So these images that the administration released today reportedly show rail cars full of artillery ammunition provided by North Korea to the Wagner group, which for months has been fighting this just punishing battle, this very, very difficult back and forth, brutal fight for the city of Bakhmut in Ukraine.And the reason that this matters, Jake, is because the fight for Bakhmut, as has become the case with much of the war in Ukraine, has become a real war of attrition that military and intelligence officials increasingly say is really likely to turn on access to artillery ammunition. Which side is able to sustain its supply of artillery ammunition the longest? One senior -- sorry, Western intelligence official that I spoke to earlier today said, in Bakhmut alone, the two sides are expending up to multiple thousands of rounds of ammunition a day, which is just staggering. And so what North Korea is doing here is really helping Wagner and by extension, the Russian side, perpetuate this fight in Bakhmut that our sources say has left this part of Ukraine looking like they're done in World War I.",

But what does matter, and the reason why U.S. and Western officials are concerned is the possibility that North Korea may continue to try to provide these kinds of supplies to send these shipments to the Wagner group, to Russia.And that's something that officials are going to want to do everything that they possibly can to try to stop. And so the hope is, with this terrorism designation, that it's going to open the door to sanctions that are going to make it more difficult for the Wagner group to do business internationally. And remember, the Wagner group doesn't just operate inside Ukraine. They have operations across Africa as well as in Syria.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, heaping praise on countries for sending more powerful and advanced weapons to Ukraine as the war nears its one year mark. The U.S. with its own $2.5 billion package that includes Bradley infantry fighting vehicles, striker combat vehicles and much more. What's missing, though, is at the top of Ukraine's wish list. VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translation): We will still have to fight for the supply of modern tanks, but every day, we make it more obvious there is no alternative to making this decision. LIEBERMANN (voice-over): Germany refuses to sign off on sending its Leopard tanks to Ukraine. Despite U.S. pressure and behind the scenes wrangling, Berlin won't budge. BORIS PISTORIUS, GERMAN DEFENSE MINISTER (through translation): There are good reasons for the delivery and there are good reasons against it. We cannot all say today when a decision will be made nor what that decision on the Leopard tanks will be. LIEBERMANN (voice-over): On the winter battlefield, Ukraine wants modern tanks to retake territory against dug in Russian defensive lines. It's a more powerful weapon for a more brutal battle. The U.S. insists its M1 Abrams tank is the wrong fit. The M1 Abrams is a heavy fuel guzzling vehicle that runs primarily on jet fuel making it harder to operate and maintain in Ukraine. And with few operators in Europe, spare parts are hard to come by. Instead, the U.S. and others have been pressuring Germany for its Leopard tanks. The German made Leopard runs on diesel and is already used by about a dozen other countries in Europe, making it easier to get spare parts and perhaps more tanks to Ukraine. But Germany has yet to make a decision. Even so, the Defense Secretary defended Berlin while pushing everyone to contribute more to Ukraine's war effort.",

Three separate trials have been set for this summer.

The other two police officers who had been on site helped keep McClain restrained on the ground. The paramedics were then called in. They injected that dose of ketamine, which later on, it turned out, was a lot stronger than what was necessary for his body weight. Initially, the autopsy report listed the cause of death as undetermined, but that changed later, following new evidence to effectively say that the cause of death was caused by complications from that ketamine injection, as well as following the restraint, pardon me, the manner of death remains undetermined. The various defendants, though, in these upcoming -- in the months leading up today, have been essentially pointing fingers at one another in terms of who is to blame for Elijah's death. And so, as a result of that, this week, the judge ruled that there will be three separate trials. The former officer, Nathan Woodyard, who performed those chokeholds, will be tried by himself. That trial is scheduled for September 18. The two other officers, Randy Roedema and Jason Rosenblatt will be tried together. Their trial is scheduled for July 11.

One of the things that I find unusual about this discussion, Abby, is the idea that there are ideas that shouldn't even be taught. I mean, I'm not talking about indoctrinating students to think reparations are owed or think CRT is correct or whatever, but just like the idea that we shouldn't even teach an idea?",
