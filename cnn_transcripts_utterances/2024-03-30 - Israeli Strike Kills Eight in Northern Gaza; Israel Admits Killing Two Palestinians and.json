It had called for a ceasefire and the release of Israeli hostages. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRUNHUBER (voice-over): Now this was the scene in Rafah on Friday. You can see Palestinians going through the rubble of a building destroyed by an Israeli strike. In northern Gaza, Hamas government officials say an Israeli airstrike on a civilian vehicle killed eight people. At least five of them were children. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): They kill women and the elderly, people who are not at fault in this war. They're innocent people. We're talking about children. This is a little girl. What has she done wrong? UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): There were massacres every day, even against children. What do the Israeli forces want? What do you want, Netanyahu? You are a children killer. You are a criminal. BRUNHUBER (voice-over): The Israeli military operation around Al-Shifa Hospital has now been going on for nearly two weeks. Israel says it's, in its words, quote, \"mitigating harm to civilians.\" Gaza's health ministry says IDF strikes have killed medical personnel and patients as well as civilians taking shelter in the hospital and its grounds. One witness says he saw more than 100 bodies in the streets. Gaza officials are asking for international agencies like the U.N. and Red Cross to rescue the civilians in and around the hospital. Now further south, the IDF says it's continuing operations in Khan Yunis. Israel says soldiers eliminated dozens of terrorists and found weapons near the Al-Amal hospital. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Hezbollah announced it was retaliating for what it claimed were Israeli attacks on Damascus and Aleppo. The IDF tells CNN it struck the missile launcher and what it claims was a Hezbollah military compound nearby. Israel is criticizing a new report that claims half of Gaza is on the brink of starvation. The report came from the IPC, a group created by U.N. bodies and major relief agencies. It says northern Gaza will decline into a full-blown famine within the next two months. Israel says the report is inaccurate and contains multiple factual flaws. The government accuses Hamas of stealing food aid being brought into Gaza to help feed civilians. Meanwhile, ordinary Gazans are growing increasingly desperate. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He says it could result in a step-by-step retreat by Ukrainian troops. About $60 billion in aid has been held up by Republicans in the House of Representatives. Speaker Mike Johnson has now committed to bring a bill up for a vote after the Easter break. Meanwhile, the White House says, Russia's targeting of Ukrainian energy infrastructure is a, quote, \"terrible reminder of Putin's efforts to break the spirit of the Ukrainian people.\" On Friday, Kyiv's minister of energy said Moscow launched another massive attack in at least three regions. This comes as Russia's investigative committee is still trying to blame Kyiv for the terror attack on Moscow's Crocus City hall last Friday, claims Kyiv promised a reward to the gunman who killed at least 143 people and injured 382 more. Ukrainian defense intelligence says the attack was planned as a way to justify severe strikes against Kyiv. U.S. President Joe Biden says Washington will keep trying to bring \"The Wall Street Journal\" reporter Evan Gershkovich home.
