It comes as Biden is really looking to sharpen his attacks against Trump heading into that first debate just ten days away.Now in this ad, they're trying to frame this election as a choice between a convicted criminal who is looking out for himself with former president or with President Biden, who in his work for the American people. This ad will run as part of a $50 million ad push in key battleground states, hoping to reach voters heading into this debate and the November election. And it all comes just from after months of the Biden campaign really refraining from commenting on Trump's legal saga in any way, but really that changed in the days after Trump's conviction, and they've leaned into that conviction to further argue that he is unfit for office. Now, this new ad push comes just a few days after President Biden teamed up with former President Obama and some Hollywood stars for a major fundraiser out in Los Angeles that brought in $30 million for the campaign. That's a Democratic record when it comes to fundraisers. And at that event, Biden, Obama and others really tried to issue stark warnings about what a second Trump presidency could hold. Biden really zeroed in on the impact it could have on the Supreme Court, saying that Trump likely would have the opportunity to possibly appoint two Supreme Court justices, further changing the balance of the court going forward. And the president also criticized what he has seen as a Supreme Court that is currently out of step. Take a listen to a bit of what President Biden had to say that the Biden campaign released in a clip. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  The Supreme Court has never been as out of kilter as it is today. I mean, never. I taught constitutional law for nine years. This guy knows more about it than most. Look, the fact of the matter is that this has never been a court that's been this far out of step. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, look, Mike Johnson and Richard Hudson, two very big Republican leaders in the House, they want this meeting because they want help with the months ahead that are going to be very difficult for, I think, many Republicans who face several bitter primary battles. Now what I find really interesting about this is, of course, it comes just days after Donald Trump made his return to D.C., met with House and Senate Republicans, promised to try and help get them re-elected or help the candidates that they are hoping to put in office elected.And this is kind of him making good on that promise by having this meeting with these two leaders. But what's also interesting is that Donald Trump, who kind of used to be a kingmaker in many of these races, has surprisingly, in some ways, stayed out of these very bitter primaries. Now, in the past, Donald Trump has issued several endorsements. Of course, he's still continuing to endorse in a series of key races. However, the way that he is operating this cycle is very different from the past. And remember, in 2022, Donald Trump endorsed a series of candidates that went on to ultimately lose on election day during the midterms. And so this is something that has weighed heavily, I know, on Donald Trump's mind personally, but also on his teams. They've been very careful in who they want to endorse, and not endorsing too much. Now, Donald Trump has said publicly and privately that that is because he is so preoccupied with his own election fight. However, a big part of it as well is them being worried that he's going to put his support behind people who may not ultimately win. So, what I'm told this meeting will be about today is really strategizing what Donald Trump can do to help the House Republican Conference, to help try and secure a majority in the fall, and definitely a bigger majority than they have now, because the other whole part of this meeting is Donald Trump wants allies in the House if he were to win in November. He wants to stack the House of Congress with a series of allies that if he's elected, he can hit the ground running and knows that he will have people to support him in that fight.",

It is hard to stand here because the wind gusts are so strong. You know, we needed goggles. You feel the wind just hitting you. And that is also what is moving all of these embers here behind me and really all over this fire. We've only seen it grow, you know, now to nearly 15,000 acres, and we haven't seen containment numbers increasing. We're still at 2 percent.So, you see some of the crews here. They are working right now to try to make those fire lines, to try to keep this fire from growing, but it has been extremely difficult over, you know, the last 24 hours we have been out here and we've seen the crews on the ground and in the air. You know, we've seen many, many water drops yesterday. They were trying to do those water drops to avoid the fire spreading even further. There are already about 1,200 people under evacuation orders and many others under evacuation warnings. So, authorities really telling people to have their stuff packed and ready to go in case it happens at a moment's notice. But, again, really, the biggest problem that they're having is this. You can see it. It is impossible to avoid, and so they're hoping that it dies down further in the day, but the problem is that we are expecting that red flag warning throughout the day today, higher temperatures later on as well. So, that's also not going to make things easier for these firefighters that are working around the clock, Sara.",

And so what we were told by firefighters yesterday is that it was going to take some time. They knew that overnight things were going to become a lot more difficult for them.And so, you know, when I talked to a firefighter yesterday, they told me, ask me tomorrow how things are going to be, because they were so concerned about the conditions overnight and the conditions in terms of the terrain. There's a lot of dry terrain. And so because it rained so much earlier in the year, and then you have the heat coming in, things are dry, and it is going to be easier for things to catch on fire and for these flames to spread. But, again, it's just really hard to hear, to stand, because these wind gusts are just so, so strong, Sara.",
