They're 31 Republicans, 29 Democrats. So it is extremely tight. You have certain Republicans in those swing districts who are very interested in appealing to their constituents. And then others who are very hard line about this.

Because, Michael, we saw Schumer moving to essentially kill this first article of impeachment, calling it unconstitutional. What are we seeing happen right now? MICHAEL GERHARDT, CONSTITUTIONAL LAW PROFESSOR, UNC-CHAPEL HILL: I think what we're seeing is Senators Schumer maybe putting forth arguments on behalf of that.
