The U.S. Coast Guard said it would conduct searches on the ocean surface throughout Monday evening, and that the Canadian Coast Guard would pick up Tuesday morning with searchers both on and below the surface. The wreck of the Titanic is almost 400 nautical miles southeast of Newfoundland in Canada. It sits in two parts on the ocean floor more than two miles or almost four kilometers below the surface. A U.S. Coast Guard official briefed reporters Monday on the search efforts. Take a listen.

More than 30 million people across the region are under a severe weather threat Tuesday into Wednesday. And take a look at this video of a possible tornado in Moss Point, Mississippi. The storm ripped through the area leveling several homes and businesses in its path. At least one person was killed and nearly two dozen injured when a powerful twister swept through the Mississippi town of Louin, Sunday night. The National Weather Service gave it a preliminary rating of F-three. CNN meteorologist Chad Myers has more on the dangerous weather impacting the country. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHAD MYERS, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Quite a few severe weathers reports all the way from Virginia all the way down to the Gulf Coast. The most severe along the Gulf Coast itself with tornadoes reported down there. Some hitting some towns with damage down there. Also another event very, very heavy rainfall. Six to 10 inches of rain fell in a short period of time with flash flood emergencies in effect. Now, here we go. This is what the computer thinks the rainfall is going to look like throughout the day on Tuesday, taking you all the way to Wednesday. Notice what happens Tuesday afternoon. Big storms could be rolling right through New Orleans. This is kind of the biggest threat that I see here. Some of those storms could also be severe with heavy rainfall, wind, and even some hail. So, if it falls on the same places that already saw the heavy rainfall, there could be more flash flooding in the forecast. And also that rainfall will be heading up the east coast up into Charlotte up the hills, up the Appalachian Chains and that was all the rainfall will be here along in east of that upslope flow of that mountain there -- area. And also some heavy rainfall across parts of Texas, and of course, New Orleans where I showed you those storms will be. Something else that's going on to the West of there is this record- breaking heat. More than 60 places will likely break record highs with excessive heat warnings in effect. And a heat index to 122 in the afternoon in some places. That's in the shade. See, these are the temperatures on the thermometer without the heat kind of added in and humidity added in. The temperatures are going to be hot already. You add in the humidity and it's going to feel much warmer in places. It's going to feel like 120 degrees. It did in Corpus Christi on Monday. It felt for a time, 120 degrees Fahrenheit. One more thing going on. Tropical storm Bret. It was named Bret at 5:00 p.m. on Monday, and it's out here in the Atlantic way out there. But it is forecast to move to the West toward the islands. And if you notice here the numbers, forecast to become a hurricane. Not until probably Wednesday or Thursday, but this storm will likely intensify and move to some populated islands and possibly even into the Gulf of Mexico next week. We'll have to watch that. This track is still way too far out to figure out where this thing is going to go just yet. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

It is striking that we are hearing from people who worked for Trump in senior positions, like Bill Barr, his attorney general; John Bolton, his national security adviser; Mark Esper, his defense secretary; even Mike Pompeo, to some extent, his secretary of state, saying this is unacceptable behavior. The other candidates running against him haven't even been willing to cite that testimony, much less reach that judgment themselves, except for candidates on the periphery of the race: Chris Christie and Asa Hutchinson. And perhaps not surprisingly, given their deference to Trump, he generally the indications are that his lead is expanding inside the Republican coalition as this unfolds.
