Hello and welcome to \"Connect the World\". I'm Becky Anderson for you. We've got extensive coverage this hour and next on the crisis inside Gaza. First up, though, I want to begin in London this evening. Well, to the U.K., a western global leader shuffles its key leadership at a time of vast international upheaval. You might recognize this man heading into Downing Street earlier today, Britain's former Prime Minister, David Cameron. He led the U.K. during its vote for Brexit, of course, before resigning straight afterwards, but now he is back at the helm. Rishi Sunak has just appointed him just hours ago to the crucial role of U.K. Foreign Secretary, that position designed to find multilateral solutions to international crises. And the appointment comes as the crisis in the Middle East is at its worst in recent memory. Threatening to engulf this entire region and to reverberate out even further. Let's kick off tonight, CNN's Clare Sebastian standing by for us in London. This was certainly a surprise to many. Do we understand why this appointment is being made now?",

      "sentences": "So, we don't know exactly why, Becky, but I think there's a couple of ways to look at it. Number one, as you say,there are multiple crises going on in the world. The crisis in the Middle East, the war in Ukraine. And David Cameron is undoubtedly a very experienced hand. He was, of course, Prime Minister, when Crimea was annexed by Russia and has had multiple dealings over the years with Russia and Ukraine. For example, I think on the other hand This is likely about internal politics within the Conservative Party. They are facing very low approval ratings ahead of what is likely to be a general election at some point next year. And Suella Braverman, the Home Secretary who has now been sacked, was someone who was seen to perhaps cause more fractures in the party by exciting the more right-wing members of that party. David Cameron is a centrist, a more liberal figure and could perhaps bring that sense of unity or help bring that sense of unity that the party needs and for its following as well ahead of an expected general election. I think that is, that is roughly how people are interpreting it at the moment. Although there is of course criticism from the opposition about bringing back the former prime minister especially given his record on Brexit.",

No decision like that in the U.K. will be taken without it having an impact elsewhere. Well, no food, no water, no medicine, and no safe way out. That is the situation being described at Gaza's largest hospital, Al-Shifa, where the director tells CNN essential units have and I quote here, \"Collapsed.\" Operations are at a standstill, and hospital officials say that babies were taken off incubators because there is no fuel to run those incubators. Thousands of displaced people came to Al-Shifa for safety, but with incessant airstrikes and ground battles between Hamas and Israel close by, some are reluctant to use corridors to the south declared by the Israel Defense Forces.

Many people at the time thought that was very contradictory, but the Israelis are sticking by that. A lot of anger.

And according to the official Lebanese National News Agency, that house was completely leveled. And also, this afternoon, a group of journalists who were going to look at houses that had been hit in Israeli strikes came under fire themselves. We understand that one journalist was slightly wounded, but it does -- look, in fact, we understand that actually two missiles were fired in their direction as well. So, it definitely seems that things are picking up. And of course, over the weekend, we did hear Yoav Gallant, the Israeli Defense Minister, say that what we're doing in Gaza, we can also do in Beirut. So, there's growing concern that this ever so gradual but very noticeable increase in the amount of cross-border fire could broaden out to something much bigger. Becky.",

Now, this follows a wave of around a thousand earthquakes. The town of Grindavik, seen here, was evacuated on Saturday morning. CNN's Michael Holmes with this report. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MICHAEL HOLMES, CNN INTERNATIONAL NEWS ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT (voiceover):  Alarming signs in Iceland, where waves of tremors are shaking and splintering parts of the country. And experts say the seismic activity there is likely to get worse. Thousands of earthquakes have struck Iceland's southwestern peninsula in the last few days. Geologists say, it's related to an underground corridor of magma that's shifting and could soon lead to a volcanic eruption. In the town of Grindavik, some 50 kilometers away from the capital of Reykjavik, the ground has already split open in places because of the volatility under the Earth's crust. More than 3,000 residents were evacuated Saturday, with a few allowed back Sunday to retrieve pets and essential items from their home. Experts say, the magma corridor, which stretches about 15 kilometers near Grindavik, could cause an eruption, and possibly destroy much of town.",

The area near Grindavik is prone to volcanic activity, with three eruptions in the past two and a half years. In 2021, a fissure measuring as big as 750 meters long spewed fountains of lava into the sky, attracting tourists to the unpopulated hot spot.

And Trump's team are defending against these allegations that they inflated the values of their properties on financial statements, and then gave those statements to banks and insurers to get better rates and terms. And so, he will be the first one up. He already testified at this trial, when he was called by the state, and then he said that he had no role in the preparation of these statements, and that he only signed off on them after he spoke with attorneys and accountants. So he has distanced himself from that. But during the state questioning, they decide the questions, and they tried to limit his answers to yes or no. Now that he's taking the stand as a defense witness, they will shape the questions that they want to ask him, and he will be able to give very more expensive answers. This as Trump's team is trying to put their defense on, saying that there was no intent to defraud anyone's, if there were mistakes made, they weren't material, they weren't important, and there were no victims, and know things were defrauded. We saw a flavor of that when Ivanka Trump testified last week, when she was called by the state, but when Trump's lawyers to question her, she spoke about how they had a long-standing relationship with Deutsche Bank, one of the lenders, and that deutsche bank had done their own due diligence before underwriting these loans. So, we expect to see more that come out of that, this general idea of trying to distance the head and the importance of these financial statements, but also show there is no intent to defraud anyone, and there is no victims in this case. So, Don Jr. will be on the stand today. We expect that could continue into tomorrow, because the state will be able to cross examine him.
