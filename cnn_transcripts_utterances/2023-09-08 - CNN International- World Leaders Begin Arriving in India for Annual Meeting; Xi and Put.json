It's spinning in the Atlantic Ocean right now, approaching the Caribbean islands. The storm will likely reach its peak intensity this weekend. And China's Xi Jinping will not be attending the G20 summit in New Delhi, India. No explanation was given for his absence. The leader has never missed a G20 gathering since taking power back in 2012. And we want to take you back to New Delhi now, where leaders of the world's largest economies, representing about 80 percent of global GDP, have already begun arriving for the annual meeting. But Vladimir Putin is staying home, just as he did during last year's summit in Bali. CNN Vedika Sud joins us now live from New Delhi, with a preview of what we might expect. So Vedika, obviously India, still fresh off celebrating its newly cemented status as a space power. How important is hosting this G20 summit for the country? And what does Modi hope to achieve?",

But one of the abiding memories for me at that time were the queues outside of the Palace of Westminster as people lined up overnight, they went on for miles and miles just for a moment at the Queen's coffin as she lay in state to pay their respects. And speaking to a lot of people there, they weren't all fans. They weren't all royalists. They were just often people who had lost someone who had been in their lives, to the whole of their lives and perhaps reminded them of people in their own lives and other people who passed away in their own lives.King Charles -- well, Prince Charles as he was then -- became king as soon as the queen died. And it's been a very busy year for him. The first thing he had to focus on was the coronation. This is the moment of the lying in state. The coronation, it was a moment for Charles to show what his monarchy was going to be about. How it differed from the Queens. And there's very remarkably little different really, from the Queen's reign. But that was deliberate. One of the roles of monarchy is to represent continuity and a lot of the royal experts will say he's handled that brilliantly, and he's actually had a very strong first year. Particularly when you consider some of the key challenges he's faced, most notably Prince Harry's book \"Spare,\" which revealed all sorts of secrets. It was incredibly uncomfortable for the royal family. They chose not to respond. And a lot of people saying they came out stronger as a result of that not responding and getting into an argument with Harry publicly. Harry actually is in London right now. He was an event last night. He gave quite a touching tribute to the Queen himself, but we don't expect him to meet up with King Charles or indeed Prince William because the tensions there are so deep. They're all in the country at the same time, but they're not going to meet up. Charles, currently a Balmoral, which is where the Queen died, of course. He released this photo. He's leading the tributes. He released this photo of the Queen. It's from the 1960s. It's his favorite photo of the Queen. So that was quite a touching tribute from him and he also released a statement for the nation and he gave an audio version of that as well. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
