And what that means is, he is going to go after certain things, probably in Iraq and in Syria, that pertain to the Iranian proxies, the client groups, basically, that Iran helps to finance and in many cases helps to train that are spread throughout those two countries.

Of course, the loss of the three soldiers is extremely tragic, and that's the reason why there is going to be a response that may take place over not just one day, but over a period of days, if not weeks.

According to a criminal complaint obtained by CNN, when officers arrived, they found an elderly male in a bathroom with blood around him, who had been decapitated. Officers found a machete and a large kitchen knife in the bathtub. Court documents said police then found Michael Mohn's head in a plastic bag in a cooking pot in the next room. Only then did police learn of his son's video, posted to YouTube, which stayed up on the site for about five hours before being taken down.
