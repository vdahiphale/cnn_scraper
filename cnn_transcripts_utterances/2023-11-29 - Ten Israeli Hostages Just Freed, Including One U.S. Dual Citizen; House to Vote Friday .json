We're standing by for new information about their release just a short while ago and their condition after more than seven weeks in brutal captivity.All this comes as the truce between Israel and Hamas is due to end just a few hours from now following a six-day pause in the fighting. The U.S. secretary of state, Antony Blinken, is now here in Israel amid urgent negotiations aimed at extending the truce and potentially allowing more hostages to be released. Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer in Tel Aviv and you're in THE SITUATION ROOM. The new group of hostages released by Hamas has now arrived here in Israel, including an Israeli-American, as the truce that paved the way for their freedom is about to expire. Our correspondents are covering the breaking news from every angle. First, I want to go to CNN's Chief International Correspondent Clarissa Ward. She's here with us in Tel Aviv. Clarissa, first of all, what can you tell us about today's release of the hostages and whether this expiring truce will be extended?",

From there, they will be flown or driven to various hospitals, depending on their condition.We understand the youngest age, or I should say the age of the youngest hostage to be released today, is 13 years old, the oldest hostage, 54 years old. And as you mentioned, that dual U.S.-Israeli citizen, Liat Beinin, is among those hostages released. This comes along with the release of four Thai nationals. And earlier, as a separate deal that was brokered by the Russian government, two Israeli-Russian dual nationals. So, in total, 16 hostages released today. And all eyes now on the question of whether this truce will be extended, or whether it will expire at midnight Eastern Time, 7:00 A.M. here in Israel. Hamas has said that they very much hope to extend the truce. Israel has said that it thinks it is possible to extend a truce. And Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who actually has just landed in Israel, has also advocated for continuing this pause. He says it has been crucial in terms of getting hostages out, but also, of course, Wolf, in terms of getting desperately needed aid into Gaza, and giving the ordinary citizens of Gaza some much needed respite, Wolf.",

Somebody, a friend, perhaps, tries to drag him to safety behind the car, but he was killed there. The other one, 15-year-old Basil Abu El-Wafa (ph), also shot.

You know, the caucuses are, as you said, more than 50 days out. So, I think that Nikki Haley has been somebody who's emerged as somebody who can distinguish herself from Donald Trump.I think world events, what we see with, you know, Israel and Hamas, she shows a knowledge and a depth on foreign policy that I think is appealing. And I do think she's able to resonate with independents in a way that Donald Trump is just radioactive. But herein lies the problem that the GOP faces in the Trump era. Nikki Haley performs head-to-head much better against Joe Biden, beating him by nearly six points, but she's got to get through the primary, and that is still very much an uphill battle. I mean, Donald Trump is hands down the favorite at this point, but it's not too late to rule out some kind of an upset.",
