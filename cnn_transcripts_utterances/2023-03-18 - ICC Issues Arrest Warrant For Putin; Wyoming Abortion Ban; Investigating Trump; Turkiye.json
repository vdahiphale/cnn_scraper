The International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for him and the Kremlin so- called children's rights commissioner, alleging they're responsible for the illegal deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia.The international court was created to prosecute individuals accused of such actions. Right now, 123 countries recognize its jurisdiction. And if Putin travels to any one of them, he could be potentially arrested there. Russia, however, is dismissing the warrant since it's not an ICC member state. Western officials are praising the move, saying Russia has clearly committed atrocities. CNN reporters are covering this story. We'll have reaction from Russia, Ukraine and the U.S., with Nada Bashir in Istanbul, David McKenzie in Kyiv and Jeremy Diamond at the White House. CNN's Clarissa Ward is at The Hague with an exclusive interview with the ICC chief prosecutor. And Will Ripley is in Taipei with a preview of the meeting with Presidents Xi and Putin next week in Russia. The ICC's chief prosecutor believes Putin could stand trial for the crimes, even though Russia doesn't recognize the court's jurisdiction. Previous trials of war criminals have set a precedent.

Russia, though, is not either. And inside the administration, there really has been a rolling debate over how much support the U.S. should extend to the criminal court as it investigates war crimes by the Russians in Ukraine. In December, though, Congress did modify legislation that previously restricted an administration's ability to help the International Criminal Court, now providing a lot of authorities for the administration to do exactly that.

Elsewhere, of course, there was a burning of cars and the previous day of rioting as the police managed to drive people away from this area. But they took the fight deeper into the city.

That the local elected officials, the school board, the parents, teachers, community groups are all part of that. Takeovers don't make that -- don't improve those conditions. State takeovers push communities out of the decision making process. As you just had young people speaking, community leaders speaking, that these individuals will not have a say in what happens in the school district in Houston. So we have over 30 years of evidence to show that, while all state takeovers are promised, the kinds of things being promised in Texas, they don't turn out that way. It's difficult to improve a school district when communities are pushed to the side.",
