Donald Trump entering the hall to love and applause. His ear bandaged, a visible reminder of that bullet that hit him during the attempt on his life on Saturday.The former president, now the official nominee of the Republican Party for a third consecutive time. He was joined in the Trump family viewing box by his newly-named running mate, Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio, an eventful day amid truly extraordinary circumstances surrounding this convention. Let's go to Kristen Holmes. Kristen, what are you hearing from the Trump campaign, from Trump allies, about his appearance today, which seemed to be quite emotional for him?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, it clearly was. Jake, this is somebody that I've now been covering for over a year. This is the most emotional I have ever seen him. And I have certainly seen him in what could have been various vulnerable positions.But Donald Trump himself, talking to his allies, the people who know him the best, people who hadn't seen him yet in public until this situation, they were shocked at what they saw. They said he appeared softer, that at times it looked as though he might cry. They said that they themselves were crying. I even spoke to people who used to support Donald Trump, who no longer do, who said that it made them choke up. But this was an incredibly emotional experience, and they felt like they were seeing a different person up on that stage or in that box when he entered onto the convention floor. The other thing to point out here is that Donald Trump himself has been telling people, both publicly and privately, that he believes that he is lucky to be alive, that he believes that there was some sort of divine intervention. Of course, that is notable given the fact that Donald Trump, we know, is not a religious person. He's not even a spiritual person. But this is something he has said over and over again, that he fundamentally believes that he shouldn't be alive right now, that there is some reason he tilted his head the way that he did to look up at that chart, and that is what kept him alive. And we saw a lot of that in his face tonight. And that is what allies said as well, that they just felt like this was so much more of a human being than they had ever seen the former president look before.",

And I could see the way that the president was responding, not only to them, but to the crowd. When his face first appeared on the Jumbotron, there was an audible sound from the crowd, elation, and literally thousands of people taking out their phones to get ready for his appearance. Once he finally emerged, Kristen was just outlining the emotional response from the president. I saw several people in the crowd appearing to be emotional themselves, really the power of the moment landing heavily on them.And throughout the evening, you could see the responses from folks not only in the crowd, but also other speakers. When we watched Amber Rose seeming to charm the former president, he appeared to make several remarks. I watched them make a comment to Congressman Byron Donalds and now the presumptive vice-presidential nominee, J.D. Vance, during her speech, all the way to Sean O'Brien, when the president stayed standing during the speech, seemingly expressionless. I did watch Byron Donalds sort of make a gesture to him. But he was very receptive of what was going on. And one interesting thing, I'm not sure if the cameras could capture this, but a large portion of the crowd over by that VIP area wasn't even turned to the speakers. They didn't turn away from the president once he emerged after the speeches began. But overall, obviously a very powerful moment for this crowd that was eager to the president all the way toward the end of the benediction, watching the president in that moment, as Kristen outlined, not known for his spirituality, but seeming to absorb the importance of the moment, Jake.",

And so, he did that mea culpa over and over again, and he will have to continue doing it over and over again. He wasn't getting information from the media. He was getting information from the then candidate in 2016, and then the president after -- starting in 2017.And, I mean, as much as he wants to say that it's the way that Donald Trump was portrayed, it's just not true. He's a smart guy. He saw what he saw. And he made his own opinion based on that, an opinion that he has changed so much that he is now a 39-year-old running mate to that very same Donald Trump.",

And yet, Trump also has a lot of political liabilities that make him a complicated and even toxic figure in the broader electorate. But for J.D. Vance, as Dana said, I mean, the paradigm was very simple. If he wanted to be elected, he had to be aligned with Trump. And the thing that probably changed his mind was that Trump's hold on the base kept getting stronger, not so much that Trump did anything different or said anything different as president. I mean, he acted as president the way that he ran as a candidate, and nothing really changed. The only thing that changed --(COUGHING) -- was that Republican base voters said, this is our guy, and anybody who wanted to be associated with the Republican Party needed to get in line.",

One thing that stood out to me is whenever you're getting a job, you always wonder, well, why is the job open? Who had it last? Why are they no longer in it? Obviously, Mike Pence is not here tonight for a reason.And to look at, you know, why that was, when I spoke to Senator J.D. Vance a few months ago, I asked him, he was very clearly in the running to be Donald Trump's vice president, I asked him if it gave him any pause, how Trump treated Mike Pence, someone who was a very loyal lieutenant of his, navigated him very well during those four years that they served together. Obviously, Donald Trump, as we've seen with other members of his cabinet, is not always easy to work with or doesn't always get along with people that he has picked and put in those positions. And J.D. Vance's response was actually not, you know, that it gave him any concern. He actually said that he didn't believe. He was skeptical of Pence when he claimed that his life was at risk on January 6th. And it just kind of puts into perspective also the caliber of people that Trump was considering, not just their resume and what they've done on the Hill, but also what they would do in a situation like that. That is really the number one issue to Donald Trump.",

And I think that goes directly to what you were just talking about, Kaitlan. And that is the fact that this probably is more a governing pick than it was a campaigning pick, and he's thinking less about who's going to put him over the top. I think Donald Trump thinks, I'm going to win this election on my own, but I got to live with somebody for four years.And if there's one thing -- I mean, when you think of Mike Pence and how he just kind of checked his -- anything he believed in at the door and for four years did Donald Trump's bidding, and then, of course, on January 6th, 2021 did not, I think that was the unforgivable sin. And maybe what Donald Trump sees in J.D. Vance, not that it'll -- not necessarily be on January 6th, but it's somebody that he can count on to do what Donald Trump wants and to be faithful to Donald Trump's wishes.",

And it's also true for poor white kids. I mean, if you grow up in a neighborhood that's impoverished and don't have opportunity. So, I think those kinds of comments don't move Black voters because they just seem out of touch and bizarre. And so that's part of the challenge they have here. They're reaching out to the Black community. But Amber Rose, when she talks, it lands, it's authentic, it makes sense. You can tell she's coming from within the experience and she's talking -- that cuts -- she was perfect. I mean, if you want -- she gave a master class on political conversation. Those speeches to me, and I don't mean to take anything away from their leadership, but they seem to be coming from people who talk about Black people, not to Black people. They talk about black issues, not to Black people. And the thing I thought was most harmful was Tim Scott, who I love and admire. When he talked about the thousands of Black children that are being killed in Chicago, he had a glee in his voice. He was like, sort of like a kind of point scoring. But, you know, those of us who go to those funerals and sit with those grandmothers and those mothers and look at young people in the caskets, there's no glee about that. That's not -- politicizing funerals in our community is not a good strategy for moving the Black vote. So, I understand what they're trying to do, but I think they got to really look at this because there's a way you can give offense. And also, the other thing that James said that I thought was bad, he talked about, you know, that Black children can't read. Look, we have some challenges, but please don't take away from the millions and millions of Black children who can read, who do read, and who are held by teachers in tough schools learning the joy of reading. There's just a way that you can sometimes try to play with these tropes for an audience like that, that really lands badly in the community.",

He knows how to play the meme games. He knows how to create viral moments and share them.

And I think we've seen in a lot of the polling some slippage there. And so, I think there's got to be, you know, an aggressive argument from the Biden campaign. [23:20:00] I think in addition to Trump's kind of personal history, I think they also have a substantive argument they can make about what the economy looked like for black businesses under Donald Trump.

The subtext is, you know, there's this rule in politics that says before people are going to listen to your policy solutions, they first -- you first have to prove that you care about them. And so, you can be ham-fisted in some ways about how you reach out to Black voters. I mean, they introduced one woman as a Latino woman and then read her name.

Noah Rothman, who is a conservative writer for \"National Review,\" writes, David Sacks alleges that Joe Biden -- quote -- \"provoked\" -- unquote -- Russia's invasion of Ukraine. And he perpetuated the war by failing to endorse a Russian-backed peace proposal. This is Rothman still saying Sacks laid the blame for Ukraine's civilian casualties, not at Vladimir Putin's feet, but Joe Biden's. And that is a fairly shocking statement to be made at a Republican Party convention. Yes, we know that Donald Trump is of the more isolationist wing of his party.

But the big moment for President Biden today was his sit-down interview with Lester Holt of NBC News. That was expected to take place in Austin, Texas. But when Biden postponed that travel in the wake of Trump's assassination attempt, that interview still took place at the White House. It was yet another opportunity where Biden was hoping to prove to the American people and the American media, as well as the democratic class writ-large, that he was up to the task of four more years. He was extremely defensive in that interview. He apologized for some of the rhetoric that he'd used as it related to his opponent on the campaign trail. But he reverted essentially back to some of his campaign rhetoric, saying that he was not the one who pledged to be a dictator on day one, that he, President Biden, was not the one who challenged the outcome of the 2020 election. So, hitting back at President Trump on some of those very familiar topics. Here in Nevada, he's going to try to turn to policy tomorrow, talking about housing specifically and actions he's taking for workers.
