That's the start of mail-in voting in North Carolina.

The week after that, Trump could face sentencing for his 34 felony convictions in his New York hush money trial. He has requested that that be postponed. Just a few days later, the first polling sites will open as early voting gets underway in Virginia. And as these days tick by, both campaigns, trying to build momentum.

They rescued both tourists and tribal members from the area after local authorities closed it down. An Alaskan community is under mandatory evacuations after a deadly landslide on Sunday. One person was killed by the disaster in the coastal city of Ketchikan. And there are fears that a second landslide could be imminent. This dolphin could possibly make the 2028 Olympic gymnastics team. Wow, look at that. The video showing a dolphin off the coast of San Diego jumping 20 feet out of the water. Some are comparing this to a Simone Biles style jump. It's amazing. All right, a really scary moment for the home plate umpire in the Yankees-Rockies game on Sunday. A broken bat hit Nick Mahrley in the neck, sending him to the round. He sustained a concussion and was carted off the field. He will undergo more testing in the coming days. And this.

So, there's about 55 million people under heat alerts, and this stretches from Minneapolis, just outside of Indianapolis. So, Chicago, you have an excessive heat warning for the day today. But again, tomorrow will be the hottest day. Look at the mercury in the thermometer, 95. But heat indices ranging from 95 to 105 today. And then from tomorrow, it could feel like up to 115 degrees in some of those outer suburbs away from Lake Michigan. So, this is the NOAA extreme heat risk map. And I want you to show the advancement of the heat. This is for the day on Tuesday. Anywhere you see that shading of purple, that's where we expect the extreme heat wave conditions to be felt. And, of course, when it gets this hot in the summer time, somethings is bound to give, right? Well, severe weather will be the result of the heat today. Just North of Chicago, Minneapolis, to Milwaukee, damaging winds and large hail threat for the afternoon as we get those daytime heatings from the sun. And I want to take you to Hawaii really quickly, because this was the scene from what is now Tropical Storm Hone, moving away from the Hawaiian islands, causing some flooding, still flash flood warnings. But the good news is that the system is pulling away from the Hawaiian islands as we speak -- Kasie.",
