We don't even know the name of the individual, though he's being described as the mastermind of that grisly suicide bombing in August of 2021, which killed 13 U.S. service members and more than 170 Afghans.And recall those frightening, chaotic days when the U.S. was withdrawing from Afghanistan after 20 years, after the Taliban victory over the Western-backed Afghan government, and those crowds of desperate Afghans trying to escape from the airport, that is where the suicide bomber struck. Now, CNN has spoken with the family member, the father of one of the 13 U.S. service members, and he said that he was informed about the killing of this purported mastermind by a marine of an official from the U.S. marines. He welcome that, but also wants more accountability from the Biden administration about how this all happened in the first place. That was echoed also by the Chairman of the U.S. House Foreign Relations Committee, the Republican representative from Texas, Michael McCaul, who put out a statement saying, quote, anytime a terrorist has taken off the board is a good day. But this doesn't diminish the Biden administration's culpability for the failures that led to the attack at Abbey Gate at the Kabul International Airport, and will in no way deter the committee's investigations. And he wants more answers about how the U.S. withdrawal took place and why it ended up being lethal in the end. This is an embarrassing and humiliating chapter for the U.S., which had committed some 20 years in Afghanistan, and a messy, messy issue for the Biden administration as well. And it also highlights some ongoing security concerns in Afghanistan that the Taliban which battled the U.S. for 20 years is now battling ISIS-K on the ground. You've got a senior U.S. military commander who basically said that since the U.S. withdrawal, the U.S. military has fewer reconnaissance and intelligence assets to understand what the potential terrorist threats are in Afghanistan, and what groups like ISIS-K, what kind of threats they could be planning for U.S. and American interests abroad.

So I think the prospect of a -- of a tactical shift, unless outside powers become more involved, I don't see that very likely to happen right now. So all that we can really do, I think is but both trying to put pressure on the parties to not draw another -- other outside actors, try to limit the amount of ammunition and additional supplies that can be fed into this conflict, and really just try to put pressure on the parties from all sides from the neighboring region, and the sort of faraway region to try to relent in some of this fighting.",

For those who are choosing to try to leave the country, it's a very perilous trip that they're undertaking from Khartoum, either to the Egyptian border or to the Red Sea coast. But these are taking 16, 20 hours. And the people who are taking these trips they're already weakened from lack of food, lack of water, lack of medicine. And so, when they get to these destinations they're going to be in need of humanitarian assistance.So prepositioning aid for those people who are able to make it to safe zones is I think really critical right now, as well as looking for ways to get new aid into the country to restore some of the aid routes over land that have been shut off, and really press the parties to create some aid corridors and humanitarian coordinators, just to facilitate all of this movement, so that people can get the aid they need and get out of harm's way.",

There needs to be pressure put not only from the United States and European countries, but Gulf factors as well, trying to prevent countries like Egypt, which has already began to play a role in this conflict to stay on the sidelines to relent in their assistance to one side, and to really limit the amount of oxygen that is let in to feed this fire that's burning across the country right now.",

The San Francisco-based bank reporting that deposits fell 40 percent or by $72 billion in the quarter.

At the start of the banking crisis, about two-thirds of First Republic's deposits were uninsured with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, a company saying that, in this report, as of March 31st, that number is closer to 27 percent of total deposits.
