Public records show that his first brush with the law, the real - the first big indicator that he was going to have some problems was back in 2002 when he became known to North Carolina law enforcement.CNN spoke with a former officer in Greensboro, North Carolina and she responded there. He had barricaded himself inside a building after a traffic stop. He eventually pled guilty to felony possession of a weapon of mass destruction. Police sources tell CNN that that was a fully automatic weapon. Public records do other - show other minor financial crimes in North Carolina, but when - then he moved to Hawaii and he set up his own business and worked for a non-profit, there constructing small shelters for homeless people. But it was really two years ago that he became very vocal and personally involved when it came to the war in Ukraine. He even traveled there to join the fight. He put his effort, when he was told he was too old to fight in the war, to try to raise money. I want you to take a look at this selfie video he posted there trying to raise money on GoFundMe.

It shows he was on the ball or she was on the ball, doing exactly what they're supposed to be doing. You know, one of the hits that the Secret Service took July 13th was that perhaps they were getting a little bit complacent, you know, doing the same things over and over again. And I think, as I said with you folks last time I was on with you, this was an opportunity now coming out of the 13th to retool, reboot and reset what the Secret Service does, refocus on what they're doing, and make sure that their protective apparatus and platforms are fully in place.

I'm wondering what the challenges are when it comes to conducting an investigation and, you know, for prosecutors to secure every answer that they possibly can going into what will likely be something that's adjudicated in court, and providing the public with information that's necessary in order to avoid any kind of insinuation.",

There was a lot of information already out there.The death of the perpetrator of that really negated a lot of the reason to keep a lot of the investigative information quiet and down without being disseminated. In this case, we have someone who's now going to be going to trial. So the Secret Service, the FBI is going to have - they have to be very sensitive as to the amounts and the types of information that they put out so as not to jeopardize the potential trial on this case. So I'm a big proponent of getting as much information out, but this gentleman has rights as he moves forward in the criminal justice system and they're going to have to be very cognizant of not putting too much information out to jeopardize the criminal case.",

It wraps them in a cause and it looks like he was in that group. But again, there were a lot of those who then don't turn to this culture of violence here.And, you know, it's the culture that is sort of so remarkable about this. I mean, a week ago, we were sitting on this set and talking about how former President Trump in bringing out the cats and dogs story in Springfield was potentially inciting threats and so forth in this environment. And, of course, in Springfield, you've seen bomb threats and other things. And now on Sunday, we're talking about former President Trump as a victim of this culture.
