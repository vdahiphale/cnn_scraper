Kyiv says a Friday attack on Sevastopol in Crimea has killed the commander of Russia's Black Sea Fleet and 33 other officers. It's one of the boldest attacks yet on the Russian annex Peninsula.CNN cannot independently verify that Viktor Sokolov was killed and Moscow would only say that one serviceman was missing as a result of the attack. Well, Russia responded by launching drones and missiles at the Ukrainian city of Odesa for second day, Tuesday. Ukraine says ports infrastructure was seriously damaged and an abandoned hotel was hit. More now from CNN senior international correspondent Sam Kiley. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Ukraine dismissed this as a pathetic attempt at retaliation. A Russian bombardment of the port city of Odesa with drones and long range missiles. Two warehouse workers were killed. An abandoned hotel smashed in what could have been an almost routine attack by Russia but for this. Kyiv now claims to have killed the commander of Russia's Black Sea Fleet, Admiral Viktor Sokolov. Ukraine says it also killed another 33 Russian officers in the missile strike against the fleet headquarters in Sevastopol on Friday. The Ukrainians have targeted senior Russian officers throughout this war, often using intelligence from NATO. And specialist units have been tasked by Kyiv with these killings. They're aimed at sapping morale, and undermining command systems. CNN has no independent confirmation of Ukraine's claim to have killed Russia's Admiral, but it would be its biggest success in this campaign. And part of an ongoing effort to break through Russia's defense lines to ultimately strike at Crimea. They've included earlier attacks on Putin's Navy and a bridge to Russia itself. The first batch of U.S. donated Abrams tanks have now also arrived in Ukraine. But they're not the strategic weapons the Ukrainians say they need. VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): Defense packages from the United States including artillery, necessary shells, HIMARS munitions, air defense missiles, additional air defense systems, tactical vehicles, and some other types of weapons that will prove themselves on the battlefield. KILEY (voice-over): Kyiv wants these ATACMS. Long range missile systems to attack deep behind Russian lines to kill more officers and destroy logistics hubs. The U.S. has yet to announce that Ukraine will get these missiles before the winter freezes over the frontlines where they are. Sam Kiley, CNN. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Sir, good to have you with us. We're seeing an escalation and fighting in the Black Sea. Let's start with Ukraine's claim that they killed the commander of Russia's Black Sea Fleet in an attack on the port city of Sevastopol. Is Kyiv opening another front with these attacks on Russian targets and occupied Crimea. And what does this mean for Russia?LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes. I'd say that, and first of all, it's great to be with you but I'd say that this is actually a deep battle strike doing multi domain operations. So they're hitting -- the Ukrainians or hitting the Russians on the front line, trying to push through the various defensive belts that have been put in place by Russia. But they're also putting Russia on guard in their rear areas. They've been doing this for months now striking targets like ammunition dumps and command post headquarters in places where soldiers are, logistics spaces. [01:05:15] But now what we're doing is taking it to the next level. This is a strategic type of strategic strike against the Black Sea Fleet headquarters. Not unexpected, they've been hitting Sevastopol on multiple locations for the last several weeks. But this one certainly was a very good targeting methodology by the Ukrainian forces to hit this headquarters of the Black Sea Fleet.",

What Russia continues to do is conduct truthfully war crimes against infrastructure and civilian targets, things that are contrary to all the Geneva Conventions and the International Court of Law in terms of armed conflict.So what we see is just a very different approach by the Russian military, trying to affect the Ukrainian people, making their lives miserable, a strategic approach to try and get Kyiv to do what they want them to do, but it's not working. We're going back into the winter months, there are indicators that Russia will attempt again during the winter to strike key infrastructure targets to make life miserable for Ukrainian civilians, while Ukraine continues to fight on the battlefield front. And I personally think that the approach that Ukrainian are using are much better than what Russia using it. The Russian approach is only making the Ukrainian people more resolute in terms of getting their sovereign territory back.",

Now, what happens when people in government headquarters thinks -- think that the military forces are not doing what they expect them to do. And yet there's a misunderstanding of what takes place on the battlefield, how difficult it is. From the very beginning of the offensive operations I've said, this will be hard because of the opportunity Russia had of in placing mines and defensive belts.It's a whole lot harder when you have soldiers going against those defensive belts than it is talking about big arrows and circles on the map. So, yes, I think early on, there were some disconnects between the Capitals in the west and what was happening on the battlefield by Ukrainian forces. But I think more and more as this has occurred, and we've seen slow but steady progress by the Ukrainian forces. I think the Western capitals are beginning to understand more how difficult it is and what is actually taking place.",

We're just simply pushing to make sure it doesn't happen, which is a municipal authorities possibly not the best use of your time. So the fact that there's not enough support in place for people.

It's worth remembering, China actually claims almost the entirety of the South China Sea based on quote unquote, historical proof even though that has been rejected by an international tribunal. But nonetheless, they claim sovereignty over some 1.3 million square miles of area. And as you said, these waters have been hotly contested for years. But nobody does this in a way that's so extraordinary and increasingly aggressive as Beijing has in the past few years through land reclamation and massive construction. They have literally turned a previously inhabited atolls and islets into manmade islands equipped with the sophisticated radars and air strips and other equipment. That really is the basis of their growing power projection, military power projection, not only through their navy, but also their coast guard and also their nominally civilian maritime militia.Now, we of course, have seen in the past few weeks and months this growing number of publicized incidents involving China and other claimants, especially the Philippines, we have seen the Chinese Coast Guard using water cannons and what Philippines have described as dangerous maneuvers to chase and drive away Philippine boats. The Philippines has also accused China of destroying marine ecosystem in their exclusive economic zones based on deliberate actions. Now, for all of that, of course, Beijing has been pushing back at these accusations, saying the only thing that has changed recently, is a change of government in Manila, this new president, President Marcos, in Beijing's words is now doing the U.S. bidding by instigating tensions and creating a political force. But Beijing also seems to be especially angry at the Philippines decision to bring international media along to witness some of those encounters and saying all of that is a stage performance aimed at creating a false narrative of China being the bully and creating a more favorable international narrative for the Philippines. But at the underlying question is the Chinese military is not leaving, they're not abandoning their militarized, manmade islands. So absent of a war, how is this dynamic? How is the Chinese behavior is going to change? Laila?",

They've got clothes hanging. They're cooking food. You see a lot of families, a lot of young children in particular. And the plan for many of them Is to be here in Ciudad Hidalgo, until they can find a way usually by bus or by car, to get to Tapachula, which is the largest city in this area, the state of Chiapas in southern Mexico. And many of them plan then to go meet with officials. And they hope to then claim asylum here in Mexico, or at the very least, try to get transit documents. And that buys them time to stay in Mexico as they plan their way into the U.S. Most of them will tell you, and they told me this directly, they want to enter the U.S. legally. But what you have noticed here, and we have seen this in the past several months here in Mexico in particular, is the influx and the surge is a real strain on the resources for Mexican cities.

Until then, for 30 years he had evaded capture, living under a false identity in his hometown of Castelvetrano in western Sicily. Unmolested during all those years, thanks to Omerta, the Mafia code of silence. Messina Denaro was tried in absentia and found guilty for involvement in a series of murders, including the car bombings of two anti-Mafia judges in the early 1990s. Among the most grisly of those murders when he and his fellow mobsters dissolved in acid a 12-year-old boy, the son of a Mafia turncoat in front of his own grandfather. He was the last of the old-style crime bosses, the godfathers he so admired, who bumped off those who got in their way. \"That Mafia is not there anymore,\" investigative journalist Roberto Saviano (ph) told CNN earlier this year. \"The organization understood well that they have to kill less.\" The law, albeit after 30 years, eventually caught up with Messina Denaro.

They are made from thousands of different chemicals and chemical additives and many different colors. So when you mix all this plastic together, you don't have a really good material that lends itself to something like making Lego blocks from recycled plastic. The plastics industry has known for decades that plastics are fundamentally not easy to recycle, and not easy to use in products. But they know that people have really serious environmental and health concerns about plastics.
