I'm Paula Reid in for Fredricka Whitfield.Anger and frustration over strict COVID lockdowns boiling over in cities and university campuses across China. Rare acts of defiance as protesters demand changes to policies that have kept millions locked down for weeks and even months. Protesters in Shanghai chanting, \"step down\", aimed at China's leaders, Xi Jinping and his ruling communist party. And also this. Videos from Shanghai earlier today show protesters clashed with police before being dragged away. People in the crowd could be heard calling for their release. CNN's Steven Jiang has more from Beijing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "It was just extraordinary to hear the protesters in Shanghai chant the slogans, directly targeting Chinese leader Xi Jinping and the ruling communist party because up to that point, even the most vehement opponents of the so-called zero COVID policy have been dancing around this issue when saying how the top leadership had its heart in the right place but instead blaming local enforcement pointing a finger at overzealous or incompetent local officials.But those protesters in downtown Shanghai really directly challenging the legitimacy of the party and its strongman leader and saying the problem really lies with the system. That's obviously something not tolerated in this one-party dictatorship. So there is growing worry and concern about the fate of some of the protesters who got taken away by police. So on Sunday, there was another crowd gathering on the same spot in Shanghai, demanding those protesters are released. But now we understand there is a heavy police presence on location, with the authorities sealing off a larger area around this protester site. But also, clearing everyone from this location. So there's obviously a lot of fear on the part of the authorities that this kind of messaging could inspire others across the country. But this latest wave of protests really triggered by a deadly apartment fire in Xinjiang and how the authorities there handle the aftermath. Remember on one hand, officials there insisted that the COVID measures they put in place had nothing to do with the firefighters' delay in reaching the fire to put it out. But on the other hand, after insisting for weeks that lockdowns must be maintained because of the outbreak, they all of a sudden announced a phased reopening after the fire. So all of that really serving as the latest and loudest of wake up calls a lot of people here in terms of how increasingly unscientific and ineffective, as well as potentially dangerous, this policy has become. Not to mention, all of the absurdities surrounding its enforcement. That's why, across the country, we are seeing people trying to take matters into their own hands. Taking to the streets, demanding their freedoms, and also tearing down metal fences or barriers set up by local officials to seal them inside their residential compounds. And also, of course, multiple vigils and protests spearheaded by university students on campuses across the nation. Because remember, for many of these young people, they have lived their entire college lives in the past three years under some forms of lockdown. Just imagine all of that pent-up anger and frustration. Steven Jiang, CNN -- Beijing. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

A few western states are also facing winter weather advisories. There are already more than 2100 delayed flights and that number is only expected to rise. The rain, snow, and wind is coming on what the TSA and AAA expects will be the busiest travel day of the year. AAA says nearly 55 million people are traveling for the Thanksgiving holiday. And we have a team of correspondents and meteorologists covering this for us today. Gloria Pazmino is at LaGuardia in New York, Nadia Romero is in Atlanta.

LaGuardia, 30 to 45 minutes for the winds. But now we can add Boston into this because of rainfall. They are 30 to 45-minute delays.A ground stoppage at Reagan National in D.C. because of the low ceiling and we could put delays in Orlando but that's because of volume. So we've got a one-two punch here. Everyone trying to travel in the afternoon into the evening period and you throw the worst weather of the entire week into the situation of the largest cities. Now, in green it's nice. Detroit, however get ready. You've got heavy rain moving into the area. Cold front is back to toward Pittsburgh. Thunderstorms are firing up there. They'll be moving in toward Pittsburgh. This is just a large shield of rain that will create these delays and will continue to have a domino effect into the evening. If you notice the large (INAUDIBLE) shape here it trails all the way back in toward Florida, mainly its volume there. But behind the front we've got other problems. Even with the rain being a problem on the roads, if you're hitting the interstates and the highways, high winds are really going to create an issue here. and that's from all the way from Cincinnati, south of Nashville, warnings into the Blue Ridge Mountains for those that have to pass those areas. You've got snow up in the U.P. Of Michigan. And again, this is going to continue. So the forecast carries it into New York this evening, leaving I would say mid evening. Maybe around 7:00 or 8:00 and then it continues to be a problem up into Boston for the entire evening. Now, you get out to the Pacific Northwest, you've got other issues. That is the next storm system with coastal rainfall, a lot of snowfall. So regional flights will be impacted here. Not to mention those traveling by automobile, as well. Do want to set the stage though, Tuesday this is a rare November severe weather event which could have tornadoes at a level three out of possible five. We could see a level four and with that heavy rain. So when you want to decide to (INAUDIBLE) to leave and wait a couple extra days or deal with this, it looks like, for the first part of the week into the Deep South.",

Not only because there's bad weather on the horizon, but because it is the busiest travel day of the year.So 54.6 million people expected to travel. That is the number that traveled at least 50 miles from their home and they are making their way back today. So many of these travelers expecting some of those delays, prepared for it, had a plan in place, knew that it was a possibility. They are taking it in stride. They're looking forward to the fact that they are traveling again, because we are also seeing an increase from the last two years during the pandemic. More people are traveling.

The rate of flooding was just too high, so our dewatering wasn't able to keep up. And then our next mission was to get people off. Then, you can see in the video how the vessel capsized so quickly and how quick the situation can go south and put lives in jeopardy. We train in all kinds of weather.

Well, Iranian state media reporting Sunday that the United States should be kicked out of the tournament and suspended for 10 days for what it called distorted image of the country's flag.

But not all these movies, and, in fact, some of the best ones don't.So, you want to take a really narrow view of what a Christmas movie is. It eliminates an awful lot of movies. So -- but that said, you know, you had \"Christmas Vacation\" which is one of my favorites, too. We just had Chevy Chase on the TCM crews. It does have all of that. I mean, it's a comedy. And that one was very much driven by Christmas, but some of the best are sort of set around the time and a key plot point. But basically, what ties them all together is what ties all great movies together, right? They make us feel something.

I get it, not everyone.But -- so I think what Christmas movies do is make us feel and move us in a meaningful, emotional way. The Christmas movies come when there's a chance for us to see movies sometimes with people we don't sit down with other than our spouse, right, so, here we have a chance to watch with our children, sometimes our grown children. So for them, it's a chance to watch movies again with their parents. So, there's something about the time that really does matter that makes the way we receive these movies a little bit different than the rest of the year. But the plan, the key to any movie, be it a Christmas movie or any other movie, is that it moves us in a meaningful way.
