Tonight, Israel says it's preparing for the nextstage of war against Hezbollah, as sources say, a ground offensive into Lebanon could be imminent. We are live for you this hour in Beirut. Then a path of death as well as devastation. That's what Hurricane Helene has left behind in North Carolina. We'll take you live to one of the worst affected areas. And in just a few moments, former U.S. President Donald Trump is scheduled to give remarks after visiting some of the areas affected by Hurricane Helene in Georgia. We'll bring you those remarks, of course, right here on the show. But first this hour, this breaking news. An Israeli ground invasion of Lebanon looks more likely than ever. U.S. officials tell CNN the U.S. believes a limited incursion could be imminent. And Israel's Defense Minister says the next stage of the war with Hezbollah will start soon. During a visit to troops in northern Israel, Yoav Gallant, you see there, also said the IDF will use all means to accomplish its mission including forces from the air, from the sea and on land. According to U.S. officials, Israeli special forces have already carried out very small raids into Lebanese territory as they keep up relentless airstrikes.

Hezbollah is vowing to fight on despite losing its chief Hassan Nasrallah and other senior leaders in Israeli attacks. It says it's confronting Israel in support of Gaza and in defense of the Lebanese people. Hezbollah says it will choose a new leader soon. Well, U.S. President Joe Biden says he's not comfortable with Israel's apparent plans to launch a ground invasion of Lebanon. Once again, he is calling for a ceasefire, but so far, he has declined to use his considerable leverage as Israel's main weapons supplier. He says he will speak with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about the conflict soon. A U.S. official tells CNN, the Biden administration is working with Israel on defenses, worried that Iran is planning a response to the killing of Hezbollah's leader. Today, Mr. Netanyahu issued this direct message to the people of Iran. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

That's declaring three zones, three towns from the border a closed military zone. That tells us a lot. Ben Wedeman is in Beirut, Natasha Bertrand is at the Pentagon. So Ben, first to you, we are hearing rumblings and signals first from the Israeli Defense Minister, the next stage of the war with Hezbollah will start soon. We don't know what that might look like.

Of course, we heard President Biden trying to avoid a regional war. But yet again, talking about this need for the ceasefire, for the 21-day ceasefire. When you hear President Biden continue to talk about this ceasefire, when people on the ground, they hear that, what are they thinking? Is anyone there putting their hopes on this ceasefire?

What we're not seeing is any sort of active diplomatic presence to try to head off what could be a full-scale invasion, despite what the Israelis are saying. There is no -- nothing being done by the United States beyond President Biden said -- saying, I think his words were, I won't be comfortable with a ground incursion. It's not that he's against it, opposed to it, or he rejects it all together, he's just saying he wouldn't be comfortable with it. But the fact of the matter is that what we've seen -- sort of going back to Friday when Prime Minister Netanyahu was at the U.N. making a speech, he never mentioned any ceasefire efforts or even the word ceasefire. Whether it's in relating to Gaza or Lebanon. And what we've seen is they -- the Israelis seem to be acting as if the White House had nobody in it. It's true President Biden is essentially a lame duck President. You have the United States utterly consumed by this election campaign, war -- what we've seen over the last year, going back to October 7th, as the United States has talked a lot about trying to halt the fighting, about a ceasefire. But the war has only gotten worse, the death toll in Gaza is beyond 41,000, the war --",

This one is just one of 300 roads that are closed right now, and as you can see,it's pretty easy to see why their roads are completely covered in mud, this heavy sludge making them impassable for pedestrians and also dangerous for vehicles. But take a look around and you'll see that work is already starting to be done to clean up some of those roads. These behind us are all people of this community, also residents that live nearby. We do know that there were emergency crews on the scene making the rounds in the neighborhood, but as you can imagine, getting access into these communities has been pretty hard. The Asheville mayor spoke to our CNN's Jim Acosta earlier today, telling him that the community is cut off on three out of the four major highways. And just to give you a sense of the destruction, he described the power lines as looking like spaghetti. So, all hands are on deck here to try to clear out some of that debris, surrounded by us right now are small businesses. This historic neighborhood, one of them being a dairy distribution plant that you see right behind me, we took a look inside, it's completely covered in mud, in slush, all of their product, as you can imagine, spoiled, everything inside of those refrigerators as well. But despite that, the workers here we spoke to, they're trying to get whatever can be salvaged and not just distributed here in their communities, but also in retirement communities that need the help that are even, if you can imagine in a worse situation than they are.

And so, this is despite, youknow, many of local officials and national officials saying this is a moment for unity that people need to come together. This is of course, developing as we're seeing into a political story. Now, I do want to be very clear where you just played that clip of Donald Trump talking about Georgia governor Brian Kemp, he's a Republican and claiming that he couldn't get President Joe Biden on the phone. You actually heard Kemp say today that he spoke with President Joe Biden yesterday, and that he had offered him support with Kemp saying that he appreciated that. So, not exactly, you know, the full picture right there of what Donald Trump was saying. But what I found really interesting, Isa, in watching this -- these remarks and seeing Donald Trump's visit today is that, he is being treated like a principal in Georgia. He is receiving a briefing from the government agency, FEMA, that is something that normally a sitting President and a sitting leader in the United States would get, not necessarily a former President like Donald Trump is. So, I would -- I found that to be pretty notable. And also, I thought it was notable that he is trying to make it seem like he has the resources, Donald Trump, to really aid in this. He said that they brought water, that they have a tanker truck filled with gasoline. Of course, things that we know, people who are in these devastated communities are seeking. But I would also - keep in mind that again, he is not in government currently, so, there's only so much Donald Trump can do. But again, I think as much as this is an important moment, this is, of course political. Now, one other thing he said during those remarks as well is that he -- you can't get into North Carolina, that he would also like to visit North Carolina at some point. It's hard with these -- with these different storms and the immediate aftermath because a lot of like, for example, in North Carolina, the Governor Roy Cooper, who is a Democrat, but also Republicans on the ground are saying, now is not the time to come for a photo-op. The damage is too extensive and you need to focus your resources -- or the states do, on what is happening on the ground. I think it's a different case where Donald Trump is today in Georgia, but I think for our viewers questioning why you're not maybe seeing other U.S. leaders in these states, that's a big reason why.",

Vance, his running mate's team, they say the same thing. You know, you want to see -- you doubt that this will move the needle for the ticket overall. You know, it really comes down to Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, not J.D. Vance and Tim Walz, their respective running mates, but there could be an opportunity to really muddy up the waters and maybe change the news cycle and the media cycle around them. And so, you'll see, I know when I talked to Vance's team, that they are confident in his abilities, they told me that really, the goal for Vance and what he's been really prepping for over the last several weeks now has been to try and undercut Walz's image. Walz, they believe has this folksy image. He tries to paint himself perhaps more as a moderate candidate. Vance's goal tomorrow is going to try and make him appear more liberal and to really attack him on certain things. I know some attacks that they've previewed, the Vance side has been on, talking about immigration. crime, the economy, all of the issues we know that Republicans believe are their best issues as they look ahead to November 5th. Part of that, I wouldn't be surprised if you hear Vance bring up Springfield, Ohio, despite that being a very controversial story that we have covered. I think you'll also hear him talk about Vance's military record, something we've heard Vance do in the past, things like that to really try and undermine Walz's credibility. We'll see if he's successful. I know that Walz on his side, but again, I'm not sure how much this will move the needle overall for the broader presidential race.",
