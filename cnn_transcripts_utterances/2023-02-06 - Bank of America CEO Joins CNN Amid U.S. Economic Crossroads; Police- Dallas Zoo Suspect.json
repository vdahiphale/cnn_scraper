Unemployment rate, 3.4 percent, the lowest we've seen since 1969.The Fed, last week, once again hiking interest rates but less aggressively, reflecting cooling inflation. And now, the question is can the U.S. pull off a soft landing and bring down inflation without triggering a recession? Happy to have Bank of America's Brian Moynihan here, as CEO of one of the biggest banks in the world. He's got some pretty unique insight into where we are going. So, good morning.

That's what we do as we do in a natural disaster or something else.And so I think hopefully, you've heard both sides say that the idea is not to shut down the government. The idea is to have a strong discussion about the question of how big -- how high the debt should be. We had to put on a lot of debt in the last couple of years to overcome the pandemic drag on the economy and administrations from both sides of the aisle, so to speak, did that.
