The first Election Day polls opening right now in some places across Vermont, the final day to cast your ballot in the 2024 election. It's the start potentially of a new era for our nation. Kamala Harris and Donald Trump zeroing on the states that could secure them their spot, their home in that house we just saw. For Harris, it's been all about Pennsylvania. She spent Election Day eve barnstorming the commonwealth in search of every last vote. The vice president even knocking on doors herself to reach voters in Pennsylvania. Notably absent again from her speech as Monday, her opponent's name. Harris made her final major address in this campaign and is a race she started just 107 days ago at the top of the ticket. Last night she was on the steps of Philadelphia's Museum of Art, and you may remember the stairs made famous by the movie \"Rocky\". (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

There's such a stark difference between these two candidates and I think it was notable the backdrop at Kamala Harris is rally yesterday, set a precedent for all and vote for freedom and that was really the closing message that she had for Americans. In her Allentown stop and Pittsburgh and heading to Philadelphia. I mean, she gave similar speeches, similar closing speeches and in it, one of the things that was notable, was her saying, you know, who is it that help her get to this day? And one of the things she highlighted was, Republicans who made that decision that they care more about the Constitution than their party and have split to vote for her.And I think on the other side of that, we were hearing Donald Trump with a message that was very filled with grievances, filled with blaming, you know, Democrats and blaming Biden and Harris for the state of the country. You know, the picture he paints of the United States today is one that is in chaos, that is overrun by immigrants that have come into the country. That, you know, has a horrible economy. And I mean, statistics and data and just living in this country tells us that it is not chaos and it is not as horrible as he may paint it to be. Really, it showed this stark contrast and I guess the question today will ultimately be how voters, who they bought in on that message.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, I mean, it's a great part, right? I mean, you and I, reporters, pundits can look and try to define what's going to happen, but the voters have done nothing if not surprise us in recent election cycles and certainly, I feel like I have learned enough to get out of the prediction business.But here's what I will ask you. There aren't many people in America who get a chance to do what you are doing this election cycle. You have attended rallies for both of these candidates, and have gotten a finger feel for how each lays out there events. I'm sure you talk to sources in both campaigns. What's your evaluation of how each camp is feeling heading into Election Day? I mean, you can often pick some of that up when you are out on the trail in the final days about how they're feeling and what this is about what we may see and how we may see the results play out tonight. RODRIGUEZ:  And I think a week ago, you know, you hear Trump campaign officials and Trump supporters themselves kind of talking with more confidence, there is this feeling of momentum, this perception and of course some of the things can be the narrative that is going out at that point but I think there is a lot more of it is being projected from the Trump side a week ago and really with that Madison Square Garden rally and sort of low racist and demeaning insults that were said at that rally, really kind of shifted a little bit of momentum toward Democrats. Again, I think some people get overconfident and then now we have been on a different page, but I think it just reminded us how close this election is going to be. And from talking to voters I think it's as debate, some of them and some of them who have been more undecided we did not tune in until the election toward the end. You know, some of feel frustrated with the economy, some feel like they do not like the direction of where the country is going and that has maybe made them flirt with Donald Trump as their candidate of choice. But then they hear some of the comments that he has made the resort of this anxiety around maybe they think policy wise he would be good but there is concern about character and values. So, ultimately, I think it will be interesting to see where those folks who were undecided to the end, which way they actually break.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, yeah. So, the blue wall states as they're known, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, they are states Trump won in 2016, then Biden flipped in 2020 but the key here is that 44 electoral votes are up for grabs between the states. So, let's take a look at Pennsylvania, 19 electoral votes, the most of any battleground state.Polls open at 7:00 a.m. Eastern Time, along with most of the Eastern Time zones. So, that will help officially kick off Election Day. But as you see, almost 1.8 million absentee and mail-in votes have been returned so far and if you dig in, women outpaced men in the early vote by over 10 percent. But overall, we are only talking about 20 percent of total registered voters in this early vote. So, we've got a lot of vote to look out for today. That said, let's look at some of the counties that we'll keeping an eye on and especially critical when it comes to the margins, Philadelphia County, but also the suburbs with big populations, Montgomery, Bucks, Chester and Delaware, the collar counties, as they're known. They all went Biden in 2020, same story when you head west to Pittsburgh and Allegheny County, and then, of course, in the top left there, the northwest, there is Erie which Biden flipped in 2020 by less than 2,000 votes. We are expecting forestry sports of mail in ballots shortly after polls close. But the secretary of state has stressed they have never had final official results on Election Day, so be patience, people. And remember, in 2020, the projection here triggered the call for the presidency could play the role this time around. All right. Let's go to Michigan, polls also open here starting at 7:00 a.m. Eastern Time. So far, over 3 million Michiganders have voted earlier absentee and that brings the total to 44 percent among their active voter rolls. Again, before we got to today, and same story, so far, women have outpaced men by about 10 percentage points. And here, though, we're going to keep our eye on the population centers, Wayne County, home to Detroit and more people live there than anywhere else in the state, really looking at the margins. Biden won 68 percent of the vote there in 2020. Also, Macomb County in the suburbs which went for Trump in 2016 and 2020, but Obama in 2012. And in the western part of the state, Muskegon County, outside Grand Rapids, it went to Biden by just 500 votes in 2020, out of the more than 90,000 cast there. The Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson has said she hopes to have final results by midday Wednesday. And then, finally, in Wisconsin, polls open starting at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time, a little more than $1.5 million have been returned already and women are also outpacing men in early vote by around nine percentage points and when you look at the map, same deal, keeping an eye on the margins in Milwaukee and Dane counties where Democrats typically win big but also some of the suburbs in Milwaukee. We projected the race for president within 24 hours of polls closing last time around in the close at 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time here. And when you look at all of these in total, remember, the key thing here is we got 44 electoral votes up for grabs, and could make a huge difference maybe the difference.",

I mean, she's obviously more competitive than Biden was in the Sunbelt because she has recovered a lot of the ground he lost among -- was losing among Latino voters in particular and Black voters. But it does not look like she has recovered all of it and so the Sunbelt states still look a little harder for her.And as you said, the most straightforward path for Harris as it was for Biden, is by sweeping the three states that I say are the former blue wall states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, because they fell out of the original blue wall and those are states where Democrats traditionally have been able to run a little better with white voters than they do in most other parts of the country. Now, you know, people know they have voted the same way and every presidential election since 1980 except one. They have also voted the same way for governor in every election over the past 30 years, except one, in 2014. And if we are talking about Michigan and Pennsylvania, the level of convergence is almost unimaginable. They have deviated in the presidential race once since 1940 and only three times since the civil war. So, you know, past performance, no guarantee of future results. Pennsylvania could be tougher for the Democrats than the other two but they are so similar culturally, economically and demographically that there is a reason why they have tended to move as a herd.",
