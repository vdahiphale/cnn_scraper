Remember, the first ballot vote, he lost 20 Republicans. The second ballot, he lost 22 Republicans. I'm talking to Republicans who are opposed to him.They expect that number to be potentially close to 30 Republicans on this third ballot. One predicted it would be 29 Republicans. We'll see if that's the case. But no one expects him to get the votes needed to become elected speaker today. And he can only afford to lose three on the floor because one of his supporters is in Israel right now, bringing down the total of what he ultimately needs, raising so many questions, so much anger within the GOP ranks about how to get out of this crisis that they themselves caused. If Jim Jordan does not get the votes, which is widely expected, then there will be some decisions to make. Does he continue on with another round of ballots, which he can do as a speaker nominee, continue to call for votes, trying to get people to come his way? His supporters are urging him to do it. Jordan is threatening to continue to keep this going through the course of the weekend, or he could bow out. If he bows out, that could lead the way to another speaker's race from other candidates Republicans were considering putting their name in the ring. Now, on the others -- the other thing that has been discussed has been trying to prop up the interim speaker, Patrick McHenry, have a vote on the floor, to give him more powers than he currently has. But Republicans are widely opposed to that idea. Democrats support that idea for the most part, and the Republicans are badly divided over this and have shelved the idea of temporarily propping up Patrick McHenry, which leads to so many more questions about how are they going to get out of this, and if they can't figure out of their way out of this, that means all these huge issues that Congress has to deal with, namely aid that's being pushed hard by the president, trying to avoid another government shutdown, cannot be acted upon until the House Republicans can get behind a speaker and find a way out of this leadership crisis. And at the moment, Jake, there is no way out. So, we can see one ballot here fail for Jim Jordan, after another, after another, as frustration and anger mounts within the House GOP.",

In fact, he might even fall even shorter today than he did yesterday, which was even shorter than he was the day before. And yet, we are in matters -- of moments of crisis in Ukraine and Israel. There are not only innocent people dying in Gaza, in Israel, in Ukraine, these are American allies, there are Americans dying in these places. What is this, if not, a narcissistic act of self-regard? JAMIE GANGEL, CNN SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT:  I don't mean to laugh about this, but it is just unimaginable that this is day 17. You know, to say it's Groundhog's Day is really too light. But, look, one of the things that I'm told, two of my Republican sources just texted me and said, more knows, it's going in the wrong direction for him. The other thing that I think is important to point out, and I have said this a couple of times over the last couple of days, is Kevin McCarthy. His name, if you go, he would not let the architect of the Capitol take his name off the door. So, when you go to the speaker's office, there you go. It still says Kevin McCarthy.

Why aren't there more? Why aren't there more? Why don't more of them have the courage to step up and say, we need to break from this? Donald Trump lost the election. Joe Biden was duly elected. We need to look the American people in the eye and say, maybe we didn't like the way Pennsylvania did it, or Wisconsin did it, but it was all upheld in the courts. It was all upheld after recounts. When the referee blows the whistle, the game is over. When you go to court and lose, the game is over. They refuse to say game over. And so why aren't more Republicans standing up and saying we need to break from this, we need to move on? This is really another defining crossroads. Normally, parties set their agenda in their direction through presidential primaries. There's one of those playing out right now, and Trump doesn't have -- changes.
