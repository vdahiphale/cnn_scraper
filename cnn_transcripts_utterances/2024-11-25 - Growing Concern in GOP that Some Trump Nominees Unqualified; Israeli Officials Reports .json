It is Monday, November the 25th, 9 a.m. here in London, 4 a.m. in Washington, D.C., where the Thanksgiving holiday week is starting with a pretty clear picture of Donald Trump's cabinet picks.Now, Republicans are bracing for long confirmation battles ahead, especially for the president-elect's more controversial choices, like the nominee for Secretary of Defense, Pete Hegseth, who faces allegations of sexual assault. Democratic Senator and combat veteran Tammy Duckworth has questioned Hegseth's qualifications to lead the U.S. Department of Defense. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. TAMMY DUCKWORTH (D-IL): He never commanded a unit. He never commanded a company, let alone battalions, brigades or whole armies. He was a platoon leader. He served at a very low level in the military. And we're talking about an organization that is 3 million servicemen and women and civilians and a budget of over $900 billion. He does not have the experience to run an organization of that size. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

There's no background there for her to see, for anyone to see. She is she is a true patriot of the United States. And there's no reason why the Democrats are going after her, other than the fact they're upset that she left their woke party. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, President-elect Donald Trump has moved very quickly to fill out his cabinet. He only has a few more names left to announce. But now, really, the attention is turning to how he is going to get these different candidates through their confirmation processes, particularly the ones that we know are more controversial and that are causing some consternation up on Capitol Hill.And that includes Tulsi Gabbard, who many senators questioned her position on surveillance and also her deep distrust of some of the agencies that she'll be overseeing. There's also RFK Jr., who his past comments supporting abortion access may not sit well with a lot of the staunchly anti-abortion senators that will be dealing with his confirmation process. There's also Pete Hegseth, who's Donald Trump's pick to lead the Pentagon. He has been dogged by a recent sexual assault allegation, but also a lot of people raising questions of whether or not he has the credentials for that role. So all of this together is what I know the Trump transition team is going to be focusing on very heavily between now and Inauguration Day as they prepare all of these different people to go through the Senate process. Now, we did hear some members address this today. I do want you to take a listen to what Republican Senator Markwayne Mullen of the deep red state of Oklahoma said in trying to address some of this. SEN. MARKWAYNE MULLIN (R-OK): This isn't a new administration coming in. And so when people are criticizing his picks, the president has done this job before. He knows exactly what he needs. He knows who he wants to put in those positions. That's why he's been able to move fast, because he knows he has four years to reach the mandate that the American people said they want the government going in a different direction. And these nominations he's putting forth are actually going to deliver that for him.",

Here's the tiny dot at the top of the screen before it disappears behind the building.This is the moment when it skidded into a house and burst into flames. You can see thick, dark smoke arising there. In this video, you can see the plane's engine next to the house it crashed into. Local authorities say one crew member was killed, but remarkably, three others on board, including the pilot, survived the crash. So did the 12 people who live in the house it slammed into. The plane was a Swift Air aircraft operating under contract for DHL. According to the logistics company, emergency workers and firefighters are still on the scene. Now an Israeli official says there's been significant progress made in talks aimed reaching a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hezbollah. Though the official did say there are still disagreements that have to be settled. Despite the talks, there's been no end to the strikes across the border. On Sunday night, the Israel Defense Forces said they struck 12 Hezbollah command centers in Beirut's southern suburbs. Lebanese officials say dozens were killed in attacks across the country over the weekend. And since mid-September, Lebanon's health ministry says Israeli strikes have killed more than 3,000 people. In Israel, at least seven people were injured after the military says Hezbollah fired around 250 projectiles from Lebanon on Sunday. Some of them, as you can see here, intercepted by Israel's air defenses. Meanwhile in Iran, a senior advisor to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei says Tehran is preparing to respond to recent strikes by Israel. CNN's Paula Hancocks joins me now. Paula, let's start with the ceasefire talks in Lebanon.",

      "sentences": "Well, Max, everyone we're speaking to at this point says that it does appear to be close. We heard from the Israeli ambassador to the United States, Michael Herzog. He was speaking to Israel Army Radio and said that it could happen within days.He also, though, pointed out that Israel does reserve the freedom to act if they feel that they need to. Meaning if they believe that the ceasefire proposal is being violated, then they want to be able to act against Hezbollah. Now, up until this point, that appears to be a sticking point in Hezbollah's mind. So it appears as though they are in the final throws of trying to put this ceasefire proposal together. But that could well be one of the quite significant sticking points. Now, we did have one regional source as well telling us that they believe that they were very close, closer than they have ever been, but not yet fully formed with this deal. Now, what we are also seeing on the ground is what we often see just before a ceasefire is announced, and that is both sides pushing and escalating the amount of military activity that they are carrying out. We heard from the Israeli Defense Force that some 250 projectiles were fired by Hezbollah. That's among the highest that we have seen since October 8th of last year. And we have also seen significant airstrikes from Israel into the southern suburbs of Beirut and southern Lebanon as well, a grim milestone being crossed in Lebanon, with more than 3,000 now having been killed since mid-September when this uptick in violence between the two sides started. [04:10:06] Now, we are also, as you mentioned there, Max, hearing from a senior advisor to the Supreme Leader in Iran, Ali Larijani, and he has said that there will be a response, as we have heard, to Israel's attack on Tehran just last month. And he has said that it will be aimed at restoring deterrence, that the military authorities in Tehran are currently trying to hammer out a deal and a plan that will try and restore that deterrence. Now, we had heard from the Supreme Leader shortly after the late October strike by Israel that the response would be teeth-breaking. Now, in that response from Israel, which was a retaliation to an October 1st strike by Tehran, we did see Israel targeting the aerial defense systems in Iran. We also saw missile manufacturing sites being struck. And the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, later admitted that a component of the nuclear program was also taken out, but not giving any more details than that. So this is what we are expecting at this point. There was no details, understandably, on timing or exactly what that retaliation would look like. But that is something that we are hearing once again, Tehran saying there will be a response to Israel -- Max.",

Then he comes to the U.S. and goes back with 100 billion every time and paraphrasing. But I think it was sort of said in a derogatory sense. And of course, we know that J.D. Vance, his running mate, has openly opposed aid for Ukraine. So this was very unnerving to Ukraine. But obviously, now that he's won, they have to work with him.

And we don't know right now who the next Secretary of State is going to be. It has to go through Congress and all of that.But, you know, there are concerns that they might reduce aid. So I think that's one thing. The second thing that we're looking out for from this meeting is any progress on dispersing that $50 billion loan to Ukraine that's backed by those Russian sovereign assets. The G7 has agreed, the various different parties have agreed their contributions to it. And we had expected that that would come by the end of the year. That financially would put Ukraine on a much surer footing going into the next U.S. administration.",

We start off the day Monday with this new system here impacting portions of the Midwest down through the Mississippi and Tennessee Valley area region. That's going to have rain on the south side and some snow showers farther to the north.Out to the west, we are going to have a series of systems moving their way through. This is expected to bring some heavy rainfall along the coast and some very heavy snow, especially in the Sierras. Could see two to three feet over the next few days. By late into the day Monday again, you'll start to see that first system begin to spread into the areas of the mid-Atlantic as well as the northeast overnight into early Tuesday. Also looking at some showers along the southeast coast too. The other system we're watching, that's the one that moved into the West Coast, now starting to overspread into the Rockies and eventually into the central portion of the country once we get towards Wednesday. This is going to have mostly rain here as the temperatures won't quite be cold enough for snow. You're really going to have to go pretty far north to get the snow into the mix. But by overnight Wednesday and into Thursday, those temperatures starting to creep down in some areas, allowing a few more spots to get some snow or even a rain-snow mix. Heavy rain at times possible across the Tennessee Valley. Even cities like Nashville, Atlanta, and Knoxville could have rain in the forecast. Then by midday Thursday, you're looking at more of that moisture overspreading into the northeast and into the mid-Atlantic. So any last-minute travel or local travel on Thanksgiving Day itself, the biggest concerns are going to be the northeast stretching all the way down into the Gulf Coast, where you're going to have the bulk of that really heavy moisture. So then the question becomes, OK, what about the famous Macy's Day Parade? Here's the thing. We've got that rain coming in. The heaviest will hold off till the afternoon and evening hours of Thursday. So the first few hours of the parade should, in theory, be OK. But those rain chances go up very quickly for the back half of the parade. Temperature-wise also, not exactly going to be very warm. You're looking at those temperatures likely only in the low 40s.
