Outside the burned out building near Moscow, while inside emergency teams continuing to sit through the debris say they expect to find more bodies and we've more than 140 people injured, the death toll is expected to rise.In a nationwide security operation, investigators say at least 11 people have already been detained, including the four gunman suspected of carrying out the mash shooting on Friday night. State media has been broadcasting grisly images of some of the men tied up and blooded being manhandled and interrogated. One suspects speaking broken Russian is shown allegedly confessing to carrying out the attacks in the Crocus City Hall for money. Well, ISIS has claimed responsibility for the assault, posting images of what they say are the attackers with their faces covered. The terror group says the attack was a normal part of its war against countries fighting Islam. U.S. officials say they have no reason to doubt ISIS claim. But the Russians President Vladimir Putin who's been vowing revenge for what he calls a barbaric acts has attempted to link the attacked to Ukraine, saying preliminary data suggests that gunman attempts to escape their across what is an extremely militarily -- heavily militarized border. That's something Ukrainian officials strongly deny, once senior official there telling CNN that the Kremlin is trying to implicate Ukraine to rally domestic support here for its brutal war, and to provide an excuse for ramping up attacks on Ukrainian towns and cities.

They'll do their best to find the so-called Ukrainian trace and so when Putin spoke and address the nation today, it was no surprise to me whatsoever when he pointed out that the car with terrorists -- with the terrorists was making toward the Ukrainian border.

And then at that point they could reveal it to the world. So that announcement was very much timed for the end of the school term, which point they could reveal it to the world whilst protecting their children so they really calling for privacy at this point, we will be seeing Prince William at public engagements, but not nearly as much as were used to. Kate will try to go out in public engagements if she can, but really she's not going to be out full time until she's been given the all clear from doctors. So they're calling for everyone to respect their privacy, the media, but also the public. And then you have a question about what happens at this place, Buckingham Palace. You know, there's a huge amount of pressure at the top of the royal family right now. There were four senior royals in full-time public duties. Now we have two. They are Queen Camilla and Prince William, both of whom have partners who have spouses, who have cancer and they have families to worry about, but they also have to represent the monarchy. But as the late queen, Queen Elizabeth, used to say, you have to be seen to be believed if you're in this role. So they understand, they have to represent monarchy out in public. But they're going to balance that with the really tough traumatic time back at home. That's a big challenge going forward, but they're asking for public patience really as they go through that process. Max Foster, CNN, Buckingham Palace. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
