We're looking at difficult to nearly impossible travel, heavy blowing snow, significant ice. The possibility of power outages all across the central plains heading into parts of the Midwest. You see all of that red from Kansas City to Saint Louis. That's where we're looking at some major impacts likely as we go into Sunday. And then that's going to stretch east as we get towards Monday.Right now the winter storm watches are in place for parts of Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and Kentucky. And this stretches almost 900 miles. And again, as we go through time, this will tack on for places towards the mid-Atlantic. The storm really starts to develop on Saturday, but really pumps in the moisture and gains steam by Sunday. We've got cold air coming in from the north that's squeezing in all of this moisture from the south. So that's where we're going to get the possibility of some heavy snow possible across these places, and some significant ice. Plus, you've got rain and the storms along to the south. And then you can see, by Monday it spreads east. We could be looking at some snow in D.C. on Monday as this spreads towards the mid-Atlantic. The ice could be significant. Just a little bit of ice could do a lot of havoc when it comes to travel conditions. We could be looking at a quarter to a half an inch, which would also cause problems with trees and power lines and power outages. There is the heavy snow a little bit farther to the north where that cold air is deeper. Could be looking at 6 to 12 inches of snow. Then the storm threat, where we have some damaging winds and a couple of tornadoes possible. Sara.",

We were unified in the last Congress, the 118th. Every important piece of legislation had a majority vote by the Democrats. The Republicans had it (ph) on. And I think we're going to see more of that as we go into this year. The Republican caucus is very, very thin. Their majority, one, two, maybe three votes, depending on who's absent.

In March, the government's going to be out of money, and the Republicans have not only the presidency, the Senate, they also, at least nominally, control the House of Representatives. They're in charge. They're going to be responsible for funding the government in March. If they cannot do it themselves, then they're going to have to turn to the Democrats here in Congress. And we will then have the opportunity to write that legislation in a way that is good for the working men and women of America. Right now, the Republicans seem determined to take care of the billionaire class, the Elon Musk and the billionaires of this - of this country. That's not where we are.So, come March, you're going to see the Democrats - the Republicans having to come to the Democrats, and we're going to require that if they want our votes, they're going to have to have that funding beneficial to the men and women, to the firefighters, the teachers, the nurses, the working men and women out there in the construction projects. That's where we're going. And you can place a bet that the Republicans are going to have to come to the Democrats at that moment. Now, will there be a speaker today?

And it appears as though, just a day or two ago, he issued an emergency order that basically opened the door for the insurance companies to charge anything they want to charge for homeowners insurance.My prediction is that the crisis is going to get worse. That the commissioner has not used his power to discipline the insurance marketplace. It's very, very difficult. I know my own situation. I've seen insurance triple over the last three years for a homeowners policy. And that's not - well, that is what is happening to homeowners. It's going to be a very difficult situation for homeowners in California unless the insurance commissioner uses the power that he has to discipline the market, to force the insurance companies to prove that they need the insurance - the premium rate increases. And, also, he has the power to force them to write policies in every part of the state. Redlining is illegal in California. If the insurance commissioner is willing to use the power to stop that red line. Now, the redlining used to be based upon racial and income. Now it's based upon race, income, and fire danger.",
