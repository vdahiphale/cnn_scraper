I'm not sure he could make that statement today as we await his address to Congress.I want to bring in our Clare Sebastian now who is monitoring all of this from London for our international reaction. I mean, Clare, look, we now have heard that in fact, negotiations have been postponed even further, that Israel will not be sending negotiators onwards until next week. What hangs in the balance here, especially when we have seen even U.S. allies really bristle the kind of support they have had for Israel in the last few months?",

And I think hopes pretty dimmed already going into this one because of that delay of the Israeli delegation going to Cairo to join those talks.Secondly, you know, we've even had one of the -- a key member of parliament in Israel, Benny Gantz, former member of the war cabinet, coming out and accusing Netanyahu of essentially trying to run out the clock on the Knesset session. They go into a three-month recess next week, then of course, the concerns which by the way have also been expressed by President Biden that Netanyahu is doing this more motivated by his own political survival than anything else. But of course, on the other hand, there is still the sense that Israel is engaged in these talks. There are questions around whether President Biden will be tougher on Netanyahu now that he doesn't have to worry as much about U.S. voters, now that he's no longer in the race. So, from the international perspective, those are the key questions going into this. And of course, as we see this new assault on Khan Younis having started this week, that raises the stakes even higher. And we also have international organizations coming out and trying to keep the focus on the humanitarian situation. And frankly also, the material nature of this relationship between the U.S. and Israel. Amnesty International coming out ahead of this visit and calling again for the U.S., the Biden administration to stop supplying weapons to Israel. Enough is enough, is that statement from Amnesty International. Paula.",

I think it is appropriate now that we can pivot to what a Kamala Harris position on all of this will look like in the coming months, especially during the campaign. You know, it's not lost on anyone that she -- the second gentleman, Mr. Emhoff has been out there really in support of Israel, also backing though his wife and his wife's position, that some say that behind closed doors, she has been much more strident on the issue than certainly the Biden administration has been in public.

But describe as a sentimental down to the core Zionist President.And that's Joe Biden. There have been very friendly Presidents and the definition of what constitutes friendly and supportive obviously varies politically. Bill Clinton was very supportive, Richard Nixon was supportive of Israel materially, if not ideologically, George W. Bush was, Barack Obama was, and some people say Donald Trump was. OK. But no one -- no one comes even close to Joe Biden's level. Which is why even though politically, Kamala Harris is his vice president, and she's running on a ticket that he would have run or should have run until the 72 hours ago, comparing her to him is somewhat historically at least unfair. Then let's be practical, I think that in the next, you know, on the 105 days until the election, she's going to try and stay away from the school called the Middle East, it's not being --",
