I wonder what goes through your mind knowing that that kind of damage is possible given that we're watching Hurricane Milton inch closer.",

They are potentially about eight to 12 feet here in Tampa Bay. And for many areas along the coast, that kind of storm surge is devastating. It could be a record setting as well as it is forecasted.

A very, very interesting decision, a potentially fatal decision by Lieutenant Dan to stay where he is with a storm surge that we're expecting with the rainfall that we're expecting.Right now, we just got a maximum rainfall. It started at about 2:00 p.m. It is going to go through the evening. I do want to just take a quick look. OK. Just making sure who our next guest is. We have Mayor Kenneth Welch of St. Petersburg, Florida, who is joining us now, live. Mayor, thank you so much for being with us. I wonder what goes through your mind when you see someone like Lieutenant Dan deciding to ride out the storm, the way that he's doing it. And also when you see folks like -- I'm not sure if you could make it out. There's a gentleman behind me who's taking pictures right now of the storm here at the bay as it's barreling down. What goes through your mind when you see stuff like that? MAYOR KENNETH WELCH, ST. PETERSBURG, FLORIDA: Well, it's good to be with you. You know, I think our sheriff put it best: If you're going to take that risk, then be best to just write your name on your clothing so we can identify you. They are literally putting their lives at risk. And at a certain point, when we get 50-mile-an-hour sustained winds, we will not be responding to emergency calls because we don't want to put our first responders at risk. People need to take this storm seriously. We had six feet of surge during Hurricane Helene. Almost a dozen lives were lost in Pinellas County and the city of St. Petersburg. This coming storm, Milton, has the capacity to double that storm surge. And so people are literally putting their lives at risk and we don't want them to put the lives of our public responders at risk as well.",

Conditions are only going to get worse and worse as Milton gets closer and the hours go on.Mayor, talk to us about some of the preparations that have been made, some of the closures, and some of the efforts to get debris from Hurricane Helene removed because I know some of that -- I saw some of it firsthand.

And people have really responded to that. The benefit of that is that most of the debris is in areas that are evacuation zones. In evacuated zones A through C. And so we -- of course, no municipality was able to clear the debris from Hurricane Helene in just a few days. We're talking six months of debris that we're trying to clean up in six days. You simply can't do that. And so our hope is that most folks that and those evacuations have moved out. Debris will cause a hazard and will complicate the cleanup going forward. But we are focusing now on saving lives, protecting lives. And we think we've done a good job at that. People are responding to the call to evacuate. The debris is going to be a major issue. This has been the most impactful storm, Helene was, to date. And now on top of it, Milton will be impactful. And so we're looking at months of cleanup after this.",

About a foot of rain is expected for some areas. Just in the last about 12 hours or so, almost 14 hours or so, the Tampa Bay area has gotten more than two inches of rain.
