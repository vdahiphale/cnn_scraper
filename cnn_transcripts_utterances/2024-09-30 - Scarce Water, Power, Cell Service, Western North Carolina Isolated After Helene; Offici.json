      "sentences": "Good morning. You are live in the CNN Newsroom. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.We are following breaking news this morning. Disaster in Western North Carolina, as one North Carolina official put it, the devastation is, quote, biblical. Large swaths are completely cut off in that area. Officials say all roads there are considered closed. These are exclusive pictures coming into CNN showing the destruction in Asheville. What you are looking at is the main road in Biltmore Village, near the famous Biltmore Estate. It's a five-lane road, usually full of cars. Now it's covered in debris and mud. People walking down the middle of the road looking for supplies, that is a common sight these days. Helene tore through the historic village. The floodwaters, you can see right here, rising to roof level and pushing trailers into buildings. Power and water are out in much of the city. This is a transformer. You can see it right there, just lying in the middle of the road, leaking fluid. It's been there for days. And the power company says they are hoping to restore power to most customers by Friday and four days. Cell service is spotty throughout this area. People are still desperately trying to contact their loved ones in the area. 600 people in Buncombe County are unaccounted for at this hour. At least 42 people are dead across North Carolina from the storm and officials say that number is expected to go higher. Joining me now is the Asheville mayor, Esther Manheimer. Mayor, thank you so much for being with us. What do we know about the hundreds of people who are said to be unaccounted for as at this hour? Is it possible the death toll could go much higher than what we're seeing at the moment? What can you tell us? MAYOR ESTHER MANHEIMER (D-ASHEVILLE, NC):  Well, it's very difficult to know for sure because our communications are so compromised. A lot of people still are not able to use their phone to call or text. And we have parts of our community that are completely cut off because of road washout. So, it's hard to confirm whether or not people are okay. So, I think that will be an evolving situation over the next few days as we reestablish communications and get cell service restored to the whole city and county that we're in.",

The rivers crested higher than they ever have on record. So, we cannot yet estimate how long it will take to restore power to everyone.Duke Energy is our provider here. They're working on that. And how long it will take to restore water to everyone. We're still in a critical emergency stage of this situation. And right now, our priority is to get drinking water and food and gas into folks so that they have the basic necessities to continue to support themselves and their families.",

      "sentences": "You know, folks are in shock. I mean, I have to tell you, I've never seen anything like this. I've been in several hurricanes in Eastern North Carolina, just to see people come out of their homes, serving the damage, just in shock. There are neighborhoods where every other house has a tree on it, or through it.Roads blocked, multiple trees down on one road. The power lines looks like, you know, spaghetti. It's hard to describe the chaos that it looks like. It really feels like, you know, a post-apocalyptic scene in some T.V. show you watch. And I've never thought I would see it myself. And the inability to communicate, you know, no one's phone is working. We're getting some communications restored. You know, I happen to be in downtown Asheville, the only square block area that has power, so I'm able to communicate with you, but this is -- you know, and as we watch these rivers recede, we are seeing just piles, people's houses that were destroyed, buildings that were destroyed, cars overturned, trash and debris. I mean, it reminds me of Katrina, where they had to go door to door and look in each vehicle and mark whether or not anyone was in it. I think we're going to continue to need to survey this entire situation. But let me just say, I am so proud of Asheville and Buncombe County, the folks that have come together to help their neighbors, to check on their neighbors. Before I could hike out of my house and get to my mom, her neighbors had already checked on her. We really have come together as a community. I knew this was a wonderful community and they've really shown their true colors and helping each other in this devastation.",

So, we know that we know that that death toll will rise. I hope and pray it doesn't rise much at all. But, you know, we're prepared for the worst.And we have a tremendous team of first responders that is working around the clock, checking on everyone, checking to see and recover folks, unfortunately. And we also want to do a big thank you to all of the first responders from around the country that are coming here to help us and all the utility folks that are coming here to help us restore power and services to the community. Thank you so much to those folks who are, you know, working tirelessly and staying in a hotel that doesn't have any water.

We need everything from food, water, to porta potties, to baby formula, you name it, all the basic necessities that anyone can imagine you need in a storm situation like this.

This is just one of the hundreds of roads that is closed at this hour. As you can see, heavy, heavy mud. That sludge is difficult to walk through, let alone drive through. It's a very dangerous situation.You know, right now, we're just now starting to see groups of people come back into the area. This very historic area built more village. This looked very different even a couple days ago, right? It was the raging waters here. But this is a very historic area. This is a very beloved area by the locals here. We spoke to a group of workers just behind me at this dairy distribution center. Some of them saying their inventory completely destroyed, the business inside, the foundation disrupted by this flooding, even as much as receiving as much as eight feet of water, something they did not expect to be hit so hard. One of the folks telling me that they may not even have a job to go back to.",

You're looking at Lake Lure in western North Carolina. The devastation is hard to put into words. That is a lake just filled with water. With debris as far as the eye can see, the landscape now unrecognizable. The Charlotte City councilman who took this video says the cleanup for the area is just impossible to comprehend. You can see boats looking like toys. They're mixed in with all of that debris. Emergency officials say there have been multiple air rescues in the Lake Lure Chimney Rock area since Saturday morning. And let me go straight to CNN Meteorologist Elisa Raffa, who can walk us through some of the damage that we're looking at right now. Elisa, it's kind of hard to put your arms around this. I mean, this is just staggering, some of the video that we're seeing coming out of that part of the country.",

And I used to do some local coverage in North Carolina, and the community there, I can tell you, is just reeling. I'm seeing so many posts on social media from people that are trying to reach out with supplies to send them up to these mounted communities.But this is what happens when you have the force of water, of rain that comes in two to three feet. I mean, some of these rainfall totals have been 20 inches. 30 inches coming down in just a couple of hours, and that is what the force of intense water can do. I mean, when we say turn around, don't drown, it's because only a foot of water can take away your car. Imagine, you know, we're seeing what two to three feet can do, and we know heavy precipitation events like this are only becoming more likely and more extreme. Jim?",

They cleared out before the storm, and yesterday, as soon as we could make our way out there, and when we got there, you could already tell this was something very, very different.And as we navigated the streets and you know, people sawing limbs that are continuing to fall even now, every day and block new parts of streets off or mudslides or roads crumbling. Once you navigate up there to the part where I was able to take that quick video, I mean, you just don't even know what to do. You came to try to help and figure out, okay, what's next now? And, I mean, it's just too big. It looked to me like a lake that we've seen for many years and my friends that live there have seen for their entire lives and then their families' lives before that turned into something that looked like probably a bit of a dump to anyone just looking at it. But when you put your eyes on it, it's these massive things that are out there, and there's so many of them. They seem small. And it's almost imagining one when it was moving. It was a blender that was just taking out anything in its path, absolutely anything. And now that it's there and you try to start fathoming what a cleanup and a recovery looks like, I mean, we, you know, we've seen have been parts of small recoveries and things like that, this is going to take years and years and years to even get to a place that's solvable.",
