And right now we are standing by for a police press conference that is set to begin at any moment. But here is what we know right now.Police say a gunman killed two people at Abundant Life Christian School this morning. And a police source says that the victims were a student and a teacher.

And CNN has now learned from a law enforcement source that it was a 9mm pistol that was used in the attack. CNN's Shimon Prokupecz is back with us and has been on the phone with law enforcement all afternoon.What more are you expecting to hear from this press conference, Shimon?",

      "sentences": "Well, most importantly, I think the breakdown of the victims, how many are students, how many are teachers, just to give us a sense, you know, always very important in these situations to remember the victims and to learn as much as possible about the victims. So I'm hoping we get some more information on that. But there's been a lot of confusion, but also just the fog of war, right?This is in the middle of this, the victims are being treated at the hospital. So as you said, we do know that at least two of the two dead victims are a teacher and a student, both dying on scene at the school. And the shooter, police are not yet able to definitively identify the shooter, even whether it's a male or a female. They won't say at this point. They're waiting to identify, to make some more conclusive identification before releasing that information. The other thing that I think is going to be very interesting here is that it's a handgun. We know the 9mm. That is going to raise some interesting questions for investigators as to how the shooter got their hands on this handgun while Wisconsin is an open carry state. There's a lot of questions about a handgun and how someone could get their hands on it and whether or not it was legally obtained. Did they get it from someone? And, of course, those are going to be the questions that investigators are going to be asking. I don't know if they'll be able to release any of that. It's too soon, perhaps. The other thing is maybe more of a timeline here about how things unfolded. This seems, based on information that I have and people I've talked to, that this was all pretty self-contained in one area where all of this happened. And it all happened very quickly, and police arrived very quickly, even that some of the people were still alive but sadly died on scene. And the shooter was still alive and was transported to the hospital. So police were able to get on scene fairly quickly and establish exactly what happened. And now the investigators have taken over from the Wisconsin -- the Madison, Wisconsin Police Department, the detectives, as they're trying to figure out exactly why this happened. The FBI is assisting. The ATF is assisting. But there's going to be a lot of questions centered, I think, right now around that handgun and how this person, this shooter, was able to get their hands on the handgun. And I think that's something that investigators are going to want to be able to answer. You know, because a lot of times we think about this when we cover these shootings. We always hear about long guns and rifles being used and AR-style weapons. That's not the case here. This is a handgun, a much different situation, which presents all sorts of different legal questions, which I think are going to be interesting to see how that develops. [KEILAR: And I was going to ask you, Shimon, but we got the answer as we were watching here, if students had been reunified, and we've been seeing a lot of kids kind of lower elementary, it looks like. These are little kids. I'd say they're obviously blurred. The camera's there protecting their faces. It is blurred, but you can make out their outlines, and they are maybe third, fourth grade, maybe second even. So some little kids filing out there as they are going to be reunified with their families. And the other thing that we are looking at, as you see there on the top left of your screen, is we're awaiting this press conference where we are going to be hearing from the police chief, we're going to be hearing from Madison's mayor, and we're also going to be hearing from the Madison County executive. Gregg McCrary, you were with us, and as you heard Shimon talking there about this 9mm pistol that was used, I wonder what you are thinking about that. You had said before that in most cases, weapons are brought, when it's a juvenile, from their home. We still obviously have some information to learn. We're awaiting that here for this press conference, but what are you thinking as you hear this news?",

And if we just go with the stats, that's what we're going to find, is that the weapon came from the home or came from an area, some area that this child had access to, was able to access the weapon and bring it to school. So that's exactly what I think we're going to find.You know, there are a couple of other things to think about when we get into this, and as you were pressing the politician there, to give some really specific answers. [SANCHEZ: Gregg, we're going to have to interrupt you because we see the police chief in Madison headed to the podium. Let's listen in right now live to this news conference.",

As a mom who received a text from her son at a high school here in the city of Madison wondering if he was safe, I can tell you this hits you in the gut.Our community is better than this. Our country is better than this. It cannot continue. My heart goes out to the victims and their families and the students and the educators, and the list goes on and on. Every one of us is affected by this unimaginable and unacceptable violence that has hit our community today. Dane County stands united in grief with the Abundant Life Christian School community. The Sheriff's Department, the Department of Emergency Management, Department of Human Services have all been on the front lines. My phone has been ringing from people across our state and our nation asking what it is that they can do to help our community. And right now it is our time to be committed to supporting this school, these students, and these families, and our first responders who went into that building during this devastating time. We must work closely with our law enforcement officers and first responders, mental health professionals, community leaders, and policymakers to ensure that we are taking care of one another. No community should ever have to endure such a tragedy. And my administration is going to do everything that it can to provide assistance to those who have experienced this devastating loss and also do everything that we can to prevent such tragedy from occurring. To all of those who are grieving in our community, please know that you're not alone. Dane County stands with you. [15:50:02] We're here to support you in any way possible. Please reach out and ask for help. The Governor's Office as well as the Mayor's Office and I will continue to update the public as we learn more. But please understand there are many things that we cannot share with you right now. This is an active investigation. This is an active case. The SSM Health Clinic near the intersection of Buckeye Road and Stoughton Road is the reunification center. I know that that has been out, but we need to make sure that folks know where it is that they can go to be reunited with their children. Again, in the coming days, we are going to make sure that we are supporting those that have been most impacted by this. But, folks, reach out. Ask for help. This does not need to be the reality of our community. Thank you.",

I can tell you that our mayor and our county exec has committed resources to not only public health but also mental health. I can tell you that every teacher that I've ever had contact with at MMSD cares deeply about their students, every staff member. I talk to staff members all the time who tell me things that are going on in the schools and want to do whatever they can, even if it's under anonymity, to let me know that they want to have a safe school. So my reassurance to the public is that if you see something, say something. If you know someone who may be going through a difficult time, please reach out to someone. And I think what I can do is make sure that our police department is transparent and open and honest and inviting for people to call and give information. I think MMSD does an excellent job of that.
