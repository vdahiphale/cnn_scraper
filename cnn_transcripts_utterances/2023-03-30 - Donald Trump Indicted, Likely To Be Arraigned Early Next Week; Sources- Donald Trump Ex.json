Our team absolutely saw that here in the nearby bridge near Mar-a-Lago. In August, when I was here almost immediately after that search warrant was executed, we saw protesters and we saw them really showing their force, really large flags and a lot of the MAGA sort of paraphernalia, support for President Trump after these big moments have happened in the past, not yet -- not to say that will not come, but really not seeing that at the level that we have seen it in the past when he has had these big moments. Now, we understand that he has been here in Mar-a-Lago over the last several days. Our Kristen Holmes reporting he has been meeting with advisers, but this is one that caught them off guard in terms of the timing, so that may play a role also in why we don't see what we have seen in the past here. You know, what this will look like in terms of any sort of surrender as that is being coordinated, we will have to wait and see. But the law enforcement presence that we do see out here right now is mostly traffic control, local police, who are making sure that folks don't park on the side of the road as they typically do when we see these type of protests on the bridge.

He got him to backpedal on some criticism that he had from over the weekend, when there was a photo posted -- Trump posted -- of Trump holding a baseball bat standing next to a picture of Alvin Bragg, but he is still attacking him and trying to basically make this argument that Alvin Bragg is politically motivated here.

The Speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy issuing a statement saying that they plan to, in his words go after the \"unprecedented abuse of power\" and hold Alvin Bragg, the prosecutor to account. That has been echoed down the line as House Republicans look to haul in Bragg, seek his testimony, demand documents, demand he turn over documents, even as they face accusations that doing so would interfere with an ongoing criminal investigation. But on the Senate Republican side, it is different. The leadership there, Mitch McConnell, the top Republican leader, the number two Republican, John Thune, both have been silent so far in the aftermath of this news. And of course, McConnell and Trump and Thune have a much different view of Trump and McCarthy and his allies do. McConnell and Thune are eager to move past the Trump era. Kevin McCarthy has aligned himself with Donald Trump and credits him with winning the Speakership. Now, on the Democratic side, most Democrats have either been mum or suggested that Donald Trump is not above the law. One Democrat just weighed in, a very important one, Chuck Schumer, the Senate Majority Leader saying that this investigation should be and these charges should be \"There should be no political influence,\" no outside political influence, a sign that he is pushing back against the House GOP efforts to intervene in this case. Now I did to also reach out to Matt Gaetz, who is one of Donald Trump's closest allies and asked him about whether he spoke with Donald Trump tonight. He did and he said that Donald Trump was in his words, \"fierce and focused\" on this historic night.

Now, again, it's not my case, so I'm not going to comment on the specific facts here.

They had him in for several proper sessions, and they ultimately decided he was not credible enough for them to bring a case against anybody else.And he was sentenced without a 5k letter or a cooperation letter. But the other point is this, just because somebody has pleaded guilty to something as part of a cooperation agreement, does not mean that other people committed that crime.

The grand jurors that listened to this evidence, listened to the testimony, reviewed the documentary evidence, and made a decision. They were conscientious, I think, spent a lot of their time, public service time.

It's going to be unlike, you know, a normal arraignment because he's going to have Secret Service and this is going to look different. This is somebody who has spent more than four decades trying to avoid being arrested or being indicted. And so, this is a really scary moment for him, despite whatever he says. Now, you talk to different people tonight, you hear he's fine. You talk to others who say that he's very angry. I expect that we will be hearing all of those emotions going in various ways for the coming days. I don't know what the fallout is going to be politically, and I think this is the first time that I can think of where he can't control this. He was able to control impeachment in some way because Mitch McConnell was on his side in the Senate trial and because House Republicans were on his side. He was even able to control the second impeachment to some extent. With the Mueller report and the investigation, he was never going to get indicted as a sitting president.

And then others of them, not all of them, but others of them did believe that the case was falling apart primarily on the word of Bob Costello, a Giuliani lawyer and briefly a Michael Cohen, either lawyer or legal adviser, depending on who you believe, who came in as a defense witness in the grand jury in New York, that you have the right to do that.There was no evidence that they ever offered as to why they believed that, just things that people were hearing. And as I said, Trump likes to create headlines that he thinks influence events, that obviously did not happen here. And if anything, frankly, all the stories yesterday about how the grand jury was going to be off for a month, probably alleviated a pressure valve for Bragg. It sort of -- it took the heat down a little bit. COOPER: I want to bring in David Urban and Van Jones. David, I mean, this is a remarkable, historic night.

And Bill Clinton, you know, was impeached and was acquitted, similar to President Trump, and then remained in office.And, you know, Ken Starr went away, and special prosecutor Robert Ray was still lingering around, and there was the threat of Clinton being indicted when he left office, right. That was always kind of out there. And the day before he left, on January 19, 2001, former special prosecutor Robert Ray cut a deal with then-President Clinton to not prosecute him, right? And to let him surrender his law license for five years, pay a fine and put it aside. And, you know, there was a great deal of pressure on Ray to indict him at the time, and he didn't. And he said, you know, the American people in history will judge me and judge whether I did the right thing or not. And in retrospect, you know, I think Robert Ray did the right thing.

At the same time, I think a lot of people are saying finally, finally something has happened to get some kind of accountability here. You've had our social norms run into the ground. You've had our political norms run into the ground. At least our legal norms are not being run into the ground in this case. You have a prosecutor who went to everyday ordinary Americans and said, here's what I've got, do you think it's chargeable? And they said, yes. And I think that there is a sense among some people that somebody had to do something at some point. And that everybody's just kind of standing on the edge of the swimming pool looking in all these prosecutors, all these cases, and nothing has happened to happen yet. And so, on the one hand, I think people are concerned and they're worried and they hope that this doesn't set some precedent where presidents start just getting prosecuted. There's real concern, but there is a sense that finally some kind of accountability may land on the doorstep of Donald Trump.",

That is something that's only in their minds, but we know the effect it had on the prosecutors, which is they thought he did damage to their case. They didn't want him to be the last thing grand jurors heard before they went to a vote.
