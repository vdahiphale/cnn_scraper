Both the Sudanese military and the paramilitary rapid support forces agreed to a 72 hour ceasefire beginning at midnight last night. The U.S. says it has been in constant communication with both military leaders since fighting broke out 11 days ago. But now eyewitnesses tell CNN heavy clashes have erupted in the northern parts of Khartoum. So tonight we ask can Washington be an effective mediator in Sudan.

MOHAMED IDRIS, SUDANESE AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S.: Thank you. Thank you so much for having me on your channel this morning. And thank you so much for caring.

That's according to the French government. So it is now becoming an increasing focus what might be done out of Port Sudan as two British warships heading in that direction to American warships too. There have been contingency plans for some kind of potential military intervention in Port Sudan if they needed to secure a bridge head for further evacuations. But of course, if the ceasefire holds the need for evacuation could go down. The ease of evacuation, of course, will also go up.

I think for so many people, we've seen so much interest inMars, whether it's, you know, is an option for the human race down the line. So why is it important to understand a little bit more about its moves in terms of understanding whether it can you know, host humans at some point?",

The team today is at an international conference, together with other scientists that are not our team who are able to access this data for the first time through the hope of a Mars mission about Mars. And as we continue studying and discovering for us what's important is continuing the advancement of science and technology in the UAE, advancing the industry, investing further in the space sector and investing further and realizing the potential of commercial space. This is only one prong of many programs and projects that are under the UAE space fund that continues to stimulate advancements in development forward. And these small pockets of achievements drive teams forward so that we can continue to achieve better science and great science, not only for the UAE, but for the space community at large.",

This is going to be an interesting week, not only for the UAE but for this international space sector at large, we will have the landing of the first commercial space vehicle on the surface of the moon. Those advancements are significant not only for the UAE, but its opening vast potential in space for us. Our first step that has stimulated quite a large activation was our mission to Mars. But today, it is not the only mission that the UAE has. Nor is it the only mechanism that we are advancing developing our commercial space sector. So as a team, I think excitement continues to be an understatement. And realizing the potential of a first mission and its impact on scientific discovery, rewriting theories coming up with new theories is something unprecedented for us.",

That's the word from scientists at Bristol University in England. And in this region, Afghanistan has been named one of the hotspots for high-risk heat waves. But the new study paints a scary scenario not only for Afghanistan, but for any nation that's not prepared to deal with the extreme heat. And I want to bring in CNN's Chief Climate Correspondent Bill Weir. I knew you and I were going to be talking again at some point over the next few days. Bill listen, I think that this is one of the big fears because there's very little you can do when it gets really hot and the Middle East is extremely vulnerable to the effects of climate change. What did we find?",

And really tried to identify these spots that seem most vulnerable because they've been fortunate to avoid these monstrous record shattering heat waves like we saw in British Columbia, for example, a couple of years ago that burned down an entire town. But if you put that map back up, you'll get a sense of the regions that have medium low or high risk for these insanely abnormal heat waves. And the green as you see there is a medium risk and that includes vast swaths of the country. And actually, it has, this has the Middle East as a lower risk. But just that one big bloodshed around Afghanistan, there you see a country that's already struggling with resources. If a record shattering heatwave were to hover there for a week, what would that do to infrastructure? But sharing that same alarm is Beijing and the 250 million people who live there. And then just above that, in Siberia, over there, Eastern Siberia, not a lot of people live there. But a heat wave would have devastating consequences on unlocking all the biological methane that's locked up in permafrost. And so, everything is connected in various ways. Folks in Central America get hit one of these red patches, that means more migration up to the United States and the politics involved.",

And now it's sort of bracing for what's sort of built in, adapting to what we can as it unfolds, but certain changes are inevitable. But hopefully, knowledge is power.
