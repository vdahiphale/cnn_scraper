I'm Laura Coates and this is \"CNN Tonight.\"Our breaking news, a brand-new forecast for Hurricane Idalia, the storm rapidly intensifying as it's lashing Florida ahead of what is feared to be a catastrophic landfall on the state's west coast in just a matter of hours. Potentially deadly storm surge and hurricane conditions expected not only tonight but also tomorrow. Officials say that the surge could be a once-in-a-lifetime event. Idalia is now a Category 2 with maximum winds of 110 miles an hour. It's now forecast to become a powerful Category 4 before landfall tomorrow morning. We've got 49 Florida counties that are under states of emergency as we speak and as they are waiting to see what the next few hours will bring. We'll be covering everything as only CNN can tonight. We've got teams out across the entire storm zone. We've got Chad Myers in the CNN Weather Center, Carlos Suarez is in Tampa, Brian Todd is in St. Marks, Florida, and Gloria Pazmino is in Clearwater. I want to get right now to the brand-new forecast with Chad Myers in the Weather Center. What's happening?",

And this is the worst of the weather. It has been raining for the better part of an hour. And the wind has picked up.We expect this bad weather to go well into the night and into tomorrow where really the concern for the Tampa Bay area, really all of Hillsborough County, is going to be the storm surge associated with this hurricane, the flooding that is going to come out of this. As we head into tomorrow, the concern from emergency officials, what Chad was just outlining there a few minutes ago, at least in this part of Florida, is that we're going to see this hurricane pass us by. It's going to push all of this water into the Tampa Bay. And then you're going to see all of this rain that is going to fall over the next 6 to 12 hours. And then you need to mix into that high tide, king tide. One once those three things happen, that is when they believe we are going to see some significant flooding out here. We are talking about a storm surge anywhere between 2 to 4, even 6 feet when all is said and done. And so, emergency officials really have spent the better part of the day trying to get folks that live in these low-lying areas of Hillsborough County to go ahead and move inland. They want them to go to a hurricane shelter. They want them to get away from these low-lying areas. We know that there are two mandatory evacuation orders that have been in place for the better part of the day. One of those orders is right here in Hillsborough County, which again is home to the Tampa Bay area. The other is just to the west of me, that's in Pinellas County, that is home to St. Pete as well as Clearwater, and we're told that there have been some reports of flooding there. Again, right now, Laura, this is the worst of the weather that we have seen, though when you take a look at the radar, of course, it explains why it's happening. We have that hurricane that is now off to the west of the Tampa Bay area. Having, again, spent the better part of the day out here, we were talking to a number of folks that came out to this location and they told us, look, we don't think it's going to be as bad considering how things are right now. So, a lot of the folks that we came across told us, look, we're not going to evacuate, we're not going to go inland. That's a message that emergency officials really don't want to hear because the concern going into tonight and then tomorrow is that then we're going to start seeing this storm surge. And so, the last thing that emergency officials want are for folks to be complacent and to be out and about thinking that the worst of the storm has passed us by, which by and large will have, but the impact that we're going to see when it comes to this storm surge and all of this flooding, we're not going to see until sometime tomorrow morning into the early afternoon.

You know, a lot of people have left this area, the Big Bend area, luckily, but there are still a lot of people here, not only on the coast but inland where I'm at in Perry. It's just in the last 10 minutes when the brand new 11Winds sustain 142-miles-an-hour, gusts to 161-miles-an-hour. This is going to be a catastrophic wind event similar to Hurricane Michael, which was (INAUDIBLE) back a couple years back, back west. I chased that storm also. So, you're going to have about a 30-mile wide, approximately 30-mile wide damage path of catastrophic damage from here all the way back to Northwest of Jacksonville. It'll be a hurricane, a strong hurricane all the way into Southeast Georgia, South Carolina as it rockets northeast across this area. The main problem is going to be 15. I haven't seen the latest storm surge, but I'm anticipating a very small, narrow area immediately east of the hurricane track near Perry and back southwest here. There'll be a very small, narrow area, probably 20 feet storm surge. It was 15. When you go up in categories, this is going to get you up closer to 20. It'll be a very narrow area, maybe 5 miles wide, probably topping to 20-foot storm surge. Then that -- then that massive wind is going to be about 30 miles path going northeast. And if you look northeast of Perry on a map locally, you look at it, the towns, I'm going to name some towns, they're going to be in a direct path of extreme damage. It's going to be Dowling Park, Live Oak, Mayo, Jasper, Lake City. And you continue northeast to the northwest of Jacksonville, St. George, Fargo, Highlands. And then over in the southeast coast there, you're talking about Kirkland, north of Jacksonville, Woodbine (ph). So that areas are going to have a major damage path. But I can tell you, in the state of Florida, I've talked to state EOC operations, and I can tell you they've got an ARMADA (ph) between state EOC. We've got Coast Guard standby. We've got helicopters. They have emergency ambulances from a number of states. They are already in the state waiting to respond. We have 10 urban search and rescue pre- deployed waiting to move in as soon as the hurricane passes to go and find people. We have air boats that are going to be deployed. So, we have massive resources in the state of Florida that are waiting to rush in here and help clear the roads. And there's going to be probably tens if not hundreds of thousands of pine trees that will have virtually every road in this area -- I anticipate and based on my past experience in this area, that when you get the winds at this high, you're going to have trees all the roads in the Perry area, southeast of Tallahassee, and all the way back down to Cedar Key. We have this big forest area here along 98. This whole area will be impassable. There'll be -- every road will be impassable. I can just tell you it will be impassable shortly after sunrise. It's going to make landfall now. I'm literally 10 miles before it's going to make landfall. I'm in the right side, the dirty side of the eye. So, winds here in Perry -- unfortunately, the bad news I've got for the town of Perry, now it looks like you're going to take the brunt of the hurricane with winds of 130 to 160 with massive catastrophic storm surge coming into the Perry. It probably will pass Highway 98. Normally, it stops at Highway 98, northwest-southeast oriented, probably pass 98 and locations along this area.",

So those are going to be two record-breaking, historic, we've never had happened since we know of in the mid-1800s, late 1800s.The third category is going to be possibly the highest storm surge ever recorded in this part of Florida. So, we're going to break three records tonight. We'll see what the pressure gets down to. That could be the fourth record we're going to break tonight. So, we could break at least four records that have never been broken here in this part of the state with this hurricane. It's going to be the new benchmark bar going forward in history.

Frankly, there are people who are refusing to even evacuate. MAYOR KENNETH WELCH, ST. PETERSBURG, FLORIDA: There are. Good evening, Laura. You know, Gloria had it exactly right, we're about 25 miles south of where she is in Clearwater down here in Petersburg, Florida. And what we've told folks from the initial projection is that we need to run from the water and hide from the wide. And when we have Cat 4 hurricane now, even if it is 100 miles west of us, we still expect to get that 4 to 6 feet of storm surge. That will be devastating. What we try to tell folks and part of the issue in Florida is we have so many new people to Florida that haven't dealt with the hurricane before. You know, just look at our neighbors down in the Fort Myers, Santa Bell area who less than a year ago had almost a similar situation where the hurricane was not projected to hit them straight on, but at the last minute made a turn, and they will be recovering there for decade, at least. And so, it is powerful folks need to respect it. And we've asked folks that are in our evacuation zone A to evacuate and move to higher ground. In our city, you don't have to go 100 miles away.

Officials are warning of a life-threatening storm surge of up to 15 feet in some areas.So, just how dangerous, Tom Foreman, will this surge be and which areas will be hit the hardest? Joining me now is CNN's Tom Foreman. He's at the magic wall to explain it all. So, tell me about this storm surge. Take a step back with me. How does this work? TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Storm surge is always what it's primarily about in hurricanes. People look at the wind, the wind is dramatic. You can get hurt, it can do damage. Storm surge is why they're saying, if you're in a directly hit area, it could be non- survivable in this case. A storm like nothing they've seen since the 1800s with blocked roads, home destruction, massive power outages. So, how does a storm surge work? Think about the big swirling storm we talk about all the time. Every place that it's contacting the water, it's pushing water in front of it. So, if you're out in deep water out here, it pushes the water in the big circular motion. Well, so what? Because it's deep enough, it just keeps swirling down the water, it doesn't matter. But when it gets into more shallow area, it runs out of space and the waters is being pushed on the parts going toward land, can't go down anymore, and it starts going inward. And the result is then you have this surge of water that starts pushing in, the longer and shallower the run up is, and it's very long and very shallow in this area. There's not a big steep drop off out here. It's very long and very shallow. The more time it has to compress, gain energy and come in. That's why we're talking about the storm surge being so bad in this area.",

Maybe higher than 10 to 15 feet.Important thing to remember, though, this area up in here, ecologically, very important, very important to the people who live there but not that many people living here. Many more people living down here. So, you may only have 6 feet of flooding down here. Huge, huge, huge impact, yes, for the small communities hit up here. It could be absolutely catastrophic.

I think the response, the initial rescues, will be led by Florida.I think FEMA, as you saw -- Administrator Criswell was talking about, a lot of the immediate needs in the aftermath of the storm of helping the survivors get assistance, find places to stay, and do that kind of work. FEMA did move search and rescue teams in. They're joined up with the state.
