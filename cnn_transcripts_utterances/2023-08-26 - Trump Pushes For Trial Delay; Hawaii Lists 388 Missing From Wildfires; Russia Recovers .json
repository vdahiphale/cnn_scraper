But two of his codefendants are pushing for a speedy trial.Sidney Powell is the latest to make such a request along with Ken Chesebro. Their trials could start as early as October and that isn't clear how it could impact Trump and the others. Meantime, codefendant Cathleen Latham says in a Friday court filing, she served as a fake elector, quote, \"at the direction of the President of the United States.\" She's also the latest to try to get their case moved to federal court. Now that will be the subject of a hearing on Monday with codefendant Mark Meadows, who served as Trump's chief of staff. Also on Monday, we could learn the trial date for Trump's federal election subversion case at a hearing presided over by Judge Tanya Chutkan. Special counsel Jack Smith has asked for a January 2 date. Trump wants it to begin more than two years later in April of 2026. A closer look now at where the Georgia case stands.

There was advanced wood decay over time, that they did not have a policy or decide to shut down the power lines, deenergize them, when there was a high wind watch and red flag warning. Specifically, to that issue, the president and CEO of Hawaii Electric said about a week after the fires that this was actually a controversial practice, even though it is done in places like California, Nevada, Oregon as a way of preventing wildfires. The electric company spokesperson told CNN that their priority is to support the people and county of Maui and they're disappointed that the county took this litigious route. Separately, \"The Washington Post\" is reporting that the utility removed damaged poles, downed lines and other equipment from where the Lahaina fires reportedly started, which prevented investigators from being able to view the scene undisturbed. That's according to \"The Post's\" investigation into court documents, letters and records; CNN is still trying to independently confirm that. But \"The Post\" does report that those actions violated national guidelines on how utilities should handle and preserve evidence after a wildfire and deprives investigators of that opportunity to view any downed poles or lines in that undisturbed condition. To that, a spokesperson told \"The Post\" they are in regular communication with the ATF and local authorities and are cooperating to provide them, as well as attorneys representing people affected by the wildfires, with inventories and access to the removed equipment, which they have carefully photographed, documented and stored. Of course now we know that the unaccounted list is down to just more than 300 people of verified names. The FBI brought that list down from more than 1,000. This is a very difficult moment, the Maui police chief said, because those names, they know, are going to create a lot of pain for their loved ones, seeing them on that list.

I will show you what the calendar is now as it stands. These dates are subject to change. But October 23rd, 2023, is the proposed trial date for Georgia. Then you look at January, the 2nd is the potential trial for the 2020 election charges; the 15th is both the Iowa caucus and potentially the E. Jean Carroll civil trial. March 5th, Super Tuesday; the 25th, Stormy Daniels hush money trial. This gives you an idea why exactly they are having these kinds of conversations. When they talk about this, one thing they hope for is making this a media spectacle and capitalizing on it. That's something former president Trump is good at doing. They were happy with how the coverage went on Thursday. They felt they dominated the airwaves and sucked the life out of many of the other candidates, even though they were having their republican primary debate the day before. They talked about how former president Trump's good on capitalizing on when he has media attention, showing the fact that yesterday that he was going on Twitter, putting out his mug shot, for the first time since January of 2021. This is something people were speculating about. He is continuing to grasp onto the media narrative. They hope he can do that during these trials, Even though they say that it might help them politically, I have talked to a number of Trump's allies and Republican operatives, who say they believe this endless media coverage, no matter how Trump spins it, is just going to be exhausting for voters.

The Paris 2024 Olympics, believe it or not, now less than a year away.The top 30 golfers in the PGA tour are in Atlanta, competing in the tour championship. Golf's top prize, an $18 million check, is going to go to the winner. Collin Morikawa going 6 under in round 2. That coming after he had the round of his life, a 61 on Thursday. So Morikawa breaking Tiger Woods' record for the lowest two-round score at the tour championship. He's tied with Viktor Hovland at the top of the leaderboard. Scottie Scheffler is two shots off the lead. Rory McIlroy is lurking there, six shots back. It's going to be another super hot day again in Atlanta. So we'll see who can once again play well in the heat. Finally, Bronny James, the son of LeBron James, is expected to make a full recovery after suffering cardiac arrest on the basketball court. The 18-year old was taken to the hospital last month after collapsing during a team workout at USC. A spokesperson for the family confirmed the cause in a statement on Friday, saying it is an anatomically and functionally significant congenital heart defect that can and will be treated. We are confident in his full recovery and return to basketball in the very near future. So that was the question. Would it be something they would be able to identify as the cause and treat it so he could continue playing basketball? And that's the great news. It turned out to be the case.",
