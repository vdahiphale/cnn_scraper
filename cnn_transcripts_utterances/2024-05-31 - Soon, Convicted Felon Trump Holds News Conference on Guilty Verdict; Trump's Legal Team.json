This morning, for the first time, the country is waking up with a former president who is a convicted felon.

As for what that means, we are all now living it moment by moment.This morning, we get fresh reaction from Donald Trump. He holds a news conference. We also have new reaction from the Biden campaign as they assess how to handle this new reality, including reaction, perhaps, from President Biden himself. Donald Trump faces sentencing on July 11th. That is just days before the Republican convention. He could get up to four years in prison, though. He could face no jail time. And, of course, Trump will appeal this verdict. Let's get right to the courthouse. CNN's Brynn Gingras standing by, you were there the whole trial. You are now there after the trial. Give us the latest.",

The same goes for The New York Times, guilty, convicted on all 34 counts, and for the New York Post, not surprisingly, injustice, first felon president after political hit job.Of course, this is what Americans, at least in New York, are waking up to on their doorsteps this morning, the first, as you said, former U.S. president convicted of a felony. Now, what's next, the sentencing. As you said, John, that is on July 11th at 10:00 A.M. Judge Juan Merchan is the one who will decide that sentencing. Now, there's a few factors that actually will go into his decision- making. One of those is any character references that the former president's family members might submit in writing, a recommendation from a probation officer, also the fact that the former president has no criminal history and these crimes were not a violent crime. So, that's going to go all into the decision making. But what's at stake, former President Trump can either receive probation or he can receive up to four years in prison for each of those 34 counts for a maximum of 20 years in prison. Obviously, that's pretty unlikely, but certainly that is on the scale of Judge Juan Merchan's -- you know, his scale of what he can decide. This morning, we are also hearing reaction from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, the first person to bring an indictment against a former president, and, of course, Trump's defense team. Let's take a listen to what they have to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TODD BLANCHE, DONALD TRUMP'S DEFENSE ATTORNEY:  We were indicted for conduct that happened in 2015, '16, '17. In a jurisdiction that, that, that it was very hard for us to get a fair trial. I think it's naive to say that this is like any other case. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Sources around him said that he was feeling in somewhat better spirits as those allies and donors aimed to convince him that this would help him both politically and financially. We have not seen any of those fundraising numbers yet, but we have asked. The big question, though, is that we are in uncharted territory. Despite what his senior advisors say, despite what they believe and despite what has happened with his various legal issues, which have boosted him both financially and in the polls, it is very unclear to everyone how this is going to impact voters going to the ballot box in November.",

And the judge said, well, that's my job, right? Well, at times in federal court, they allow campaign finance expert that are specialized in that area to testify. It happened in federal court in Philadelphia in what was called the Farnese case, where a state senator was indicted. They had someone who was an expert lawyer that came in and testified on that case. There is precedent for that. They didn't do that here.And all they did was instruct the jury on the particular elements of the campaign finance issue on a case that was never prosecuted by the federal prosecutors. So, they're saying they violated federal law. It was never prosecuted goes back to the due process piece and whether they should have been allowed to have someone testify in that case.",

He didn't have to say anything about that. By doing that, you open the door to Stormy Daniels.

I always hate to armchair quarterback, and I know everybody's still trying to digest the verdict, you know, especially on the defense team, I'm sure. But I do think maybe a more cohesive story, a lot of talking to a jury is just telling a story. Are you able to tell it in a way that sort of sets the bait, sets the hook, and then keeps them interested and with you through the trial? And I think there was a little meandering back and forth that went on. I think they got into some information that was not necessary.I mean, I think a lot of the questions that might have been effective at some point just to stand up. So, I don't have any questions. This person knows nothing about whether or not he falsified any documents. Who cares if he wore boxers or condom? That just doesn't matter.
