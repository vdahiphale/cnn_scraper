I'm Abby Phillip. He was a young father starting a new life in a new city. And now, 29 year old Tyre Nichols is gone. His life tragically cut short in a case of police violence that even for some veterans have described is unlike anything they have ever seen. The footage is shocking and harrowing. More than an hour of several recordings released by police showing how -- what was supposed to be a traffic stop became a brutal beating. We will not show you that video this morning. But what it does show is this. Officers dragging Nichols from the car within seconds of the stop, assaulting him and physically and verbally beating him. Nichols attempted to comply with their conflicting demands, pleading with officers. I'm just trying to get home. The swift action that was taken against those officers by Memphis police chief, Cerelyn Davis, has been praised by many, including Tyre Nichols' family attorney, Ben Crump. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

This is a department that is majority Black officers with a Black woman reformer police chief that has instituted a ban on no-knock warrants, a duty to intervene if officers are harming each other, de-escalation policies, a smorgasbord of every reform anyone could ever want. And here, we have watched on the body cameras as the officers have done this. And so, it does speak to the limitations of the types of reforms we see often and often. I mean, right now, one of the big pushes from attorney Ben Crump and others is to renew efforts around the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which I think contains a lot of important steps. It's also worth noting there is nothing that act that would have prevented George Floyd from being killed, much less Tyre Nichols from being killed.

This is part of his push into midterms 100,000 more cops over the next five years. You look at the COVID relief money, a chunk of that went towards reforming police departments. You know, President Biden's viewpoint is largely been that more cops on the street makes community safer.

You've had President Biden really trying to step away from the kind of activists pushes to defund police and the like.But I think you see the reasons why those activists and clarity around things like systemic reform for policing because the typical kind of mainstream Democratic responses to police brutality, things like diversifying police forces. This incident speaks to the shortcomings of those reforms. And so, it is a question, the onus is on the Democratic Party to speak to the deep rooted nature of this issue and policing. And to respond to the kind of communities who are calling for what justice looks like. There's no universal meaning of that. I remember being in the line at George Floyd's memorial in Houston in 2020. And even in that time, when you talk to people who are universally condemning those actions, universally sympathetic, emphatic with what happened, they are not saying -- they are not saying that means we must have less cops in the street. Americans are divided on what the solution here is, but they are united that there is a deep-rooted problem.",

I don't think anybody doubts adult Trump's pretty angry man. I think what the question is whether he is fully engaged with a task running for president. The answer is that he obviously is not. And also, whether he has something to say that's really relevant at this moment, right, that can really connect with first Republican primary electorate and then much more importantly, the broad American public. When you hear him talking about so unfair how he's getting investigated in New York, how the wind turbines kill birds. I don't think he did when turbines cause cancer at this event. But I'm sure we'll hear that when again. He just sounds like a guy from a different time, right, a guy who sort of trying to do the 2016 thing, but in a smaller scale and with less sort of organic enthusiasm around it. And what I will say just in the vein of putting an asterisk on everything I just said is, I covered his campaign launched back in 2015.

And so, he wants to set the terms of the bag for Haley and DeSantis and start making sure that it's all playing out on his terms. I'm not sure that will be the case, but that is clearly his hope. What is also different -- I think we can't -- he is a twice impeached former president who is facing a ton of legal peril right now in multiple investigations.

I am a skeptical now too. But the one thing that keeps me still pausing is that nobody else has entered the field yet. There was a lot of enthusiasm ahead of the midterms when I was talking to voters for Ron DeSantis. People thought he could legislate. That he had a lot of Trump ideas but he could sort of speak to them in a more eloquent way. Ron DeSantis has not officially entered. Other people are still waiting in the wings. So, at least for now, I mean, there does seem to be this hesitation within the Republican Party to see where he goes. HERNDON:  There is absolutely hesitation on those other challengers, and on comfort even with the reality of it, I mean, it's Trump, that he still not an easy person to run against. But I think another thing has really stuck out for me about this version of the Trump campaign because there has been a real energy on the grassroots, Republican side, over the speaker fight, and over replacing Ronna McDaniels as RNC chair. And Donald Trump was on the wrong side of both of those things. He is not only from the perspective of the Republican grassroots. So, not only are we talking about a candidate who is rehashing kind of old fights but in the way that the movement he has inspired has transitioned, particularly since the midterms I was seen as universally disappointing, he is not speaking that same language right now. And so, you not only have a Donald Trump disconnect with what we know with the kind of Republican establishment figures to blame him for those midterms candidates elections. You also have a disconnect between Donald Trump and the Republican grassroots right now which is currently organized -- which currently has been motivated by things where he was on these complete opposite side.",

And so it was a kind of convolution of interests that led to the challenge against McDaniel, but because this is a group that is not really a grassroots focus group, they backed her in the face of that challenge. But there was universal fear at that event, that that was going to lead to kind of an outsider backlash.

It's an opportunity to keep Ronna McDaniel on the straight and narrow, perhaps.
