And these are all related to funds that were acquired during the 2020 and 2022 campaigns. In one instance he defrauded political supporters. He took thousands of dollars that he said was going to his campaign and really but he was just putting it in his pockets. He was using it to buy lavish things for himself, designer clothing, a car. In another instance, he had a job. He was earning over $100,000 a year but he was still filing for unemployment. He earned about $24,000 during that period. And finally, there was another instance where they have him with lying about the disclosure forms that he made to the House where in some instances he's overstating how much he's earning and in others he's understating.

A source telling me that yesterday they had more than 10,000 encounters. They also have over 20,000 migrants in custody straining capacity and resources along the U.S. southern border, and that has prompted senior administration officials to put in place unprecedented measures to try to manage the flow.So what does that look like? A new asylum rule that would largely bar migrants who have transited through other countries from seeking asylum in the United States if they did not first seek refuge in one of those countries. That, by the way, has echoes of a Trump policy, according to advocates and lawmakers. Then two, they plan to push back certain non-Mexican nationals to Mexico if they do not qualify for asylum. But of course, beyond policies, this is also simply a logistical challenge. And so administration officials have told reporters that they are going to set up two CBP facilities as well as send troops along the border to provide additional resources. But, Sara, even with all these preparations in place, President Biden himself has said it remains to be seen how effective they are and it should not be overlooked that these policies can really reshape asylum policy and the way that the U.S.-Mexico border is managed and all of that will come to a head in just the next 48 hours.

Jean Carroll. Under the law, the difference between finding that he raped her versus that he sexually abused her has to do with the nuance and the definition of the type of non-consensual sexual contact.
