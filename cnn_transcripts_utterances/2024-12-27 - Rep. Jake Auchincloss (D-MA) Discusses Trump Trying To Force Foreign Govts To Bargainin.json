I mean, the president- elect can tell his party, I don't want to do this, and they're not going to do it.Breaking things is not hard in Washington, D.C. Building things is hard in Washington, D.C. And what did they do? They broke something, a bipartisan deal that would have saved $5 billion for taxpayers on drug prices and lowered co-pays at the pharmacy counter. And what did they build? They didn't build anything. So I'm pretty unimpressed with the ability of this incoming administration to actually work it's will through its own party. And until I see otherwise, I don't think that Vivek and Elon are actually the center of the policymaking universe right now. I'm looking at the next speaker of the House.

What this means is now the case will be remanded, will be sent to the Kings County Supreme Court. And the suspect is going to be arraigned on the charges on January 7th. So the indictment will be unsealed then. But we know many of the details of the alleged crime from our reporting in the -- in the past couple of days. We know that he is accused of setting fire to a woman who was asleep inside of a subway train. Law enforcement officials believe that the woman was likely homeless and taking refuge inside the subway train. Take a listen to the district attorney talking about his prosecution of the case.

So there's the particular type of soil and the land that's there. But you also have -- I mean, you can't deny the fact that sea levels are rising.

I don't think really anybody needs to be worried. Because, again, the buildings understand the subsidence is going to happen. It just is on this type of limestone and sand. It's just the lifespan of the building is going to be shorter. And luckily, it's -- you know, it sounds quickly over years, but we, as structural engineers and the structural community, can step in before we see these strains take any kind of sudden movement. This is not -- this is not a brittle failure where you're going to - like a -- like a sinkhole where you're going to sink into it all of a sudden. It's gradual. We're monitoring it.

So what we've seen over the last sort of half year is a really exponential increase in drone attacks involving Shahed, those Iranian designed drones, and similar types of drones on Ukrainian cities, civilian areas.They went from a sort of monthly average of around 400 between May and July this year to 2m400 in November. And we've seen a high level continuing into December, including, of course, that attack on Christmas morning involving 100 drones. So look, we know why they're doing this. This is a war of attrition. They're trying to wear down Ukrainian air defenses, trying to wear down the resolve of Ukrainian civilians. But what we've been looking at is how they're doing this. Russia is facing crippling labor shortages. So bringing people into factories like this is a major challenge. We've seen social media recruitment targeting teenagers at an affiliated Polytechnic University. We've seen that they've been using African women as well. These satellite images have also shown serious levels of expansion. Construction of two new buildings in the last nine months. And in terms of sanctions as well, because this facility has been sanctioned now by the U.S., the E.U. and the U.K. How are they getting around that? Well, we are seeing increasing involvement from China. CNN sources with the Ukrainian Defense Intelligence say that that involvement is ramping up, including a Chinese prototype now being allegedly used for a new type of decoy drone. So there's a lot going on there that we've been tracking. And we think the expansion is continuing.",
