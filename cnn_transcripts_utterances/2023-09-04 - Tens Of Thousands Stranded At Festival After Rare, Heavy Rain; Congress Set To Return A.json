But what in the world led up to this? Well, we got to look to the 3D explainer here for a little bit more of an in depth explanation.So what you're looking at is the difference between our typical earthy soil that you and I are used to, something we would plant our vegetable gardens in. We call that loam. Now compare that to the other side of your T.V. screen. That is clay that's surrounding this playa where Camila was currently located. Well, unfortunately, when we get this incessant rainfall, when we have that earthy topsoil in loam that we're accustomed to, it gets absorbed very easily. But in the desert, over portions of the western U.S. and the playas where Camila is located and where Black Rock City is located, unfortunately, that water just puddles up and it eventually mixes with that clay surface and it creates that almost a muddy cement like mixture that inevitably stuck the tens of thousands of people, which you can see here from this aerial visual. Just incredible to see some of the trucks left behind by the RVs and some of the vehicles. Look at that gentleman. He's not getting anywhere anytime soon, right? That car is stuck. And that was the concern. They said, well, hey, what if more rain fell within this area after what already took place this weekend because unfortunately, that would lead to more problems and people running out of potential supplies, right, food, water, fuel, that type of thing. But the rain, when it did come through, it came down in sheets and it brought about two to three months worth of rain in a 24 hours period. But the rain is coming to an end very quickly. You saw Camila's live shot, the sun comes out. We do expect that water to evaporate rather quickly and that will change the structure of that clay substance into more of a harder surface so the vehicles can start to exit safely, hopefully, hopefully getting that all clear to open things up. But, yes, you know, I just love seeing the positive attitude that people have here in the playa, which you can see on space just north of Empire, Black Rock City right here, about 70,000 people descending on that area on annual basis just happened to coincide with this rainstorm typically dry months in the month of August and September here, but not this year, right?

      "sentences": "Well, Congress is nowhere near completing their work on their long term funding bills, so a short term patch is going to be needed. But, Rahel, even that is proving to be complicated. They have still not decided what, if anything is going to be attached to that short term funding bill.The White House has requested $40 billion for both disaster relief and for Ukraine funding. But it's not yet clear whether Republicans are going to be OK with linking those two issues together, because conservatives in the House want to see that disaster aid separated from Ukraine funding. They do not support Ukraine funding. And that is just one of several demands that conservatives are already laying out in this funding fight. They also said they want to see the House start a Biden impeachment inquiry. They also want to boost border security as part of this CR, this short term funding bill. And they also want to see parts of the Department of Justice defunded. All of those, very unlikely to happen, but it shows you the type of challenge that Speaker Kevin McCarthy is facing. And I think Republican Mike Simpson, he serves one of these key spending panels, really summed it up perfectly.\\ He told me if he, as in McCarthy, works with the Democrats. Obviously the Democrats are not going to do it for free. So it's going to be a compromise. Then you're going to find a resolution introduced on the floor to vacate the chair. That is a reference to a procedural tool that would allow any single member to force a vote on ousting the sitting speaker. Conservatives have threatened it in the past. They are threatening to do so again if they don't get their way on spending. McCarthy is trying to avoid that, of course. He held a conference call with his colleagues last week. And sources told me and my colleague, Manu Raju, that McCarthy argued that they should save these funding fights for later in the year when they actually do their long term spending bills. So we'll see if that's enough to convince conservatives to back off of their demands. But time is ticking, and right now there is no obvious solution in sight. Rahel?",

He talked in front of a group of union leaders at a Labor Day event in Philadelphia. And it happened just as a new \"Wall Street Journal\" poll is out this morning with a stark warning as he seeks reelection.A majority of voters, 58 percent said they believe the economy is worse since Biden took office, 51 percent of voters see Donald Trump as having a record of accomplishment as president, according to 40 percent who said the same about Biden. Trump's also up by a 10 point margin when it comes to who voters think is mentally up to the presidency, 46 percent said that Trump is mentally fit to serve versus 36 percent who said the same of Biden. Joining us now was former U.S. Congressman and one-time Democratic presidential candidate in 2020, Tim Ryan. Congressman, great to see you. Those are some pretty bleak numbers if you're a Democrat who wants to see Joe Biden get reelected. How do you explain them? TIM RYAN (R-OH), FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE: Well, I think people really aren't paying attention, honestly. And I think there is still a lot of anxiety in the economy, inflation, gas prices, food. That's real. But the reality is, you know, President Biden, regardless of how you feel about him, John, he has reindustrialized the United States of America. You take the CHIPS Act, where we're insourcing chip manufacturing right here in Columbus, Ohio. It's going to be tens of billions of dollars invested and the average job is going to pay about $150,000 a year because we're going to start making chips here and not in Asia. You look at the infrastructure bill, you look at the Inflation Reduction Act. We're building factories here to build electric vehicles, batteries, charging stations. Things are happening. And that's what the campaign has to be about, getting that message out. BERMAN: And President Biden was talking about all that today.
