According to NYPD at least, that's working. Spoke to FBI, their cyber people are monitoring this. But they don't know that there's anything nefarious going on. It's just something they would monitor because, as we heard the FBI director testify, just a couple of weeks ago, along with General Nakasone from the NSA, you know, foreign governments have literally spent years incrementally trying to get further and further into critical infrastructure.

Now, if President Biden decides to go through with the executive action, he's likely to face intense backlash from immigration advocates and progressive Democrats.Immigration, of course, has been a huge liability for Biden with an unprecedented surge of migrants overwhelming the border. A new poll this week underscores the political risks here, only 26 percent of Americans approve of the president's handling of immigration. oining us now to discuss this and much more is South Carolina Congressman James Clyburn, he is the national co-chair for the Biden 2024 Campaign. Congressman, we always appreciate your time. I'm interested when you look at both the collapse of the bipartisan immigration talks, driven largely by former President Trump and the Biden administration's decision to start considering something that Trump did while in office. Are you concerned that the pledge for a humane immigration system is giving way to kind of political necessity here? REP. JAMES CLYBURN (D-SC): Well, thank you very much for having me. Yes, I am concerned about politicizing this issue. This issue has been around long, long, long time. I remember way back before I came to Congress during the Reagan years, we had this problem. When I first came to Congress, I worked with Xavier Becerra, who's now in the candidate, and we had an issue that we thought would resolve all of this, we sat there on the House side, waiting on the Senate to send us the legislation. At the last minute, Republicans stepped in, withdrew their support and they collapsed. We went to the same survey just a few weeks ago, we thought we had a very good bipartisan deal. House waiting on the Senate. Senate gets to where it needs to be. And then the House Republicans decided to politicize the issue. So, they have been wanting, the Republicans wanted to keep this immigration issue as a political issue, rather than try to solve the problem. I would hope that President Biden will go forward with his executive order. And I would hope that the executive order will stay within the four corners of this agreement that was reached on the Senate side, because I think there is extensive support in the House on what the Senate came to. So, let's hope that we can do a better thing, a deal going forward.",

The gridlock in Congress over military aid is showing up at the front and time is not their friend. We reached Sergeant Mykola (ph), who's also serving now on the Zaporizhzhia region frontline. AMANPOUR (on camera):  Do you have enough weapons? Do you have enough people? Do you have enough ammunition? (SERGEANT MYKOLA speaking in foreign language.) AMANPOUR (voice over):  \"Of course, we don't,\" he says. \"There is a catastrophic shortage of people, the same with weapons. There aren't enough shells for artillery and tanks or the tanks and artillery themselves.\" On a brief hiatus in the rear, they've had to buy their own mortar, small caliber just for self-defense, problem is no ammunition. Anastasia practices perfecting her balance, her endurance, regaining the strength to shoulder her weapons and she wants to go back to the front. (ANASTASIA SAVKA speaking in foreign language.) AMANPOUR (voice over):  \"I think anything is possible,\" she says. \"But whatever happens, we all need to fight this together because the enemy is advancing.\" No one wants their children to still be fighting the war they and their parents have been fighting ever since Putin's first invasion a decade ago. (END VIDEOTAPE) AMANPOUR (on camera):  Anastasia also told me that we cannot advance against the Russians carrying just assault rifles. And others have said that they have had to decide these days, how to ration the ammunition that they have. In other words, they can't just keep, you know pounding their enemy. They absolutely have to leave that to the last minute and the height of danger, and then choose how many shells they can actually afford to spend at any one time. It is that dire on the front.",

President Biden was at a fundraiser in San Francisco last night, he made very clear his frustration about that ongoing Washington debate, but he also called out Vladimir Putin directly and called him a \"crazy SOB.\" I was interested in your take on that.",
