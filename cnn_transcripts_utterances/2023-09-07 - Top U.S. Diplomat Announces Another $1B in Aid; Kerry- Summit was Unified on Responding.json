And onboard for another jam packed show this Thursday,just ahead this hour climate crusader the U.S. Climate Envoy John Kerry joins us to discuss the cost of extreme weather what was accomplished at this week's African Climate Summit in Kenya and how to stimulate more green energy investment. Especially of course in the aftermath of America's groundbreaking $1 trillion plus climate deal the badly named let's call it that Inflation Reduction Act. Also, the latest on the loss and damage fund agreed at COP 27 last year. When it's the money coming, plenty to discuss and just to illustrate the climate change challenges a new hurricane rapidly gaining strength in the Atlantic forecasters fear hurricane Lee could intensify into an unprecedented cat five storm fueled by warming ocean waters its threat to land still uncertain. And the climate on global markets, while that's still cautious the NASDAQ looks set to fall for a fourth straight session. Amid fresh concerns about the Fed's interest rate path new numbers showing strong growth for the U.S. services sector. Prices there still not easing significantly and investors for their part now see a 50/50 so 50 percent chance of another Fed rate hike by November. As you can see over in Europe too, a touch softer but perhaps some rate relief coming in for the United Kingdom after the Bank of England Chief suggested interest rate hikes could be nearing an end. As you can see there the pound under a little bit of pressure there versus the U.S. dollar on that news all this plus a new batch of weak Chinese data imports and exports both falling sharply again in the month of August. The numbers are as not as bad as investors and markets feared but Chinese stocks did finish the day more than 1 percent lower as you can see there, plenty to get to as always, we do begin the show once again in Ukraine. America's top diplomat is on his second day of his latest Ukraine visit earlier at the state border guard facility on the outskirts of Kyiv Secretary of State to Antony Blinken was shown U.S. donated surveillance drones before he visited a demining center. Blinken says Washington agrees with Kyiv, that Ukraine's forces have made real progress in recent weeks. Melissa Bell is live in Kyiv for us on this. Melissa and the silver lining to the ongoing strikes that we see is further financial support and aid coming from the United States and announced at this trip, on this trip.",

It comes after Huawei unveiled this new Smartphone powered by an advanced chip that's believed to have been made by the Chipmaker Huawei has been on the U.S. blacklist since 2019 over national security concerns. Anna Stewart joins us now. Anna stunned by some of the details on this. And actually, it's not just the chip in this Huawei phone, I mean, the power amps, the switches, the filters, I think everybody's scrambling to understand just how these were pulled together and circumvented sanctions, potentially too?",

Looking at that chip, though, that's in that phone, the one made by SMIC are believed to be it's so high tech, no one believed that a Chinese chip maker could make that. And it raises this big question, whether sanctions from the U.S. and other Western nations against high tech technology, whether it's the chips or the chip making machines is it really working. And overall, the concern is really not about who can make the best Smartphone. Really, it's about all the other things that the chip like this is used for it are the linchpin for so many technologies. And the big one, the big concern, of course, is weaponry and artificial intelligence. And there will be a huge concern in the U.S. and many Western nations I would have thought that China could potentially develop this sort of technology end to end within China. How will the international community be able to police restrict or be aware of what's being developed if that is the case? So lots of U.S. lawmakers speaking out about this. One, the Chair of the House of Representatives Committee on China yesterday, saying they should ban all exports to Huawei at this stage high tech or not, and to SMIC.

This is an example of achieving technological independence. And on social media, you're right, there are some interesting memes floating around. I'll show you one of them, and essentially crown the U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo as being the unofficial brand ambassador for this new Huawei phone, the Mate 60 Series because without the severe restrictions, without the sanctions the argument is China wouldn't have bothered to develop this technology on their own to be able to create this phone. One thing is for sure, this is a Smartphone launch like no other. I mean, you don't see this sort of a reaction do you at Mobile World Congress -- ?",

Now as far as the economy is concerned, nearly 60 percent of people who responded think the President's actions are making things worse. And the gap between President Biden and potential Republican candidates is very narrow. If it came to a race between Biden and Former Vice President Mike Pence, the poll says Pence leans 46 to 44 percent that's within the margin of error, of course. Here is what Pence had to say about the poll just moments ago on CNN. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MIKE PENCE, FORMER U.S. VICE PRESIDENT: Joe Biden has weakened this country at home and abroad, the American people are done with the failed policies of President Joe Biden. And now I think Republican primary voters and frankly, many independents and many Democrats around the country are looking for that leader and looking for that agenda that will really restore our economy and ensure our national security and generations to come.

And I'm pleased to say joining us now is Special Envoy John Kerry, Secretary Kerry always fantastic, sir, to have you on the show. Some of those issues, pretty thorny, what concrete can be achieved and where does this lead is now heading to COP28? JOHN KERRY, U.S. SPECIAL PRESIDENTIAL ENVOY FOR CLIMATE: Well, I'm very excited about what's happening economically, globally with respect to the climate crisis right now. We just had a major meeting in Africa President Ruto of Kenya convened nations from all over Africa and elsewhere. And there was unanimity about the urgency of responding to the climate crisis. But also there was unanimity about the positive aspects of that for our economies. There are just unbelievable number of jobs and the new technologies that are going to help us have a clean economy, a clean, well clean world in effect, by using renewable alternative, clean energy. And that includes nuclear energy, which I've just been working on here in Romania, where President Iohannis of Romania has gathered 15 nations of Eastern Europe and Central Europe, all of whom are focused on economic development on the future of responding to the crisis by growing jobs in new technologies that will be clean and not add to the problem.",

I think around the world, I don't think begging was actually the wrong word to use in the context that you did. But some of the losers are pushing back. And I think we see that here in America in the recent auto worker union negotiations, where they're saying, look, you're pushing money and incentives towards things like electric vehicles. What about legacy businesses? How do you find the balance? And what's the message to those in the fossil fuel industry and those that are in sort of legacy auto businesses and saying, look, we're sort of pushing money away from you, or interest away from you.

Apple losing at 3.5 percent Wednesday as well amid reports that the Chinese government will ban the use of iPhone for government officials Apple stock tends to do well before new iPad product launches, but perhaps not this year.

G20 members, Saudi Arabia and Russia this week announcing they will keep voluntary production cuts in place through the end of the year. That news helping push oil prices substantially higher, with Brent crude rising for a seventh straight session on Wednesday. Look at that rise though since June both Brent and U.S. crude softer today but still trading in a nine month highs, tighter supplies and continued strong demand could keep gas prices elevated this fall to a key political concern for President Biden as the 2024 vote nears.

Meanwhile, India's oil officials are saying their country's imports of discounted Russian crude are a \"win-win\" for the world's economy, freeing up supplies for the rest of the world despite the moral implications of helping Russia fund its Ukraine war. Russia remains China's top crude supplier too, but a slowing Chinese economy continues to pressure demand, at least to some degree there. And it depends on the product you're talking about. Amrita Sen joins us now from Singapore. She's the Co-founder and Director of Research at Energy Aspects. And she's just returned from a trip to China where she got a first-hand look at the energy demand situation in that country. Amrita, we're great to have you so you're going to shed some light. Two things going on, I think on a very basic level demand is greater than we expected. The U.S., Europe for the most part avoided recession. And then you've got restricted supply from the OPEC members Saudi and Russia too and that's the dominating force. AMRITA SEN, CO-FOUNDER AND DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH AT ENERGY ASPECTS: Yes, I think you've summarized it exactly right. Demand has surprised to the upside. I'd actually even say China, regardless of the macro fears oil demand growth has been extremely strong about 1.8 million barrels per day, year on year. And crude imports are coming in at record highs August numbers out today 12.7 million barrels per day. So there is no sign of a slowing, \"Chinese economy on oil demand\".

So that gives them a lot more confidence, ultimately, for Saudi Arabia, their revenue maximizes, right? What you can see now the price has gone up a lot more. Yes, they are curtailing exports, but net, they're still earning, we calculated 30 to $40 million per day more than each one of this year, right, because prices have gone up so much.
