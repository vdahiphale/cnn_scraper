I was walking down this road suddenly. Bang! It was up. These houses on the other side of the road. If you pan over here, these have been burning for some time now.You mentioned evacuations, Anderson. About 30,000 people have evacuated. Hundreds of firefighters, now, in trying to save those people's homes. This place obviously a goner. But what they're trying to do elsewhere is they're trying to soak down these beautiful big hedges that they have in this neighborhood, because that is just fuel. The issue, this wind, Anderson, you can see it whipping that smoke. And you see those embers, those are a big problem because those embers are going to fly on that wind. And they can land and they can set a spot fire somewhere else. They can hit another house. So it's that wind, and that wind is nowhere near its peak yet. We've had big gusts for sure, but the wind is going to peak early, just before dawn tomorrow morning. So, there is a terrible night ahead for these firefighters and a terrible night ahead for the thousands of people who have evacuated and have no idea what they're going to come back to, if anything. You know, a lot of people -- the roads around here are very narrow. It's a little hilly, very affluent community. So evacuating people on these roads was a massive problem. There were just traffic jams. People abandoned their cars, walked with their luggage, and then the Fire Department, of course, had to get their firefighting equipment in. So they use bulldozers just to clear those cars out of the way so they can get in to try to fight this fire. So as I say, Anderson, it's going to be early hours of the morning when we see the worst of this wind. And the other problem, this vegetation. We haven't had significant rain out here in LA since the spring. So there is so much dry vegetation and that that's just fuel -- Anderson.",

I mean, it is just disintegrating in front of our eyes. Chris, if you come here, you can just see, you know, as I say, Anderson, 20 minutes ago, half an hour ago, this place was fine. And now look at it. And this is just what we are going to continue to see throughout the night. They are trying to contain this fire, but, you know, the wind started picking up. I was down on the beach eight o'clock this morning. The wind started, you know, picking up a little, by 10:30 this fire had lit and we knew this was coming. In California, you know, when a Santa Ana event like this comes, you know that there are going to be fires. So Fire Departments had pre-positioned their resources to try and deal with this. But, you know, between 10:30 and now, we're now up over 1,200 acres just in the space of this very, very dark day. As I say, it is hard to believe that there is any sun up there right now.

Panama is a relatively new focus of his, as Kaitlan said, Greenland, not only has he been talking about it for some time, but a lot of people have been talking about it for some time.This idea of acquiring Greenland for strategic purposes has happened, you know, for decades and a close friend of Trump's suggested it to him in his first term, Ron Lauder. It's never totally gone away. But Trump is clearly in an expansionist mindset. He also keeps talking about Canada as a 51st state, that is clearly much more of a troll than sort of a dominance play. But in terms of Trump talking about military action, or at least not ruling it out, as Kaitlan said, that caught a lot of people by surprise. It's not clear if that's actually something he's thinking about or something he said, because he was quite visibly in a pretty bad mood during this press conference. I think primarily because of the legal challenges that he's facing this week in the New York criminal case, and with the possibility of the Jack Smith report and the documents federal case getting released. So, what that looks like when he gets into office remains to be seen, but it's not a surprise that Trump, at least in his language, has never been especially respectful of sovereign borders. We'll see what that looks like in actual practice.",

It's worth remembering that he made the same promise in 2016, and it didn't quite happen that way. But do I think there will be a lot of actions related to immigration on day one or shortly thereafter? I do, and I don't think that he's especially concerned with distraction.

Obviously, that was the irony of ironies, given Trump was certainly trying to hamper his transition, to say the least, four years ago.But I think one thing he's been complaining about is the executive orders and the actions President Biden has been taking in his last few weeks in power. That's something you see every president who is on their way out do, whether it's pardons or executive actions, trying to cement their legacy, whether they've had four years in office or eight years. Trump himself did it four years ago. He actually had signed double the executive orders that President Biden has signed in this period when he was about to leave office. I think it was about 14 and Biden has signed six or so, so far with maybe more to come. And so, I think though really, you know, hearing Trump speak there and listening to him as he came out today, what was so clear was that he was so angry, and he very quickly made clear what he was angry about. And that is, as Maggie referenced there, his legal cases and his issues, his issues before him, whether it's the Jack Smith report that could be coming out within a matter of days, depending on how an appeals court rules and also whether or not he's going to be sentenced on Friday in New York because he was just rejected by another appeals court in New York today.

He is really testing what the public is going to tolerate with this suggestion about pardons for people connected to January 6th.Now, what some of his advisers were saying a year ago or six months ago was, well, some of these people who were arrested, you know, were barely in the building or were not part of it or were and so forth. And that's why this is going to be acceptable to people if we issue these clemency grants. But, you know, suggesting -- pivoting from he got asked a question specifically about a hundred -- roughly 140 police officers who were injured that day. And would he issue clemency grants to people who were involved in those incidents? And he answered by saying, Ashli Babbitt, a supporter of his, was the only person who was killed. So, you know, we will see where this goes. But the question of exactly who gets clemency here in terms of the pool of people connected to J-6 and who doesn't, has been a very hard subject to pin down for the last couple of months, I think, because there is not agreement within Trump's world on what to do.",
