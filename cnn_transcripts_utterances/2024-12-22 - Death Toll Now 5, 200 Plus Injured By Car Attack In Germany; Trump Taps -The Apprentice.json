Mourners grieved victims of Friday's Christmas market attack in Germany, as police released the name of the lone suspect.After a U.S., government shutdown is narrowly averted, Washington braces for what's next as Donald Trump prepares to begin his second term, and it's not always quantity, but quality. We'll take you inside an Artisanal Pasta shop in Italy. Live from Atlanta. This is CNN Newsroom with Kim Brunhuber. We are learning more about the man accused of driving a car into a crowd at a Christmas market in Germany. A U.S. based activist group called Rare Foundation USA has identified him as Taleb Al Abdul Mosen. Germany's Interior Minister says he's an Islamophobe. Police say he was in court late Saturday, where a judge ordered him held in pretrial detention. Meanwhile, police have increased security at Christmas markets across the country, and some Germans say they won't let Friday's attack keep them away from holiday events. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And he was considered a fugitive by Saudi Arabia. In fact, they asked for his extradition in 2007 in 2008 Germany refused that concern for his safety, if he would have gone been sent back to Saudi Arabia. So, as we learn that about him, the man who lived in Germany, worked as a doctor -- you know investigators will be looking at -- you know his social media postings about the warnings he may have -- you know given, you know, he rented this car that ploughed through this Christmas market.

The attack temporarily closed a local airport, which is now back up and running.

The House passed it just hours before the deadline on Friday, and the Senate passed it shortly after avoiding a shutdown that would have had a widespread impact just before the holidays.President Joe Biden signed the bill into law Saturday morning, calling it good news for the American people. In a statement, Biden said, quote, this agreement represents a compromise, which means neither side got everything it wanted, but it rejects the accelerated pathway to a tax cut for billionaires that Republicans sought, and it ensures the government can continue to operate at full capacity. This solution comes after a lot of back and forth on Capitol Hill. Earlier in the week, President-Elect Donald Trump came out against the initial bipartisan deal in response to Trump's opposition House Republicans dent that deal, frustrating Democrats both here at the White House and on Capitol Hill. The GOP led House then tried and failed to pass a Trump backed plan that would have included a two-year suspension of the debt limit. That's something that received pushback from members on both sides of the aisle, with Democrats arguing that effort would help Trump pass his tax plan in the future. So, what's in the bill that was signed into law on Saturday? It will fund the government until mid-March, March 14th, to be exact. It includes 100 billion in disaster relief and 10 billion in farm aid. It has not addressed the debt limit. Now following the vote in the House, both House Speaker Mike Johnson and Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries framed this final agreement as a win. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA): I was in constant contact with President Trump throughout this process. I spoke with him, most recently about 45 minutes ago. He knew exactly what we were doing and why?
