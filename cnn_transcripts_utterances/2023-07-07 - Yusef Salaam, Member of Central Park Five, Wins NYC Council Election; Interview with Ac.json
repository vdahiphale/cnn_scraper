Thank you, John. A new read on the U.S. economy, the June jobs report is out this morning. The economy added 209,000 jobs in June, lower than expected, but also showing that labor market remains resilient. The unemployment rate now at 3.6 percent. Let's get some reaction to this, what the trends mean. Joining us now is the Acting Secretary of Labor, Julie Su. Thank you so much, Secretary, for coming in. After this, and the report that we see, not just this one report but the trend we have been seeing overtime. Do you think the economy, in your view, is headed for a soft landing or do you still think a recession more likely than not as many smart minds expect?",

The president's policies have been about helping the country recover from the pandemic induced economic catastrophe, putting shots in arms, putting checks in pockets, and then creating jobs, investing in America. And we are seeing the payoff from a lot of that policy. And so, this is the jobs report that demonstrates what steady and stable growth looks like.",

The predictions were that it would not fall below four percent for years, and it has fallen below that. Not that just this time, but we've had 17 straight months of unemployment rate that is under four percent, we haven't seen that since the 1960s.Combined with the labor force participation rate, people coming into the job market, that is also at an all-time high, especially for women for the straight month, women of prime age, 25 to 54 are in the labor market at the highest rate in 75 years, those are all signs of not just, you know, economic progress but, I think, confidence.

So, like if I fall asleep or whatever, she would use her fingerprint to get in and change the settings. DESTINY RODRIGUEZ, SELENA'S SISTER: Once the pandemic had started, she was posting more. She became more recluse. She was focused on how many likes she has. How many followers she has. How many followers she's losing. Who's messaging her. CORNISH (voiceover): During the pandemic when Selena's school and social life moved online, she was regularly messaging with people on these apps. Some she knew, some she did not. T.

And one of the things that was very clear is that it's not easy for a parent to keep up with either their kid or the tech companies when it comes to policing this technology. The other thing is that in all of our conversation about, say, the geopolitical considerations in having TikTok or in the misinformation issues that come up, say, with Meta, and the campaigning 2016, et cetera. What's getting lost is this dialogue about whether or not children and teenagers are, kind of, suffering in the process. Whether that be through instances of bullying, through falling into disordered eating, or even just participating in various challenges where they come to harm. There are a number of ways, there are a number of pitfalls.
