Parts of the state have been buried in up to 7 feet of snow over the past few days as a freezing cold system moves inland over the U.S. And authorities are searching for survivors of a double train collision that killed at least 38 people near Larissa, Greece. Conservative allies of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis are quickly shaking things up at a small liberal arts college, the school's board of trustees which includes several members hand picked by DeSantis voted Tuesday to abolish all diversity, equity and inclusion programs at the new college of Florida. The governor's critics say it is nothing more than a political power move as he prepares for a widely expected presidential run. The school's interim president explained the reasons for the changes but students are voicing their concerns. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
