Town hall meetings, combative sit-downs over economic policy, defensive pushback over appealing to black men voters, and record breaking early vote turnout in a battleground state. That was just yesterday.Today for Kamala Harris, a big event in battleground Pennsylvania with a ton of Republicans supporting her, her team dubbing it a push for patriotism. And also going where she's never gone before, a sit-down interview with FOX News. Donald Trump is headed to another town hall, this time directed at Latino voters. He's also clarifying, as John was just talking about, who he really considers the enemy from within, which he says he'd consider using the military against. Joining us right now, CNN political director David Chalian. So David, where do we even begin -- once David pops up -- where do we even begin, David. Harris teaming up with Republicans in Pennsylvania, Trump reaching out to Latino voters with a Univision town hall, what do these moves speak to in your mind in terms of where the campaigns are focused, or maybe what they think they need from voters?",

We're actually seeing them address all the potential vulnerabilities that they have day in and day out in this very targeted, segmented audiences kind of approach.And you saw yesterday Trump going and talking to a town hall full of female voters, knowing that he has to shore up female support. You saw Kamala Harris talking to Charlamagne tha God and dealing with black voters and specifically black men. Today, also, as you noted, when Kamala Harris goes to Bucks County, Pennsylvania, it's one of those four collar counties that we talk about the border Philadelphia, those Philly suburbs that are so critical for especially Democratic candidates. That is where they need to run up the vote if they are going to win the commonwealth of Pennsylvania. She's going there to where George Washington crossed the Delaware to make this its argument about country over party and patriotism, like you say, this on the heels of what Donald Trump was still referring to January 6th yesterday as a day of peace and love. She'll be joined by Adam Kinzinger and other Republicans. It's sort of Republican day for Kamala Harris. She is very much today focused on bringing over some voters, whether independent or Republican leaning independent, Trump resistant Republicans into the fold. And the Harris campaign sees that as a critical component of what they need to get across the finish line on Election Day.",

You know, they had not been putting out David Plouffe, the senior adviser from the Obama days, who is now responsible for building the strategy to get to 270 electoral votes. But he did a couple of interviews with \"Pod Save America\" and \"New York Magazine\" certainly, and you can hear where they are turning their attention, which is they want to draw a contrast with Trump every day. It's why Harris wanted that second debate that she's not getting with him so badly.[08:05:01] So in all her answers to Charlemagne tha God, yes, she was working the African American vote and targeting black men. But in almost every answer she said, and now let's compare it to where Trump is. And so having them out and about daily is something that they welcome in terms of trying to draw the contrast. And they are seizing on his, whatever headline he makes in the day, right? So whether its enemy from within, as we'll discuss, they then seize on that and drive that home in their daily message.

He's not quite there yet, but he is up to $75 million, nothing to sneeze at. Dick Uihlein $49 million. So these are individual wealthy Americans who are clearly putting it on the line.And we see, you mentioned the joint fundraising committee for Harris. She's not without her rich friends, too. Laurene Powell Jobs, Melinda French Gates, these are people who have maxed out in the million dollar range under the rules of the joint fundraising committee, more contributing directly to Harris and the DNC, their victory fund, rather than the unlimited contributions you can give to these super PACs, outside ally groups.",

The tariff is almost used as a threat, if you continue to manufacture overseas, which costs us jobs, then we're going to place a tariff on your products and services. So we want you to bring that manufacturing home.What you did do very -- I don't know if it was done on purpose or if it was done for time, what was interesting is you cut off the crowd's response. That was a room full of businesspeople. That wasn't just a town hall of regular citizens. And they clapped at Donald Trump's answer because as businesspeople they understood what the point was that was being made. But now let's go over to Vice President Harris's non-answer to a very specific question. No, you cannot do everything. You cannot take care of American citizens who are living under bridges, veterans who are living under bridges, families who are homeless, you cannot take care of them and continue to send hundreds of billions of dollars to Ukraine, to Israel. We're getting ready to put boots on the ground in Israel, 100 boots on the ground in Israel, to Taiwan, and all these places around the world, and take care of American citizens, and give reparations, and give $50,000 to every business that wants it. And now you went from a $25,000 housing credit tax credit to last night, she told Charlamagne tha God, it's going to be $25,000 down payment assistance. So right there I've got to ask, what is it? Am I getting 25 stacks for assistance or am I getting a $25,000 tax credit? What is it? And it's par for the course for this campaign.

You're talking about three weeks later, the 81 people still unaccounted for.But when you think about the death toll of 117 people, there are so many folks in North Carolina who are still dealing with the effects of the storm. Just talking back and forth with people that we know, even people who work in the crew, some folks are just getting water back. There's still 13,000 people without power, and the surveys continue. There are 1,500 first responders still in the area, trying to help people recover. And all of this, the governor says, is just the beginning of this massive recovery effort. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. ROY COOPER (D-NC): It's beginning to get into the fall season, into the North Carolina Mountains, so we're working to make sure that people have blankets and coats and heaters and fuel, and working to change the supply chain, to make sure that we are dealing with those issues as well. So it's really hard when you've lost your home and some people are staying with relatives. Some people are staying in hotels that FEMA has provided for them, but many of them are just trying to figure out what their next move is. (END VIDEO CLIP)  YOUNG: Yes, John, trying to figure out what's next. $99 million of assistance has already gone out. But when you think about what the governor was indicating there, you're talking about in the mountains already cold. It's getting cold here in Atlanta, so you can only imagine what it's like in that cold area. And then on top of the impact that those folks in North Carolina are experiencing, then you have the real concerns of where they can get water and power back on to several different areas. Let's not forget our friends to the south who are dealing with Hurricane Milton in Tampa. There have been shortages when it comes to power and gas, and so they're hoping to get more gas into the Tampa Bay area in the next 24 hours or so. But this recovery effort continues, and John, unless you have family who's impacted by this, a lot of times, these updates are slow when you think about there are massive amounts of areas that are still without power, where people are just hoping that the supply chain gets back up so that infrastructure improvements can be made. This double hit of these two hurricanes back-to-back really have stressed a lot of people -- John.",
