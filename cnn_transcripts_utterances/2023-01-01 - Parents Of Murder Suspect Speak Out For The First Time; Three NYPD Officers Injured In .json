We begin tonight with a major development in the Idaho murder investigation. For the first time we are hearing from the parents of the suspect in the case, 28-year-old Bryan Kohberger. He is facing four counts of first-degree murder. CNN's Jean Casarez is in Pennsylvania where Kohberger remains in isolation at the Monroe County Correctional Facility. So, Jean, what are the parents saying? CASAREZ: Well, Pamela, they have released a statement and I want to read this to you. But first, you know, the attorney for Bryan Kohberger, Jason LaBar, tells me that when he was arrested Friday morning and the family is telling him about 3:00 in the morning, but Bryan LaBar tells me that what happened was that they went to the front door and that Bryan's father actually answered the door. It was law enforcement. We know it was the FBI. We know it was Pennsylvania State Police. It was in the middle of the night. We also are told that he was very cooperative. He brought his son Bryan to the front door. Bryan was cooperative and that is when they took him into custody. And I want to read you now the statement that is from the family. They say, \"First and foremost, we care deeply for the four families who have lost their precious children. There are no words that can adequately express the sadness we feel and we pray each day for them. \"We will continue to let the legal process unfold, and as a family, we will love and support our son and brother. We have fully cooperated with law enforcement agencies in an attempt to seek the truth and promote his presumption of innocence, rather than judge unknown facts and make erroneous assumptions. We respect privacy in this matter, as our family and the families suffering loss can move forward through the legal process.\" And I also understand that Bryan Kohberger, who is in protective custody inside the detention facility right behind me, is not allowed to have his parents come and visit him, and that comes from his attorney Jason LaBar. He tells me that he is not allowed that, only his attorney -- Pamela.",

Watch what he said to me on that presumption of innocence.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JASON LABAR, BRYAN KOHBERGER'S ATTORNEY: He's doing OK. He's shocked a little bit. Obviously, he's calm right now. You know, we don't really know much about the case. I don't have any affidavit of probable cause. He is entitled to a fair and impartial jury of his peers. He's presumed innocent. He's cloaked in that innocence. And really, I don't want anyone to jump to conclusions as far as facts and evidence. Right now everybody is making presumptions and assumptions. But really, he has that presumption of innocence until proven otherwise. (END VIDEO CLIP) CASAREZ: And it is true, to remember, for any defendant, obviously, it's constitutionally based, but the next hearing will be that extradition hearing. It is on Tuesday. And once he gets back to Idaho and has his initial appearance, authorities there have said the probable cause affidavit, which will have specific facts in it, will be publicly released -- Pamela.",

This is an area that is usually crowded, but around this time of the holidays and right before New Year's Eve, this area is packed.Now there is a big difference between the crowd you're seeing now and the crowd we had here last night. And that's that every single person that got into this area here yesterday to watch the ball drop was screened for security purposes. It was at one of those security checkpoints that police tell us this 19-year-old male approached an officer and attacked him, striking him above the head with a machete. He then tried to strike another officer, and it was at that point that a third police officer that was on the scene discharged his service weapon, injuring the suspect in his shoulder. Now, this event happened last night shortly after 10:00 in the evening, and it did not affect any of the Times Square festivities, but, of course, it caused a major security headache around that time. Now, those three officers are in stable condition and recovering at the hospital. One of them is a rookie police officer on the NYPD. He graduated from the police academy just less than a week ago. Mayor Eric Adams held an early morning press briefing after visiting with those officers, and he commended the way that they responded to this incident. He hailed them for their actions and talked about the fact that not only that they respond, but made sure that the scene was secure and that people who were trying to get into the area here last night could still do so safely. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR ERIC ADAMS (D), NEW YORK: They maintained the scene. They got the scene immediately under control. Those responding officers then, after securing the assistance for their fellow officer and subduing the person involved, the officers responded back to the location because we still had a city we had to protect.

One are either bipartisan or the Democratic initiatives that he was able to get through last year when Democrats were still in charge of the House and that infrastructure deal is one of them. It's really politically popular across partisan lines.And the other thing that President Biden can lean into is, I think, for better or for worse, is GOP overreach. When there are examples of bipartisanship that he can lean into, that is a real strength for him because it's a big part of what he ran on. He's not going to have many of those opportunities.

It will be a very painful period of weeks or months for him to endure. It really could occupy most of the next two years. Some of the other problems, challenges that he faces, is the economy. It's doing better than it could be. It's doing better than it was. But the risk of gas prices, inflation, stock market, and economic slowdown, these are all real risks that he doesn't have much control over that could hurt him politically. Russian aggression in Ukraine, the Biden administration is expecting a brutal winter ahead. And all those other foreign policy challenges. And then we haven't mentioned 2024 yet, but we are expecting an announcement by President Biden in some number of weeks or months about his plans and that will all factor in his calculus. I do think his biggest strengths are going to be the accomplishments already behind him that he can look to bear some fruit in the coming year, and he can hope that the infighting among Kevin McCarthy and the right flank of his caucus, the missteps by Donald Trump, help him to make the case that continue Democratic leadership is, you know, a more sane choice, that will be what he will try to argue. Again, it's sort of an Achilles heel. I think the Republicans are going to give him the most heartburn, but they also may be Biden's salvation if they overplay their hand.",

So there are a million reasons not to prolong this fight.McCarthy is starting to suggest he's willing to make some concessions, too. Ironically the concession that most of his detractors want is a concession that would make it easier to topple him if he becomes the speaker. So my guess is that's where this is heading. It's possible it will take more than one vote. And if it does, it will really be chaotic because there are a lot of old people in Congress, but no one has been there for 100 years. So we will be relying on the history books and parliamentarians if it gets to that. I'm not sure it will, but the jockeying in these final hours is something to behold.",

He's really looking at a false narrative, but he's trying to convince the Russian people and, really, the rest of the world, that the Russian cause is the one that is the defensive cause. In other words, he's doing all of this because he believes Russia has been wronged. He believes that Russia needs to move forward and protect its borders and one way to protect those borders is to prevent the pernicious influence from the West from getting to Russia through countries like Ukraine. So there's no better way to protect Russia, in his logic, than to go after Ukraine and eliminate that as a threat for Russia. And that's what he's trying to do.

She doesn't have to go through any bureaucracy or approvals. She has the ultimate say. She's in the process of putting her case in front of what we call a special grand jury, which will make a recommendation, and then the D.A. will decide whether to seek an indictment with a regular grand jury.Now, on the federal side, we have special counsel now, Jack Smith. He will run the day to day of the investigation. He will make the first recommendation as to whether to indict or not indict. But either way, that decision goes to Merrick Garland. Now, he has to give great weight to what the special counsel wants to do. But ultimately, Pam, on the federal side, it will be the Attorney General's decision.",

People need to remember an indictment is the start of a case. It is not the end point. And we're going to see some real obstacles here at the state level.If Fulton County charges, there's a real legal and constitutional question about whether a local elected, partisan district attorney at a county level can indict somebody for conduct touching on the presidency. There will be a debate about whether this conduct actually touches on the presidency. But watch, that will be a legal argument. And either way, Pam, as you know, you have to get a jury if you're a prosecutor to convict 12 to zero. That's going to be difficult in any case. It's going to be particularly difficult against the former president. It's going to be particularly difficult against somebody who is a current candidate for 2024. So an indictment, it will be momentous if it happens, but I think we need to understand that there are miles and miles between an indictment and a conviction, especially in this case.

This report, he stressed judicial security, the safety of judges, and he spoke very generally, or he wrote very generally, and he really placed it back into the context of history. He said, you know, back in the civil right there, there were judges who at times wrote unpopular opinions and they came under attack.And Roberts wrote in this report, he basically said, a judicial system cannot and should not live in fear. So that was the main theme here of this report. But Pam, what was really interesting is the fact that he doesn't refer at all to the tumultuous year that just happened at the Supreme Court. And it was a big year, right? He doesn't explain why the focus on judges' safety is necessary. And in many ways, this term was so big because, as you remember, back in May, there was the leak of that draft opinion on Roe v. Wade that prompted these protests in front of justice's homes across the country. And there was even a man who was picked up in Justice Brett Kavanaugh's neighborhood and later charged with attempted murder. Chief Justice John Roberts in this didn't mention that at all. And he also didn't update the country on where we are in the investigation that he launched looking into that leak, right? It's been some eight months. A lot of people said, well, maybe he's going to use this report just to sort of say where we are. He didn't. And one more thing, Pam, that's important is the area of ethics, right? Because public opinion of the Supreme Court is at an all-time low. And a lot of people look at the fact that you and I have discussed this for years. At the Supreme Court, there really isn't a code of conduct that is targeting the justices themselves. Basically, these justices get to decide when they want to recuse from particular cases. And that brings up questions for a lot of people. They thought maybe in this new report he unveils something new ethics guidelines, and he didn't.",

But even if it wasn't a big deal for the committee and her lawyer said, look, her role was minimal, she doesn't talk to Justice Clarence Thomas, her husband, about the law, still that raised these concerns like, should Justice Clarence Thomas have recused himself from at least one case that had to do with that committee. So all these questions are burgling and we get this report where, in fact, Chief Justice John Roberts isn't talking about things that are happening right now. He's sort of making references to judicial safety, you know, pinning it back in history. But I think a lot of people thought that this year, this report might have had a little bit more meat.",
