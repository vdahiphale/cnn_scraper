Smartmatic is currently suing OAN, Newsmax and Fox News for spreading false claims about their voting machines and voter fraud during that election.",

      "sentences": "Hey. Good morning to both of you. This is a pretty wild story, I will admit. I got to agree with you. According to court filings, after the 2020 election, the President of OAN, Charles Herring, sent a spreadsheet to former Trump lawyer, Sidney Powell, claiming to contain passwords of Smartmatic employees. This came at a time when OAN and Powell were promoting those baseless conspiracy theories that Smartmatic had rigged the 2020 election. The details about this spreadsheet have not been made public before. We pieced together the story from three different court cases stemming from the 2020 election.In one of those cases. Smartmatic is suing OAN, as you said, for defamation. And in a recent filing, Smartmatic referenced this email between Herring and Powell. It's unclear how Herring got the spreadsheet or if the passwords were actually real. But Smartmatic says, this means OAN executives \"may have engaged in criminal activities\" because they appear to have violated state and federal laws regarding data privacy. Now, I want to be clear, OAN denies wrongdoing. Their Attorney, Charles Babcock, said in a statement to CNN that \"this vague accusation is a clumsy attempt to smear OAN and to divert attention from Smartmatic's own misconduct\". Now, guys, the timeline here is crucial. The email was sent in January 2021, one day after the voting systems in Coffee County, Georgia were breached by some of Sidney Powell's associates. They were looking for evidence that would back up their fraud claims. And Powell, as you know, has pleaded guilty to state charges in Georgia, stemming from that breach.",

Joining us now is the co-founder of Black Voters Matter, Cliff Albright. Cliff, it's great to have you. It's not that a majority of black voters in these polls are turning to Trump. It's that more of them are, right? You look at The New York Times in November and you see that in the crucial swing states, you have 22 percent of black voters saying they would back Trump. It was 8 percent last time around. Why is there this weakness? CLIFF ALBRIGHT, CO-FOUNDER, BLACK VOTERS MATTER: Yeah, thanks for having me, Poppy. I think, I don't want -- I don't ever really give polls this far out a lot of credence. Interestingly enough, I went back and looked at polls from July of 2020. And President Biden or then Joe Biden was still at 71 percent, literally the exact same number that this poll (inaudible). The thing we got to keep in mind is, polls can say one thing, but if you look at the way that black folks have actually voted, these estimates -- this is not the first time we've heard estimates of 20 percent from Trump. We already did -- Herschel Walker might get 20 percent in Georgia, that didn't happen. We are -- Trump will get 20 percent before, and that didn't happen. In fact, if you look at black men, interestingly, in 2016, he got 14 percent of black men. In 2020, he only got 12 percent of black men. And so, the number is actually going into reverse.

And that can be an issue. I mean, wars have changed presidencies. I mean, ask Lyndon B. Johnson. And so, they really have got to look at that policy.
