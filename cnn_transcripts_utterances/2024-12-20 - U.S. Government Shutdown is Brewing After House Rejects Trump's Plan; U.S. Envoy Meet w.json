No one wants to vote really to raise the borrowing limit in the United States. And Donald Trump does not want this to be part of his first-year agenda. So he wants to take it off the table now. He's saying, deal with it now, and so he doesn't have to worry about when he's president. But there's a problem. There are Republicans in the ranks who say that they will never vote for a debt limit increase, especially if it does not have spending cuts. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP.

The White House has tapped former ambassador and Syria envoy Daniel Rubenstein to lead the effort in the final weeks of the Biden administration.The State Department says U.S. officials will meet with the group that now comprises Syria's de facto government to discuss the transition and other issues. The U.S., the U.N. and other countries have designated that group as a terrorist organization.

Gratitude for a reunion they never believed would come. This is one of many emotional homecomings across Syria after the sudden fall of the Assad regime. At just 19 years old, with security forces hunting him down, Morjan fled his family's home in Aleppo. Here he is in 2016. Reporting for an opposition-based media network as barrel bombs rained down from the sky. Later that year, Morjan filmed the exodus as thousands withdrew from the last remaining rebel enclave in Aleppo. We are leaving with our dignity, Morjan says in this clip, and we will return one day. That promised return is now finally on the horizon. Morjan says he is planning to move back to Aleppo from Gaziantep, Turkey, where he currently lives with his wife and their two young daughters.

AL-BUNNI:   I Don't think any -- I don't think any Syrians will force back or the Syrians want to go back. I knew that. But there is some of them will stay forever in Syria, and some of them they will go and back to visit to stay there to maybe have a new business in Syria, and they keep their business in Europe. So I don't think, I mean, until now, any country will force any Syrians to go back, because Syrians in Europe community, they go inside their community, they work, they create business, they create -- they add to the community of Europe many values.

Reproductive technologies are being used to help the rare species, as there are now only two females remaining on the planet.Susanne Holtze is a scientist for the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research, and she's in Berlin. Thank you so much for joining us here. So, as I understand it, at the beginning of this year, scientists announced they'd achieved the world's first IVF rhino pregnancy, successfully transferring a lab created rhino embryo into a surrogate mother. So that was with southern white rhinos, the only species that that isn't endangered. Now, the question of whether it was successful is a little tricky to answer. I guess it's both yes and no, I suppose, right? SUSANNE HOLTZE, SCIENTIST, LEIBNIZ INSTITUTE FOR ZOO &amp; WILDLIFE RESEARCH:  That's totally correct. So for once, southern white rhinos are also endangered. So they are rather abundant still. But they are also heavily threatened by poaching. However, yes, we had a very sad incident that after a successful embryo transfer and, a fetus developing inside of this mother, the southern white rhino surrogate female died of a completely unrelated cause, which was a tragedy. And yeah, it created this picture of us holding a fetus of this, yeah, first successful embryo transfer.",

So when were looking at the number of eggs, I suppose in the northern white rhino that you have access to, it must be limited because you only have these two individuals.
