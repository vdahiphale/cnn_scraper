These pictures show an Israeli flag being waved at a resort along the sea in Gaza. CNN has geolocated the images to an area over two miles into northern Gaza.As Israel presses its bombing campaign, Palestinian say airstrikes are getting dangerously close to Al Quds Hospital, the second largest hospital in Gaza City. Israel has warned that the facility should be evacuated because it could be hit by airstrikes. And in southern Gaza, some aid trucks made their way through the Rafah Crossing. Some aid trucks, I have to underscore. And internet and cell phone services that were cut off on Saturday do appear to be slowly coming back online. Well, Israel has sworn of a long difficult conflict to take out Hamas and ensure its security in response to the brutal October the 7th terrorist attack that killed more than 1400 Israeli civilians and resulted in more than 200 people taken hostage inside Gaza. But Israel's stepped-up military campaign is having devastating consequences on the ground. Let's kick off this hour with CNN's Scott McLean, who has the very latest on the increasingly desperate situation inside Gaza. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): There isn't much last of the Bilal Bin Rabah in central Gaza. The building was flattened by an overnight Israeli airstrike. People inside the neighboring apartment blocks weren't spared either, roofs were ripped right off, everything now covered in a pale shade of gray. More than a dozen were killed and more were injured according to medical staff at the local hospital, where outside the bodies of those killed are wrapped in white sheets and marked with their names. Both the IDF and the Israeli prime minister have renewed calls for civilians to urgently evacuate northern Gaza. The apartment buildings next to the mosque were filled with people who had heeded those warnings believing Central Gaza would be safer. There were no warnings at all, this survivor says. We've seen the entire thing collapsing on us. We didn't know exactly where the hit was, we started running to get our children out, it's a miracle they survived. This man said there were no warnings. It was a strong airstrike the people pulled us from underneath the rubble and took us to the hospital. CNN has reached out to the IDF for comment. Israel said that overnight some 450 terror targets were hit and say that some strikes were directed by troops now on the ground inside Gaza. This was the aftermath of one of those strikes on a family home in Khan Younis in southern Gaza. The desperate scramble to move slabs of concrete hoping to find survivors, instead they found at least one body. By daybreak, the urgency has gone. A pile of rubble is all that's left. Hospitals already at the breaking point are only getting more overwhelmed. In Deir al Balah Saturday doctors operated on this boy on the floor. The Palestinian Red Crescent now says that Israeli authorities called Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City twice with a clear and direct threat that the hospital must be evacuated at once. Otherwise the Red Crescent holds full responsibility for the lives of everyone inside. That amounts to hundreds of patients and thousands more people taking shelter. Israel says it called more than twice since the war began and says that Hamas is shielding themselves inside hospitals. Foreign aid is entering Gaza at a trickle. The desperation apparent in this video of people ransacking a U.N. warehouse carrying out bags of food. Maybe a temporary lifeline for those people but the U.N. calls it a worrying sign that civil order is starting to break down as the situation in Gaza only gets worse. Scott McLean, CNN, London.

We saw increasing military fighting between Israeli troops and Hezbollah militants in the northern Israel and southern Lebanon including the Israeli Air Force striking Hezbollah targets inside southern Lebanon.And so this is certainly a tinderbox situation. And I think that as we are watching this ground operation expanding in Gaza, the ways in which it expands and how vast it becomes could also potentially be a factor in terms of the political pressures that Hezbollah feels in terms of how much and how intensely to begin striking northern Israel as well.

Their first conversation since Israeli troops began their incursions into northern Gaza. U.S. officials say they are telling the Israeli leadership it is important to protect civilian lives even as Israel tries to root out Hamas terrorists who he accuses of using civilian areas and facilities for cover. U.S. president also spoke to Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi on Sunday. They discussed efforts to ensure that the conflict in Gaza does not spread to other parts of the region. Well, the U.S. president spending the weekend at his home in Wilmington in Delaware. That is where CNN's Kevin Liptak is. What do you make of what we heard discussed?",
