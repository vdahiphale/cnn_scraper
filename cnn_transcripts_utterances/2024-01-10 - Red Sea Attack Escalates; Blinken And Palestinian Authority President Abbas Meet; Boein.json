I'll show you one of the reasons why: Boeing is up heavily and that's one of the reasons why the market is up. Investors also waiting for inflation data, but those are the markets and the stories we're talking about tonight. US and British warships intercept Houthi attacks. The Secretary of State Blinken says there will be consequences for these attacks. Boeing's chief executive says he is devastated by the 737 Max fuselage blowout. He gives an interview. And days out from the Iowa caucuses, the World Economic Forum based here in Geneva says electoral disinformation from AI is the biggest global risk. Live from Geneva in Switzerland. It's Wednesday, it is January the 10th. I'm Richard Quest. It's freezing here -- what do you expect -- Switzerland in the winter, but I still mean business. Good evening, and a warm welcome on a cold night to Geneva, which in many ways is the home to international diplomacy, the center and home to some of the world's top diplomatic organizations, everything from the United Nations, which has an absolutely massive campus here to the World Trade Organization, a whole host -- the International Red Cross, who we will be talking to during the course of this program. In fact, on tonight's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, you'll hear from the director- general of the WTO, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala. In a moment, it'll be the head of the International Red Cross, Robert Mardini. We've got Saadia Zahidi, who is a managing director of the IMF on that AI and disinformation. We're in Switzerland and you'll also hear from Olivier Calloud, the CEO of Piguet Galland, the bank, and we have chocolate, we have lots and lots of chocolate. We begin now tonight with the violence in the Red Sea, which is escalating. The head of the World Trade Organization, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala tells me the potential is growing for even greater serious problems not only for those involved, the shipping involved, but of course for the supply chain and world trade. The US Navy has said it has downed 21 Houthi missile drones launched towards the international shipping lanes. It was a complex attack, and of course, the more of these attacks there are, the worse it gets for shipping, and the more avoid the region. Secretary of State Blinken in the Middle East made a surprise trip to Bahrain, and he delivered a warning to the Houthi rebels. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It means we are looking at lower aggregate demand in many countries or parts of the world, lower demand for imports and so on and that also impacts trade. So what is happening?

But are you concerned, if you take the global position at the moment. OKONJO-IWEALA: I would say, yes, I'm concerned. Why am I concerned? Because there are so many uncertainties now. You know, last year for 2023, we forecast 0.8 percent growth, and we were a little bit more optimistic on 2024, pegging it at about 3.3 percent, but when I look at all the risks we are facing in the world, I feel that there are risks to the downside.

Like I said, now, if you listen to what everyone is saying, you'll think, oh, globalization is over. And I know that it's trendy to say, globalization is over, you know, we are now in a post-globalization period, but that's why I'm saying that the data from trade shows that with 75 percent of global trade, it is still taking place on WTO terms free, fair, open and stable. Now, the other percentage that is not taking place, yes, we are worried about that. For example, we did simulations between, let's say, two trading blocs, and we saw that trade between two opposing blocs is growing much slower than trade within the blocs, and this is a sign that we think of people trading more with like-minded people, and now, some of that imagined fragmentation.",

We're now trying to work on subsidies for overcapacity and overfishing so that our oceans can be sustainable.

As we continue tonight on the other main news that we're following here on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, a top US diplomat has visited Ramallah and spoke to the Palestinian Authority leader. Secretary Antony Blinken, the US Secretary of State met President Mahmoud Abbas, where they talked about reuniting Gaza and the West Bank under the reformed Palestinian leadership, as well as, they've already said, of course, that there will be no room that roll in their view for the Palestinian leadership in Gaza in the future. They both discussed as well, the need for more aid into Gaza. That is something of which the Red Cross most certainly and heartily would agree as a matter of urgency, describing the humanitarian situation in Gaza as dire. The organization says extreme shortages of food, water, fuel, medical supplies, the amount of aid entering via the Egyptian border is tiny compared to what is needed with the aid. Well, we'll find out now from Robert Mardini, who joins me. Robert Mardini is the director-general of the ICRC and he is with me now. So, the issue of aid to -- aid is going through the Rafah Border. Is it also going through the Israeli border as well? ROBERT MARDINI, DIRECTOR-GENERAL, INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE OF THE RED CROSS: No, not at this stage. The aid is only trickling through the Rafah Border, which has been designed only for the transit of persons. So it's trickling in and all the aid that is getting in the Gaza Strip is only a small fraction of what is needed and cannot match the magnitude of the humanitarian need and the disaster, unfortunately.",

Much has changed, of course, dramatically in the last 10 to 15 years. Lots of the Swiss banks, Swiss secrecy laws have been abandoned and the Swiss government has reformed its image. But how far has it actually gone, in terms of still being a good place to come and visit your money, as they used to say? I spoke with a private bank, Piguet Galland's chief executive. In one shape or another, they've been operating since the 19th century. There have been many changes, much consolidation but Swiss and banks still beautifully go in the same sentence.
