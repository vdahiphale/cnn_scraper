The markets and the events of the day. Stop, go, or somewhere in between. Mixed economic signals put the Fed in a difficult position and they prompt the return of the QMB traffic light. No one wants to go back to a dark dingy office says one of New York's top developers. Great places to work are now attracting key talent. And Toblerone is forced to drop its iconic Matterhorn logo. Is this protectionism by the Swiss? We will explain. Because we all live in New York. It is Monday. It is March the 6th. I'm Richard Quest and back in New York, I certainly mean business. Good evening. We start tonight with US stocks that are barely higher, which is interesting, because it is the start of an eventful week for economic forecasters. It began on Monday. Today, US factory orders down 1.6 percent, but that's better than we thought. You're going to hear over the next two days from both the Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and the equivalent in ECB, President Christine Lagarde. President Biden was set to unveil his budget on Thursday and on Friday, the latest job numbers come out, a strong labor market has helped the economy charge ahead and the former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers tells us he thinks it could be headed for a nasty fall in the market.

Now, we first used the traffic lights during the Great Recession, 2009-2010 and 2011. In fact, they've traveled the world with us. As we now find ourselves in very confusing times, we've brought them back to help explain the road ahead. Obviously, green means the number is either for growth or we're heading for a soft landing. Red means the number indicates things are getting worse and we could be heading towards a recession and yellow, well, as you might expect, it is neither one thing nor another. It just means, it is a number that we'll watch and see. The traffic lights have made a triumphant report, but this is the one that you want to try and avoid, obviously, the red, and then of course, if we see that.

I think the problem for the Federal Reserve is that the service sector remains hot, and it is actually, by some metrics getting hotter. And so the problem there, of course, is the Federal Reserve is trying to cool things off. They're trying to get inflation under control, and still inflation remains way too high.

The Russians throwing all they have at the city says the deputy mayor. Heavy artillery, mortar fire, airstrikes and a substantial commitment of ground forces both regular soldiers and Wagner Mercenaries. But Russian advances have come at huge cost. Wave after wave of Russian soldiers have been sent to their deaths. And Ukraine has accused Russia of exaggerating its gains, claiming they still control one of the major highways into Bakhmut. A lifeline for Ukrainian defenders, with one Ukrainian commander tweeting that there are many ways still to get into the city. Analysts have questioned the strategic importance of Bakhmut but that has not stopped Moscow's intense campaign to capture the city. Nor Ukraine's existential fight to keep it. The unceasing barrage of artillery fire hasn't just killed or forced out most of the city's civilians. It's taken a huge toll on Ukrainian soldiers too, as the battle turns to close quarters street fighting. But Ukraine continues its fierce fight for victory, even as Russian forces continue to close in on a city that's already a byword for Ukrainian resilience on the battlefield. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
