      "sentences": "Tom, there are inevitably going to be questions, as there -- some have come up already about regulations and about safety standards. The Coast Guard was asked during the press briefing. What questions might you have at this point, as we learn of this tragic ending to your friend's story?TOM DETTWEILER, CLOSE FRIEND OF PAUL-HENRI NARGEOLET: Well, the other submersible operations that I've worked with all have relationships with the Classification Society, and that's that society -- there's several of them that will classify submarines, and they all have rules that you have to follow to guarantee that the submarine is tested periodically and is safe. And every so often it has to be completely torn apart, everything inspected. And those submersible operations have operated for decades with a really fine safety record. Now this submarine, from what I understand, was not classified and there may be reasons for that. But I think we need to look, you know, were there things they didn't do because they weren't inspected by an outside agency? Were there shortcuts taken? All of that's got to be looked at, and certainly that will trickle down to anybody else that is looking to do a private sort of venture like this. I think it's very comparable to what's going on in the space program right now. You know, we're making great strides in the space program through privatization of some of it, but at the same time, you know, are those programs as safe as say the government-run programs? So I think we have to work that out. We certainly don't want to stop the entrepreneurial developments because, quite often, they develop technologies that are major steps because they're not hindered by the regulations. So, you know, we need to find where that line is, where we can allow them to be somewhat unregulated, but at the same time not sacrifice safety.",

I'm wondering, as you well know with your friend PH, what your message might be to his family and to the families of the others on board at this difficult time when it's unclear what they might get back from their family members? DETTWEILERwho was British, his name was Robin Williams, who has since passed away, but he was well known for investigating shipwrecks. And when we looked at another submarine which had had a catastrophic implosion after a failure, that was the Israeli submarine Dakar, he put it very well.

And now that they do have all those assets in place, this will be a very good starting point from which to collect the debris, to start that investigation. As he said there, those remote operated vehicles will remain. In fact, they're on the scene to collect as much debris as they can. And of course that question, family members want to know, can the remains of their loved ones be retrieved? We certainly don't know the answer to that. But Boris, you did hear the U.S. Coast Guard say look, this is an unforgiving environment and that had been a catastrophic event. Obviously, they're still assessing the situation. But you know, retrieving human remains at this point would be difficult. But, you know, the remote-controlled vehicles are still down there and they will continue to be down there for hours more.

And this will be important in terms of evaluating what happens with this kind of exploration. We have private companies, certainly many of them trying to go to space and launching things in space, including space tourists. So what will it take in this kind of exploration to the deep seas? What is safe? What should be regulated? That is certainly a cause for concern for Canadian officials. This entire operation was launched from St. John's Newfoundland and so they want to know. It was launched off their waters, what do they need to know for next time? What do they need to be inspecting? What do they want to make sure is onboard can happen is possible? Again, OceanGate Expeditions included the fact that this was experimental and they were adventurers. They were explorers. They wanted this to happen. They wanted to stretch the limits, and yet there is concern among many now to understand exactly what was that catastrophic event, what happened? If we want to do this kind of exploration, and if private companies want to continue to do this kind of exploration, what do we know so that we can keep people safe in the future?

I think the U.S. Coast Guard was able to muster the resources they could, and that included being ready for survivors if they came off that Titan. Being able to immediately put them in a medical bay on a ship there in the North Atlantic and really cater to their every medical need. Obviously, they will be moving on. Again, when we're talking about the aircraft that was in the air, they will be moving on as well. What is most important now is things like the John Cabot, which is doing the side scanning, mapping of the sea floor bed, that may still be necessary.

It was the previous vessel, Cyclops, before that. They went on multiple expeditions. They went to Titanic. They went to Andrea Doria. They went to these famous shipwrecks. And you're right, Stockton Rush spoke very passionately, he clearly believed in this. Yes, there was tourism side of things that they were bringing you down these mission specialists, who were paying a lot of money to go on these trips.But they talked about mapping these shipwrecks, which they did do. They had these sonar cameras, laser cameras onboard. And they talked about the science and understanding more about shipwrecks and understanding about their impact on the ocean, while they still exist. So that is difficult knowing what we saw firsthand five, six years ago and now what's happening.",
