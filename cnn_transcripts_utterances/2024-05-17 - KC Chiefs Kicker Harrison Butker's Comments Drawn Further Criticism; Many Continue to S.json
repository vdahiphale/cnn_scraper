Many times, in professional sports, and frankly, particularly in the NFL, if you deliver results, a lot is excused. And in this case, Butker was a key part of winning that Super Bowl for him. He's got the longest kick in Super Bowl history. He's very good at his job, and he does have some support. Of course, there's also voices on the other side who are pro-family, pro-religion, pro-God who are making the point you can still be all of those things and support women's rights. There are certainly plenty of men in this country who are equal partners in raising their children, some as single dads who would argue with his comments, even if they are dedicated church members.",

It can get personal when people's emotionals getting -- emotions get in effect. You know, tonight is the D.C.

She's going to be there supporting the D.C. Party.

We'll be monitoring that.I mean, Shermichael, the other thing I wanted to ask you about -- to talk to you both about is what's been taking place up at the Trump trial all this week. Not what's going on inside the courtroom, but what's going on outside the courtroom. You have these members of Congress who support the former president. Standing behind them. In many cases, it looks like the MAGA Matrix, they're all wearing the same suit and red tie, you know. And yesterday, Matt Gaetz tweeted a photo of himself at Trump's trial saying, standing back and standing by, Mr. President. Of course, that is, you know, essentially echoing what Trump told the Proud Boys to stand back and stand by during that 2020 debate. I -- you know, what's going on here? I mean, isn't that kind of -- that's getting into some rhetoric that is just has no place anymore after what took place on January the 6th.",

You bring on some Republicans who can do the exact things that the former president can't do.And what it also showcases, Jim, is that despite all of these things, the Republican leadership, the Republican Party is still solidly behind Donald Trump.
