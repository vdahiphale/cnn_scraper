And it's not for us to be in grief, not only in grief, but mainly to keep our struggle going to get all the hostages back. Because that's the most important thing, because she knows that she would have wanted us to keep the struggle going and get all the hostages back. I'm sure of that. And I'm going to do that. I promised it to her. And I promised it to all the hostage families that we're going to keep on pushing to get all the hostages out, even if Netanyahu is willing to sacrifice them.",

And the U.S. worked with officials in that country to come up with this plan to seize the plane. That happened, and then today it was flown to Florida. And the U.S. has been going after corruption within the Venezuelan government for years now. They've been trying to prevent goods and money from getting into the country, and specifically, of course, ending up in the hands of the president, Nicolas Maduro. They have seized, you know, things like luxury cars. But this is a major escalation. I mean, imagine another country seizing Air Force One. That is effectively what happened today. And so U.S. officials are saying that this demonstrates that they're going to go after anyone who is in violation of U.S. sanctions, even if, of course, it is someone who is at the top of the chain and a foreign government.",

It went through the Caribbean and then it ended up in Venezuela. It's only been there now for just over a year, but it's really remarkable that it was actually a U.S. plane that ended up in Venezuela. And now, of course, is back in the hands of U.S. authorities who are able to investigate what's on the plane.
