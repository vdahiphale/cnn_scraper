This is on the heels of pretty strong economic data. The Fed signaling three possible interest rate cuts next year. The latest data actually shows the U.S. added nearly 200,000 jobs last month. Unemployment dropped to 3.7 percent. And while inflation has cooled to 3.1 percent, that's down from 9.1 last summer. Still, though, the vast majority of Americans say the economic conditions right now are poor. So, the big question there is, why?CNN's senior data reporter Harry Enten joining us now to dig into this. Why, Harry?",

We've actually decreased the amount of disposable income we've had, 2.7 percent for the Biden administration. Look at that, the average for the president since JFK, it's plus 4.5 percent. And even in the last few months, the last six months, the growth that we've had, just 0.2 percent. The average six months since 1961, 1.1 percent. So, we're even behind on that metric.",

It is a ceremony she knows well having gone through the same process when she became a U.S. citizen in 2006. The nationalization ceremony at the National Archives is very meaningful and it's a meaningful choice for the first lady. She has largely stayed out of the public eye since leaving the White House. Kristen Holmes joins us from Washington with more. She is doing this event while her husband has pledged to expand his hardline immigration policies in many ways if re-elected. That's just an interesting contrast. Do we know why she's chosen to do this right now. KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, it certainly is, Poppy. So, we are told that she was personally invite by the head archivist, Dr. Colleen Shogan. The two had worked together when Trump was in the White House and Shogan was at the White House Historical Association. And as you mentioned, Melania herself is a naturalized citizen. But there is a bit of irony here, particularly given the fact, as you noted, she is not somebody who was ever in the public space. We have rarely seen her. She is often behind closed doors. Her focus is on her son, Barron. And yet she is choosing to do this event as her husband has pledged if re-elected to expand his hardline immigration policies that would really restrict both illegal and legal immigration. And, Poppy, I also want to point out that it was the National Archives and Record Administration that asked the Department of Justice to look into Trump's potential mishandling of classified documents after he left office, which resulted in the special counsel probe and eventually an indictment. Now, despite all of that, we are told by a source close to Trump he is supportive of her speaking at this event. And I will note that the head archivist now was not the same archivist when all of that happened. Poppy.",

And while the box is tricky it build, the rocks are cheap and abundant. PONEC: There is plenty of production of this, even just 1 percent of the current production of carbon blocks would be enough to make terawatt hours of batteries, which would be enough to power, you know, the United States. WEIR (voice over): A competing company called Rondo uses even cheaper bricks in their thermal batteries to create megawatts of power for a single factory without the need for a grid upgrade, which means places with a lot of sun and wind could become magnets for new industry.

So, let's start there with how you made that decision, Abby. ABBY PHILLIP, CNN ANCHOR, \"NEWSNIGHT WITH ABBY PHILLIP\": It was a difficult one. When I tell you, Erica and Poppy, I did not, in a million years, think that I would be a mom who wanted to give birth at home. I just did not think that was in the cards for me. But when I got pregnant, I decided I wanted, first of all, a safe birth. I wanted a birth with as few interventions that were unnecessary as possible. And I just did not feel like I could be heard necessarily in a hospital. And so many moms that I've talked to as we were making this piece and just throughout my life say the same thing. Now, I just want to be clear, it doesn't have to be that way. And one of the beautiful things about this piece is that we talk about some ways that hospitals are trying to address that very issue, making hospitals as well a safer place where black women in particular feel more heard in the labor and delivery room, which we know actually has real health results that - that can keep them alive, frankly. HILL: Absolutely. So, drilling down on that a little bit, the CDC does say structural racism, implicit bias are among the factors contributing to racial disparities in maternal health care. You talk about starting this conversation, which is so important, that can hopefully lead to change. What - what is the sense of what needs to happen to change what exists in the system today?",
