But President Volodymyr Zelensky says his military needs more air defenses and other military aid.At a regional European summit in Lithuania on Thursday, he said Ukraine's allies need to put their promises into action. Here he is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  I have clearly outlined what Putin is planning to do this year. We have enough information from our intelligence. It is critical that each partner fulfills its promises regarding the supply of weapons and ammunition, as well as our joint production agreements. Every day, Russian missiles are fired and every day the number of promises increases. Every day, Ukrainian soldiers at the front withstand the brutal pressure of Russian artillery and guided aerial bombs. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Iran's Foreign Minister spoke by phone this week with his counterparts from Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Reports say the U.S. has called those three diplomats, urging them to help lower tensions in the region. Israel is bracing for retaliation after a strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus, Syria last week that killed a dozen Iranian military officials. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he is preparing for all scenarios. Here's more of what he had to say during a visit to Israeli air base on Thursday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator):  We are in the midst of the war in Gaza, which continues in full force.

The Council discussed the situation earlier this month, but differences among its members prevented any formal action. U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres condemned the attack through his spokesperson.And joining me now from London is Daniel Levy. He's the president of the U.S. Middle East Project. He's advised multiple Israeli prime ministers and worked on negotiations with the Palestinians. Thank you so much for being here with us again. So, first on Iran, how big a concern is this threat from Iran, do you think? DANIEL LEVY, PRESIDENT, U.S., MIDDLE EAST PROJECT:  Well, clearly, there's a lot of speculation. Speculation is not entirely unfounded. Will something be imminent? Will something be firm but non-escalatory or escalatory nature? But there's also a lot of disinformation and psychological warfare in the mix at a moment like this, Kim. So, I think that the best service we can do is to step back but focus more on what we do know. We know that Iran has not looked to get involved directly in this war. We know that channels between the U.S. and Iran have been activated. We know that Iran's ally, Hezbollah, in Lebanon has not sought to escalate this to a full war. There are exchanges across the border. Some of the Israeli forces are tied down there. We know that Houthi militia have engaged in support of Palestinians, as have Iraqi militias. But we also know that the Israeli leadership under Netanyahu have been prodding and pushing and provoking, and the action in Damascus was a serious escalation. And therefore, we're at this point where the thing that the U.S. has apparently wanted to prevent, which is a regional conflagration, is on the agenda. That could suck the U.S. in. But if we zoom out, the thing that we're most aware of is the link to Gaza and that you're only going to de- escalate regionally if one can bring a close to the atrocities, the devastation in Gaza. We've heard a U.S. official Samantha Power confirmed that there is famine. [02:10:00] It is said it's the most catastrophic hunger created by a war situation since it started to measure food security with this system 20 years ago. We know there are 34,000 plus Palestinians dead, 14,000 plus children. The devastation in that place, and it continues, and the U.S. has continued to send weapons to Israel. So, this is a very combustible mix, Kim.",

This idea of a seaport to be constructed that was announced in the State of the Union address by Biden, all this, I'm afraid, is for the birds. It's not serious.The land crossings exist. Israel is not allowing the aid in, even when it says, look how many trucks the U.N. then explained to us that they're not allowing those trucks to be full, that those trucks, as we saw yesterday, U.N. trucks are being targeted. We know that more than 200 humanitarian aid workers have been killed by Israeli attacks. This is the largest number. So, what we are not seeing is the kind of effort to end what is going on in Gaza, which also will be the only way to get those Israeli hostages who are still alive back to their families. The only way to end this catastrophic situation. And although there are expressions of frustration by the Biden administration, they are not putting on the table the leverage that very much is at their disposal. And that primarily is the conveyor belt weapons, including these extremely devastating two thousand pound bombs that are still being sent to Israel.",

There is increasing dissent in Israel around this question of how high a priority should be the hostage deal, including if that has to lead to a ceasefire, which the Israeli leadership is against.So, there's divisions inside the war cabinet, the public, even in the military. What it needs is a forceful external intervention. Only the U.S. is capable of that. The U.S. has not done that. You know, sometimes the comedian has as the sharpest words to say on this. There's -- there's an American comedian, John Stewart. He did a sketch the other day and he simply said, take the keys away. He used an expletive. I won't repeat that expletive.

Under a new proposal, the law would be extended for two years instead of five. Now, the law allows U.S. intelligence agencies to collect communication records of foreign citizens abroad.
