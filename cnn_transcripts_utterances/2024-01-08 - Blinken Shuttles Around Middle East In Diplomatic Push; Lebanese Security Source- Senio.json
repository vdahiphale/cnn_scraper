Second hour for you.The head of the World Health Organization says Gaza's Al-Aqsa Hospital which he calls the most important hospital remaining in central Gaza must stay functional and protected. It comes as multiple aid groups say they have been forced to withdraw from the facility, saying increased Israeli military activities made it too dangerous to stay. We're going to show you some pictures, which I warn you are graphic, taken yesterday. CNN cannot independently verify conditions inside the hospital. But the WHO chief says when the group's representatives made a visit, they saw dead and injured lying on the floor as well as blood street floors in chaotic corridors, and I quote him there. Meantime, America's top diplomat is aiming to prevent a wider conflict from erupting. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has just touched down in from the UAE and he set to meet with Israeli officials on Tuesday. At a news conference in Doha on Sunday, Blinken criticize, what he called, irresponsible and inflammatory statements by Israeli government ministers who have called for Palestinians to be resettled outside Gaza. Well, that was just one of the big moments to note so far on the top American diplomat's latest trip to the region. Have a look at this.

There is likely to be the discussion of normalization, which was a key factor of discussion before October 7th. And of course, as you mentioned, Blinken did call out the Israelis yesterday, some of these far-right extremists for voicing this idea that Palestinians in Gaza should be resettled outside of this strip. He said that would be unacceptable. So, he is -- he is pushing for them to be able to return home. However, the question of when and how and if they are actually able to do so looms large given the amount of destruction we have seen there in Gaza.

And then, Becky, of course, this idea of preventing a larger conflict from spreading, he arrived in Saudi Arabia just minutes, hours after we heard that this top Hezbollah official had been taken out, reportedly in an Israeli strike.

Moscow hasn't commented so far and Ukrainian authorities investigating the wreckage say they haven't yet come to a final conclusion about the missile's origin.

But on the TV categories, Beef, as you said did very well. So, did The Bear. A big win there for Jeremy Allen White, also winning in the comedy series category. Now, there were some surprises last night, particularly in the film categories. We saw two big wins for \"The Holdovers\". One for Da'Vine Joy Randolph and one for Paul Giamatti. Also, Poor Things really coming out ahead of \"Barbie\" in two categories that many experts predicted would go to Barbie. Barbie came in with the most nominations last night, and only walked away with two awards. Obviously, biggest movie of the year. Made over $1.4 billion. Who needs awards anyway? But I spoke to Helen Mirren on the red carpet, Helen Mirren was the narrator of Barbie. Let's take a look at what she told me about the film's success. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
