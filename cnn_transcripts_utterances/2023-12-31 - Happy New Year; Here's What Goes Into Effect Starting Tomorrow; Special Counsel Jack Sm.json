This is First Republic Square. This is the Times Square of Tbilisi. You can see the crowd has been lined up here for hours and in the sky, you can see there is a fireworks display still going on. And to be honest with you, I have no idea whether this is the official fireworks display, or whether this is just very excited festive Georgians lighting off their own fireworks because they sell them very liberally on the streets here. And so we have been hearing fireworks and seeing fireworks now for hours. You asked about the glasses, yes, those are Santa-themed because Georgia actually, they celebrate Orthodox Christmas, which is in about a week from now and they also celebrate Orthodox New Year's, again, another New Year's Eve, in about two weeks from now. And so this whole two-week period, is really just one big festive season that they have going in Georgia. So it's like New Year's and Christmas all melded together. This is one of their Georgian Christmas trees by the way. It is actually a hazelnut tree branch that they've shaved down to look like this, and basically, you burn this in a couple of weeks. It represents all of the bad things 2023 that you would like to not carry with you in 2024. And so, Amara, I am wondering what that is for you.",

I just want to show you so you can see just behind me, this is the Arc de Triomphe, all done up this year to the themes of the Olympics. That is the theme of course of tonight's firework display because this is the year that Paris will host the Summer Olympics. In fact, we've been hearing from the French president saying that what he intends for 2024 is for this to be the year of French Pride. That's what he was telling the French Strovolos. So people have been gathering here for their traditional fireworks display, which is going to begin just before midnight. You can see them there on the Champs-Elysee. It is a million people that we are expecting to come out here tonight to watch that firework display. You can see they've been gathering already. There's a DJ getting them ready to count down to midnight and already, they are dancing. Vast crowds of them, I had to push my way through to get up here, Amara, so I can tell you they are packed fairly tightly -- children, grown up, families -- they have come in huge numbers tonight. Now, last year was the first fireworks display since COVID, so that was pretty special. But yes, really just being down there earlier you could really feel the difference. There are a lot more people out there tonight than even there were last year at just about this time? But again, we have just under three hours to go, Amara, until what should be a pretty formidable fireworks display. Usually the French put on a pretty good show here at the Arc de Triomphe of every New Year's Eve and that's what we expect to have in a short while -- Amara.",

I'm joined now by Shan Wu. He is a former federal prosecutor and a defense attorney. Shan, lovely to see you. Thank you so much for joining us on this New Year's Eve. So Jack Smith's filing, it uses some of the harshest language to date saying that by granting Trump immunity would threaten to license presidents to commit crimes to remain in office, and he also warned that allowing a former president this kind of broad immunity poses extreme danger.

I mean, it's really a common sense argument in a lot of ways, which is if you tell somebody that if they get that office, they can do anything they want, and they can't be prosecuted, and of course creates an incentive for people to want to commit crimes.From a legal basis, you know, Trump's claim that there's this blanket immunity just because you've been president or while you're president, there is just no basis for it in the law. There was something a little bit similar to it on civil liability, where they had found -- the Supreme Court had found that for their official duties, presidents can't be sued for that, which makes perfect sense. You don't want them being sued for every action they take because people disagree with it. But there has been nothing that says that they would be immune from a criminal suit.

It simply flies in the face of what the Constitution says.I mean, impeachment, obviously, is a way of removing a president through the political process. It doesn't say anything about criminal and the criminal process, and it doesn't make any sense to say, oh, in order to have a criminal process, you first must impeach the president.

I think one of the challenges for the Supreme Court of the United States is to refrain from trying to like set forth some universal rules in areas they shouldn't be making universal rules in. There are some constitutional definitions, for example, whether the president is an officer of the United States. It seems like he should be, but they haven't had to decide that yet and if he is not, then this aspect of the 14th Amendment wouldn't apply to him, so that's certainly something that they should answer for the states. But with the fact-finding that Colorado did, the Supreme Court should not touch the fact-finding, and on other issues that the states may decide based on their laws, the court needs to guard against this idea that they can lay down sort of like a nationalized answer to the question.",
