The breaking news today, Kevin McCarthy opened Pandora's box.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY, (R-CA): Today, I am directing our House committee to open a formal impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden. This logical next step will give our committees the full power to gather all the facts and answers for the American public. That's exactly what we want to know. (END VIDEO CLIP) Let's get straight to Capitol Hill where CNN's Manu Raju is there. Manu, you were there when the speaker made that announcement. What are you hearing in the halls of the Capitol where you're standing right now?",

      "sentences": "Well, it's shame to change in plans by the speaker of the House, who had said just a few days ago, in fact, on September 1, that if they were to announce an impeachment inquiry, again to President Joe Biden, there would actually be a vote on the House floor to open it up.In fact, he had told Breitbart News at the time that it wouldn't occur through a declaration by one person but occurred through a vote on the floor of the people's House. But the problem for Speaker McCarthy is that he does not have the votes at the moment to open up a formal impeachment inquiry and required that he do so. So instead, changing tactics, calling for an investigation into Joe Biden, into those allegations that Joe Biden may have acted nefariously as vice president in allegations of a pay to play scheme with the son Hunter Biden, and those overseas business dealings. Even though Republicans acknowledged they do not have the evidence yet to tie Hunter Biden's actions into Joe Biden directly to Joe Biden's actions to the Hunter Biden, and that that is one issue they plan to continue to investigate. Now, what McCarthy indicated was that the House oversight committee would take the lead in this impeachment inquiry, that's led by Congressman James Comer. He will have an assist from two other key committees, the House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan, as well as House Ways and Means Chairman Jason Smith. All committees that have been involved in different parts of this Hunter Biden probe. Now the question is, where does this go from here? And will they actually move forward and try to make Joe Biden just the fourth president in American history to be charged with high crimes or misdemeanors? That would still be a very high bar to get to because of divisions within the Republican ranks. But by moving with this impeachment inquiry, Dana, he does have support from members of the far right, including Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, someone who met privately with Kevin McCarthy just yesterday. Also, they had dinner with Donald Trump on Sunday night and had been calling for an impeachment inquiry. She said she is fine with McCarthy skipping the vote, and she wants this investigation to go as long as possible, you could potentially into next year, the election year. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE, (R-GA): I'm very excited to see it happen. I think Americans deserve truth. They deserve transparency. And we need this investigation to go as long as it needs to, to uncover all the corruption that has been involved in covering up Joe Biden's crimes. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Will they actually try to vote on an Article of Impeachment at the end of the day here, as people like Marjorie Taylor Greene have been pushing so hard.Because at the moment, they simply do not have the votes, they can only afford to lose four Republicans in order to have any party line vote, there are far more than four Republicans who would vote against impeaching the president at this moment or a vote against even opening up an investigation into the president. So, a lot of questions here about for the speaker, but still making this dramatic step to potentially charge the president with a high crime or misdemeanor.",

      "sentences": "Right. I mean that's it is what is inextricably linked here is Kevin McCarthy's move today and Kevin McCarthy's quest to survive as speaker and that is what you're seeing on display here.And so, by moving ahead with this impeachment inquiry, absent sort of unified support from his conference, Kevin McCarthy is saying in no uncertain terms, his own survival in this job as speaker is the most important thing here, rather than getting the entire Republican conference together with this as a critical goal for this fall, and I just think that's important to note here. It's so different from what we saw four years ago, when Nancy Pelosi launched impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump in the first Trump impeachment. She waited for her more moderate frontline members to get on board with this idea, they were so skittish that this was going to blow up in their face that they -- it took them a while to get on board. And finally, when those vulnerable members got on board, Nancy Pelosi move forward. Here Kevin McCarthy is taking the threats of the hard right wing of the conference and moving forward with his vulnerable members, his majority makers, not yet on board.",

This historically this kind of move, whether there is widespread support or not, tends to backfire on the impeach er, not the impeach e. And so that's why you have Kevin McCarthy, again pushing for this announcing this without taking a vote because the vote would fail. AYESHA RASCOE, NPR HOST, \"WEEKEND EDITKION SUNDAY\" AND \"UP FIRST\": So, he doesn't even have the support of his own party. And it's interesting, because I mean, this would be an impeachment inquiry, that, you know, we're still a long way from actually trying to remove the president. But it seems for all the facts that we have now that a Speaker Kevin McCarthy is much more likely to be out of his post as speaker before President Biden would be out of his foes do an impeachment. Like this is all about the politics of it. And what if -- what at the end of the day, they're also looking for evidence that right now they have not found. And it's like, well, yes, if he did do a pay to play scheme that would be impeachable, but they have not found the evidence of it. BASH: Not that they've been able to show us for sure.",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MATT GAETZ, (R-FL) (voiceover): I worked very hard in January to develop a toolkit for us to be able to reorient the House of Representatives in a productive and positive way. I don't believe we've used those tools as effectively as we should have. And when we get back to Washington in the coming weeks, we have got to seize the initiative. That means forcing votes on impeachment. And if Kevin McCarthy stands in our way, he may not have the job long. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He's been pushing this. He's been very public about it. He's been pushing in private to do this, which really is illustrative of the fact that he has still the biggest grip, not just on the party writ large, but on the House Republican conference.Because if McCarthy was looking at the map and the math, he would know, and he would know -- he does know that to keep the majority, you do the opposite. You sort of listen to the moderates, and not to the right. And the answer to why he's doing that is because of Donald Trump. And you know, who's not happy about that, Republicans in the United States Senate. John Thune, who is the number two. He said, one thing I do this is just today in the hallway. One thing I do know is I don't think it'd be advantageous, obviously, if this thing went. I just hate to see where this becomes the method of every time there is a change in administrations, of trying to throw somebody out of office. I think you ought to win elections. That's how, in my view, you change the direction of the country.",

Mike Braun of Indiana came right out with the statement, saying impeachment inquiry is the way to go here. So, Donald Trump or Kevin McCarthy in this effort will have some supporters. But clearly the Senate Republicans are going to be even more divided than the House Republicans on this effort.But Dana, it's so interesting what you're saying because the Donald Trump piece of this, this is a classic Trump tactic, right? He's facing four indictments and 91 criminal charges. So, what does he do? He just wants to muddy up the opposition so that it's all seen as the same. So having months and months of conversation and hearings and news coverage of, well, what exactly did go on with Joe Biden and Hunter Biden's business dealings, and as we've all said, no evidence yet has been presented. But Kevin McCarthy said this impeachment inquiry is about getting that hard evidence and having the ability to do it. Donald Trump wants that so badly to mitigate his own legal peril in the mind of the public. And as we see in public polling, the perception of this, and he's troubling for Joe Biden.",

But the White House counsel's office has been pushing back on this announcement from House Speaker Kevin McCarthy calling for a formal impeachment inquiry. And what they are really focusing on in this moment is the fact that McCarthy has changed his tactics, deciding that inquiry should move forward without a vote in the House.A statement posted on social media by a White House counsel spokesperson Ian Sams says, \"House Republicans have been investigating the president for nine months, and they've turned up no evidence of wrongdoing. His own GOP members have said so. He vowed to hold a vote to open impeachment, now he flipped flopped because he doesn't have support. Extreme politics at its worst.\" And that is in line with what we have heard from the Biden White House as they have pushed back as McCarthy has floated the possibility of an impeachment inquiry over the past few weeks. And really, this is a moment that the White House, while they do not welcome it, it is something that they have been bracing for, for quite some time. In stating back all the way to when House Republicans took over control of that chamber in Congress, the White House has really been ramping up their teams, hiring lawyers, communication experts, legislative aides to try to prepare for an onslaught of Republican investigations that now could transition into an impeachment inquiry. And certainly, this will present a challenge for the White House going forward as they are heading into an election campaign. And as an inquiry could potentially extend into 2024, but for the time being the White House is trying to paint this as a symbol of extremist politics, extreme policies from the Republican wing of the party as McCarthy moves forward, calling for that formal impeachment inquiry.",

Do you believe that Biden had any involvement or not? If you look at the numbers there, it is pretty astounding. 61 percent say yes. 38 percent say no.

That's the heart of the impeachment allegation. There's no allegation about that in the law enforcement matter. In the case against Hunter Biden right now, we have not seen or hurt, we don't know. But we've got no wind of any kind of connection there that's being pursued by the now special counsel in that case. This is, to your point, Eli, no administration would want this. So, waiting for the potential political benefit of backlash, Joe is, it's just an unpleasant process for them, because nobody would want this, especially with where Joe Biden's numbers are right now and heading into the reelection. But one thing about those numbers that the White House is facing is this lack of enthusiasm around with Democrats.
