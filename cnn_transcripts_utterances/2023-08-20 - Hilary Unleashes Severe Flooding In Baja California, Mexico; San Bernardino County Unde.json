The intense rainfall turning what appears to be a neighborhood into a rushing river. At least one person died in the storm according to Mexican officials. Hilary is expected to hit the US later on today with what officials are calling life-threatening flooding. In Los Angeles, already feeling the effects, a flash flood warning is in effect for areas north of the city and that includes over 700,000 people; and in Pasadena, Palmdale and Santa Clarita. Last hour, I spoke to La mayor, Karen Bass and Fire chief, Kristin Crowley. They say the city is prepared for this unprecedented weather event. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR KAREN BASS (D) LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA: Fortunately, our preparation which has taken place over the last few days is in full effect. And as you can see, it is every department impacting the city, impacting the storm and so we are monitoring the impact all around the city.",

So 65 mile per hour winds, gusts of 85. This is going to still be a tropical storm as it enter Southern California and then on into Nevada by the time we get into early Monday morning. But you can see 50 miles per hour across San Diego, Los Angeles, but the rain is really what's going to grab headlines with this system. You can see from the radar, we are seeing very heavy rain. That flash flood warning has actually been extended to include Los Angeles, that's new, just in the last couple of minutes. We're seeing rainfall amounts of half an inch to an inch an hour, which is significant across this corner of the country where we're not able to absorb the rainfall like we are east of the Rockies. We could get several inches of rain in one thunderstorm east of the Rockies and it not be that big of a deal. When you get this much rain in a short amount of time across this region, you are going to have huge consequences. We're going to see pictures like we saw you just showed in Mexico. We could see similar situations across Southern California because of all of the rain in the next 24 hours. We could see widespread amounts of two to four inches, but Fred, we are talking about the potential for 10 to 12 inches for some isolated locations. That's going to have major impacts across this region.",

And so behind me, you see these are volunteers. These are people who not only live in the area who are preparing themselves, but also volunteer their own time to provide food or to provide water, to provide shelter.This makeshift Disaster Relief Center is a high school cafeteria here in Redlands, California. Now some of the other services that they're providing are mental health services. There are services for the elderly who are here as well. There are also animal services. San Bernardino County has sent numerous animal control officers here, and the reason is, they don't want people to hesitate if you have to evacuate to worry about your pet. I mean for so many of us, our pets are like members of our family. I couldn't imagine you know having to leave my pup, Pico behind if I had to evacuate and so they don't want residents to have to pause for a second and think well, I'm not going to evacuate because I can't take my animal. They are ready. They actually have outside livestock trailers for those who have larger animals such as horses, and so a full host of services that are here that are ready in case residents find themselves in a situation where they have to evacuate. Now, I've been talking with some of the folks that were here including one person who had to evacuate last night. We saw numerous evacuation orders here in San Bernardino County in advance of possible flooding.

Now, of course the whole area, the entire peninsula of the Mexican states of Sonora and Sinaloa have been experiencing devastating conditions for several hours now. There was that death in the small coastal town of Santa Rosalia. This was a man who is caught in his car as the roads there were really turned into rivers and swept his car away. That town has seen four inches of rain at least today so far, about four times the daily average in August. And several people have been rescued, according to local authorities there. But as this storm continues to move quickly, a lot more of Mexico is in its path. It is going to move through Ensenada, that's Mexico's most important wine-producing region with tourists coming not only from the entirety of Mexico, but from the US, crossing the southern border down to this this beautiful wine region.

In other words, he's presuming he's going to be the nominee, I don't think that's a very good look for any candidate just to assume they're going to be the nominee before a vote has been cast. So the real question is, what will these candidates do? Who will frontally and directly attack Donald Trump? We know Chris Christie will, Asa Hutchinson probably will, Ron DeSantis has indicated that he is going to go after Ramaswamy who appears to have some momentum. I think this guy is going to be like a shooting star, you know, he'll flame out at some point, but he might be an interesting thing for primary voters in the short term. So there'll be some attacks on Ramaswamy.Curious to see how much these guys go after each other. They're going to fight for second place, so they're going to eat on DeSantis and Ramaswamy and ignore Trump. These are the questions that I have right now, but I suspect Christie is the guy to watch though, because I think he's the one who is going to really make some noise.",

He did this before on one or two different occasions, and then eventually he showed up and didn't miss any additional debate.So I suspect he'll skip this one; and the others to follow, I believe he'll be present. But with that said, Fred, if you look at this recent CBS poll that came out, Republican voters do not want to see the other candidates going after Trump. So that is a significant portion of Chris Christie's strategy. I would think it's a mistake. They want to hear from the other candidates, what their plans are, what distinguishes them from everyone else, and why should they consider them as a potential candidate, but going after Trump and Trump alone, I think would be a terrible mistake.",

I mean, is that a big mistake? I mean, a lot of Republicans are very upset about the fact that there was this memo. But in terms of that strategy, I mean, do you agree with Charlie that this is politics. This is the race.

Many of these voters are now viewing these indictments as some form of a political attack against the former president. Anytime a Republican candidate attacks him or attacks the voters, Trump's numbers continue to go up. Just two months ago, Fred, he was around sixty, fifty-nine percent. Now he's at seventy percent with prospects of going even higher with likely GOP voters in terms of them supporting him. And so I think if you're a candidate, you're looking at debating policy, you're looking at distinguishing yourself from the frontrunner, but you also have to realize, attacking him is going to be a terrible mistake here, Fred, and so if I were advising one of those candidates, I think after this first debate, I would have to face reality, do we stick in this thing in the race or do we completely drop out because the odds mathematically do not look very good for them.",

Many of them are attorneys in Georgia.People are being interviewed by the prosecutor right now, most likely, a lot of the media trying to figure out who they are, but from the looks of the indictment, which was very detailed, there's a lot of inside information that was provided to the Georgia DA and to Fani Willis and so, these are people who are right on the inside.",
