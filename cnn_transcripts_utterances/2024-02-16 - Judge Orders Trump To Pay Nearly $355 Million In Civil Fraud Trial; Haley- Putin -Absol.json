Jake talks with the still-defiant former Illinois governor, Rod Blagojevich, who served eight years, in prison, on federal corruption charges.

Judge Arthur Engoron leveling Trump and his businesses, with a mind-blowing order, to, pay up to the tune of $355 million, plus interest, for being fraudsters. And don't sleep on the interest here, because the New York Attorney General, Letitia James, says that it could bring the total payment closer to $450 million. The judge found that the Trumps engaged in a years-long scheme to trick banks into thinking that their assets were worth far more than they actually were. Eric and Donald Trump Jr. were both ordered to pay $4 million apiece. So, when you look at it tonight, $300 million, $400 million, obviously a big deal, even for a billionaire. But he should be able to pay it, right? We've seen what Trump has testified, about how much money he has. But there are a lot of questions, tonight, about whether or not even he has this, or if he'll have to start selling assets. Here's the former President reacting to this, tonight, shortly after the verdict came down. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: $355 million, for having built a perfect company. There was no fraud. The banks all got their money. And the judge knows that. He's just a corrupt person. We'll appeal. We'll be successful. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And he noted that without a massive financial penalty, he says, they'd likely do it again. We have everyone that you'd want to hear, break down this ruling, tonight.

Instead, there needs to be an independent monitor, whose role and responsibilities are going to expand. Look for in 30 days, an order, where she will propose how she will do that. But essentially, the businesses now have a babysitter, who's going to be checking and looking at everything they do. And not only looking at what they do after the fact, but before. They have to seek approval, before they even go to a third-party, to make financial disclosures. They're also, for the first time, going to have an independent compliance director, somebody who's now going to see where the bodies are buried. They've never had that -- they've never had a compliance department before. So, things have really changed here. And look, you look at the amount. It's obviously a massive amount. But he says he has a perfect company. Well perfect companies don't get -- don't get found liable for $355 million of fraud. So, look, I think you have a business empire that's really taken a hit here. I don't think Trump will be in an empire state of mind, for anytime soon.",

Initially, he was going to give what's been called the corporate death penalty, and basically ban the president -- the former President in debt -- forever.

You can't even apply for a loan in a New York-registered bank, without the approval of that person, and the monitor, Judge Jones.

Dan is here with us. Dan, I mean, obviously, just I think the key question is can Donald Trump afford this? DAN ALEXANDER, SENIOR EDITOR, FORBES, AUTHOR, \"WHITE HOUSE, INC.\": He doesn't have the cash, right now. Especially if you add on that penalty with that interest, and the E. Jean Carroll penalty, which comes to -- with the two rulings on that comes at $88 million. Altogether, you're looking at over half a billion dollars. Right now, Trump has, does legitimately have roughly $400 million in cash. That's not going to be enough. And remember that you can't just empty out your coffers, and say, OK, now I'm down to zero, I'm still going to operate a major real estate company. He needs to have some cushion here. And so, he's going to have a couple of options. He is either going to need to refinance things. As you guys have talked about, the banks are going to have issues, with being able to lend to him. He can't even apply for a loan with many of these banks. But there are, for example, plenty of rich guys, who might be interested, in lending him $100 million or $200 million, and may have good interest, in wanting to do that, for somebody, who might become the President of the United States, here in about a year. Another option is that he could sell assets. But Donald Trump has always been reluctant to sell things, for what they're actually worth much -- not to mention, much less than they're actually worth.

He said, that would require not only valuing it as a private residence, which the deed prohibits, but also is more than the most expensive private residence listed in the country by approximately 400 percent.

Even after he's faced hundreds of millions of dollars of penalty, for lying about the value of his assets, he's continuing to lie about the value of his assets. But I will say that Mar-a-Lago is worth a lot of money. It's a hard thing to value. We peg it at roughly $290 million. And it doesn't have any debt on it, right now. So, he could theoretically take a loan, against Mar-a-Lago, somebody takes Mar-a-Lago as collateral, perhaps, again, some rich guy, or some foreign lender, or whatever, that wants to say, OK, sure, we'll take that as collateral, and we'll hand you a $100 million or $200 million.

That is Putin himself.Navalny was an anti-corruption activist, who was being held, in a penal colony, after being arrested in 2021, when he returned to Russia, in an incredibly symbolic act of defiance, knowing that very arrest was likely coming. Navalny had just survived and barely recovered from an assassination attempt, after Russian agents poisoned his underwear, with a nerve agent. Russian prison officials claimed, tonight, that Navalny suddenly lost consciousness, while at that Siberian penal colony. And joining me now is Republican presidential candidate, former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, and former South Carolina Governor, Nikki Haley. Governor Haley, it's great to have you here, tonight. First, on the major international news, today. Do you believe that President Putin is directly responsible, for Alexey Navalny's death? NIKKI HALEY, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Absolutely. I mean, all you have to do is look at his track record. I mean, this is a man, who's known to kill his political opponents. We saw him do this with the Skripals, in the United Kingdom, a few years back, when I was at the United Nations. And honestly, Kaitlan, that's what was so disturbing, about what Donald Trump said in his rally, in Conway, South Carolina, a week ago, was that he said that he would side with Putin, and not defend NATO allies, if they weren't pulling their weight. But he went even further than that. And he said that he would encourage Putin, to invade any countries, not pulling their weight. That means Donald Trump is siding with a thug, who kills his political opponents. He's siding with someone, who has made no bones, about wanting to destroy America. He's siding with someone, who arrests American journalists, and holds them hostage. And he's siding with a dictator, instead of siding with our allies, who stood with us at 9/11. It's the problem. But this is exactly the Russia, I know. I dealt with them every day at the United Nations. It is a brutal dictatorship. Navalny was a hero. He was trying to call out the corruption. He was trying to call out what Putin did. The fact that he returned back to Russia was nothing short of just amazingly courageous. But he was trying to make a point.

The problem is, that doesn't help us win any seats, in the House, in the Senate or anything else, if the RNC is all focused on his legal fees. The RNC's practically broke now as it is. And so, this is a bigger issue for the Republican Party. It's not -- you know, I'll let him deal with his lawsuits. I haven't paid attention to what the charges are, what he's found. But what I am most concerned about is now he's gone and taken someone, from North Carolina. He's made the co-chair, his daughter-in-law. He's made his campaign manager, the Director of Operations. He's trying to control the RNC after the fact that he tried to get me out of the race, so that he could be the presumptive nominee. All of that is so that he has an arm to pay his legal fees.
