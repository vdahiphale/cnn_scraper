It's between the Karim Abu Salem or the Kerem Shalom Crossing between Israel and Gaza, through which much of the humanitarian aid that is getting to Gaza passes, and it goes through the Salah al-Din highway, which is the main north south highway between inside Gaza. The point is to allow aid to reach those who need it most.Now, the Israelis put out a statement saying that they have decided to do this pause indefinitely after coordination with the United Nations and other humanitarian organizations. This, of course, following reports of increasingly dire situation in particularly the northern part of Gaza. But increasingly, what we're seeing is the entire Gaza Strip because of the crossing -- the closing of the Rafah Crossing between Egypt and Gaza, much less aid is getting through and the humanitarian situation is getting ever worse. Now, it also coincides, and we'll get to this in a minute, with a high number of Israeli casualties yesterday that really underscores just how difficult Israel's mission in Gaza has become. A, because of the amount of resistance still being put up by Hamas, despite the fact that this war is eight and a half months old, and also due to mounting international pressure on Israel to ease the humanitarian situation in Gaza.

Though -- yes, I mean, we just -- we have to see what this means. We've heard a lot of promises. Yes, as your correspondent said, we desperately need more aid in. It's not just about getting more aid in, of course, it's also then the safe delivery of that aid on the Gaza Strip, and that's become less and less certain over the last weeks, really ever since that military offensive in Rafah, which of course was promised to be \"a limited offensive,\" but in fact meant not only a million people, 1 million people again had to move, again, had to go take a tent, having lived in a home from a tent to another area of rubble. It also meant that the Rafah Crossing, which was the lifeline for aid coming into the Gaza Strip has essentially been closed now for more than a month. So, it's a real wait and see. Any news that means more aid and a restriction on bombing and killing of children is great news. But I think we have some way to go before we see a reality on the ground.",

And I got that sense that, yes, it is. Yes, you go out and, you know, you buy fresh clothes for the family and today, of course, is a feast and an amazing feast, rich or poor, everyone eats like a king today and they make sure that even those people for whom meat is too expensive for, you know, have a wonderful meal today.But what I really learned is today is about family. Today is that day like all cultures have where everyone comes together, it's cousins and aunts and uncles and grandparents. It's that beautiful day that we all know whatever time of the year it is. And what I really heard yesterday, because I was in camps that were entirely of orphans, what I really heard yesterday, increasingly through tears, was just families will not be together. Families have been literally devastated. Families have been destroyed. You've got people who've lost their entire families, half their families, a brother, a sister. So, that's what that looks like in terms of what that celebration really is. But yes, on a nutrition front, we keep sliding into more and more perilous states when it comes to the nutritional status. UNICEF has done an enormous amount on trying to reach those severely malnourished. Severely malnourished means you are 10 times more likely as a child to die from a standard disease, and disease is taking root here because sanitation has been devastated. But we had these stabilization centers treating thousands of these children. Again, they were disrupted or ended during that Rafah offensive. So, we're starting afresh. So, again, the nutritional status of the most vulnerable children really falls back on yes and aid delivery, but also a ceasefire.",

We're learning more about a Southwest Airlines flight that came within 400 feet of crashing into the Pacific Ocean. It happened in Hawaii back in April during an on-board flight. Island hop between Honolulu and Kauai. Flight tracking data shows the Boeing 737 MAX 8 plummeted while only a few hundred feet above the water before rapidly climbing. The flight then returned to Honolulu. In a statement to CNN, Southwest acknowledged the incident but did not say why it happened. That incident, though, just one of a number of incidents involving Boeing aircraft the FAA is now looking into. Earlier in the week, the head of the FAA admitted the agency had been too relaxed in keeping Boeing in check. Well, joining me now is CNN Safety Analyst David Soucie. He's also a former safety inspector for the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration. David, great to have you with us.

And what had happened is he actually -- he or she, I don't even know which one it was. I'm sorry. But they leaned forward on that control yoke, they actually leaned forward on it and caused it to move forward and caused that aircraft to dive.It wasn't something went wrong with the aircraft. It wasn't a procedural or operational thing like that. It was simply that they must have been moving in the cockpit or something and it got forward on it. And once you get forward on that control yoke and the aircraft starts diving, it throws your body forward as well. So, it's hard to get back out of there and pull it back. That's the only explanation I might have for why it wasn't made known by everybody is because it was a mistake by a person and the FAA has to go towards that person for violations about what they did or didn't do right, and that's -- that takes some time to happen. So, I don't think it was any kind of systemic problem that had to be addressed with other aircraft.",

What are they going to do? And the safety program is very detailed. I've looked at many parts of it right now, and I'm very impressed with what it does and how it does look at itself and realign their thoughts and their entire culture about safety. What is interesting to me is the FAA then receives this thing and they approve it. And they -- they're looking at it and scrutinizing and say, yes, you have to do this. You have to do this. But where does -- where was the FAA in all this? Why does the FAA not have -- where's their safety plan? Where's their safety strategy changes? What are they going to be doing different? I haven't seen that yet. And this is the first step, on Thursday, when the administrator admits this, that gives me an indication that they're looking at themselves. They're looking -- not just looking at the manufacturer, they're looking at themselves. And the FAA has done this before. But at this point, it has to be a much bigger picture. It has to look at not only how they're doing the safety oversight on these manufacturers, but who is doing it. That's one thing that they've been lax on.",
