A new political era is beginning in the UK where after 14 years in opposition, Labour has won a landslide victory, handling the conservatives their worst defeat in party history. Now, Labour leader Keir Starmer will now serve as prime minister, Britain's fourth in two years. While meantime, here in the United States, President Joe Biden's team is scrambling to shore up his campaign and rebuffed fears over his viability as a candidate. Where you can see it there now, live use due to speak it as first its rally in a week, we will, of course, take you to those remarks live when they begin. And so, we are looking ahead to this week's crucial runoff election in France, where a controversial far-right party is trying to capitalize on its strong first-round performance. We have an exclusive interview with the face of that party, but we begin in the UK and the country's new direction with its new Prime Minister Keir Starmer at the helm, Starmer is already on the job after yesterday's victory, he met with King Charles earlier today at Buckingham Palace. You see it there, who he at that point had formerly asked him to form a new government, and he spoke with President Biden already who said he was looking forward to working with the new prime minister. We want to head over now to CNN international diplomatic editor, Nic Robertson, who is outside 10 Downing Street to talk about this history making landslide victory. What does not history-making is the rain again and at Downing Street. Nick, you've seen so much of this over so many years. A lot to really process in this victory. Keir Starmer, in terms of becoming the prime minister today, what was his overall message?",

It is country first, party second, politicians that are going to come in and work for the people to deliver a better economy, to deliver a better health service to improve on crime and justice.That, you know, but he also was clear about where he was setting the horizons not immediately for people not to expect this immediate change, but the rebuilding of houses, of schools. This was something that they haven't ambitious plan for over the coming five years, but someday, he said that would begin to happen in a bit more time. Of course, the tough position for him is, does he have the money? He has to improve the economy, and a very skeptical public and you, he will be acutely aware of that 59.9 percent turnout that second lowest in a century at a general election. That's significant, only 35 percent of the country actually voted Labour despite the fact they've got 412 seats, a massive majority to push through changes who want to push through, says a lot of warning signals in there for the prime minister and is really trying to address those and bring the public with him and his party on a journey of changes.

I want to thank you and now, we move to politics on this side of the Atlantic into 2024 election in the United States. President Biden facing a series of crucial test as he tries to save his candidacy.Right now, he is campaigning in Wisconsin where he is due at any moment to speak at his first rally in a week while in the battleground state, he is also sitting down for his first on-camera interview since last week's debate. Now both events will be closely watched as you can imagine, in highly scrutinized as the president seeks to demonstrate his fitness and capacity to serve another four years. Now, the campaign trying to combat any concerns, announced an aggressive travel schedule in July with the president set to visit, think about this, every battleground state after next week's NATO summit. It is also launching a $50 million ad campaign, and that would be quite the media blitz in terms of money. CNN's Isaac Dovere joins me now. You know, today is a crucial test, of course, for the president. Can you give us some insight into the behind the scenes, especially this dichotomy, right, between what his inner circle is saying to him and that includes lets his family. But now what so many more Democrats are urging. EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER:  Look, this is a situation where that the president and people close to him are asking for time to make up their minds, to make up his mind, and to prove to people that he is up to running. The problem they are facing, is that many Democrats feel like their minds are already made up, and it should be said there are huge number of Democratic operatives and officials who are quietly saying they're ready to stick with Biden, but a lot of others are saying it's done. We need to move on. They're so far past that that they are already envisioning what it will be for Kamala Harris to step in as the nominee. My reporting as number of top Democratic leaders and officials saying that they are so far along that they are planning on who her potential running mates would be, and thinking about things in that way, how to restructure things, moving so far into the post-Biden phase of it that they're not even paying much attention to this rally in Wisconsin or the interview of this evening, or other things that are going to be part of the presence schedule in the next couple of days to again, try to prove to people that he is in it to win it, and that he is still up to the race that is a high bar that he's going to have to clear.",

Again, it will be on prompter likely not too long, maybe about ten minutes.So what Democrats saying to you about making the case to actually replace him now and replace him? With Kamala Harris right now, who's kind turning up to be the likely candidate.",

She's played in the NFL. And that's different from the people in the stands who are shouting, bring someone else.So, that is a big part of what's going on here. It should be said also that a number of people who I will tell you, have been very sour on Kamala Harris to the past and very down on her political prospects have in recent days said to me, they are sure that they would prefer her over Joe Biden, the leader of one Democratic group. I said, given where Joe Biden's polls are and where her polls have been, what you really they prefer one over the other and the person said to me, are you kidding, it's so obvious that person that that person would want Kamala Harris to step in now?",

But critically, this ABC News interview with George Stephanopoulos tonight where we really do expected to face really attentive and probing questions about, you know, all manners of the presidency and particularly his fitness to serve for office.And I have to say what the Democrats that I'm talking to it I'm sure all of us are talking to him doing well that interview tonight is kind of a bare minimum for him to continue on in this race. He really does have so much confidence among the Democratic Party that he has to restore for after his disastrous debate performance in Atlanta, odd at the CNN debate last week. And he really, we can't overstate this uphill battle that the president, the president's team, the president's reelection apparatus has right now to really get that motivation that competence back from Democrats.",

Everything after that and the differing explanations, he had a cold, he was tired from traveling, he needed more sleep -- all of these things has led up to a loss of confidence because you're absolutely right, this isn't about making it through the next week or even the next month. This is about being able to stand four more years as president taking Democrats competent again, that he can do it.The age issue has been an issue for as long -- since Joe Biden re- declared his candidacy and probably before then.

We talked about, you know, he's going to try and visit every battleground state. I do want to bring in though this issue of -- the medical issue now. Our own, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, you know, he wrote an essay today at CNN.com, which I encourage everyone to go and read it. Remember, he is a neurologist. Not only is he a neurologist, he says in the last few days he's spoken to so many that have reached out to them and that's qualified doctors and I'm going to quote him. He says the consensus from the doctors reaching out to me is that the president should be encouraged to undergo -- undergo detailed cognitive and movement disorder testing and that those results should be available to the public.

Obviously, if Joe Biden is telling governors that he's planning to be embed or at least stop events every day by 8Jackie, of course, a lot a lot of attention on Kamala Harris right now, right? And we can all tick off perhaps her weaknesses, not the least of which is the issue of immigration, which she was she was supposed to be leading up. And now the Trump campaign would hammer her on that. And, yet and yet, given the poll numbers that CNN has had over the last few days, saying that she is within since striking distance of Donald Trump, at least statistically, do you think the party can rally around her or do you think like Jim Clyburn, the congressman, suggested on CNN earlier that maybe they should have a mini primary that if Joe Biden steps down, that some kind of competitive process is necessary?",

Another jury found Trump sexually assaulted a woman in a public place and has been fined $90 million for defaming her, $90 million. (INAUDIBLE) bank about 20 times, but I don't know.This so-called great businessman owes over $400 million in fines after being convicted in New York state of business fraud, already convicted, fined $400 million. Donald Trump is just a convicted criminal, he's a one man crime wave. But Trump's biggest lie of all because he had nothing to do with the insurrection of January 6. We all saw with her when eyes. We saw he sent thousands to attack the Capitol. We saw police being attacked, Capitol being ransacked the mob hunting for Nancy Pelosi, gallows set up to hang Mike Pence. Let me ask you something after what Trump did on January 6, why would anyone ever let him be near the Oval Office again? Folks, the issue of this election is, what kind of America you want to be? What kind of American do we want to be? You want to be a country of anger, your friend, revenge and retribution, a country of hope and optimism of possibilities as we've always been. I want a country where women have a right to make their own health care decisions. Trump wants America where abortion is banned and women are punished. I want America where health care is a right, not a privilege. Trump wants to throw tens of millions of people who couldn't get insurance any other way than Obamacare off of Obamacare. (BOOS) I want America for the very wealthy begin to pay their fair share. Trump wants to get the very wealthy and (INAUDIBLE) last time out when he was president, he gave me a $2 trillion tax cut, creating the largest deficit any president has in one term. Now, he's announced he wants another $5 billion, trillion -- trillion, not billion, $5 trillion tax cut after already leaving the largest deficit. If this -- I mean, it's hard to make this up. I want to protect Social Security and Medicare. He wants to cut Social Security and Medicare, so he can cut taxes for the very wealthy. I want to ban assault weapon, require universal background checks. You heard the promise in the NRA. He promised the National Rifle Association. I will do nothing about guns. That's what he said. I would do nothing about guns and he means it. I want January 6 insurrectionist to serve their full prison terms Trump wants to pardon them. Folks, you can't be pro insurrectionist and pro-American at the same time. (CHEERS) This is so damn serious. You can't love your country only when you win. Look, you've been standing a long time. Let me close at this. Ulamy (ph), ultimately, the American presidency is about character. The character the president holds the job because with the immunities he's talking, extreme (INAUDIBLE) just talked about, it gets down to that. He gets down to that. It's about honesty. It's about the president's decency, integrity. Do they respect people? Or do they incite violence and hate? Can they honor their oath to the Constitution and uphold their oath of office? Well, I don't think it's an exaggeration that yes, Trump has failed on every one of these character tests, everyone. And what's worse is Supreme Court has just ruled, that virtually no limits on the power of the presidency. I know it sounds bizarre, but that's what they rule, a frightening decision. According to the extreme majority of the Supreme Court, the president is now above the law. We just celebrated the Fourth of July, saying we will not be ruled by a king, and this Supreme Court he appointed prove this to law. It's a dangerous precedent, especially if Donald Trump was returned the presidency, just think about it, the second term, this next term, whomever is a president is going to appoint at least two new appointees. A second Trump term where there are no limits. Supreme Court Justice Sotomayor warned us about that and her dissent in that case. There's this, she noted that based on a majority decision, Trump can take out his opponents, be physically take them out, take bribes, lead a coup, and be immune ever being held accountable for it if he did it while it was president, according to the Supreme Court. (BOOS) I mean, where the hell are we? So, he really could become a dictator that he promised to be on day one. For over two centuries, America has been a free democratic nation and I'll be damned if the year 2024, just two years before our 250th anniversary of this nation -- as a nation, I'll let Donald Trump take this away. (CHEERS) Folks, this is not hyperbole. This race is about our freedom. It's about our democracy. It's about the very soul of America, or her to fight for that. I know I am and I will. But, folks, I've never been more optimistic about America's future because the American people are decent, good, honorable, just to remember who in god's name we are. We're the United States of America. I mean it -- think about it. Think about it in literal term. And there's nothing -- nothing beyond our capacity when we stand together. So let's stand together, win this election and exile Donald Trump politically. (CHEERS) God bless you all and may God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you.",

Perhaps, perhaps most notable after going through what he considers some of the great achievements of his administration, he took it to his opponent, calling Trump a stable genius, ingest, saying he was a one-man crime wave and saying that he's failed all character tests. CNN's Isaac Dovere is back with me. Look, you and I discussed earlier, about what he had to do in this kind of speech, likely for one speech in one moment in time, passed that test. And yet, there is doubt with Democrats because this is not a one speech, even one campaign, future ahead of him. He's got to keep this up for four and a half years.",

If he seems to get lost in the middle of a sentence again, as he did many times during the debate, that is not likely to go over well with people who've been wondering. If he makes errors about things, when it comes to policy, he, for example, today, he said that he was the one who beat pharma when it came to insulin prices that is aligned that he tried to deliver on the debate stage. But he said that they beat Medicare. Obviously, that's not there what he meant is, it's not what people wanted to hear out of.Those sorts of things, the substance and the style clearly both them are going to be on what rule, probably the highest price they could has ever done in his 50-plus year career. NEWTON:  Isaac, we will leave it there for now. As I said, we expect him to sit down for this interview right after this rally.
