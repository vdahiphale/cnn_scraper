Ukraine's military says it is right nowtrying to establish the type of missile that Russia has fired on Dnipro after having originally said it was an ICBM. Analyst saying that the strike, whatever the missile, was intended as a message to the west. And the International Criminal Court issues an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. It is 03:00 p.m. at The Hague. It's 04:00 p.m. in Dnipro, and it's 06:00 p.m. here in Abu Dhabi. I'm Becky Anderson, you are watching \"Connect the World\". And the stock market in New York will open about 30 minutes from now. The futures market certainly indicating a higher open. They'd be mindful of tech earnings after an underwhelming result from Nvidia after the market closed yesterday and a slew of economic data out this week. We begin with the Middle East and arrest warrants for top Israeli and Hamas officials, including Benjamin Netanyahu. The International Criminal Court of the ICC, accusing the prime minister and his Former Defense Minister, Yoav Gallant of war crimes in Gaza. The ICC also issuing a warrant for Hamas Leader, Mohammed Deif, although Israel has claimed he was killed earlier this year. Deif is accused of crimes against humanity involving Israeli civilians. Well, CNN's Nic Robertson is in Jerusalem. And Nic this news breaking in the past couple of hours. Finally, we get these actual arrest warrants after this has been discussed now for some months. What are these specific charges in these warrants?",

So, this is the ICC now moving ahead with what they had proposed and first laid out in May. Israel had gone back to the ICC, rejected these allegations, called them absurd, and that's exactly what's happening again. The ICC had today said that Israel's legal challenge to what the ICC was doing was being turned down, and that they were moving ahead with these arrest warrants. And specifically for the prime minister, this puts him in an invidious position, if you will, being the first Israeli leader to be accused of such crimes, the first leader of a recognized democracy to be accused of such crimes. And it also implicitly means that he will be limited in his travel because the 124 countries that are signatory to the Rome statutes are obliged if Netanyahu sets foot in their country to arrest him and turn him over to the ICC for to go to court. So, this potentially radically changes the legal landscape and the physical landscape for the Israeli Prime Minister, his office is very clearly rejecting these allegations.",

Well in Gaza itself a devastating 24 hours, local health authorities reporting Israeli strikes on northern and central Gaza have killed at least 87 Palestinians in the past day. Medical staff say at least 65 were killed in Beit Lahia overnight, and that death toll is expected to rise. Gaza's Health Ministry now says the death toll in Gaza has surpassed 44,000. Well, turning to our other big story this hour, and Kyiv now says it is assessing whether Russia fired an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile or an ICBM at the City of Dnipro in eastern Ukraine. This video obtained by CNN shows the moment of impact from the Russian strike earlier today, and this next recording is said to convey the sound of the impact. Ukrainian authorities have not confirmed the authenticity of that recording. They had earlier accused Russia of firing an ICBM. The Kremlin isn't commenting. It comes in a week of creeping escalation in Moscow's war on Ukraine. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh writes that Moscow is sending a message to the West that it has greater capabilities that it previously displayed. Nick, standing by for us in Ukraine's capital of Kyiv.

We do have, as Nick mentioned, one Western official saying that this does not appear to have been an intercontinental ballistic missile, but rather just a regular ballistic missile. We don't know what the characteristics of it were exactly, but we do know that this appears to be the first time that they have used this specific type of missile in this war. So, it does mark a significant moment, right? I mean, it does suggest, according to people that we are speaking to, that the Russians are prepared to use these new capabilities, suggesting to the U.S. and its allies that they have more in their arsenal, more in their stockpile, that they have withheld, that they are now capable of using. Now, even if this was not an ICBM, it did have a pretty long range. It is capable, according to officials, of potentially carrying nuclear warheads. It did not in this instance. But still, this is a very clear message, I think, to the U.S. after the U.S. gave us Ukraine permission to use those long-range attack comes inside Russia itself. The Russians, of course, have been trying to take back that territory of Kursk from the Ukrainians, which Ukraine occupied in August. And you know, the U.S. allowing Ukraine to use these long-range missiles to defend that territory is a clear escalation on the U.S.'s part as well, in an attempt to try to allow Ukraine to keep that Russian territory. So, this is all part of this kind of back and forth that's going on right now in the waning days of the Biden Administration. What remains to be seen, of course, is whether any of these policies are going to be changed in just two months' time, whether things are going to be ratcheted down a bit from here. But at this point, it does seem, you know, that we are kind of in this spiral. Hopefully, you know, it doesn't escalate beyond that. As we know, Russia has threatened to use nuclear weapons. They've recently lowered the threshold for doing so. So, a lot of fears here in the U.S., of course, about this escalating further and spiraling out of control, potentially, Becky.",

You know, the woman who's referred to as Jane Doe throughout this police report says that during this conference, Hegseth was giving off a creeper vibe. She says she ended up in a strange hotel room, and when she was there, Hegseth took her phone from her, he used his body to physically block the door, and she remembers saying no, a lot. Now there are conflicting accounts about whether she may have been inebriated. She says something may have been slipped in her drink, but other eyewitnesses said she seemed sober. You know, there were also conflicting accounts about interaction she had with Hegseth in a hotel bar before they ended up in a hotel room. There was one witness who said she came and sort of intersected Hegseth when he was hitting on another woman who was not interested. A different eyewitness said that Jane Doe and another woman seemed to be flirting with Hegseth. But a couple days after the incident occurred in the hotel room, she sought medical attention, she had a rape kit conducted, and a nurse reported this alleged sexual assault to the authorities. Now Pete Hegseth has a completely different account of what went on that night. He said the two of them engaged in consensual sex. He said there was always conversation and always consensual conduct. He said he and Jane Doe, the woman, discussed that she was married, and she said that she would tell her husband she'd fallen asleep on the couch in someone else's room. And he said she showed early signs of regret after they allegedly had intercourse. Now an attorney for Pete Hegseth have told CNN that this report confirms what I've said all along. The incident was fully investigated. Police found the allegations to be false, which is why no charges were filed. We should note the police report doesn't actually say the allegations were false, although it is accurate that no charges were filed. There's other evidence in this case, a surveillance video, a memo from the district attorney that could help shed light on why there were no charges filed. But that information is not being released to the public. And we should note that Jane Doe declined to comment when CNN tracked her down last week, when folks on our team approached her, she broke down in tears.",

And of course, it's a real barometer of the health and tech sector, because this is such an integral part of the AI revolution. It's in the DNA of AI. It's part of the infrastructure, so it's critical to that. Now let's look at the numbers for Nvidia's earnings. This is for the third quarter revenue, Becky, was up 94 percent compared to last year, so it actually nearly doubled. But the thing is, if you compare that to the third quarter of last year, well, revenue was up more than 200 percent year on year. So here you can see why Wall Street has such lofty expectations of that not lofty. They're, frankly, stratospheric. Even the outlook from Nvidia was pretty good. They are pinning all their hopes on the latest generation of chips. They're pulling them Blackwell. And there were concerns in the Nvidia earlier this year that there were some production issues with that, that knocked the stock at one stage. But on the earnings call, the CEO said they're selling more black hole products and expected this quarter, and they do expect demand as ever to outstrip supply, and the forecast for revenue for the next quarter actually beat analysts' expectations.

I'm sure your source is telling you that these stock markets are due a bit of a correction at this point.

And perhaps some of these, you know, highly valued AI companies in the tech sector will actually have some sort of correction. Is there a bit of a bubble brewing? I actually suspect that isn't. But perhaps with Nvidia, that's the sort of company where they're not seeing the growth they've seen in the year before. There is maybe a limit to scaling, or a limit to revenue growth, but progression in the sector, in the technology and the applications it's having is still very much there.
