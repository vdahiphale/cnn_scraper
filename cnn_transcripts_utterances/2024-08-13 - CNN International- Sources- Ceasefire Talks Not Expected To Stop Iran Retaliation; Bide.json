We begin in the Middle East, where Israel remains on high alert, bracing for potential retaliatory attacks by Iran and its proxies in the region. The threat is not deterring mediators who will meet in Doha on Thursday for another round of ceasefire and hostage negotiations. Hamas wants mediators to compel Israel to accept a U.S.- backed ceasefire deal that is already on the table. But two diplomatic sources tell CNN any progress on such a deal will not stop Iran from retaliating over the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh. You see his picture there. This took place in Tehran In Gaza, Israeli airstrikes have continued to kill dozens of people over the past 24 hours, including three day old twins and their mother. This morning, the military wing of Hamas says it fired two rockets at Israel in response to the killing of civilians in Gaza, the IDF says, one of those rockets fell into the sea, the other failed across into Israeli territory. The cycle of violence, though, spinning on unabated. CNN senior international correspondent Ben Wedeman is in Beirut for us. Ben, mediators, they're going to return for negotiations under increasingly difficult circumstances. You and I have heard that mantra we're close. These talks are necessary. This is the final stage. Where do they stand?",

      "sentences": "Well, really, they are in a sense, already facing serious obstacles.On the one hand, you have Hamas, which is now, of course, run by Yahya Sinwar, who is somewhere deep underground in the tunnels of Gaza. He's the man with the hostages. He makes the final call. Whether Hamas participates in these talks or not, or through Qatar, it's going to be very difficult to get messages back and forth to him. On the Israeli side, you have this very fragile coalition led by Prime Minister Netanyahu, but it has those two hard line members Itamar Ben- Gvir, the national security minister, and Betzalel Smotrich, the finance minister, who have made it clear all along that they're opposed to a ceasefire. They want Hamas to be completely destroyed. And if Netanyahu agrees to some sort of ceasefire that they don't like, they've made it clear, they will resign from his government, his government will collapse and Israel will be back into that situation of political paralysis that was so common prior to October 7. So there's a lot of good reasons why these talks should make progress. The death toll in Gaza is nearing 40,000. Those are the accounted for dead, not counting those under the rubble. The situation is only getting worse. There's this looming possibility of Hezbollah in Iran retaliating for those twin assassinations two weeks ago. Now, Hezbollah has made it clear that if there's a ceasefire in Gaza, it will cease fire itself. But it's not clear if their desire for revenge for the killing of Fu'ad Shukr two weeks ago today is going to be put on the back shelf or not. So there are many things that play and the outcome of these talks day after tomorrow very, very uncertain -- Jim.",

I don't know, that the carrot that they're asking for of negotiators is that the terms of the talks stick closely to what President Biden endorsed in July, the framework approach, an agreement to the deal. What precisely the carrots and sticks are for Prime Minister Netanyahu, who is we understand from diplomats in the region, ostensibly or would be under pressure from the United States to go softer on these talks just aren't clear. It's not quite clear what large enough carrot could -- could succeed there. But I think it's an -- Jim, I have to say, look, it's an absolute roller coaster at the moment of what's going to happen. But we are getting closer. So in diplomatic terms, that's positive. We have a destination, a location for the talks, Doha, and it seems by virtue of being just 48 hours away, more or less from the talks, there's a chance they could at least get off the ground.",

You can see the troop movements with satellites that, of course, the Russians have with drones, that the Russians have, and still they absolutely apparently did not see any of this coming.And I think one of the things that's extremely concerning for the Russians is that the Ukrainians still appear to be making quite a bit of headway. You were just mentioning some of the areas that the Ukrainians have been able to take. The chief of the general staff said today that they were able to take another 40 square meter -- square kilometers in the past 24 hours. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, he came out today and said that Ukraine now controls 74 towns and villages on the Russian side in the Kursk area. Yesterday at this point in time, it was only 28. So it certainly seems as though the Ukrainians continuing to make that headway. We've heard from Vladimir Putin. We've heard him berate, is generals and some of his advisers well telling them that they need to push the Ukrainians out. But so far, it really doesn't appear as though the Russians have much of a solution to all this. It's been quite interesting because one of the things that we've been doing is we've been monitoring the Russian military's feeds and some of the stuff that they've been putting out and they keep showing their troops allegedly bombarding the Ukrainian forces.
