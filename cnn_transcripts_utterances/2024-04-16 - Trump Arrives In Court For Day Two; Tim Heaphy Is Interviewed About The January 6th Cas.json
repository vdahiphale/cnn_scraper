This isn't even where the Department of Justice cases, where there is some link to the Biden administration because the Department of Justice falls under the administration. Again, there's only link to Biden in any of these cases.However, this is a New York state case. He is entering the courtroom in New York that was brought by the district attorney in New York. This is nothing to do with President Joe Biden. But as we have heard time and time again, Donald Trump has really tried to take control of the narrative here to make this about politics, to make this about, quote/unquote, election interference. Essentially the messaging theme that President Biden does not want him running against him in November so has orchestrated entire legal system to be on his side to put him through these various trials so that he won't run in November. I will tell you, Kate, this is something that resonates with some of his supporters, some of his base. But, again, when it comes to the actual facts of this, that is incorrect. The other part of this that I thought was so interesting is remember, he did not mention any of the witnesses here. This comes after yesterday after prosecutors asked the judge to fine Donald Trump over his three social media post in which he mentioned witnesses, saying that he had violated the gag order that said that he couldn't talk about witnesses. We're waiting to see if he does anything with that. Again, I know that there were reporters asking about that in the hallway. Interesting, Donald Trump just gave his slate speech, came right out of the can, and then walked into that courtroom.",

So, you can see that he's trying to work within the bounds of that gag order.The frustration that he and his lawyers have expressed, though, is, for example, Michael Cohen or Stormy Daniels, who were the subjects if some of the social media posts that prosecutors were pointing to yesterday, Trump's argument is, hey, they can talk about me all the time and say disparaging things, but I can't talk about them? That's inherently unfair. So, people may see it that way, but the fact is, he is a criminal defendant in the state of New York, and he is subject to this expanded gag order.",

We're going to cover that. I also want to bring back in Tim Heaphy and continue the conversation, or even let's just start the conversation now, Tim, with what Paula Reid was reporting before, which is in another courtroom, in another city, where the Supreme Court is going to be looking - is going to be considering oral arguments today that could up end the sentences and the cases relating to the January 6th rioters. The question before the justices really is one of scope, of this federal obstruction law that more than 350 of them were charged under. The implications and the fallout from this could be huge. What is it going to look like if the convictions of 300 plus people of these rioters are now thrown into limbo?",

He wrote - there was a filing where he even noted and made the case that even if this - the scope of this is defined narrowly with the Supreme Court ruling, he still thinks that he can move ahead with the case against Donald Trump because he has charged Trump with violating the same law as part of his election interference case. You think that it stands regardless of what we hear today.",

      "sentences": "Yes, I do. First of all, there are four counts in the special counsel's indictment of the former president, two of which are under this statute that's at issue in front of the court today. The other two conspiracy to defraud the United States and the deprivation of civil rights, the right to vote, would not be touched by this opinion. But even if the Supreme Court narrowly interprets 1512, that obstruction statute, the special counsel has evidenced that he did use false documents, which would be consistent with that obstruction theory tied to the Enron pattern and the more limited interpretation, that part of the charged conspiracy was the submission of these fake electors that were signed as official but were not - did not reflect the results of the voters in that state.So, I think the special counsel's indictment of the former president is fine regardless. There are a lot of other cases, as Paula points out, where there is no - there are no - the defendants were not involved in fake electors. They're just up there storming the Capitol. Those convictions under that statute are potentially subject to those counts being dismissed and resentencing. Almost all of those cases, though, also had other counts. So, I don't expect a lot of practical impact even of a narrow interpretation.",

      "sentences": "Well, Kate, I checked with investigators this morning to see if there were any new details. They say no. But I want to start from the top here to get you through this.This nightmare started about two weeks ago for the families of Veronica Butler and Jilian Kelley. That's when Butler and Kelley were on their way to pick up Butler's children from their grandmother. That's when these two women vanished in rural Oklahoma. They were supposed to go to a birthday party. When they didn't show up, Butler's family went out to try to find these women and they found the abandoned car. That's when they called police. Now, we have video of that area. You now see flowers and a cross with the names of both of these women there. Now, investigators responded to the scene. And here is how that scene is described in court affidavits. It says, quote, \"blood was found on the roadway and edge of the roadway. Butler's glasses were also found in the roadway south of the vehicle near a broken hammer. A pistol magazine was found inside Kelley's purse at the scene, but no pistol was found.\" Now, according to that same affidavit, Butler and the grandmother of the children are in this custody battle. And now - and now the grandmother is accused of Butler's murder. But she's not the only suspect. There are four suspects. Take a look. Now, Tifany Machel Adams is that grandmother. Her boyfriend is also a suspect. That's Tad Bert Cullum. And the two other suspects are married, Cole Earl Twombly and Cora Gayle Twombly. They all belong to an anti-government group called \"God's Misfits.\" And again, all of this is according to the affidavits. Now, it's important to note, that two bodies were recovered over the weekend. The medical examiner has not identified them as Butler or Kelley. The medical examiner is still working to identify the bodies. But the affidavit makes it very clear that these four suspects are charged with two first degree murder charges, two kidnapping charges, and one charge for conspiracy to commit first-degree murder, quote, \"by arranging and planning the deliberate, intentional, and unlawful taking of the life of Veronica Butler and/or Jilian Kelley.\" Now, this affidavit goes on to say that Adams, the grandmother, purchased five stun guns, three burner phones. There are multiple agencies involved in this case. And, Kate, I should add that CNN has made attempts to determine if these four suspects have legal representation. We have not been successful. What we do know is that they will be facing a judge for the first time tomorrow morning. Kate.",

You don't have control over the situation around you.Donald Trump has completely lost control of the situation in the courtroom. And that's what you're seeing. You're seeing this very palpable fear of a criminal defendant. Let's not forget that now he is on the other end of the criminal justice system, where he's tried to put so many other individuals, the Central Park Five come to mind initially, but now he is on that end of the criminal justice system and he's going to get justice doled out to him like everyone else in the United States of America.

There is no competition. Now, in the past, Live Nation has downplayed this and they have said that they are not responsible for inflated ticket prices. But as you said, Kate, we all remember back in 2022, when there was a nationwide meltdown over Taylor Swift's Eras Tour, when fans could not get tickets, it even prompted Taylor Swift to respond on her Instagram, which is very rare for Taylor Swift to do, and she said how upset she was over this that her fans couldn't get tickets or that the tickets were at astronomical prices. Now, this even resulted in a hearing last year in January of 2023. It was very contentious. The president of Live Nation testified. And this was one of those rare occurrences that brought together lawmakers from both sides. Now, we have reached out to both Live Nation and the DOJ, and we have not heard back. But in a statement to \"The Wall Street Journal,\" a spokesperson for Ticketmaster had this to say, quote, \"Ticketmaster has more competition today than it has ever had, and the deal terms with venues show it has nothing close to monopoly power.\" This, obviously, is one of the biggest issues, Kate, facing the music industry.
