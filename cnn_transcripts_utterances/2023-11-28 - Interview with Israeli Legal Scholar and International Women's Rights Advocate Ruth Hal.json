As Israel gathers evidence of sexual violence committed by Hamas on October 7th, I'll speak to Ruth Halperin-Kaddari, a women's rights advocate who accuses the International Humanitarian Community of staying silent. Then, I'll put that the same question to Sarah Hendricks from the U.N. And disinformation, deep fakes, and division. An Israeli cyber journalist tells me how the war is playing out online. Plus, one of the hidden heroes of the civil rights movement gets his due in the Obama-backed film \"Rustin.\" Hari Sreenivasan speaks to leading actor Coleman Domingo. And finally, we say farewell to Former First Lady Rosalynn Carter with friend of the Carters, James Fallows. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York, sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. Well, there's hope in Israel as more hostages are expected to be released as part of an extended truce. But the horrors of October 7th are still being uncovered. Israeli police, along with a civil commission, are compiling forensic evidence, video and witness testimony to document cases of rape and sexual violence against women by Hamas. CNN spoke with witnesses to those harrowing events. And a warning that the following testimonies are graphic and contain disturbing accounts of sexual violence. First, take a listen to an Israeli paramedic whose unit responded to one massacre site on October 7th at Kibbutz Be'eri. He did not want to be identified. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, this is separate. This is coming from documented evidence they have compiled from the medical community. How significant is this? HALPERIN-KADDARI:  It is very significant because the Physicians for Human Rights is an incredibly credible civil society organization. And I'm really grateful for the work that they did in putting all the dots together. This is what I am now visiting in Geneva. And I have met with a number of high-level officials, including the High Commissioner of Human Rights, Volker Turk. And I also spoke in front of many ambassadors yesterday at a closed event and presented this kind of evidence and testimonies and walked through all the dots together because despite not having surviving witnesses, we do have eyewitness survivor who witnessed a gang rape next to her. We do have a paramedic who spoke to a survivor who described that she was raped by four men and we do have all the other evidence. And I do think that we need to add this to what comes out of the interrogations of the terrorists because this demonstrates the premeditated plan and the systematic nature in which these orders were actually executed by the terrorists. Recall that the massacre actually took place in 22 locations, at the same time. And these horrific images of the bodies that you just described at the beginning of this part, and the testimony that comes from the volunteer in the IDF morgue, they described the same pattern, the same method in which these horrific atrocities were executed by the terrorists in separate locations, in different locations, all at the same time. This demonstrates a preconceived and premeditated plan. And that is why it does amount to crimes against humanity.",

You similarly have been critical about a very hollow or lack of response. And let's just give our viewers a sense of the tick tock here, because we're talking about something that occurred seven weeks ago now. The U.N. made a statement just a week after the terror attacks that did not mention sexual violence at all. The U.N. then condemned, \"All forms of violence against women and girls, as well as any use of sexual violence as a weapon of war.\" And just last week, the U.N. tweeted, \"We met with Israeli women's organizations and heard about the work of the civil commission for crimes against women and children. We remain alarmed by gender-based violence reports on the 7th of October and call for rigorous investigation prioritizing the rights, needs and safety of those affected.\" Again, this is from U.N. Women, an organization you've been affiliated with and had been affiliated with for a dozen plus years. Not mentioned here was Hamas, not mentioned here was sexual assault and rape of Israeli women on October 7th. What is your response to the responses thus far? HALPERIN-KADDARI:  I was actually affiliated with the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, the CEDAW Committee, which is another human rights body that is also in charge in promoting and protecting women's rights throughout the world. But CEDAW, as well as U.N. Women, their response was really devastating, was heartbreaking for me. Because neither of them acknowledged or recognized the existence, the fact that sexual violence was part of the Hamas massacre, the Hamas October 7th attack. And these are bodies whose raison d'etre is to protect, to promote, to fulfill women and to protect them from violence, all women, in all places of the world, regardless of nationality, of race, of religion. And by not acknowledging this, by dismissing, by ignoring, they are, in fact, almost, I would say, legitimizing the existence of these atrocities. They're signaling, they're sending a message that these atrocities can go on unaccounted for. And Hamas already said that they are going to do it again and again, a million, 7th of October. That's what they said. So, is this the message that these human rights bodies, the international human rights community wants to send the world, wants to send to Hamas or to other terrorist organizations that this can go on unaccounted for?",

I am glad to notice beginning of a change of the attitude from U.N. Women and hopefully from other human rights bodies. And I also acknowledge the fact that the head of the U.N. Women Geneva office yesterday in opening the 16 days of fight of violence against women did refer to October 7th as a place where sexual violence against women was committed.

Women specifically provides and has extensive knowledge on gender- based violence, and provides and supports investigations as we do with all U.N. investigations. And so consequently, in this context, and within the U.N. system, it is the Independent International Commission of Inquiry, which for us has the mandate to investigate all alleged violations. It is absolutely important for the rights, for the needs, for the protection, for the dignity for the survivors of violence to be supported throughout a process. And that's why we work through these globally mandated mechanisms. That notwithstanding, we understand certainly we encourage and support national level efforts. The ones that you've heard about today, the Civil Commission in Israel, which has brought together women's organizations to document gender-based atrocities impartially.

As Elon Musk, the CEO of X, formerly known as Twitter, met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Isaac Herzog. It's a trip that comes just after Musk endorsed an antisemitic conspiracy theory on his own platform.

So, regardless of what you think about his politics or even Netanyahu's politics, this current situation where people cannot recognize that Israelis were innocent, Israelis were murdered and slaughtered on October 7th, while also simultaneously recognizing that civilians in Gaza are also being killed as part of the Israeli response and the situation which no side can accept a shared reality is based on the technology that Elon Musk makes money off of and he's actually expedited a lot of these kind of processes. So, in the past, post kind of Trump, we saw tons of disinformation mechanisms put into place on platforms like Twitter And all this kind of -- all these mechanisms have been rolled back. And I think this this truly terrible kind of division in reality that we're now living through is how Elon Musk actually makes money. And I think when you connect that to the politics of Netanyahu, you can kind of see why newspapers like Haaretz and people who are concerned by the state of kind of veracity and facts take issue with this, because the reality is that they're allies. There's almost this kind of international access or this access of international technology and local nationalist populist leaders who are invested in this. And I think Netanyahu, because he wants to be perceived as part of this kind of, you know, as someone who plays on the international level, we'll meet someone like Elon Musk and give him an easy PR win, but the reality of it is that they're both quite complicit in creating this very politicized reality. And again, in a reality in which we can know -- we can accept that Israelis were slaughtered and raped while simultaneously accepting that people in Gaza are dying. And I -- I'm a firm believer in the fact that we can actually establish a shared reality. And we can say, you know what happened regardless of our politics and we can kind of, you know, create for -- like just a shared sense of reality, right? And I've seen online, on Twitter, it's just such a good example on X, forgive me, I've seen the same video used by both sides, but with different captions. And I think that's just a perfect example. So, there's this video of children in cages and, you know, a lot of people were claiming it's Israeli captives, and a lot of other people were claiming it was Palestinians that Israel had arrested, and it was an old video from somewhere else, and both sides were wrong, right?

But of course, we have to examine that this friendship and this sort of tendernessbetween brothers who really believe in each other's minds and beings was challenged with folks, you know, they didn't understand a relationship between an openly gay man and a straight man. I think they could not think of anything but sex in between, instead of thinking, like, I know -- it's like, no, that's a deep friendship and brotherhood. But because, again, it's biases of the world and what they put on it. And then that was also threatening to not only within the movement, but it was threatening to outside the movement. People can use it in any way, shape or form and even lie about it. I think, you know, from what I know, I think there was a picture made like created of like Martin Luther King in the bathtub and by Rustin sitting in a chair nearby or something, to be suggestive, to see if it can be used to like discredit both of them, to bring down the movement. You know what I mean? There's a lot of forces as much as we were coming together for the fight for civil rights, there were many forces that we're trying to make it fall apart within the parties and outside of it as well. So, I think from what I knew in the way that Aml Ameen and I played it, Aml is Ronald McCain. He's beautiful. And he's playing Martin in a way as sort of as a young man who doesn't have it all figured out just yet. So, you see the relationship that they had sort of teacher and student, which is what we wanted to experience. And then, also see how the thing that was important to us is to see the tenderness between these men, that one would never really imagine, the tenderness between these two. They had to be intimate to really support each other for the fight for civil rights. They had to. So, that's what we wanted to explore. Intimate in the loving brotherhood sense, you know.",

He really believed. I mean, I think that's -- it was outside of his -- in his thinking, which is great.

They believe in the unexpected. They're like, yes, let's go on a ledge and believe that we can actually get this done, and they did it.

And I think it feels like Bayard's alive again. So, people are calling, oh, my gosh. That moment in particular, when Colman puts down his cigarette and stomps it out, I've witnessed that many times. Bayard did that. Did you know that? I was like, no. She said, there was something, she says, you must -- and she said she's not a spiritual person. She said, but there's something spiritual around the portrayal. It feels like we're calling on each other. And that's what I feel. And they feel very proud of the film. They feel proud that his story is out there. His legacy is -- and his importance is out in the world. Because I think that they've always looked at him as such a -- he was always on their Mount Rushmore, and now we really do marvelize him now with our film. But we also make sure that it's human, because he's not a perfect person. He's kind of messy at times in his private life, and that's all to show a real full human being. So, they're very happy.

It really was and is the animating part of their life. So, I think they actually believe there was God's justice that would be reckoned in the long-term. And most Americans were born in 1984 or afterwards. So, most Americans have no memory of Jimmy Carter as president. They remember him as -- him and Rosalynn Carter as these benevolent people around the world, winning Nobel Peace prizes, eradicating giddy worm, monitoring elections at various places.
