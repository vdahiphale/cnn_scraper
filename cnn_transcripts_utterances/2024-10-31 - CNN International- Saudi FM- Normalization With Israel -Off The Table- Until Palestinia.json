Now top of mind here continues to be the regional instability, not least the situations in Gaza and in Lebanon, of course, but very specifically in Gaza, that has resulted in more than a year of intense bombardment and unimaginable human suffering, a quote form of genocide.

We are stuck in this region. All of us, the Palestinians, everybody. And we're going to have to find a way to live with each other. And we can only live with each other if we address the rights of the Palestinians, if we address the issues of injustice that the Palestinians face right now. And that is going to have to be a serious discussion. If that's not going to happen, we are setting ourselves for a continuing cycle of violence that serves no one except the extremists. What does a pathway to a Palestinian state mean? That means many things, and that's why we have this you know that's why we, with the European Union, Norway. And our colleagues in the Arab League and OIC, launched this coalition for a two-state solution because we realized that, just as you said, that perhaps in Israel, unfortunately, the conversation right now isn't addressing the reality that there's going to have to be a two-state solution. The rest of the international community seems to be fully committed to that. Now we need to translate that commitment into concrete steps that's going to include capacity and state building, state building of state institutions within the Palestinian territories. It will also mean that we have to build on the existing international law that supports the establishment of Palestinian state. From our perspective, of course, Palestine should become a member of the United Nations without delay. All of these issues are things we want to work on. So, there are elements of Palestinian statehood that are tied, obviously, to a negotiation between the Palestinians and Israel, the settlement of borders, things like that. But in reality, the establishment of a Palestinian state is not tied to whether or not Israel accepts it. It's tied to the principles of international law, and I will say that the United Nations resolutions that led to the establishment of the State of Israel clearly had a Palestinian state in view as well. So, we need to make that happen.",

So, I would hope that the leadership of Israel sees that it is not just the right thing to do, it is not just the moral thing to do. Is not just the just thing to do to give the Palestinians their rights and their state.

Well, withjust five days to go until this very consequential election. The candidates are, of course, in their final push to win votes in those critical battle ground states. And also, to do their best not to lose any support at this point by alienating key groups which could ultimately decide the election. Both campaigns harping on the garbage remarks that have really set the tone for much of this week. All of this, of course, started on Sunday night with a Donald Trump supporter who called Puerto Rico, a quote, floating island of garbage that happened at a rally in New York, sparking widespread bipartisan outrage and offering somewhat of a gift to the Harris campaign. That is, until Tuesday night when President Joe Biden seemed to call Trump supporters garbage during a \"Get Out the Vote Event\" and while he did try to clarify he was referring to a single supporter, that Biden gaffe became a bit of a gift for the Trump camp. Vice President Harris distanced herself from the President's comments, stressing she would never criticize anyone over their voting choice. Former President Trump really leaning in here, posing in a garbage truck and a reflective vest at campaign stops in what in Wisconsin rather, on Wednesday. With more, I'm joined by my colleagues, Kevin Liptak in Washington and Steve Contorno, who is following the development in the Trump campaign from Florida. So, Steve, as we look at this, you know, Donald Trump really leaning in here. It is important to remember, he has called the entire country garbage, has called Harris supporters scum and absolute garbage in the past, but is now really leaning into these comments from President Biden. And also looking to distance himself from the comments Sunday night that started it all. Here's a moment where he tried to do that. I (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I don't know who he is. I've never seen him.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BILL CLINTON, 42ND U.S. PRESIDENT: I think part of it is that Hamas did not care about a homeland for the Palestinians. They wanted to kill Israelis and make Israel uninhabitable. Well, I got news for them. They were there first before there was their faith existed. They were there, in the time of King David, in the southernmost tribes had Judea and Samaria. When I read that people in Michigan are thinking about not voting because they're mad at the Biden Administration for honoring its historic obligation to try to keep Israel from being destroyed. I think that's a mistake, because Donald Trump has shown what he wants and I don't think it's -- and he claims it's good for Israel, but I don't think it is.

      "sentences": "You know, I think a lot of Democrats will say that there's not that the cake is kind of baked amongArab-American voters, particularly in Michigan, certainly hopes for achieving a cease fire in Gaza before the American election are almost zero at this point in the argument that you're hearing, including from Bill Clinton there, is essentially that Donald Trump would be worse for the Palestinians. Certainly, that President Biden has had his own issues in trying to achieve a peace in the Middle East, but that Donald Trump would certainly be heavily weighted on the side of Israel. And can I just say it's so fascinating to hear Bill Clinton talk about the struggles to achieve this in the Middle East. I don't think anyone understands the frustrations of American policy in that region better than him, after, you know, trying and failing at the end of his presidency to negotiate that peace between Ehud Barak and Yasser Arafat. And so certainly Bill Clinton, I think, understands this better than anyone. But I don't think if you're an Arab-American voter in Michigan that hearing that is necessarily going to alleviate any of your concerns. And certainly, when Kamala Harris has been talking about this, including last night in Wisconsin, when she was interrupted by protesters calling for a cease fire in Gaza and calling for an end to American weapon sales to Israel. Her answer has always been to point towards the necessity of that cease fire agreement, but she hasn't necessarily said how she would achieve that, how she would do that differently than what President Biden has been doing. And I think that's led to a lot of frustrations. And she has very certainly stopped short of saying that she would condition American arms shipments to Israel on its upholding of humanitarian rights in Gaza on its addressing of the humanitarian situations in these regions. And so, I think that's what's led to the frustrations. And in an election that is so razor thin in all of these battleground states, a population like Arab-Americans in Michigan could be a deciding factor. And I think that's why, you know there are so many concerns among Democrats about how the top of the ticket and how the White House has addressed this issue over the last year.",

Unclear exactly how many Palestinian prisoners would be released in exchange, but this is an attempt to kind of shake up the talks. Over the last two months, we have seen the talks really completely dead locked, but there is a hope that in the wake of the killing of Yahya Sinwar. Perhaps Hamas will reconsider its demands that the war, that any kind of cease fire, any kind of release of hostages, leads ultimately to the withdrawal of Israeli troops and the end of the war in Gaza. But that doesn't appear to be the case, at least not yet. We just heard from a top Hamas official who released the statement reiterating those previous Hamas demands. Reiterating a demand that they return to the kind of July framework that had been discussed in these negotiations. Israeli officials have really moved beyond that. They think that they are in a very different place now with the achievements of the military achievements they believe they've reached in Gaza, particularly the killing of Sinwar. But so far, it doesn't seem like Hamas is willing to engage in a different way. But of course, those talks still underway.

What the expectation is about 117,000 jobs added in October. That's the expectation. Of course, things change all the time. In September, we saw a huge jobs report, about 254,000 jobs added in the month of September. That was double what people expected. But in this particular report, Erica, there's two sort of things that we need to look at right now, because that could have an impact on this report. One of the two hurricanes that could have slowed down hiring in the month of October. And also, we've had a couple strikes, and one that is still ongoing, the Boeing strike, where you have 33,000 people off the job, and that's having a downstream ripple effect on other jobs. Some estimates suggest that, that could be a hit to the jobs report of about 100,000 jobs. So that's something to look at very closely. One thing we can use as sort of a precursor to what we're going to see tomorrow is, just yesterday we got the ADP jobs report. That's private sector jobs. Tomorrow we'll get public sector jobs, but private sector jobs really, really strong. 233,000 jobs added to the private sector. That's about double what was anticipated. So, with these jobs report, you have all these analysts trying to make predictions, but at the end of the day, the numbers have swung wildly in recent months. Over the summer, there was sort of slow hiring, but then it picked up again in September, but this October jobs report is going to be one of the last pieces of economic data that both voters are going to get about the strength of the economy, and the two candidates are going to get about the strength of the economy. So, this is going to be on top of minds for both the campaigns and voters as they head to the poll in the next couple days. Right now, what we're seeing is that there has been strong economic growth, that jobs have been added at a steady healthy pace. That is what we are expecting in this report. But you never know.
