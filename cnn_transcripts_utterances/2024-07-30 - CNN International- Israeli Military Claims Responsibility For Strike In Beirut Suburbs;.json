The Israeli military is now claiming responsibility for an attack in the southern suburbs of Beirut. You're looking at images of the destruction that followed. Israel says it targeted the commander it says was behind an attack in Israeli occupied Golan -- the Golan Heights that killed 12 children earlier this weekend. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had vowed serious consequences for that attack. Lebanese state media reports, today's strike was conducted by a drone that fired three missiles. The IDF has not provided details about how exactly the strike was carried out itself. Matthew Chance, CNN's chief global affairs correspondent, has been following events from London. Matthew, do we know yet if Israel believes that it hit the target of the strike?",

We're waiting for the battle damage assessment from the Israeli authorities, Israeli military, where they will give their intelligence assessment of that.But I mean, look at those images from the suburb of southern Beirut, which is a Hezbollah stronghold. It's clearly had a lot of damage inflicted upon it. There may well be casualties, collateral damage beyond the intended target, which was, according to Israelis, a Hezbollah commander who oversaw the killings in Majdal Shams in the occupied Golan Heights at the weekend in which 12 Israeli, sorry, 12 people, children and teenagers were killed on a soccer pitch. That is an absolutely terrible incident. The commander who's responsible for that, that's who the Israelis say they were targeting in this strike. But look at that heavily populated area, look at the damage that's been inflicted, sort of as a result of those Israeli strikes and Lebanese media is saying that there were three missiles fired into that heavily populated suburb from an Israeli drone that could we other -- other casualties. As a result, the big question of course is, will this be the start of a broader Israeli operation in southern Lebanon? There have been -- there's been lots of pressure inside Israel but for them to do that, and to try and push the Hezbollah forces in southern Lebanon back to prevent the incessant rocket attacks into the north of the country. But whether we have reached that point yet, whether this is the start of that, I think remains very much a question. I think much may depend on what the response of Hezbollah will be in the hours ahead.",

If this did hit Fu'ad Shukr, who is listed on the State Department rewards for justice program as a senior military adviser to Hezbollah's Hassan Nasrallah and it only hits, say, members of his family, then I think you might see his below respond with maybe a limited series of strikes on several Israeli military targets.The belief is that Hezbollah did not mean to hit the Druze village. It was aiming for a military target and this was a mistake. So, Israel hitting a military commander, seen by Hezbollah as a controlled tit for tat as opposed to Israel hitting a number of targets. So if this is one and done by the IDF, I think this might lead to a minor set of skirmishes back and forth. But at the border, not escalating to something larger which is Hezbollah and Iran don't seem to want at this point.",

Is it possible Israel factor that into its decision here, given -- given the notice and advance to U.S. officials?LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  They may have, Jim, but I just tell you straight up and Kim has already said, this guy is on the terrorist watch list with a potential for our $5 million reward of his killing or capture. So yeah, maybe. But what I'd also say he is he's just a bad guy. Here's the other thing. I mean, you talked about proportional response, having been a military guy providing targeting list to a civilian leader for approval, what you talk about is what is the proportional response? They did this and I've heard the last couple of days that the strike by Hezbollah was an accident or a mistake, hey, it still killed 12 civilians. And the fact of the matter is it still as a result of firing 30 missiles into Israel. So, you know, if I'm providing as a military guy to my civilian leaders, what could be a proportional response? And I have a pattern of life for Fu'ad Shukr. And I know where he is and where he's going to be. And I can target him with a couple of drones. And it will have an effect on telling Hezbollah we know where you are, and we're coming after you, and it has a secondary effect of telling the Lebanese government, these guys are operating right underneath your noses, so you better take care of them. I'd say, yeah, it's a pretty good proportional response even though, it struck in a civilian area with limited collateral damage, I'd say that's pretty good.",

And we certainly see Hamas doing that, General Hertling, John Kirby, he said in the last 24 hours that the talk, the risk of a broader war emerging from this is exaggerated. And I'd heard the same from the White House that they do not see it likely that this tit for tat series of strikes balloons into a broader regional war.I mean, do you agree with that assessment or is that too sanguine? HERTLING:  I agree, but again, Jim, it depends on what happens next. What we saw was the missile strike of the 30 missiles that kill children. That is the action. This attempt at an assassination of a terrorist leader is the reaction. Now, it's time for the counteract into the reaction. That's how these cycles go. So what is going to happen next? Well, will Lebanon and Hezbollah stand down? Will Iran tell Hezbollah to stand down? Will Israel say, okay, we've sent the message and it's going to be applied and will that cause a reduction and a constraint and further action? But truthfully, there are so many other factors that go into this. You know, Israel has been fighting now in a very intense fight in Gaza for the last nine months and they've mobilized close to 300-plus thousand of their forces, which is taking away from businesses and they'd been in the field the reservist have not been going formal private sector job. So Israel is fatigued at this point. Are they willing to open a second front into Lebanon in a higher kinetic and conventional fight that would involve an incursion by ground forces or a major air operation? I'm not sure Israel is ready for that either. So all of these things help determine what is next and I think, yeah, the message has been sent and the fact it's interesting to me, you know, the reporting that Lebanon is saying that Shukr wasn't killed tells me they know where he is or that he's still alive. That just reinforces my point of there's got to be a disconnect between the Lebanese government and the Hezbollah terrorist organization.",

Basically, what our understanding is based on what came out of this hearing today, is that about 30 seconds before the gunfire erupted, local law enforcement knew he had a gun, that information never made it to the Secret Service, didn't make it to the counter-snipers, didn't make it to the detail.That is a massive communications failure. Jim, what's supposed to happen is law enforcement supposed to get on the radio, that information is supposed to go to the command center. They're supposed to be Secret Service liaisons inside that command center. Those people are supposed to be talking because, you know, what is common here and certainly was the case at the rally is all the law enforcement is not on the same radio. The Secret Service is not on the same radio as the local law enforcement. So that's why you have this command center and people are supposed to be talking that information is supposed to go out to the details. It didn't happen. An Acting Director Ron Rowe say, you know, that is the major failure and that's something that they need to dig into as well. The other thing that we learned, Jim, is that they were offered drone support by local law enforcement and they turned the offer down. CNN has previously reported the Secret Service did not use drones at this rally. Again, what we learned today is they were offered drone support by local law enforcement and for some reason and the acting director didn't know why they turned that down. The other major breakdown that we heard about today was so he's detailed human failures, but the other major breakdown was technological. And what we learned today was that the Secret Service does have, you know, basically technology to defeat drones. And it just count based basically called a CUAS. It's a counter UAS, an unmanned aerial system.  And so -- the counter unmanned aerial system. And what that process is supposed to do is to detect and defeat drones. That system wasn't working. They couldn't get it up and running because there wasn't enough bandwidth. So when Thomas Crooks, the shooter put up a drone at 3:50 the day of the rally, 3:50 p.m., the counter, the Secret Service counter UAS system wasn't working. If it had been working, it might have detected that drone and defeated that drone. And Ron Rowe said that is really one of the points of failure here that has caused him to lose sleep because he said, I just wonder if that had and working, would -- would we have we have stopped him when he have said law enforcement saw my drone. This isn't going to happen and moved on.",
