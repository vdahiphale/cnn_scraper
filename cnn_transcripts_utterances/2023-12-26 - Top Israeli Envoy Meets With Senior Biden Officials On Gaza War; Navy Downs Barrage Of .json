He's a member of the war cabinet, and he was Israel's ambassador to the US previously under Netanyahu as well. Now, Israel, up to this point has assured the US that it plans to move toward a low-intensity war. That means more precise military operations targeting Hamas leadership. But they haven't offered a timeline as to what that looks like and when. Now, US officials have said and -- that they have anticipated that localized operations would happen sometime in January. But again publicly, US officials have not been able to offer much more detail beyond that. And so, going into these meetings, senior US officials, including the Secretary of State Antony Blinken and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan were going into this, wanting to see results. What does it look like, especially as the death toll grows in Gaza? Now, over the course of the day, senior Israeli officials expressed confidence that there -- the conversations between the US and Israel have been good and that there is no daylight because they are both on the same side.",

President Joe Biden was briefed about that attack and given options for how to respond.You're seeing on your screen here the results of the US response, attacks on three facilities the US says is used by Kata'ib Hezbollah and affiliated groups for carrying out and operating its drones. And the US trying to send a very forceful message, but calibrating that message with these strikes to try to avoid regional conflict or even a localized escalation. This, however, is very sensitive. The US generally doesn't carry out strikes in Iraq. Normally, it carries out those strikes in Syria, and that's because the US has good relations with the Iraqi government. And the US presence in Iraq relies on those relations. Still here, the Iraqi government responding very angrily, calling these hostile acts that infringe upon Iraq's sovereignty. It's also worth noting here, John, US Central Command says there were no civilians affected by the US strikes. The Iraqi government says there were civilians who were injured in the US attacks.

And as you noted, yes, he could be the 47th president. And right now, he is leading the GOP primary field. And the reason that that is notable is because we have seen him amp up his rhetoric. It's not just these attacks on Joe Biden and Jack Smith, it is the aggressive anti-immigration language. It is going after the judges in the Colorado Supreme Court for ruling against him. And we are unlikely to see any sort of toning it down and the reason being, when I talked to his advisors and his allies, they believe what he is doing is working. And they say they have the proof to back it up by showing the polls particularly out of Iowa. As we have seen him ramp up this language and rhetoric, he has actually gained points in that state. Now, obviously, a ballot hasn't been cast. We will wait to see what exactly happens in those first caucuses.

And polling shows at least for a brief window of time, Americans really want to be happy and uplifted. This monomyth (ph) poll shows, like, eight out of 10 Americans said they'd be on Santa's nice list, and nine out of 10 Americans or, you know, three or four of us want to listen to Christmas music. So this is not a conventional approach to the Christmas season. And I think it does raise new concerns about normalizing this kind of language, hoping your adversaries or people you see as your adversaries rot in hell at the presidential level.

And inside this word cloud, describing Donald Trump, it has words associated with him including revenge and dictatorship here.

JOE WALSH (R), FORMER ILLINOIS CONGRESSMAN: Because he loves it, John. He's proud of it. Donald Trump wants to be a dictator. But to what Margaret said, this isn't the story, right? Trump is a bad guy. He's a horrible guy. He's a bully. He's a jerk. The story for America in 2024 is that this is what Republican voters want. Yes, Donald Trump wants to be a dictator. He wants to have unlimited power. But the scary thing, John Berman, is Republican voters want him to be a dictator. They want him to have unlimited power. They want revenge. This is what, in 2024, America has to wake up to. This is way, way bigger than Donald Trump.

      "sentences": "Well, what the FBI is doing primarily right now, John, is assisting local law enforcement because otherwise they have to find a federal violation. Under Colorado law, making a threat against a judge or an elected member of the assembly is considered an act of retaliation.It's a class six felony. But it also spells out that it has to be a credible threat. Here's the difficulty for law enforcement. First, identifying these people with their handles and screen names, that can be done. In fact, the FBI is really good at that. Second, doing the threat assessment, which is, is this threat real? Is this person blowing steam? Is what they said, although abhorrent, a real threat, is it a credible threat? Do they need to carry it out? But the hard part is what we've learned again and again, you can pick your case. Judge Esther Salas, whose son was murdered at her home in New Jersey, who passed a law to protect judges. The Nancy Pelosi case with the home invasion where her husband was assaulted from an individual who said he intended to wait there for her and kidnap her. And it's not always the people making the threats in these forums, in these message boards, in these chat rooms, who are the ones who act. Sometimes they're the lurkers who decide, I don't have much of a voice here or a presence, but I'm going to go out and actually do something. So a lot of this has been about increasing protection.",

And the threats against the judge in the Washington, D.C., January 6th, in the election interference case. But not so much the judge in Miami where, you know, he's had some -- the point is, Donald Trump has the ability to pour gasoline on this environment by making distinct, specific, very personal attacks and saying, you know, we can't stand for this, and that gets the followers going in these chat rooms.",

One, we would issue subpoenas, preservation orders, legal process on the providers to say, we need that IP address, we need to trace that to a machine, to an address, to a person. We could do all that in many cases.The more difficult part is going out there in a case where someone has said those things and sitting them down and getting them to talk about it and then assessing, can we say this person is a real threat or not a real threat? Is this a person who's in need of medical help? Is this a person who we need to do a search warrant on for weapons? Did the threat rise to the level of violating the law? And this is a very layered and complicated process. You know, prosecutors in a First Amendment based society are pretty wary about taking on a case where they think that the threat is either not specific enough or not credible enough.

As we mentioned, with the war nearing its two-year mark, Ukraine has struggled in recent months fighting on the ground.With me now is Retired Army Major General James \"Spider\" Marks, a CNN Military Analyst. General, thanks for being with us. How significant is this Ukrainian strike on the Russian warship? MAJ. GEN. JAMES \"SPIDER\" MARKS (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, any strike that can decrease the amount of capability, capacity to conduct offensive operations that the Ukrainians can do against the Russians is a plus. It goes into the plus side of the column. The challenge is it is an amphibious landing craft and be pretty significant. And you can see from the explosion that it was loaded with ammunition. A lot of those are secondary explosions. I mean, that's quite significant. That ship is out of commission now, obviously, that's a good thing. Russia still has the law of large numbers, John.

Yet, Russia can take a blow like this and then can continue to show up. That doesn't mean they're very effective. That doesn't mean they have good leadership.
