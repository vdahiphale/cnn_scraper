The storm is up to 50 miles per hour. It's not a tropical storm now. It was subtropical, which means it's a little bit cold inside. Now it's warm. Now it's growing. Now it's beginning to gather strength. And that's why hurricane warnings are all the way from the Volusia-Flagler line all the way down to Boca.This will be a storm coming on shore at 75 maybe a few miles per hour higher than that. And that doesn't sound like a lot. But what happened here was that when the storm rolled through, and it's going to roll through the area that was damaged earlier in the year by Ian. Ian took an awful lot of sand off the east coast. And we know what it did to the west coast. But an awful, Alisyn, that didn't get covered. There was no news coverage of this, but the beaches are gone. And now another storm system is going to try to pack a three to five-foot storm surge on top of those dunes that are gone, the beaches that are gone, the sands that are washed out to sea. This could cause some significant storm surge flooding there across the East Coast, even though it's only a Category one. Obviously, Florida doesn't need any more rain, they're going to get about two or three inches here, and that's already still flooding from Ian. But back up to the north -- farther to the north. This is where the rain is going to stretch out and will do some good. The problem is by the time the storm is here, it's going to be doing 50 or 60 miles per hour. And there are still trees with leaves, not all the leaves but still some, that could bring down powerlines, could bring down trees and branches and all the like so, so many things going on here from storm surge flooding to wind damage all the way up even in toward New England, and of course, the flooding that's already going on in some of these rivers like the St. Johns River still in some spots out of its bank and more rain is coming.",

You heard both President Biden's closing argument about democracy and you heard Donald Trump who is not running for -- I mean, at the moment, we think running for anything, but he gave his closing argument that was about crime, taxes, and the border. And I believe you thought that that was effective? DR. ABDUL EL-SAYED, EPIDEMIOLOGIST &amp; FORMER DETROIT HEALTH COMMISSIONER: Well, it is their closing argument and he was entirely on message. I will say that Democrats, we've sort of swerved around a number of different closing arguments. You -- we wanted to close on abortion, swerved to democracy, and then we kind of whiffed on the economy, which is frustrating because there's so much that Democrats can talk about when it comes to the economy. You have a Republican Party that wants to mention inflation, but doesn't really want to address it. Whereas if you look at the Inflation Reduction Act, you look at the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, you look at student loan forgiveness, you've got a lot to close on there that is frankly economic. And the question here is not just who's going to handle inflation. Because this is an international question. The question is who is going to protect you from the economic insecurity of inflation?

And then very smartly, they pivoted to crime and the economy. And were very disciplined, I think, through the rest of the general election, really hammering that. They put -- they kind of put the crazy to bed for a little bit in hopes that people forgot about it. Democrats, to your point, have really not had what seems like a plan. They wanted to ride the Roe wave, which I get. They wanted to throw democracy in there is like looming over all of this. I get that, too. They didn't really deal much with the economy and they didn't deal at all with crime, except to say it was a Republican invention. I don't think they made the most of this opportunity. And look, we can't overstate. Republicans were probably going to win, right, just historically. But I don't think Democrats did the best job at closing the gap.

It's about to be silly season if Republicans take the House, honestly, I mean, using impeachment as a political tool in ways that is unjustifiable, fighting culture wars in ways that empower folks like Marjorie Taylor Greene, that's going to be what Congress looks like if Republicans take power.
