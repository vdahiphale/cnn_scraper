You heard immediately from people like Elise Stefanik, who's in Republican leadership, Steve Scalise, the majority leader, and the House speaker himself, who tweeted, quote, today is indeed a dark day for the United States of America. It is unconscionable for a president to indict the leading candidate opposing him. Joe Biden kept classified documents for decades. I, and every American who believe in the rule of law, stand with President Trump against this grave injustice. House Republicans will hold this brazen weaponization of power accountable.Now, he didn't specify specifically how the House of Representatives is going to respond, but Jim Jordan, a Republican and the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, also came out yesterday on Twitter defending the former president. Obviously keep all eyes on his committee as to whether or not they take any actions, whether that's to defund the FBI or Justice Department in upcoming weeks. The other thing to keep an important eye on is this split that we are seeing between Republican leaders in the House of Representatives, who quickly came out to defend Trump, and those in the U.S. Senate. We have not heard from Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. We have not heard from the Republican whip, John Thune. And it's important to note that during the last indictment, John, we really never got an answer from McConnell on what his view was. Instead, just responding to our colleague Manu Raju at the time when he returned from the Senate after falling that he might have hit his head but he had not hit it that hard. In other words, dodging the question all together, John.",

Former Vice President Mike Pence has called the U.S. attorney general, Merrick Garland, and demanded that he unseal the federal indictment that we have been hearing about. He has called Merrick Garland's office and made this demand, saying that he thinks the Justice Department should release this before the sun sets today.And I just want to clarify, he called on Merrick Garland. He didn't talk to him on the phone. He called on Merrick Garland to unseal the documents. That the public should be able to see and make a judgment for themselves what these charges are and whether they believe in all of the facts. We are witnessing a truly extraordinary moment in American history. The enormity of it cannot be overstated. Donald Trump is the first former president in the nearly 250-year history of the United States to face federal charges. To help us put all of this in perspective, presidential historian Douglas Brinkley joins us now. He is a professor of history at Rice University. Can you just begin with the enormity of this and the history of our country. This has never happened.",

And one just has to be -- sit back and be staggered that the GOP doesn't -- meaning leaders in the Republican Party -- don't immediately turn on Donald Trump with this release.It's been an odd week. We've had three Republicans, you know, GOPers joining the presidential campaign for 2024. Donald Trump is going to overshadow this. But I'm really alarmed by the transcript that CNN has produced.",

We just don't have moderate Republicans like Howard Baker of Tennessee or conservatives like Barry Goldwater of Arizona. Back then, the fact that Nixon broke the law was enough to make them realize that wasn't the Republican Party. Donald Trump has been able to hijack the Republican Party.[09:35:04] And, you know, I usually -- it's a big debate in history, was Gerald Ford right to pardon Nixon? I've always thought Ford was right to heal the country pardoning Nixon, but in recent years I realized it was probably a mistake for the reason that it encourages the arrogance of President Trump. This feeling that he's above the law, that the Constitution doesn't matter. That you can have an authoritarian vent and do anything you want in the United States. So, I find it encouraging that the Justice Department, with all the noise going on now, is focusing on this and telling Donald Trump he's not above the law. And it's going to be a spring/summer of indictments, but we are in a strange political atmosphere right now because some Republicans will claim that Joe Biden, the president, is trying to put his chief GOP rival in jail.",

Joining me now for some more reaction to all of this and the new reporting this morning, former Trump White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Matthews. Sarah, thank you so much for coming in. And we just got in more reaction and a statement from an interview of Mike Pence, as we were just reporting on, Sara was just talking about in the last block. I think we have a bit of this interview that he gave with Hugh Hewitt talking about what he wants to see now, calling on the attorney general to unseal the indictment. Let's listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MIKE PENCE (R), FORMER U.S. VICE PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The Justice department, I think before the sun sets today, the attorney general of the United States should be standing in front of the American people, should unseal this indictment, should provide the American people with all the facts and information here.
