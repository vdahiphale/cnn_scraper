According to the gun violence archive, the US has seen more than five hundred mass shootings so far this year. The agency defines a mass shooting as one where at least four people are shot or killed in a single event. Now while the US as a whole sees hundreds of incidents of gun violence, this is unusual for Maine.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SUSAN COLLINS, U.S. SENATE REPUBLICAN: Maine, as I point out, has one of the highest rates of gun ownership in the country, and has a long heritage of responsible gun ownership. It had also had a very low rate of gun violence. What makes this crime so heinous is, in a typical year, Maine might have 22 murders, and last night we almost approached the number for the entire year. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Officials say these facilities were used and assisted in this series of attacks we have seen. Since October 17th, the Pentagon says we've seen 19 attacks, drone attacks and rocket attacks against US forces in these countries resulting in more than 20 minor injuries and one US civilian contractor who was killed as a result of a false alarm, because of a belief of another one of these attacks. Given the situation, the US felt it had to respond. But the US and defense secretary Lloyd Austin were very clear in this warning, describing these as self-defense strikes that were narrowly targeted to protect US forces but also to send a message that there would be more strikes if the attacks on US forces continue. And I'll read you a post of Austin's statement here. First, attributing these to Iran, pinning this on Iran. Iran wants to hide its hand and deny its role in these attacks against our forces. We will not let them. If attacks by Iran's proxies against US forces continue, we will not hesitate to take further necessary measures to protect our people. And then, these narrowly tailored strikes in self- defense were intended solely to protect and defend US personnel in Iraq and Syria. We have already seen the US bolster its force presence in the region because of a worry of escalation on the part of Iran's proxies, and that would be Hezbollah in Lebanon as well as these Iranian proxies in Iraq and Syria. The US, deploying and in the process of deploying nine hundred troops to the region, including a THAAD air defense battery and pagery air defense systems. And that's on top of everything we have already seen the US move to the region, two carrier strike groups, an amphibious ready group, all as a warning to Iran to stay out of this fight. The question now, of course, is did these airstrikes and these targets on facilities used by Iran's IRGC and affiliated groups, did that get the message and has deterrence been restored or does this continue? The US trying very hard to make sure the conflict in Gaza does not spread to the wider region, even as we have seen anti-US and anti- Israel protests across the Middle East.
