      "sentences": "Good evening. I'm Erin Burnett.OUTFRONT tonight, President Biden speaks to the nation, in his first televised speech from the Oval Office. And tonight's message in this address will be one of victory for the president, because it comes less than 24 hours after Congress passed that bipartisan bill allowing Washington to pay its bills, right? To raise the debt ceiling. A major win for the president, and it does follow weeks of tense negotiations, and some very dire warnings of economic catastrophe. A deal that cuts spending and extend the debt ceiling coming just days from what would have a devastating default, right? And we had heard that from bank CEOs, not just from politicians. Tonight's speech also coming on the heels of what was a blockbuster jobs report, nearly 340,000 jobs added in the month of May. That was a stunning number, and it did send the Dow surging more than 700 points. So this is a significant event, this Oval Office address the first of his presidency. Phil Mattingly is live outside the White House where the president will be speaking just a few minutes. Of course, Phil, this is a Friday night, it is a summer Friday night. What more are you learning about why now and what we can expect when the president tonight?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Erin, when this is put in the schedule last night, it was certainly an interesting development for a president that is never given Oval Office remarks in an even incapacity before now, despite the kind of historical significance of that moment, but also the timeline itself.The way it has been framed, to me, from White House officials and I think you can see this from the excerpts we've seen from the president's remarks that he will be given shortly is this is a moment after the passage of this legislation on its way to the White House that underscores two things. One, just how grave the lawmakers try to negotiate this, just how great this was potentially for the U.S. economy. I think it's something that White House officials in the president to underscore. This is an, despite the fact, it feels like we've had these moments repeatedly over the course of the last ten, 11, 12 years. This one was different. This one is very dicey for a period of time, and yet, the White House negotiators, with their House Republican counterparts, were able to reach an outcome, a bipartisan outcome and a very big vote in the House that the president will emphasize. But also, one that White House officials believe on net is a win, or at worst may be a wash in the sense that it does not dramatically affect any of their major legislative priorities the president got across the finish line over the course of his first two years. Even some of the issues that progressives have had with this legislation, they feel like work requirements specifically, they were able to mitigate some of what Republicans wanted. I think more broadly, they feel like they kept out the vast majority of the Republican priorities in this agreement. But more than anything else, Erin, I think particularly on this day we can see that jobs number, the wreckage of the U.S. economy's durability, and stability over the last several months has really defined the predictions of Wall Street, of economists, is the fact that the issue of default is off the table, it has been hanging over the White House and the president for the better part of the last six months. Getting this off the table, given where the economy still is at this moment in time, and looking at weeks, and months ahead where these major legislative buyer tolls and self-imposed crises are simply not on the radar there was an opportunity here to turn the page. That is something the president will focus on.",

They have agreed to get past the 2024 election in 2025, which politically I realize the significance.So, of course, Phil is staying with us. I also want to bring Jeff Zeleny, Van Jones, Rina Shah, and Michael Smerconish in just these couple of minutes here before we anticipate the president will enter the Oval Office. Michael, this is Biden's first speech from the Oval Office. But as I mentioned, it is a summer Friday. What do you make of his choice of venue and time? MICHAEL SMERCONISH, CNN HOST, \"SMERCONISH\": I find it very unusual. I think he is entitled to a victory lap, but listening to fill, it doesn't make sense to me that the purpose is to educate about a grave danger averted. If you are such a grave danger, then a week ago would've been the appropriate time to deliver these remarks. The cynic in me says it's intended to dilute the image of the president taking that stumble at the Air Force Academy, and to end the week on a positive note because he did have a major achievement.",

For the president, yes, for doing what he said he would do, work with Republicans and for Speaker McCarthy, yes, as well.He has been underestimated throughout the first part of this year. The White House never thought he would be able to keep his Republicans unified. That is what happened. I can tell you, being out here for several days talking to voters on both sides, there's not a lot of applause for Washington. There's not a lot of credit for averting a crisis from happening. But there is no doubt, President Biden despite if he doesn't on a Friday night, how we consume the news now and everything that is chopped up and shared on social media, this will get into the bloodstream. That is what we are trying to do. I think Michael is probably correct. The White House is very savvy. They want to remove the images of the fall. This is also something that they want to tout. But, bottom line, it's hard to imagine this helping him in the long term for 2024. BURNETT: Yeah, I guess that is the big question. The president is about to begin speaking in the Oval Office.

He did interestingly in all of this make sure to count something Democrats really wanted and that had really caused many Republicans who opposed it to go ahead with opposition of the vote and that was to tout some of the additional funding for the IRS. So, our panel is back with me now. Phil Mattingly, just to ask you, you know, your sense when you heard that. Obviously, he was talking about how he protected Social Security and Medicare, those important things for seniors, but he did make a point of both complimenting the Republicans, which is a double edge sword, and touting the IRS.",

My response was exactly.And while that might seem a little bit strange, given the fact it's an Oval Office address, given the fact it's a Friday, this has been the theory of the case. This is what his theory of the case was during the campaign. And I think you listen to the speech, understanding where his priorities were and what he has long been focused on, what his messages and will be over the course of the next 15, 16 months, like yes compromise is important, bringing down the temperature is important, being willing to negotiate is important. On policy and in order to govern, not on principles, and by that, I mean, he's focused on the fact that Medicare and Social Security were kept out, to your point about the legislative priorities and legislative winds he had in the first two years to ensure that those were largely untouched, except for the shifting of that IRS funding, but making very clear that the willingness and ability to talk to Republicans and get bipartisan agreement was important. There was no dramatic new development or announcement or policy in these remarks.

Trump took a different tone every time. Biden, what you see is what you get, and there's a lot to bite off tonight and in tonight's remarks. He really ran the gamut, talking from the deficit, cutting spending, complement and Republicans as you said, but a couple of things I liked. I like that he used line that I said no. I think that was strong. He wanted to show that he is still here and still in command and able to do the job cognitively. That's really big. But the other part that I didn't love because I don't think this is going to have an impact. When we go to the store shelves what we feel and what do we see?

So, there's just -- I think for those of us that expect something new or dramatic or exciting or interesting or different, he's like that old slugger that goes up there every time and hits a triple and then goes back to the dugout.

But in the era of Trump, and after he's been gone now, what you hear from Republicans is look at him saying what feels right to him, saying what feels natural and maybe saying what may not be politically popular. So, a lot of defense for the former president posture towardsdictators because what I keep hearing over and over each week as I talk to people who voted for Trump in 2016 and again in 2020 and maybe even considering doing it again, they say he keeps people on their feet. He keeps our enemies on their feet. He creates chaos that gets people wondering, well, what are we going to do now? Are we going to be friends with North Korea? I think what he saw in (AUDIO GAP) is literally what just came to him, is that a leader was able to get something done that they did not think he could do. So, that is Trump (AUDIO GAP) is being more of the same, and it doesn't make sense for the policies that the United States should have toward enemies, but that is our former president and that is what a lot of Republican voters like about him. He says what feels natural and what they are thinking.",

She spent more time in space than any other American, and she's already thinking about her next mission, telling reporters, quote, I'm ready, let's go.Now, this comes after she just spent ten days leading a crew to the International Space Station, adding to the staggering 675 days she's spent in space. And Peggy Whitson joins me OUTFRONT now. Peggy, thank you so much. It is such an honor to be able to speak with you. And, you know, just thinking about all of the experiences you've had in your career, the times you have gone up into space. This time it was a private space flight. I know if I'm right, you went up with Axiom. You came back in a SpaceX capsule. How is it different doing that than working for NASA? PEGGY WHITSON, RECORD-BREAKING ASTRONAUT: Well, it is a different mission, mostly because the objectives are different. NASA has a certain set of objectives that, as an astronaut, I was able to contribute to. And it was a very satisfying and gratifying. But space industry is changing now. And exploration is changing. If you look at NASA's plan to go back to the lunar surface, you know, Axiom space will be one of the companies that is providing lunar suits for the astronauts who will walk on the moon. Other companies are providing rovers and space communication capabilities. So, it's really an exciting time to be a part of space as it is changing. The Axiom 2 mission was exciting because it was the first time we had private and government astronauts represented on a mission like this. And it was fun for me because I had a great crew, number one. But it was -- it's neat to be a part of this process, as we change. And Axiom's objective is to increase access to space, to governments, individuals, and institutions who want to fly research or people into space. And get access that maybe before they didn't have.",
