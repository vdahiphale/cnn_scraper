They also revised the number of people killed to 14. The 15th person who died was the terrorist who plowed into a crowd on Bourbon Street in a rented pickup truck.This morning, authorities trying to answer questions as to how several warning signs were missed before 42-year-old Army veteran Shamsud-Din Jabbar's deadly attack. Sources say, a search of a Houston home related to Jabbar found chemicals typically used to build explosives. Now, we want to show you some footage obtained by CNN, a Ring camera capturing him just hours before the attack, loading several items into his truck, and authorities say surveillance camera images show the suspect planting coolers loaded with explosives in two other locations in the French Quarter. A remote detonator was found in his vehicle. Questions are also being raised about security efforts to protect Bourbon Street from an attack of this magnitude. A 2019 report by a private security firm warned. There was a need for an immediate improvement on security barriers in the French Quarter, and it said the likelihood of terrorism involving mass shootings or car attacks was, quote, highly possible while moderately probable. CNN's Ryan Young is live on the scene. He's been covering the story from the start. You have the very latest on the investigation. What are you learning this morning, Ryan?",

Now that we know and we've seen parts of that report, you understand why there are people here who are asking questions about what the next steps are, especially when it comes to improving security in this area before the Super Bowl.But if you look behind me, that's where the accident pretty much came to an end down this part of Bourbon Street. We're a little bit above at this point. This street has been hardened over the last 24 hours. They have large trucks on either end. They put barriers up towards sidewalks to make sure folks can't just come through anymore. This street was opened yesterday and in fact they did a second line. Now, that's part of almost a celebration here in New Orleans as they try to memorialize the people who lost their lives here. So, we watched the mayor and the police chief and clergy members all moving together to symbolize the reopening of this famous street here, placed 14 roses down. But you can still understand the pain that is connected with what surrounded this area, the bodies that were just strewn up and down the street. We actually talked to Matthew Tenedorio's family about the sudden loss and the tragic ending of his life. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I mean, if you're Speaker Mike Johnson this morning, you are staring down these votes, and it's not clear right now if this race is locked up for him.We do know, as you just heard from Thomas Massie, that he'll be voting against Speaker Johnson and he's going to be voting for another candidate. That means Johnson cannot lose a single other Republican who would vote for another candidate. That's assuming everyone's in full attendance and Democrats are all voting for Hakeem Jeffries. But I'll just walk you through the last 24 hours. Speaker Mike Johnson has been having phone calls. He has been having meetings with some of these holdouts, and some of them are insisting on some changes structurally. They want promises about how Johnson's going to handle future spending bills. They want promises that he'll include spending cuts in some of those negotiations. And they also just want some other promises that Johnson is going to bring members into the fold sooner when he's negotiating big pieces of legislation. Think that tax bill that has to pass in the next 12 months. Those are the kinds of things that some of these Republican holdouts are asking for. But right now, we're looking at about ten Republicans who have either not committed to Johnson or say that they want other commitments from Mike Johnson. That is a difficult way to head into a day that you're hoping to clinch the speaker's gavel. Again, here are some of the comments we're hearing from holdouts and Johnson allies. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. LAUREN BOEBERT (R-CO):  I do believe that Mike Johnson coming out and committing to Chip Roy being the chairman of the Rules Committee would secure the vote on the first round. REP. VICTORIA SPARTZ (R-IN):  As of right now, if we don't have concrete commitment from Speaker Johnson, I am not going to be supporting him tomorrow, but I'm open minded. I'm going to talk to some other members and hopefully we can act with him later tonight or tomorrow morning and figure out if we can actually make real changes in this institution. REP. NICK LALOTA (R-NY):  Two years ago, there was a 15 round knockout drag out fight. This may be more like a pillow fight. Despite a couple of my colleagues dissenting a little bit over the last couple of weeks, I think we'll come together. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Does he start to soften on that position once we go round after round and he still doesn't have the speakership? I think that remains to be seen, John.",

Or will they even try again to arrest South Korea's suspended president, Yoon Suk Yeol? But to give you an idea of the backdrop that we have right now, all the people, the hundreds of people who you see standing a few blocks with all of their South Korean flags, those are supporters of South Korea's suspended President Yoon Suk Yeol.And for his part, Yoon issued a clarion call as soon as this warrant for his arrest was issued on Tuesday, and he sent a letter to supporters paraphrasing here. Saying, hey, I need you all to come out and make it much harder for law enforcement to detain, make it much harder for law enforcement to arrest me. And they answered that clarion call. So, fast forward to earlier this morning, we have not only his supporters, but the equivalent of South Korea's Secret Service protecting the president and refusing to turn over suspended President Yoon Suk Yeol to investigators, investigators who want to hold him accountable for putting this country down the road of martial law, declaring martial law one month ago on December 3rd into the early morning hours of December 4th. So, this is dealing with criminal charges. Meantime, we have new reporting that the suspended president, Yoon Suk Yeol has his first date of his impeachment trial, the first trial session of the impeachment saga, which is set for January 14th. So, in some, we're waiting to see the next move. What will prosecutors and investigators do? Will they try again to bring South Korea's suspended President Yoon Suk Yeol into custody?",
