Well, we've been talking the last couple of days about the checks, the welfare checks that were being carried out both by the police and National Guard troops.The National Guard was going to neighborhoods that lost power to make sure they're doing OK and don't need anything. Meanwhile, emergency services people and police have been trying to check on the 1,100 911 calls made during the height of the blizzard. All of is what's adding to that death toll. In in addition to that, the snow melting in some area. If you think about the fact that 17 of the 39 people confirmed dead by the medical examiner in Erie County, 17 of them were found outside. There's still large piles of snow even as they begin to melt around here. Listen to what Mark Poloncarz -- he's the Erie County executive -- had to say about the additional bodies they found.

The governor of New York, Kathy Hochul, has directed state agencies to be prepared for that. They're sending things like sandbags and personnel and pumps to pump water in case the flooding issue does become a problem. Just in that press conference a while ago, Mark Poloncarz says they don't think it's going to be major. They're going to see waterway crest. But they don't expect to see ice jamming things up and major flooding. But they are prepared just in case. One thing that I want to point out that was remarkable was that Poloncarz has been complaining -- he complained publicly at least last night about the lack of coordination with Buffalo city mayor, Byron Brown. He used the beginning of that press conference to apologize several times, saying he lost focus. And the focus should be on the families who are missing ones and, on this recovery, and not so much on that back and forth. He said he reached out to the mayor and hopes to connect with him to talk about this -- Sara?",

They remain low, not much above the pre-COVID levels.This is a sign that a lot of bosses don't want to let go of the workers they have because there's a worker shortage. They're worried they won't be able to get new workers. Claims remain well below the level that would cause economists to be worried. In fact, Moody's economist, Mark Zandi, told me today he believes the jobless claims is a key reason why this economy could avoid a recession next year. Now, you mentioned mortgage rates. They did tick higher. And 6.4 percent is the latest average that comes after six straight weeks of falling rates. But 6.4 percent that is more than twice as high as they were a year ago. That is a big deal. Let me show what you that works out to, in terms of your calculations if you're a home buyer. On a $500,000 home a year ago, versus now, your monthly payments are $800 higher. Remember, that's not going to get you an exercise room or a nicer kitchen.",

This is the worst year for the S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ since 2008. Some stocks did well. If you look at the biggest winners, they're oil and gas companies, Exxon, Hess, Occidental Petroleum. All of them skyrocketed this year. That's because those companies are making more money as oil and gas prices went higher. On the negative side, some losers, Meta, Facebook, Tesla, all of them down 60 percent or more. Listen, this bad year for the market is almost over. In about 25 hours, it will be done.
