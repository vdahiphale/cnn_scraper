They're seen as something that France should be deciding for himself -- for itself is very worrying. I think the one grain of truth in what she said, in terms of her characterization of the party is the way that the Rassemblement National has broadened its base in over the last decade or so is by adding a socio economic element to its agenda.So it allows itself to speak very much for the people.

They frequently have specialists who were there on rotation. They come once a month.Like myself, I've been treated there for different things when I worked there. The two different times that I worked at the White House, on the White House grounds. So it's not unusual for a doctor to come once a month that it's a specialist from Walter Reed. The med unit is operated by the military, so it's 100 percent normal -- normal operating procedure. I would venture to guess there was also a dermatologist. There is also maybe a physical therapist or other doctors that have specialty that also come to the med unit.",

This company is not saying all that much, only that it has reached an agreement in principle with the Department of Justice.Here are the terms of that deal according to the federal government. Boeing is being fined $487 million. The Department of Justice says that is the maximum fine allowed by law. The government will also be appointing an independent compliance monitor to oversee Boeing for the next three years. And that monitor will give reports to the court each year. The biggest part of this is Boeing agreeing to plead guilty to criminal charges. Remember, this is for the 737 Max 8 crashes, the Lion Air crash in 2018, the Ethiopian Air crash in '19 -- 346 people killed in those two crashes abroad. Boeing agreeing to plead guilty to defrauding the Federal Aviation Administration about the Max 8, that Boeing hid major design changes that led to those two crashes. Originally, Boeing was able to reach a settlement with the government to avoid criminal charges for those crashes but that deal also came with three years of probation and the January 5th door plug blowout on the Alaska Airlines 737 MAX 9 happened just days before that deal was set to expire. So that made the Department of Justice look at that original deal again and ultimately triggered this new deal. Victims' families are calling it a sweetheart deal. They wanted Boeing to face a nearly $25 billion fine. Paul Cassell is the attorney leading the civil case, and in a statement he says, \"This sweetheart deal fails to recognize that because of Boeing's conspiracy, 346 people died. This deceptive and generous deal is clearly not in the public interest.\" Of note here is that Boeing executives avoided criminal charges themselves. The Department of Justice says this deal gives them no immunity. That applies to the Max 8 crashes as well as the door plug incident of earlier this year. Back to you. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
