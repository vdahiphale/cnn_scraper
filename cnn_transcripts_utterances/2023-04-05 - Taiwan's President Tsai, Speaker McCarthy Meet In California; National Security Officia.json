Right now, in the outskirts of Los Angeles, Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen is meeting with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and other bipartisan leaders. It comes as Taipei's relations with China steadily crumbled and U.S.-Chinese tensions continually rise over aggressive spying in Beijing's support for Russia.",

Next hour, we do expect Speaker McCarthy and President Tsai to deliver joint statements from the Reagan Presidential Library and we will bring those to you live.Joining us now is CNN's senior international correspondent Will Ripley who's in Taipei and CNN chief White House correspondent Phil Mattingly. So, Will, the last time that Tsai of course met with the house speaker, we know the reaction there. Beijing launching extensive military drills in response. What are the concerns today about a similar retaliation? WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Well, so far, the Taiwanese defense ministry is not detecting a huge uptick in Chinese military activity around Taiwan, although there was an aircraft carrier group that was apparently heading out towards the Western Pacific that they're monitoring very closely. At this stage, a lot of analysts believe that this will probably not be as severe of a response as we saw last August after Nancy Pelosi took off from Taipei and China kicked off unprecedented military drills, including firing missiles over Taiwan, not to mention simulating a blockade of the island, which would be the first step that China would take theoretically if there were an actual invasion. Of course, it was clearly an attempt to not only intimidate Taiwan but warn the United States that these kinds of high-level exchanges are just not acceptable to the Communist Party leadership because they don't want to see the third in line to the U.S. presidency, the House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, meeting with Taiwan's president because they don't think that Taiwan's democratically elected government by the 24 million people who live here is actually legitimate. The CCP, the Communist Party thinks that they should be the ones in control this island. They've claimed it for more than 70 years, ever since the end of China's civil war, but they've never actually controlled it. But China has a lot to lose if they actually do -- you know, stage these large-scale military drills. That could further alienate the West. It would distract from Xi Jinping's meeting on Thursday with the French president and the president of the EU Commission who are in Beijing. And so, the -- you know obviously, China and his military might feel that they have to do something to show, you know, defiance and anger about this visit. But will they go as far as they did less than a year ago? That is the very big and open question right now.",

But you underscored, Bianna, a reality here. The choreography. This isn't officially to be called a visit.That use of the word transit is very intentional to make through -- make clear that in the mind of the U.S. officials in the official dome, I guess if you will, of what's actually going on here, the Taiwanese president is actually going through the United States not having a visit directed at the United States. I think it's those dynamics when you put it into the full context of a bilateral relationship between the U.S. and China, that has been just at heightened tensions that only seem to be accelerating over the course of the last several weeks that you reach this point where they are out right now and where U.S. officials are watching very closely for that response that they've been urging Chinese officials over the course of the last several days not to actually engage it.",

He is a columnist for the Washington Post and the author of Chaos Under Heave: Trump, Xi, And The Battle For The 21st Century. Josh, always good to have you on. So, as we just heard out from Phil, you have the United States in Thai play -- Taipei downplaying this visit, calling it a transit stop. Is that an effective and value-added approach at this point in the relationship between the two? I mean, you know that China's going to react the way that it has and said that this is unacceptable. Does it bring any added value to sort of tiptoe around it?",

      "sentences": "Right, it's a great question. I think it's clear that both the governments in Washington and Taipei do see some value in not being as provocative as they could be when these types of visits which are a regular occurrence do what happened. And that means Tsai is not making a lot of speeches. She's not giving any press interviews. They call it a transit stop when everybody knows it's a visit, not a transit stop.The problem is that over the years, the Chinese Communist Party has been less and less willing to understand those gestures and respond in a similar way. And actually, what they've done is they've ramped up their aggressiveness, they've ramped up their coercion of Taiwan, and they've taken those concessions as weakness and used that to escalate and change the status quo, vis-a-vis, China and Taiwan's military to military relationship. And this is a huge problem because if you think about it, their -- Tsai is in an impossible position. She needs to do these visits. They're important for democracies. They have to talk to each other. They have to talk to people in all of these countries in order to be a healthy functioning democratic country. At the same time, they have no interest in provoking outright conflict with China. And that's the balancing act that Tsai is engaged in right now, especially in California. HILL: There's also the balancing act that the administration is engaged in, right? So, to Bianna's point and to Phil's point about the very, very clear use of language, John Kirby, even earlier today, going out of his way to say, look, this isn't uncommon. This happens. But also, by the way, it's not official, wouldn't address whether there were perhaps discussions with the administration with Speaker McCarthy pride or -- prior to heading out to California. But he was very clear, Josh, to say that the administration -- that members of the administration did make clear to China how they felt about potential overreaction. How is that choreography helping, if at all?",

And that has been the focus -- bipartisan focus really in the administration here and amongst Democrats and Republicans.But you write about the threat that's non-military towards Taiwan, and that is a campaign of political, economic, and psychological aggression that you think and it looks like President Tsai also believes could be actually the biggest threat coming from China, and their possible number one option before going to military.

I -- you know, I think a lot of times in Washington we can get caught up in seeing Taiwan as just some sort of irritant in the U.S.-China relationship and not an actual country that hasn't a functioning healthy democracy that's under attack not militarily right now but in lots and lots of other ways. We're talking about massive political interference, economic coercion, information, warfare, cyber warfare. It's not a coincidence that China invited the former Taiwanese president from opposition party to counterprogram against Tsai's trip to the United States. And this is a real threat but it's a harder one to talk about because we're not good at dealing with disinformation and cyberattacks and political interference.And the Taiwanese are saying we need to focus more on that and less on the attack because if China can secure control over Taiwan without attacking, they will. That's what they're going to try first. And then if that fails, then they reserve the right to just invade and kill a lot of people, which would be horrible. But we can't just focus on one and not the other. We have to focus on them both because they're both threats that the Taiwanese people are facing every day.",

That is one of several ongoing criminal probes that Trump is facing now. One of the top -- former top officials who has testified is Ken Cuccinelli, who was the second in command at DHS in the waning days of the Trump administration. His boss -- or then-boss, Chad Wolf also testified before the grand jury telling -- and they both told them something similar that you know, they were asked if DHS could cease voting machines, if it had the authority to cease voting machines, and they both said no. Now, we also know that Trump continued to entertain the idea of potentially using federal agencies to cease voting machines all the way up into the immediate run-up of January 6, but this new -- these new details from our sources about closed-door testimony really do give a rare window into what prosecutors are looking at, at least, as one part of the investigation into efforts to overturn the election.",

Well, what is the exact violation? Bragg talked about it. Is it possible tax violation that makes this a felony? What is that violation? So, I think they're going to probe for that, they're going to get discovery, get the evidence. But as this is going on to the court of public opinion, Donald Trump should not say some of the terrible and threatening things that he said over the past weeks. He should not attack the judge, but he does need -- if I were advising him, I would tell him he needs to keep his base strong. Why? Because more cases are likely coming. Perhaps next, in Georgia from Fanni Willis or from the federal special counsel Jack Smith, hurdling forward on his investigations of the Mar-a-Lago documents and of January 6.",
