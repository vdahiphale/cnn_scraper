They say the polls showed he was going to lose in 2020. The polls showed that Democrats were going to lose in the midterms in 2022. That didn't exactly happen, so it wouldn't happen this time. Well, how true is that history exactly?With us now, CNN senior data reporter Harry Enten for something of a history lesson, Harry.",

Right now Donald Trump leads in an aggregate of national polls by about three percentage points. If you go back four years ago at this point, Joe Biden was ahead by nine points. This, right now, don't look anything like what we saw four years ago at this point. I then decided to take it a step further. What was Biden's worst 2020 polling position? He was ahead by four points, which basically match what he ended up beating Donald Trump by in the national popular vote. So, this three-point advantage for Donald Trump is Donald Trump's best position versus Joe Biden, whether you include the polls this year or you include the polls last cycle. The idea that the polls underestimated Joe Biden last time around, simply put, does not hold any water, Mr. Berman.",

You have to go all the way back to 2000, to George W. Bush being ahead in the early July polls, you have to go all the way back to the end of the 20th century, beginning of the 21st century, to find a Republican ahead at this. Twenty-four years.

The duration is really what is making this so difficult.If we can just take a look at a few different cities that have hit all-time records or daily records. We saw Las Vegas hit its hottest temperature ever on record, 120 on Sunday. And it has been over 110 degrees in Vegas every day since Wednesday. That is the longest stretch of that kind of heat ever for that city. You mentioned Death Valley hitting 128 on Sunday. It could hit 130 by Tuesday. And that is over the weekend where we saw a motorcyclist die from heat exposure. A few other motorcyclists were treated on scene. Some others taken to the hospital. And authorities said that due to the high temperatures, emergency medical flights, helicopters, were unable to respond as they generally can't fly over 120 degrees. And then, in Portland, you saw 100 degrees as well. We also are seeing the CDC and other federal agencies start to track just out of 100,000 overall ER visits in a given area, how many of those are heat-related illnesses. And just looking at the data from Friday to Saturday, I did see those numbers tick up. And they especially marked areas on the long - along the West Coast where there were surprisingly high number of those heat-related ER visits. One spot in Nevada. One spot in Oregon. Now, the multi-day nature of this is really what's creating a difficult situation, not just high temperatures during the day, but high overnight lows as well. So not really giving people enough adequate break to really get cool from this heat or get any relief from it. Of course, very dangerous for firefighting as well. You've got several large wildfires up and down the West Coast right now, including the Lake Fire in Santa Barbara. That is near what is now Sycamore Valley Ranch, what you might know previously as Neverland Ranch. And not in danger at the moment, but the U.S. Forest Service did say that that ranch does have some firefighting capacity themselves.
