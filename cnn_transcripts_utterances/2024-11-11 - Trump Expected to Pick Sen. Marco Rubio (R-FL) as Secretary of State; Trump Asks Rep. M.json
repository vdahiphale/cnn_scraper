How is Marco Rubio any different than the former secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, or Nikki Haley, the former U.N. ambassador? I mean, it's clearly someone who is considered a neo con, and for so long, this was part of the reason why he wasn't chosen as vice president. I mean, there was an argument made internally that he was too much of a neo con and that was by Don Jr., and that's why they went with J.D. Vance.I do know that Marco Rubio got priority above others because he was on the short list for V.P., and also Susie Wiles, the chief of staff, was really pushing hard for Marco Rubio. And I think if anything, this shows the power that Susie Wiles has in picking these positions. Marco Rubio is a former client of Susie Wiles. They are very close. And she was lobbying very hard for him to be vice president for the running mate position, and she lost that one. But I think this time she put her foot down and made sure that Marco got this role.",

I mean, he, you know, grew so frustrated with Jeff Sessions, who he had picked to be his attorney general, fired him, blocked him from getting back into the U.S. Senate.So, if I were a U.S. senator, I'm not sure I would want one of these jobs, because who knows if Trump is going to fire you in a year because he decides that you do, in fact, conflict with his vision in one way or another, and then may even further impede your political career. So, I think it's interesting that Rubio wants to be in the cabinet. FMR. REP. MONDAIRE JONES (D-NY):  We've already seen Marco Rubio evolve his position on the Russia-Ukraine war. A few months ago, he said that Ukraine has to end this war. It has to be done through negotiated settlement. And, of course, what that reads like to me is Ukraine needs to give up something to Russia, which would be horrible. And I don't think the Marco Rubio of old would have supported that kind of position. So, I think you already see, to Scott's point, this nominee in particular changing his views to become more palatable to the incoming president of the United States.",

And so I think, you know, I wouldn't put too much weight on one poll question. I would put more weight on the election result, where you saw that obviously Trump won, but then also you saw that when you ask people, who do you trust more on immigration, Trump almost always won that question, which I think suggests that people in a vague sense want the more hardline approach on immigration.Now, the thing about, you know, mass deportations and, you know, the, whatever it is, 20 million unauthorized immigrants in the United States, is it's logistically impossible to deport that large number of people, even if you want to. And the Trump administration is not going to do it. There could be a really substantial increase in interior enforcement in a way that could be, you know, somewhat effective, could be very disruptive, but it's not going to remove en masse this entire group of people. So if that's what people are actually expecting from Trump, then they're not going to get it. But I think that, you know, in terms of what were voters looking for here, I think they want less chaos at the border. I think they want, you know, some of the changes that have happened over the last year. I think people expect a continuation improvement on that, a return to a situation that's more like before the Biden administration. But the politics of this changed because the situation on the ground changed, because you had this massive wave of immigration that was not authorized by U.S. policy. You've had all of this gaming of our asylum system. And so I think there is a mandate for Trump to do something here. I just think that it is a complicated and expensive area to execute.

So, it is Veterans Day and Governor Westmore of Maryland made Harriet Tubman an honorary one-star general. Her family was there, it was an incredible moment. It was a deeply moving moment. But for me, especially in a time where it really feels like black women, black history, black studies is under attack. This is a really important reminder of the sanctity, of the importance, of the significance of somebody like Harriet Tubman, that her history is American history. But also that she is the truest kind of patriot because she fought for freedom, she fought for her country and she fought for democracy. So, here's to General Tubman.",

And so, the results are always inaccurate. In particular, people are throwing around this stat claiming that Harris ran 10 points better with the top third of Americans by income than Biden did four years ago. Now, all you have to do is glance at the map to see that's obviously not true. He ran nine points worse than him in Greenwich, Connecticut and Loudoun County. People are so desperate to have any data to hang their hat on, they'll take even the bad data and they form false narratives about what happened in this election. In like six months, we'll have good data from the Census Bureau, from Pew, we'll be able to talk authoritatively about what group she did better with and works with.
