He's now set to appear in court on Monday. Investigators accuse him of stabbing those four students to death at a home near their school. The quadruple murders shocked the campus and the small community there. It sent cops on a month and a half long search for Kohberger.CNN's Jean Casarez is here. Jean, what do we know about this indictment and what's next for Bryan Kohberger?",

There was going to be a preliminary hearing, which was out in the open. It's set for the end of June, for the week of June. Witnesses would take the stand. People would listen to their testimony, cross-examination by the defense. Very out in the open. Unbeknownst to anybody, they went and convened a grand jury that heard testimony. But We'll never know who testified because the document came out yesterday, all the witnesses are sealed. And a grand jury is very secret. It is secret testimony basically. And so they determine, the grand jurors, from that community, that the case should be bound over for trial. So, now it is in district court. He will appear on Monday. He will enter a plea.

As authorities said, there was a country wide air attack. This as fierce fighting has continued around that embattled eastern city of Bakhmut that we have been telling you about for several months now. Ukraine has been gaining some ground there in recent days. And CNN has obtained new satellite imagery that shows just the devastating toll that fighting has taken on the city over the last year alone.This all is happening as Ukraine is preparing for that long awaited counter offensive to reclaim occupied land that Russia took when it invaded Ukraine. With us now to talk more about this is retired U.S. Army Major Mark Lyons. Thank you, of course, for being here. So, we're talking about Bakhmut, which is this key city that they have been fighting over. We talked about it last week with the Russian mercenaries and whether or not they were going to withdrawal. This image right here is so striking to me. This is Bakhmut a year ago. And it just looks completely torched. What happened exactly? What weapons were used to take it from this to this? MAJOR MIKE LYONS, U.S. ARMY (Retired): Yes, Kaitlan, an example of, you know, a Russian war crime. This is a thermobaric weapon fired - firebombing fundamentally, weapons that are designed to do nothing but cause fire and destruction here, against civilian targets. This was a civilian apartment building, an apartment complex here. You can see the entire vegetation is gone on both sides -- on this side here. The buildings are destroyed.

So, if you look at this very long border here between where Russian troops are and where the Ukrainian troops are, I think the counter offensive, when it finally happens, kind of cuts in this way and threatens Crimea.

I think, besides the artillery, the air defense and the armor systems that have been given to them, you bring helicopters to that counter offensive right now, it would allow shock effect, it would allow troops to move around the battlefield, cross over the Dnipro river, cross those obstacles that we have there.
