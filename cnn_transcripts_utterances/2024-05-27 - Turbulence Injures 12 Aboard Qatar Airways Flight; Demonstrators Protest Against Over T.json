So the markets' movements are small and there's not really much to say, you can see the numbers on the screen. The events of the day are very busy and that, we do need to give to your attention. \"It was the worst 15 seconds of my life,\" says a passenger who is describing turbulence on board the Qatar Airways flight that sent travelers and crew to a hospital. The second such incident in aviation in a week. The Carnival Cruise line chief executive says cruise lines are an easy target for cities trying to tackle over tourism. Ahead of this week's elections in South Africa, we asked why their economy is sliding backwards despite all the money that is being poured in. We are live from New York, Monday, May 27th. Happy Memorial Day. You can wear white shoes in the Hamptons I am told. I am Richard Quest, I haven't got any white shoes. I mean business. Good evening. We begin today with concerns about flight safety after a dozen people were hurt on a Qatar Airways flight that flew into some turbulence. Emergency responders met the Boeing 787 when it arrived as scheduled in Dublin. The airport says the incident took place over Turkey. Six passengers and six crew members were hurt. It follows the Singapore Airlines flight, which hit severe turbulence with more than a hundred people hurt and one passenger, of course, died as a result. Passengers on the Qatar flight described the fear that they felt when the turbulence. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

If you can still do the job, there shouldn't be discrimination in that work and there are any flight attendants who were 30 and 40 years on the job who trained me when I first started flying and they were extraordinary. Just because flight attendants become older does not become the main -- they become less able to do their job.

They were storms that the pilots couldn't see because the radar didn't show up rain, because it wasn't raining yet. These storms were violently rotating up into the air between 20,000 and 50,000 feet, Richard in just 10 minutes. So it wasn't raining because there was no rain to fall out. All the air was going up, while on the outside of that up, you just can't keep going, it has to go down and so they got into this clear air or I am going to call it clear radar turbulence, which may be new term that we start here because they didn't see the storm on their screen because it wasn't there yet. So yes, rapid ascent then a rapid fall and that's exactly what we would expect around a big thunderstorm. Thunderstorms weren't even there yet. We may not have to use radar anymore. We may have to go to something else called visible satellite, and this would be ground base where meteorologists would be staring at the screen, waiting for thunderstorms that are already going up, but not raining yet, that could be part of the problem or part of the solution. And then the pilots could fly farther around this rapidly rising air and miss the rapidly descending air. I heard you talk about this earlier, so I want to get to it about --",

Now most people don't understand that these planes fly in lines. They are in lanes. So if there is a PIREP, if there is a Pilot Reporting, this storm or bumps ahead of you, the pilot behind 20 minutes already knows it is there because it was reported. This had no -- both of them -- had no reports because it wasn't there yet. So with this visible satellite, a lot better than this one, you can see it, you can see that cell right there. The one that they flew through, but it is not really the answer because you have to have something more immediate, more ground truth every minute, maybe even every three minutes, because these storms go up so quickly. I heard you talked earlier about don't sit in the back of the plane if you don't have to because of the vertical stabilizer and this is part of the turbulence. You kind of get the side-to-side and the shaking back in the back. But yes, we do know that this clear air turbulence is on the way up, mainly over North America, mainly over parts of the Atlantic, a little bit less down across parts of the south here along the equator. Because when we start to see and start to blame climate change on this, it is all about the increased turbulence and the increased jet stream instability. Clear air turbulence is when you're flying and there is nothing. You're looking out the window and there is not a cloud in the sky, and all of a sudden the plane bounces. That's clear air turbulence. But when you hit convection, when you hit a thunderstorm going up and down, that's when it is very, very violent and this is what happened in the last two instances.",

And I think, you know, what you're referring to there is really the decade of state capture thatwe saw under the former President Jacob Zuma, where corruption just exploded.

Ramaphosa was there, you right. I think many South Africans feel that he was still a better leader to kind of move the country forward. But you heard it all there from David. Corruption has been rampant, joblessness is soaring, a third of South Africa's labor force is unemployed, and that just entrenches inequality. And then the encrypting pockets, Richard.",
