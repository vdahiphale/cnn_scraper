But there seems to be a theme, whether it's on the \"Boxer,\" whether it's this fuel leak we saw last year in Hawaii that poisoned many military families, whether it's Camp Lejeune water, whether it's burn pits, the theme is there seems to be a culture of denial that you are describing. Why isn't that being addressed so that they don't have this expensive problem that they have with all of these cases?",

A trend that I picked up on from talking to these \"Boxers\" over the last five years is that, just mere days after this incident occurred, the leadership on the \"Boxer\" said, hey, this water is safe to drink. But yet there's the smell of diesel fuel across the ship.You think about how many uses we have for water, like in our everyday lives. We use water for laundry. We use water for brushing our teeth. We use it for just drinking. Well, that was no different on the \"Boxer.\" It was in everything. But they're being told it's safe to drink. Well, the Navy has admitted in other investigations of contaminations on, say, the \"Nimitz.\" The Navy doesn't have a mechanism for testing whether or not there's fuel in the water on a naval ship. So even though the Navy is saying to sailors of the \"Boxer,\" hey, this is safe to think, they don't have the ability to test for that. So I'm not sure -- I actually still don't know how the leadership on the \"Boxer\" came to the conclusion that the water was safe to drink.",

Now, all of this seems to stem from a commitment that Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin made during a House Armed Services Committee hearing back in March that the Department of Defense does not support or fund these kinds of drag shows on military bases and installations across the country. He was grilled on this by Republican Representative Matt Gaetz, who questioned both him and chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Mark Milley, about why these drag shows were occurring on these bases in a way some conservative policymakers have argued is not appropriate. Here is that exchange. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL): At Nellis Air Force Base, you had the drag show Nellis on June 17th. Who funded these things, Mr. Secretary? GEN. LLOYD AUSTIN, DEFENSE SECRETARY: Listen, drag shows are not something that the Department of Defense supports or funds.",

Now we should note that Secretary of Defense Austin did release a statement marking the beginning of Pride Month. He said that, \"As secretary of defense, I remain dedicated to making sure that our LGBTQ-plus personnel across the joint forces can continue to serve the country that we all love with dignity and pride this month and every other one.\" He went on to thank them for their service. So Lloyd Austin here, he has expressed support for that community many times in the past.

One man narrowly survived, thanks to an amazing rescue.

The guy who was assigned to another climber when he spotted him in distress, clinging to a rope and shivering. Keep in mind, temperatures in the area can drop to -86 degrees Fahrenheit. The sherpa carried him down nearly 2,000 feet. The helicopter then took the climber to base camp. The rescue, in total, took about six hours.
