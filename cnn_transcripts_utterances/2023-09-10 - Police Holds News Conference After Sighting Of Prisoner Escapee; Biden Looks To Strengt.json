Police holding a news conference in Chester County, Pennsylvania as the search enters it's now 11th day, and this comes as officials say Cavalcante is no longer in the Phoenixville area. Even though he was spotted there last night after changing his appearance, police say the fugitive was seen driving this van, stolen from a nearby dairy farm. They say they recovered the van without Cavalcante inside. CNN's Polo Sandoval joining us now with more from that press conference. There was a wealth of information, but the bottom line is they still don't know where he is and they have expanded this search -- Polo.",

And it wasn't until later according to authorities, that van was abandoned near East Mill Township, which is just west of that location. Authorities telling me earlier today that he literally ran out of gas, and so he ditched that vehicle and that rural part of Pennsylvania is now the general space or at least a general region that investigators believe that this convicted killer could be hiding. But look, this is certainly going to be for those that have been closely following this investigation, this manhunt. A significant and disappointing development here as authorities have said time and time again, that they were fairly confident that they had contained him in a perimeter about just a short distance from where he originally escaped in late August. And now, really the region in the country waking up to news that he has essentially escaped that area and that authorities at this point, don't know where he is. And as we heard from the Lieutenant Colonel George Bivens a little while ago, even very clear that there is no excuse for that happening. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. COL. GEORGE BIVENS, PENNSYLVANIA STATE POLICE DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF OPERATIONS: I'm not going to make an excuse to you. I wish it had not happened. Unfortunately, there are a lot of circumstances, there are a lot of issues associated with that property -- tunnels, very large drainage ditches, things that could not be secured. You couple that with weather, aviation being down for a night. There are a number of reasons. Again, no excuses. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And today in Hanoi, the president inking this new high level partnership with Vietnam becoming a strategic comprehensive strategic partner of Vietnam on par with countries like Russia and China as it relates to this country's foreign relations, a sign that like several other countries in the region, with whom President Biden has really sought to forge closer ties with in recent months, that there is growing concern about the way in which China throws around its military and economic heft in the region. But even as the president took these steps, which he insisted are not solely aimed at China, and yet every expert you talk to says, this is all about China, the president tried to make clear that he is not seeking to contain that second largest economy in the world.

Sincerely, we're all better off if China does well. (END VIDEO CLIP)   DIAMOND: And now the question is, Will President Biden actually be able to meet with China's President Xi Jinping. There has been some speculation that the two could perhaps meet on the sidelines of the APEC Summit in November, which is set to be hosted by the United States in San Francisco. The president would not confirm that today. And so far, the US is in treaties to the Chinese over the last several months, as we've seen, Cabinet secretary after Cabinet secretary dispatched to Beijing to try and deepen the relationship between the two countries, to reestablish military-to-military communications. So far, that has yet to bear any tangible fruit. So we'll see if the president is able to be successful in that regard. So far, China appears to be resisting re-establishing relations along the same rules of the road that have existed now for decades. I did get a chance to shout a brief question to the president at the end as he was leaving the stage, and I asked him a question about human rights, and that's because Vietnam is one of the worst offenders of press freedom in the world as the third largest jailer of journalists and cracks down on political dissent. And it is the latest example that we have seen of President Biden appearing to put strategic interests of the United States above human rights concerns, and when I asked the president about that, he said: \"I don't put anything above human rights.\" And he insisted that he has raised human rights issues with every leader he's met, including here in Hanoi -- Fred.",

Bill Clinton did the first, I was on that. George Bush did one. And they were still trying to sort out the relationship after the Vietnam War. You didn't hear any mention of the Vietnam War in the course of this.

But that are also critical to China's development in the most high tech industries.That includes doing high end semiconductors, it includes the hardware you need and much of the software to do artificial intelligence, and to do quantum computing. So when the Chinese look at this, they say, well, you're not just trying to stop our military from developing, you're also trying to keep China from being a competitor in the biggest, most profitable industries of the future and they are not wrong in that.",

And you start with the treaty allies, which include Korea, and Japan and the Philippines, and of course, Australia and New Zealand, but then you spread out to other potential partners, and that's what Vietnam was all about. It's even part of the effort to woo India, which has clearly not sided with the United States and its allies on the invasion of Ukraine.

Meadows has appealed the ruling.And Trump's lawyers have signaled in recent days, they may also ask for his case to be moved to federal court. The Meadows' decision came on Friday the same day the full special grand jury report was released and that report provides new insight into the 2020 election subversion investigation in Georgia. It shows the panel wanted to indict 39 people in the sprawling racketeering case including Senator Lindsey Graham, former Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, and former National Security adviser, Michael Flynn.

That's a moment that we don't normally get to see between Coco and her parents. They are famously stoic when they are in her box. They don't get over excited. Sometimes they even go inside when things get tense, like her dad did last night, but all of the emotions came flooding out when she was finally able to realize this moment that she's been dreaming of since she was such a little girl. And when we spoke last night, she told me what that moment was like between her and her family. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They are very familiar with one another's style of play and they love to get into these duels at the baseline. So I think true tennis fans will have such an appreciation for what Novak Djokovic is trying to do winning that 24th Grand Slam. A lot of people would put it in Novak's favor. You certainly wouldn't be wrong to do that. But don't count out, Daniil Medvedev. He is very tricky on the hard court.
