      "sentences": "Yes. So, the cause is an atmospheric river that's basically funneling all of the moisture into California. It has been for the last 48 hours and it's going to continue for the next 24. And it's not just Southern California, even areas of Northern and Central California are still getting some pretty heavy bands of rain right now. But the heaviest rain is still focused over portions of Southern California, specifically across areas of Los Angeles. That's where we have a lot of these active flashflood warnings.And what that indicates is that it's active ongoing flooding. So, you're having landslides, you're having flooded roadways in a lot of these areas from Los Angeles, stretching back west towards Malibu, scenes like this. This is from yesterday, but this may still end up happening today as more rain is expected to come in across many of these areas. You look at some of the rainfall totals so far, you're looking at several locations that have already picked up half a foot of rain. Now, you're going to be adding an additional one to three inches on top of what they've already had, and that's just going to exacerbate any of the flooding concerns that are going on across many of these areas. It's also why you have such a widespread risk for flooding, not just for L.A. but pretty much for a vast majority of the state. However, Los Angeles becomes the target point for that high risk, what we refer to as a level four out of four. So, it's the highest threat that you can get. And, again, they don't happen very often. You will often only get them on, say, about 4 percent of days. Power outage is still over half a million right now. That's because of this. Look at this. You've had several wind reports over 100 miles per hour. But even some of the other areas that have had wind gusts of 80, 90 miles per hour, that's still going to lead to trees coming down and the subsequent power outages that go with it. So, several more high wind warning still for today with those wind gusts up around 60 to 80 miles per hour.",

      "sentences": "Well, over to Washington, a bipartisan group of senators have officially unveiled their long-awaited bipartisan border security bill, which Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is calling a, quote, monumental step. And that, at least based on several decades of failed negotiations on immigration, is not hyperbole when it comes to what's actually inside the bill.Now, on its face, the measure would dramatically change immigration law for the first time in decades. But here's the reality. Even if the Senate can pass the bill, it's already facing stiff, if not unyielding opposition from House Republicans. Many have already labeled it dead on arrival, some before they even knew what was in it. But policy actually matters. I know that might be stunning to some people. Let's unpack what's actually in the deal. So, there are several key changes to the asylum process. This was a critical component of the talks, making the process more selective and quicker. It includes provisions to shut down the border when crossings reach a certain threshold. It also preserves but clamps down on the humanitarian parole of migrants into the country. Let's go a little deeper into what these changes would actually mean. Now, a critical element of the agreement, the bill grants the federal government a sweeping new authority to effectively shut down the border when the daily average of migrant crossings hits 4,000 a day. If that average reaches 5,000 a day, the Department of Homeland Security would be required to shut down the border immediately. DHS would also be required to shut it down if more than 8,500 migrants crossed on a single day. So, to put that into perspective, daily averages reached nearly 10,000 migrants last month, meaning the current surge of migrants is enough to shut down the border under this new bill. And it's something President Biden hasn't been shy about when it comes to his willingness to use that new authority to get the situation under control. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: It will also give me, as president, the emergency authorities shut down the border until it could get back under control. If that bill were the law today, I'd shut down the border right now and fix it quickly. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
