Some of the things that you see, some of the paintings that somebody brought in honor of the victims who died here in that New Year's Day terrorist attack and also a lot of flowers, and it has been a steady stream of people who have come here. Earlier we heard from the FBI, not only that detail about the Meta Glasses, but also the timeline for everything that transpired well before the attack, and it started on October 30th when Jabbar first came to New Orleans, and he stayed here for a few days the following day. That's when he used the Meta Glasses to record some of the streets here around this area. And then he came back again on November 10th. We have also learned that he rented the pickup truck, the F-150, that he used for the attack in the city of Gonzales here in Louisiana, and one more important detail, the FBI is telling us that he placed here in the French Quarter not one, but two improvised explosive devices. Let's hear the special agent in charge and how he explained that earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "All right, Rafael Romo, thank you so much.Joining me right now, CNN senior law enforcement analyst, Andrew McCabe. Andrew, it was an incredible press conference, was it not? I mean, there was a lot of detail there about timeline, about forensic evidence, still declaring that he appeared to be working alone, but then also saying they do want to -- FBI, ATF -- they want to reach out to people that may have interacted with him because he did travel quite a bit prior to this attack. So in your view, you know what is going to be the priority in trying to carry out this investigation at the same time better secure the city, especially since so many people will be descending on the city ahead of Mardi Gras and the Super Bowl? [15:05:16] ANDREW MCCABE, CNN SENIOR LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST: Yes, so let's give the FBI a lot of credit for really teeing up a very substantive, revealing press conference, which both raises new concerns about the state of terrorism in this country. But also, I think should provide some comfort to the people of New Orleans that, you know, we have good people on this. So for me, Fred, the most significant thing that we learned in the press conference was about the foreign travel and the reason I say that is because this is the type of lead that if he traveled to Egypt and Canada for any purpose connected to this attack, then both of those trips provide an opportunity for the United States working with its foreign partners to identify people who could be part of an ISIS support network. It could be recruiters, trainers, people who provide financial support, technical support, whatever that might be, and that's what helps us identify other operatives. So that's the kind of lead that really fuels counterterrorism efforts here and abroad, and could uncover a network of dangerous folks that we need to be able to disrupt. The other things we learned in the press conference, super interesting, because they tell us a lot about this guy, about this attacker. The fact that he reserved the truck six weeks ago, the fact that he took two trips to Louisiana in the months preceding the attack. This all shows us the high degree of, first of all, organizational capability that he has. And secondly, the amount of time that he spent planning and preparing for this attack. This was not some act of fury, you know on the turning over of the New Year. This is something he was thinking about for a long time.",

And you mentioned ISIS because he did post, or at least it was revealed that he did post many videos, you know, prior to the attack and proclaiming his support for ISIS and claiming that he joined ISIS in the summer.Now, when you talk about what appears to be meticulous planning ahead of the attack, the FBI and the ATF both revealed today that the fire that he intentionally set at the home that he was staying in New Orleans, either could have been to get rid of evidence, or it could have been used to distract first responders while he was also carrying out the attack. How important was that to reveal that to the public? Because if not for a neighbor who some five hours later, after he set fire in the home saying that they smelled smoke, investigators say they might not have been able to put some of those pieces together as quickly as they did.",

I think, it is absolutely intentional effort, the fire, probably for both of the reasons you mentioned, both to destroy evidence and to distract first responders. But also, let's give some credit to our fire company that responds to that fire before we have any knowledge of who it was connected to. That's an opportunity to draw first responders into a very dangerous environment. If those precursor chemicals are ignited by the fire, you know, many personnel could have been additionally hurt. That's something that we've seen mass killers do in the past, to booby trap the place where they live, realizing they'll never get back there, and it is an opportunity to hurt more first responders who go to check out or search their residence.",

They had stopped communicating after that, but she suddenly heard from him again on December 28th.She said he had texted her about the Tesla cybertruck he rented, saying, \"I feel like Batman or Halo,\" a reference to a series of military science fiction video games. But she said she had no impression he was planning anything like Wednesday's incident. Arritt said he suffered concussions, though it is not clear how many, and that he told her he suffered from depression while they were dating. US officials familiar with Livelsberger's military records told CNN he had been diagnosed with depression, but was not deemed to be at risk of violence or suicide. Now, what authorities have gleaned from notes they believe he wrote on his phone, paint a much broader picture of his state of mind beyond any mental health challenges. The writings included a call to action to purge Democrats from the government and the military, including the possibility of occupying streets and federal buildings, not ruling out the use of force. In another letter, he had stated support for President Trump and Elon Musk and outlined his grievances with political, societal and cultural issues. He called what he was about to do a wake-up call. Now, his explosion in front of the Trump Hotel injured seven people who were treated for their injuries and released -- Fred.",

You know, you go back to January or February of 2021. What was it? It was 17. You know, that's a significant chunk of folks, right, Manu? I wasn't -- most of the GOP didn't, but 17 is a pretty big number here.",

Pretty much the ones who did were all run out of town. There are just two House members, three Senate members who remain.The bottom line is this, and we will say it over and over and over again. This is Donald Trump's Republican Party. That's why he could pick up the phone, make those calls to ensure that Mike Johnson held on to his speakership. But it is not just within the Republican Party. It is nationally among the general populace as well. So take a look at Donald Trump's net favorable rating. Take a look here. Trump's net favorability rating, you go back to January of 2021. Donald Trump was way underwater, way underwater, minus 20 points. That's your favorable minus. You're unfavorable. Look he is still a little bit underwater, but he is now at minus one point. He is considerably more popular. So folks who were writing off Donald Trump's political career, writing his political obituary, he rose up from the grave. He almost looks like one of those WWE characters, right, who kind of rose up, and that is what Donald Trump has done. He is right now broke even. He is about as popular with the American public, Manu, than he has ever been.",

Donald Trump may be more popular than he has ever been, but the idea of him pardoning these January 6th protesters is, simply put, not a popular proposition.You look, overall, its 33 percent. It is 33 percent. Look at the opposition, 59 percent of the American public, you can barely get 59 percent of the American public to agree on anything, but they do agree on opposing Trump pardoning the January 6th protesters. Even among the Republican Party, look at this number. Yes, it is two thirds who support it at 67 percent, but, you know, Donald Trump's favorable rating within the Republican Party is like 85 to 90 percent.",

How did it work? Then well take a look at January 6th memories. Take a look here. All right. January 6th is the biggest memory of Trump's first term. Look at this.",

      "sentences": "Well, Fred, I have to tell you, it has been in the making for more than a decade, and even in the last few days, it was facing intense opposition.Congestion pricing here in New York City has been long in the making. It has had a lot of political obstacles, a lot of political opposition, and it remains deeply unpopular in the suburbs outside of New York City and even in New Jersey, which tried to sue to stop it at the last minute. But after all of that, it officially started early this morning, right at the stroke of midnight. Officials here in New York were unveiling the new signage to alert drivers about this new congestion pricing program and it is supposed to do exactly what it sounds like. It is a tolling structure designed to alleviate congestion. It is designed to raise more money for the public transit infrastructure. It is supposed to encourage people to use public transportation, and in the long run, it is supposed to significantly decrease gridlock in what is one of the most congested zones in the world. So we are here at the end of the congestion zone, and you can see over my shoulder the cameras that will be taking photos of the plates so that they can be told as the cars come in and out of this zone. Now, how much is it going to cost you? Well, if you drive an average car, a passenger vehicle, it is going to cost you $9.00 to enter Manhattan, south of Central Park on weekdays between 5:00 AM and 9:00 PM and weekends between 9:00 AM and 9:00 PM. The fee is much lower if you enter during off peak hours, and it varies if you drive a truck or a commercial vehicle or a motorcycle. Now more than 700,000 vehicles are estimated to enter this zone every weekday, Fred. So that is what it is intended to get at. It is supposed to alleviate congestion, improve the quality of the air. And as I said, in the long run, improve traffic. Now, officials in the suburbs and in New Jersey are not the only ones who have been opposed to this plan. President-elect Donald Trump has also been critical of the program, saying that he will cancel it when he takes office. He has called it a regressive tax that is going to hurt families, workers, and businesses. But the MTA Chairman, which is the agency that is administering this program, responded to that criticism earlier this morning. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Other major cities like London, Singapore, to Stockholm have all installed plans similar to this one, Fred, and I will give you some firsthand personal experience.Today, I took a cab to get here. If you take a cab, the cost is being passed down to the passenger. So I paid an extra $1.75 in order to get here. That is what you'll be charged if you take Uber or Lyft. It is $0.75, if you take a yellow cab. So, Fred, perhaps next time I will take the subway in order to get here and that is exactly the point, to encourage people to take public transportation more often and to reduce the traffic. My cab driver said that he was in favor, as long as it means that he can get around the city a lot quicker -- Fred.",
