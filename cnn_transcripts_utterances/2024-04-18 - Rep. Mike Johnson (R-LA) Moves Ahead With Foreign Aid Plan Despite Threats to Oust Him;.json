Why is this happening?I'm Sara Sidner with Kate Bolduan and John Berman. This is CNN News Central. BOLDUAN:  Every member gets to vote their own conscience. That is the message from the Republican House speaker today, which should be good news for every lawmaker. No pressure campaign or arm-twisting operation toward a predetermined outcome on the floor, just a vote. But that's not exactly how things work on Capitol Hill, and that message is not making some House Republicans happy. Putting Johnson's job on the line now as the foreign aid bills are facing a first crucial test today. In a few hours, the House Rules Committee will meet to consider the $95 billion package of aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. This committee is the gatekeeper to what gets to the House floor. A bill has to pass through rules, generally speaking, before it can get a vote on the floor. And even this step, Johnson might need the help of Democrats to make it through. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA):  When you do the right thing, you let the chips fall where they may. I mean, that's my life philosophy, and that's how I govern here every single day. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It's so important to underscore that the Rules Committee is typically known as the speaker's committee because people who serve on it typically serve at the leisure and at the direction of the speaker of the House. Obviously, that shifted a little bit when Kevin McCarthy was the speaker, but now you're seeing these problems really stacking up for Johnson.This border security bill was supposed to be a bone that he was throwing at his hardliners to tell them and send them the message, I do care about the southern border, if we're going to help Ukraine, I understand this sentiment that we should be doing something at our own border as well. And yet even that couldn't get through the House Rules Committee. Now, all eyes are on what happens to this series of supplemental packages to help Israel, Taiwan, Ukraine in the hours to come. And it's possible that Democrats on the House Rules Committee could help Republicans to get this to the floor of the House of Representatives in order for them to debate it. Again, once they get to the floor, they're going to need more Democratic support on the rule. And I know that that is a lot of jargon this morning, but it's so important to just point out that the procedural hurdles here for doing anything has been so difficult because of this threat of vacating the speaker that is hanging over the entire House of Representatives right now. Now, Democrats, for their part, are remaining noncommittal on what precisely they are going to do. Here's Josh Gottheimer, a moderate who is often willing to cross the aisle. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JOSH GOTTHEIMER (D-NJ):  If it mirrors what the Senate sent us, that's something that I can see strongly supporting. However, if they stick a bunch of amendments on poison pills with this tightrope walk that they're doing, that undermines it, then, of course, I'm going to have problems with it. So, I think what really matters is now what amendments they introduce, what amendments get passed and that's going to make the difference. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And as you just mentioned there, the judge telling them they should report back on Monday because it's very possible opening statements could happen. But, of course, that schedule is very fluid.So, today, when court picks back up at 930, those 96 perspective jurors are going to come into the courtroom and, again, the judge is going to ask them, can they be fair and impartial? Now, remember, when we went through this process on Monday, about more than 50 people basically rose their hand and said that they wanted to be dismissed. And so we'll see how many are weeded out through that process. After that happens, then the rest of the perspective jurors have to answer those 42 questions. Remember, it's about where they get their news from, have they attended Trump rallies, things like that. And then once that number dwindles down a little bit even more, then each side, the defense and the prosecution, are able to ask more pointed questions. Now, when this happens on Tuesday, it got very interesting. The prosecution really asked questions about, you know, could they follow the judge's instructions? Do they have any issues with the fact that there's going to be a tabloid publisher, an adult film star, a attorney who has committed and it was guilty of federal crimes? Those are the sort of things that the prosecution is trying to look for when they are asking these questions to the jurors. As for the defense, well, they really were weeding through the social media of some of these jurors. In fact, the judge had to dismiss two jurors because of cause. So, those are some of the things that we'll continue to be looking out for as they try to pick these five other jurors plus more alternates today. It's going to be another interesting day in court. We'll see if we do get a full jury seated. And, of course, we'll be here for it. Guys?",

It sounds like most of these states, not contiguous states, most of them were related to mobile phone issues.In Del Rio, Texas, for instance, the law enforcement there said, our system is fine, but the mobile system is down. In Clark County, Nevada, which is where Las Vegas is, of course, big town, which would have a lot of emergency services, people were not able to get through -- weren't able to call with their phone. They were able to still text, or if they called, the 911 operator could see their number and call them back, but they couldn't get through on their cell phone. Across Nebraska, there were spotty issues, South Dakota, similar issue. In Nebraska, they said every cell phone carrier was affected except for T-Mobile. If we had to guess at this point, it's probably some sort of update situation because it was just mobile systems. It was very specific ways that it was affected in all these different areas.

      "sentences": "Yes, Kate. This will be quite a moment, President Biden really trying to harness the legacy of the Kennedy family, which ordinarily wouldn't be such a huge surprise. This is the most storied family in Democratic politics, but the real intrigue here is, of course, that third-party bid by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.Of course, many members of the Kennedy family have already rejected that bid, both concerned about some of his controversial views, but also deeply concerned about the prospect of him siphoning off votes from President Biden, from Democrats who may see the Kennedy name on the ballot, tick the box without knowing much about the candidate himself. And so, really, this event is designed to show that RFK Jr. doesn't necessarily represent the Kennedy political brand. And certainly it demonstrates that the Kennedy family and the Biden campaign are taking this very seriously. Now, what we'll see today is 15 members of the Kennedy family joining President Biden in Philadelphia, including Kerry Kennedy, she's a sister of RFK Jr., she will introduce the president and she will really sort of heighten the stakes of this election. In an excerpt of what she'll say, she'll say, I can only imagine how Donald Trump's outrageous lies and behavior would have horrified my father, Robert F. Kennedy, who proudly served as attorney general of the United States and honored his pledge to uphold the law and protect the country. Now, after the president's speech today, he's planning to join an organizing meeting with members of the Kennedy family. He'll be introduced there by another member of the clan, Joe Kennedy III. He's the Biden special envoy to Northern Ireland. Afterwards, members of the Kennedy family will make phone calls, will knock doors on the president's behalf. Now, President Biden has long espoused his affection for the Kennedy family. He has said that RFK Sr. was an inspiration for his own political career. He has his bust, in fact, in the Oval Office. And the Kennedy family has also telegraphed their support for Biden. It was just back on St. Patrick's Day when they all took a photo in the Rose Garden with President Biden with one notable absence, RFK Jr. Of course, that will be the same case today. It's all an indication that the campaign that the Kennedy family views RFK Jr.'s campaign as a threat they can't ignore, and certainly they do want to emphasize their support for President Biden as this third-party bid continues.
