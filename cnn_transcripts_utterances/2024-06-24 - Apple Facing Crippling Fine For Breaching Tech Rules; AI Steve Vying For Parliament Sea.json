It looks like we are up 263 points for the Dow Jones at the moment. A strong session just off the tops of the day. But otherwise, all well and good. That's the market and the news that we will be talking about over the course of the next hour. The EU accuses Apple of breaking its new tech rules. If found guilty, the violation could cost Apple dearly. Wall Street is after its best start ever for a presidential election year. What it actually means. And I meet the man behind AI Steve. He hopes artificial intelligence can transform British, I suppose everybody else's politics. Tonight, we are live in London on Monday. It is June the 24th. I am Richard Quest, and, yes, in London, as elsewhere I mean business. Good evening. We begin tonight with the European Union, which is taking its biggest shot yet at Apple threatening the company with a crippling fine over a key part of its business. The Commission says Apple coerces people to shop through its App Store in breach of the new EU Digital Markets Act, the DMA, as we will call it. Apple says it has changed how the store operates to comply with the law. Clearly, not in the view of the EU itself. If found guilty, Apple could be fined up to 10 percent of its global revenues, $38 billion. It is the first time the EU as accused a company of violating the DMA. Similar investigations are underway against Meta and Google. Now, earlier, just a couple of months ago, I spoke to the EU's antitrust chief, Margrethe Vestager after the DMA came in and she told me that brussels was prepared to enforce its rules.

Richard, we are seeing sort of this core tension that Apple has run into with the European Union on thisissue and others as well, where Apple says that it wants to keep consumers in its Apple ecosystem because it is better for consumers. If consumers by things through the App Store, it has security measures, they will be safer, but the EU says that this is essentially a misuse of Apple's size and its market power. It has taken issue with the fact that Apple doesn't allow app developers to let consumers know about deals or sales that are available for purchase outside of their iOS app, and that is because a lot of App developers charge a premium for purchases made in the iOS app because Apple takes a cut of that. And the EU is essentially saying here that consumers may be paying more than they need to be without knowing about it because of these rules that Apple has in place, and so I think this is sort of this core tension between Apple wanting to keep things in its ecosystem, but the EU saying that that is anticompetitive.",

You go from Mina, to Arafat, to Muzdalifah and then around again. Some 44 kilometers in these blistering heat and in each of these bases, particularly of course in Mecca. There are more procedures, there are more religious ceremonies that have to be completed. According to the authorities in Saudi, most of those who died were traveling through unlicensed tour operators. These companies don't typically provide air conditioned buses or easy access to food and water. And look at the temperatures that we are talking about, 45.

It is hard to know exactly how many who died tragically were unregistered. We will take their word for it. But I don't believe that it is specifically designed, designated just to those pilgrims.

They're similar. They're saying that transgender rights look back at the Supreme Court precedent, it's covered under the 14th Amendment Equal Protection Clause, and this would not be treating transgender children equally to others.
