Why? Because their training, tactics and experience took over.They went in. They knew that the call for service was that there was an active shooter. They rapidly mobilized and entered into the building to go after the assailant, hastily searching each and every room along the way, until they heard the sound of gunfire, which allowed them to figure out what part of the building, the assailant was in They went to that and then they neutralize the threat.   This was a textbook operation by law enforcement that was executed flawlessly. They did a phenomenal job, the time to response, the way that they address the threat and neutralize it actually saved more lives.

One of which is concerning communication. We know that this suspect had writings, had basically telegraph the fact that there was going to be some sort of action through Instagram messages to a friend, whether it was suicidal ideation or stating directly that they wanted to die by suicide.   Those are concerning communications. Oftentimes social media can be used as an outlet for rage and we have to be able to identify that better. The second part of this was there was a significant amount of planning and preparation put into this attack. Everything from pre-attack surveillance to mapping the target location, identifying the easiest pathway in. And three is the targeting. They targeted a soft location, right? So we're hearing in the reporting earlier that there was a mall that was potentially targeted as well as this school, houses of worship. They're all soft targets. What is my point here? My point is we have to understand what are these red flags, what are these warning signs that we need to get smarter about.

But in the final analysis, we've had 367 shootings, school shootings since Columbine happens.And I don't know what it says about a society, when we're not willing to defend our nine-year-old children from getting gunned down on a regular school day. This is insane. And we need common sense gun reform. And inevitably, listening to some of your guests who think this is about freedom, I would say that we have the freedom to - we should have the freedom to send our kids to school without having to worry about them getting shot. That's the freedom that we need to have in our country. And I guess it's not going to happen until we vote for individuals who will pass common sense gun reform. And that is the power that we have. The power that we have at this point is in the voting booth, because it's clear that our legislators in Congress are intractable.",

Therefore, if people remain on the streets, demonstrating that is, and I have to say there's only a small ramp of people left here, very heavily outnumbered by the police and the French gendarmerie, then they risk arrest. That is what essentially the police are saying.But the police have also reduced their own numbers at a peak here. There were five and a half thousand were being deployed, 13,000 around the country. The size of the demonstration here is down than what it was last Thursday, according to the interior ministry, down from about 120,000 to about 73,000. There was quite a lot of back and forth earlier on today in the late afternoon, early evening with clashes, with the burning of rubbish and garbage. With protesters throwing bottles and rocks at the police and the police responding with charges and tear gas. A number of arrests have been made. We've seen quite a few arrests, but relative restraint on both sides, particularly by the standards of clashes over the weekend at a very violent environmental protests outside of Paris, not connected with the ongoing demonstrations against President Macron's plans to raise the pension age by two years to 64. Now, that is going to go ahead, Boris and Bianna, that is almost definitely going to End up on the books in France. So the only way that this can be turned around is by forcing a U-turn on the Macron administration. To do that, the hardliners and the opposition believe you need to see a lot more of these street protests. The unions have tried to have dialogue. They've allowed dialogue with the government, the government says fine, but they are not going to discuss - the government is not going to discuss changing that retirement age or backing down on that very key issue. So there is what the French would call an ampars (ph). There is nowhere particularly to go apart from more of these demonstrations, but some of the energy is going out of the strikes across the country because many of these strikes have been going on and off since mid January. And the strikers themselves or workers are running out of money, they need wages in their pocket. So here in Paris, for example, garbage collection is going to happen tomorrow for the first time in many weeks - in many of the main districts in Paris, back to you.",
