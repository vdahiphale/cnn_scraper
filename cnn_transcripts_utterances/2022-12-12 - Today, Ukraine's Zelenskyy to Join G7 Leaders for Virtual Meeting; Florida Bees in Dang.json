      "sentences": "And the response from Defense Minister Oleskiy Reznikov probably pretty predictable. He said, look, when you are having a war, we never have enough. We always need more. But he said they're grateful for the tens of billions of dollars in assistance from the United States, which has been by far the largest contributor to Ukraine's war effort.And when I was on the frontlines up in the north, where they're reinforcing ahead of a Russian buildup once again in Belarus, you know, they said to me pointblank that, yes, Ukrainian soldiers are bravely fighting, but without these weapons from the United States primarily and NATO, it would not be possible to fend off the much larger Russian army. That said, they have a list of items that they say they pretty desperately need, and at the very top of the list are more advanced missile defense systems because of the ongoing attacks, these systematic Russian assault on Ukraine civilian infrastructure, the power, the water, essentially making life miserable and potentially very dangerous for millions of people as temperatures plunge. It is winter time here and there are people right now who don't have power, a lot of people right now who don't have power. I was in Odessa over the weekend. 1.5 million people were plunged into darkness after a strike from Iranian combat drones, but it was three days that they were without power last week when Russia lobbed all of those missiles. So, I asked the defense minister is he being told anything about Patriots, is there any update on if and when they may get those systems. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, that says something in and of itself about how well the Ukrainian army is fending off the Russians, that people, while they are facing very legitimate concerns, still, they're not afraid at least for Russians to be taking over their homes like they did earlier this year.",

      "sentences": "Absolutely. Iran's demonstrators today repeating the name of this man executed this morning, Majidreza Rahnavard.I want to put out, this was a public execution. Iran's authorities hanged him in the early hours of this morning in the city of Mashhad. I bring up the public part because that means residents could have potentially seen his body hanging on streets this morning. He was convicted of waging war against god. The allegation from Iran's authorities is that he stabbed two members of the security forces killing them and wounding several others. Now, there is a very important detail here, Jim and Erica, that I want to point out. The authorities alleged this took place on November 17th. That means in less than a month, this man went from allegedly stabbing members of security forces to facing execution. And that is what rights groups are saying. They're saying these are speedy sham trials with very little due process, very little that is fair or right, and that their actual intention, the intention behind these executions, activists say, is to repress, is to silence, is to intimidate, is to keep people scared from going out and joining those demonstrations on the street. I'm going to point to another bit of material that protestors are speaking about today, this is some CCTV footage. Now, I want to start by explaining that CNN has blurred part of it because it shows a very violent act. But it is this surveillance footage that Iranian authorities used to convict this man. It shows apparently the stabbing incident taking place. But we have seen the original footage, and even in that footage, Jim and Erica, it is unclear who the individuals are in the video. And, again, that is what protesters are saying. That is what rights groups are saying. They're saying these are not trials. These are kangaroo courts that are just meant to give Iran yet another tool of repression to silence dissent.",
