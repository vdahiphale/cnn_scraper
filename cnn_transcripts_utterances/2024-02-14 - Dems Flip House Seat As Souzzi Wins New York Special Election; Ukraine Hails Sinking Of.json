It doesn't seem like there's a lot of will to continue doing that after months of negotiation.And some of these -- some of these Republicans in the House, some of these in swing districts who took this vote, it's unclear if this is the kind of thing they're going to want to campaign on because, you know, they can't point to the work they would try to do on bipartisan legislation, but they -- are they going to point to this impeachment that just kind of stalls in the Senate that Republican senators have said is not a -- is not a good idea. So, you know, there's a question of a month from now, months from now, are people still going to be talking about this? Democrats might be raising it on the campaign trail, though.",

His -- his opponent, Mazi Pilip, not as well-known. So he, you know, Tom Suozzi had a reputation as someone who ran to the right of Governor Kathy Hochul. He wrote, he campaigned on cracking down on crime, lowering taxes, very middle of the road issues. And he also -- what was interesting about this race was both as a candidates did not really embrace their party's leader, Joe Biden and Donald Trump. You're not going to see that generally across the country in some of these races, there's some of these candidates are going to run with their party standard bearer on the line there. The candidates are going to be campaigning in their districts, trying to win those swing districts. So, you know, it's suburban seats, suburbs -- suburbs are a place that Democrats need to compete but there's a lot of, you know, there's -- there's limits to what we can read from these results.",

That's another reason why that's something that Donald Trump very quickly last night was quick to point out and say, this was not one my MAGA candidates and did trying to not have any ownership over this one. You know, he and his argument was that his people -- his MAGA supporters. His base did not turn out to support her because she wasn't one of them.

      "sentences": "Well, it is being celebrated as a victory for them. This is an operation that was carried out. We understand it in the early hours of the morning by a Ukrainian special forces. We have no way of confirming exactly what would happen, what happened.What they say they did is that they used Ukrainian Magura drones home made drones that are powered by jet skis, highly maneuverable with very long ranges, about 800 kilometers, so much further than many of the conventional weapons that are in Ukraine's arsenal right now. And what they've been doing is using these types of drones to much greater and greater effect, in the Black Sea. Specifically, we'd seen them earlier this month at sink a guided missile ship, the Ivanovets. And this one, this landing ship that was killed, there was taken out according to the Ukrainians by these drones is another important win for them. Now what we believe it does is brings to more than 30 percent the amount of the Russia's Black Sea fleet that's been destroyed since the start of the war, and that is significant when you consider the asymmetry of this war, the strength and military might and ability of the Russian forces to rearm and re-equip themselves, with the ammunition, the artillery that they need, the men that they keep throwing at the front lines of Ukraine. Ukraine has been a disadvantage and increasingly so. And what you've seen it do over the course of the last few months is really try and shift at first of all, to the greater use of drones, both in the Black Sea and along the land front lines of Ukraine, but also to try and move their production more to a homegrown type of production, given the difficulty that Ukraine has had in getting many of the weapons that they need to their frontline. So what we've seen overnight in the Black Sea is significant fall of those reasons. But, of course, just psychologically, this is an important win for Ukraine at a time when its been having trouble shifting any of the lines, whether on the frontlines or elsewhere of this war. And I think it indicates not just their willingness to strike Russia wherever it can, denting its capabilities, but also to psychologically shift things in their favor. So an important victory for them this morning, Jessica.",

Thanks so much for that update.A U.S. official says talks in Cairo over a potential Gaza ceasefire and hostage relief have been productive. But a final agreement is not in sight. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has balked at Hamas's demands, which include the release of Palestinians held in prisons in exchange for those hostages. Meantime, Israeli Defense Forces say they've obtained video footage from October showing Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar inside a Khan Younis tunnel with his wife, children, and an unidentified man. CNN has been unable to verify the authenticity of that video. Let's go now to CNN's Nada Bashir, who joins us live from Cairo. Nada, where did the talk stand?
