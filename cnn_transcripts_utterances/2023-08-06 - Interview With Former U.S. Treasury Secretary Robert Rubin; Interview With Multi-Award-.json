I'm Fareed Zakaria coming to you from Aspen, Colorado.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ZAKARIA (voice-over): Today, an extra special program with three, yes, three former secretaries of the Treasury. First I'll talk to Henry Paulson and Timothy Geithner about the state of American politics, the downgrade of the U.S. credit ratings and the struggles of the Chinese economy. Then Robert Rubin talks to me about how to make hard decisions, and what a yellow legal pad has to do with that skill. Finally, David Byrne came to fame with his new wave band, Talking Heads, some 40 years ago. I talk to him about his latest wave of creativity which includes a musical about former Filipina first lady Imelda Marcos performed in a Broadway theater that's been transformed into a disco.

And like any American, the world looks at our political system today and they wonder, is America going to be able to find the will to come together and do this in the sensible way? I think part of the problem is that it still feels remote and over the horizon. Like any political system, really hard challenges trying to get people to focus on something that seems kind of far away. They don't feel the cost of it today. ZAKARIA: This is the debt index.",

But as I look at the Biden economic policy, you know, I take the climate change so seriously, I was a major proponent of the IRA and I think that has the potential to make a huge difference in terms of accelerating the development of the sorts of technologies we're going to need and really changing the -- you know, the cost curve there.So I see that, I'm positive about that. But otherwise, I am uncomfortable by and large with industrial policy, all right. That sometimes it makes real sense, where it's targeted and you've got a very, very specific goal, and it's going to be implemented very carefully. I am, you know, cautiously optimistic about the CHIPS bill. But, again, there it comes down to, is bureaucracy going to be able to implement it, right? So, you know, I'm concerned about the regulation. I'm concerned about immigration. You know, I -- you know, have some concerns about the anti-trust policy and regulation. I think these things are inflationary. But as we -- again, you know, there's -- there is plenty of positive and as Tim said, we've got an economy that sure looks better than many of us had predicted a number of months ago. But, you know, we're not out of the woods yet in terms of inflation. One thing I would emphasize when we look at the U.S. economy. There's not many countries that I could think of that we would ever trade places with. When you look at the size of our economy, the GDP per capita, the very best run companies in the world, the best technology, energy independent, living in a safe neighborhood. You know, the only -- the real problem the country has right now is dysfunction in Washington, right. But otherwise, it's in a very strong position.",

That is the challenge because it's hard to define or frame a limiting principle that the world can look at and say, I understand it's going to stop there, and not expand beyond that.I think part of the challenge for the world in looking at this is that, you know, we're also trying to build more supply chain resilience. We're making these large investments in the climate transition, which we want to make sure benefit American companies and American employment. And there is a bit of this -- Hank used the word protectionist, there is a bit of nationalist protectionist shadow cast over this set of policies and that's making it harder for the world to figure out how to navigate what would be always a tough thing to define.",

And we're trying to preserve that while we're still trying to -- while we're also trying to craft a credible military deterrent and make sure we can reduce the risk to us that come from this more ascendent (INAUDIBLE) China.And that's a really tough balance to strike.

Then you make judgments about probabilities and ultimately you try to make the best decision you can, Fareed. There are no provable certainties and that, by the way, is the view of modern science as you know. There are no provable certainties and all decisions about probabilities.

Obviously, I should have.I don't think it would have made in the difference at Citi particularly because I was a senior counselor and not in a decision- making position. But I think -- and wrote about this in the book because I think the real big lesson to be learned from this is don't assume anything. Look under the hood, have a questioning mindset, have a constructively skeptical mindset, because almost nobody including the fed and analysts and bank regulators and I mean some -- a few did but very, very few.

RUBINNow there is an assumption in there which is at some point or another we will meet our policy challenges. It's not terrifically well but at least reasonably well. And even though we have tremendous issues and problems in our political system, I think, over time we will in the last two and a half years we've done quite a bit but there is immense amount more to do. In terms of the moments, I think there is a certain complacency right now and it may will be that we have a soft landing but it also could be that we have something different than a soft landing. And I think the uncertainty -- I've been around this a long time. Fifty years that I've been involved with this stuff, Fareed. I think that there is -- there is probably as much uncertainty today about the next say year and a half than any that I can recollect in my time. They may resolve in a soft landing as you say and that's a material chance but the material chance it could resolve in to a slowdown or a recession. Inflation certainly is still there. The question is, does it come down or does it reignite?

But I thought wouldn't that be fun if people could dance and they were getting a kind of story at the same time.Then years later I read that she loved going to discos in her heyday. And she had a mirror ball installed in her New York townhouse. I Googled it up at the time. This was some years ago.
