But arguably, any kind of trips on a private jet or personal yacht that Clarence Thomas went on should have already been recorded.But I want to just mention what Thomas's lawyer said today in a statement that came with the filing was any errors had been inadvertent. And to just reflect the atmosphere that we're all dealing in, he called it political blood sport to go after Thomas relative to his financial disclosure filings. So, you know, we know what this charged atmosphere is, and I just wanted to mention kind of how they're trying to counter it, despite the reality that other justices had actually been reporting these kinds of personal hospitality, travel, and lodging that the justice hadn't. KANNO-YOUNGS: I thought that last aspect was fascinating, too. The defense in there and these disclosure forms, it just really shows just how polarized the highest court in this country has become at this point. This is already after a year of some pretty pivotal Supreme Court decisions that definitely stoke divisions in the country. When you think of Roe, when you think of other decisions as well, also multiple controversies surrounding different justices as well, just the fact that you would have Clarence Thomas, who is not exactly known for speaking publicly on these issues, include that defense in these disclosures kind of shows the climate around the court right now.",

      "sentences": "OK, so I'm going to be off the reservation on this. I will confess my conflicts here. I know Harlan Crow. He's a good friend of mine. He's one of the most honorable people I know. I don't believe for a moment that he tried to bribe or unduly influence Clarence Thomas.I completely understand the appearance of ethical problems that Clarence Thomas got himself into, particularly with the real estate thing, which I think was legitimately problematic. All that said, the fact that Clarence Thomas's lawyers said that this is about -- this is a political blood sport doesn't mean it's not true. And to quote Sheldon Whitehouse, who, if extending the metaphor of political blood sport is covered in partisan blood, he is not exactly a straight shooter or an honest broker in these kinds of things. And there is a concerted double standard since the Supreme Court has moved into -- as a conservative majority to cover this stuff, to question the legitimacy of the court because it is conservative that we did not see before and that if it had been done in previous eras or if this was a liberal majority, we would hear also how dare you delegitimize the court? We hear that about almost every other institution from the right, and it's a criticism of the right. But when it happens from the left, when it happens from ProPublica, and there have been an enormous number of really terrible journalistic hit jobs on Clarence Chalmers that don't get the attention because there is political blood sport here, doesn't mean that there aren't some that are legitimate. But this idea that all of the verities and all the equities go against Clarence Thomas and against the court, I just don't think is fair or right.",

I mean, even today, getting these forms, you know, both Justices Clarence Thomas and Sam Alito, had every right to ask for a 90-day extension here.But things tend to come late. They tend to come with skimpy information. So as much as I can appreciate your defense of Harlan Crow and Clarence Thomas, I think what we shouldn't lose sight of is the power of the Supreme Court, whether it's moving to the left or to the right. And right now it really is lunging to the right. And that's why there's so much more public concern about the justice's off bench behavior.",

Talking to White House and DNC right now, folks around there, they intend on doing the same thing moving forward, which is also interesting given the current president has also openly said that he's uncomfortable speaking about abortion rights and what have you, and we'll see what that means for the strategy moving forward.
