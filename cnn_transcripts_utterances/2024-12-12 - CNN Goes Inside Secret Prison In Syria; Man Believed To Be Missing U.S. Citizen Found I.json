Vance, also attended the ceremonial bell ringing. So much going on today. We want to talk more about Trump's preparations for the White House. Joining us, CNN's senior political commentator, Scott Jennings. Scott, it was interesting to see Trump there at the NYSC. My old stomping ground. My first job in New York was a producer there. So it's always exciting. And you see how he was met with real enthusiasm by the traders there, obviously, the economy, a top issue for so many voters and for him as well. But it was notable in this interview with \"Time Magazine\" when he was asked about the economy, being a big factor in his victory. And he said, no, no, it was a big factor, but the bigger factor, I believe, was the border. He was then asked about the price of groceries and whether he felt that if they didn't go down that he would be blamed. And he was rather honest about saying, listen, I hope they go down. I'd like to bring them down. It's hard to bring down once they're done. We know that the economy was the number one issue for most voters. How much leeway do you think Americans will give him on that issue of inflation? We saw it remain rather stubbornly high, meeting estimates in a report earlier this year. This is going to be a big challenge for him, Scott.",

      "sentences": "It is. I think he will get some leeway. Because I think Trump's going to be honest with theAmerican people about the situation that we're in. And I think one of the reasons voters punished Biden and Harris, ultimately, is because they weren't truthful about what was going on. They repeatedly I think were dishonest about how their policies have led to some of the inflation that was crippling people. And then at the end of the campaign, they were trying to tell everyone that inflation was going down when in fact it was not going down. The rate of inflation might have been slowing, but prices were still creeping up. As you just noted, it's still stubbornly high. So I think Trump is telling the truth. It's hard to bring prices down once they go up. But if you're honest, and then you further institute policies that don't make it worse that, in fact, alleviates some of the economic anxiety that people are having, I think voters will give you some leeway and ultimately reward you for that kind of transparency. But you're going to get a radically different economic vision out of Trump than you are of Biden. And for politics purposes, you hope that vision and you hope that those policies alleviate that anxiety that has sort of permeated the electorate for the last four years.",

I mean, when you think about all the things you justlisted that he survived, from the political stuff to the lawfare to the assassination attempts to the Democrats changing out their campaign. When you think about all the unprecedented stuff that he had to survive in order to come back from losing in 2020 to winning, not just the Electoral College, but the popular vote in 2024, there's never been anything like it. And you're right, he did bring out voters that only want to support Donald Trump. And I think one of the things that we learned in this election, one of the superpowers of Donald Trump is that he's the breaker of narratives. And there were always narratives around him that he could never win the election, that the case in New York was going to bring him down, that, you know, this or that was going to be the thing that finally brought down Donald Trump or that Kamala Harris was the greatest presidential candidate we have ever seen and so on and so forth. Trump is the breaker of narratives. And I think he exposed, really, the political information distribution complex in this election for what it is, which is often a distributor of narratives and not facts. And a lot of people came out and supported Donald Trump because they felt like they were being lied to by the current administration. They had a real mistrust of the policies that had been instituted. They were upset about the economy. The border was really -- and I think he's right. The border was really on people's minds for all of the societal impacts of that. And he broke all of the narratives around it that was coming out of the media and coming out of the Democrats and won this huge victory. I think it's earth-shattering what he did, not just for politics, but the way we as Americans receive and process our political information. He kind of bypassed in some ways the mainstream media and went right to these alternative media sources. And it turns out his entire strategy around that was correct.",

This was widely expected. But there is some concern among those in the industry at the FBI, Justice Department officials, about the precedent that this sets as to not wait and let Donald Trump make this unorthodox decision by firing him before he would resign, just for the principle alone of the independence of the organization, and to really claw back some of what people believed were overreaching powers that the FBI once had under the likes of Hoover and during the era of Watergate, especially now that Trump has stated that he plans to appoint a loyalist like Kash Patel to the post. What do you make of that, the longer-term ramifications? I know that it's his right to fire an FBI director, but these 10-year terms are set to avoid the optics of any sort of impropriety and avoid the optics of the FBI not being an independent organization.",

And Jasmine El-Gamal, a former Pentagon Middle East adviser who joins us from London. So good to see you both. Alon, let me start with you, because as you know, over the past sort of year and a couple of months of this war between Israel and Gaza, a lot of people have accused Netanyahu of prolonging that war against Hamas for his own political advantage and, of course, to keep himself in power and out of jail as well. We are getting some indication that there is movement in terms of potential ceasefire hostage deal, including the fact that Hamas has now said that they are content with possibly allowing an IDF presence in Gaza, at least temporarily, while the hostages are released. Just walk us through why you think Netanyahu, at this point in time, would be willing to agree to a ceasefire deal, especially given that he's been delaying it. A lot of Israelis believe this, delaying it for so long for his own political advantage. Why now and what has changed?",

Now, we don't know the exact details of this hostage deal and ceasefire and realignment of the IDF in Gaza. So, you know, we can only be -- we can only comment intelligently after it's been done. But look, this deal from the little we know about the contours and the details of it, this deal couldn't should have been reached last November of 2023 and again in December. And again, and again in March and April when it was negotiated. And Mr. Netanyahu did prolong the war purposely. And he did intentionally sacrifice the hostages. And he did lie more than once to the American administration, reneging on agreements that he himself proposed. The only reason that he's doing this now has to do with the pressure or the appearance of pressure from President-elect Trump and to a lesser extent, the fact that the war in Gaza, for all intents and purposes, is over. Israel reached some kind of a ceasefire, a circumstantial tenure with ceasefire in South Lebanon. But now it is stretch even thinner because of Israeli activity in Syria. So he felt that this is the time to reach an agreement. I wouldn't be surprised that this would be a partial agreement, not to hold view.",

So what Israel is dealing with right now is much like Jordan is or Iraq is or the U.S. and Turkey is, and that is who will control Syria? How will Syria be governed? Will it remain -- will it maintain rather? It's territorial integrity that has that already been eroded throughout the Civil War or will it splinter within a year into four or five semi- autonomous regions? Now in order to prevent any kind of infiltration of jihadist elements of various organizations, whose names I don't even know yet, into areas close to the Israeli border, Israel went on a precautionary and preventive military strike against naval targets, airfields, airplanes, weapons depots and even a minor, well, it may not be minor but a relatively small territorial incursion into Syria. What I think Israel should do to prove its intentions are just are just -- are, you know, impermanent is to set up a huge field hospital in the areas where it already -- where it is positioned. Because there are tens of thousands of both Jews and Bedouins who are fleeing the areas in southeastern Syria. And that would be a good sign for Israel toward whomever is going to govern Syria. That Israel has no intentions of a land crab but, you know, saying this is easier than actually doing it.",
