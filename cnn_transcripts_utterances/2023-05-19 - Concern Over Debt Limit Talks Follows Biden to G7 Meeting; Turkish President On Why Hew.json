A summit that's going to now include a last minute in- person appearance by Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelenskyy, as Biden today affirmed U.S. support for fighter jets to be given to Ukraine. But, back home, the two sides have only 13 days to reach a deal before the U.S. government runs out of money to pay its bills, according to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. So let's get straight to CNN's Phil Mattingly who is traveling with President Biden in Japan. Also with us, CNN's Melanie Zanona on Capitol Hill. Melanie, there was not that long ago, just yesterday, optimism that the two sides could reach a deal, perhaps even as soon as this weekend, but now, talks aren't even going on. What happens?",

Not give an inch in these negotiations, to stand up and show that they are fighting for their parties priorities. So, that is certainly one of the dynamics that's driving this impasse here.But they're also big differences still when it comes to substance and policy, particularly when it comes to spending cuts. I want to read you what one Republican, Dusty Johnson, a key McCarthy ally, told me not too long ago. He said: We are too far apart on the top line number. McCarthy is holding the line. He knows where the Republican conference is. The gap on top line numbers is not the only problem but it is the biggest problem, and he also added: We are in bad shape. So, I would caution here that these types of blowups and breakdowns are not uncommon in these types of negotiations. Sometimes we just need to take a step back and cool off before they can come back to the table, but this is a very big setback, especially in terms of the timeline. Negotiators were hoping to have a deal in principle by this weekend so they could get it onto the House floor by next week. So that timeline right now is in serious question, Jake.",

Now, keep in mind, the president's day was bookended by briefings from his negotiators on the domestic issue that he is dealing with. But on the geopolitical side of things, there is no question. The decision by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to actually show up in person at this G7 summit is critical. It follows a tour of European capitals at each stop, in France and Italy, and Germany, and the U.K., securing new commitments for lethal aids, securing new commitments for economic assistance, and that will be a push here as well.And it all underscores what officials acknowledge, this is a critical moment in the war with Ukrainian forces nearing their counteroffensive campaign, and as it hits its 15th month mark, the kind of grinding nature of things underscoring the necessity of the durability of the coalition that has been behind Ukraine. Now, when it comes to F-16, this is also a critical moment. The U.S. and President Biden have been wary of the idea of supplying Ukraine with F-16s, of training Ukrainian pilots, they have not shifted off the idea of the U.S. not providing the planes themselves, but what they are willing to do is to allow the export of those planes from allies, and also President Biden at the G-7 summit yesterday made clear to allies that the U.S. would support training of Ukrainian pilots, a big step forward for something Zelenskyy has requested repeatedly over the course of the last several months, Jake.",

You have been calling on President Biden to invoke the 14th Amendment which some would say allow the Treasury to bury money to pay its bills without approval from Congress. President Biden and Secretary Yellen have questioned the legality of that move. REP. RO KHANNA (D-CA): Well, Jake, I don't think we should be negotiating in this country about whether we pay our passed bills. It's patriotic for America to keep its word and pay the debt. I believe this is spending that past congresses have authorized.

It's really important to remember that back in the summer of 2020, then presidential candidate Joe Biden really criticized President Erdogan's Kurdish policy. He called President Erdogan an autocrat, and he said that he supported the Turkish opposition in their efforts to defeat the incumbent president here, President Erdogan. And on the campaign trail to what is a highly and increasingly nationalistic audience, on both sides of the presidential divide, let me tell you, both President Erdogan and the opposition candidate, president or no one has found a willing crowd to hear anti-American sentiment.

As you see there, Kim Rubio talk about the idea that perhaps her child -- how much did her child suffer while waiting for police to kill the gunman? And was there any hope for her to survive, had police come in sooner?And these are the many questions that parents have about that day that they simply just have not been able to get answers for. And so they've turned to us. They've turned to CNN, they know that we have a lot of material. We have been able to obtain through sources the entire case file. We have heard every interview that investigators did, and what happens is while we were in Uvalde, Jake, filming for this special, that airs on Sunday night, one of the mothers calls me and says I want to see video. The body cam video, the moment that police breached the classroom. I want to see our kids survived, being rescued and running out of the classroom. He was shot in the leg, so we sat with several parents who came to us, and they wanted to see this video, watching as their kids were running out of the classroom. Two of them shot, another one survived, had no injuries, but certainly has a lot of psychological and emotional issues to deal with. But this is what the parents are left with now. They are trying to figure out, really through us and the video that we have been allowing them to see, how much there are kids suffered. What exactly their kids went through, so they can try to help in the healing process now, Jake.",

They could be at home and something triggers them. And they start talking about things, and the parents have no idea what they are talking about. But now they are able to give them answers through this video. Through some of the information that we have been able to provide to them that authorities have refused to give them.We also show them video where a lot of the survivors, after they were rescued, were placed on a school bus because there weren't enough ambulances. And they were taken to the hospital on a school bus. And several of the survivors that have remained friends to this day, were injured, nearly died, all in a school bus together. Screaming, begging for help, begging for their parents to come help them. So, we showed them that video as well, and that was for them also a very revealing moment, because at one point, one of the girls, she is passing out and the mother never knew that. She never knew that her daughter was passing out on the bus. And so, by showing her this video, she was able to learn that, Jake.",

They were disenfranchised. These were civilians, women and children, that were not able to protect themselves.
