First, it was Silicon Valley Bank, then Signature Bank here in the U.S.. Then it was First Republic, a regional lender. Now, all attention on Credit Suisse.You mentioned landing this $3.25 billion takeover deal from UBS, 60 percent discount from where it was. This is a big transaction, not because it creates this $1.7 trillion behemoth, but it's the first time since the 2008 crisis that regulators allowed one of these big, global banks to merge with another one. In fact, this time, it was actually done at the behest of regulators in Switzerland that were really worried because Credit Suisse was facing this crisis of confidence. This deal is getting applauded, I think, on Wall Street. The U.S. markets moving solidly higher today. I think investors are hopeful that this means one of the weakest links in the system is getting strengthened. Regional banks in the U.S., they're looking a bit more mixed. You can see the big board. The Dow up almost 300 points. If we look at regional banks, we see they are kind of mixed. First Republic Bank is down 39 percent today alone. And this comes after credit ratings firms, S&amp;P and Moody's, they cut First Republic deeper into junk territory over the weekend. We did get positive news on the banking sector. A U.S. official telling CNN that deposits at the small and midsized banks, they have stabilized. Those big cash withdrawals out of the small banks into the big banks has either eased or stopped or even reversed, in some cases. And that, of course, is very encouraging and something U.S. officials are watching very closely.",

This was a stock that was collapsing.Some of their counterparties reportedly backing away from the bank. And also, we saw big deposit outflows out of Credit Suisse. I think the good news here, from a U.S. perspective, is that U.S. official tells CNN that U.S. banks have pretty limited exposure to Credit Suisse at this point. Again, the hope is that this emergency rescue sort of stabilizes things.",

Right?If you look at the retail and where housing sectors, for example, massive expansion early on in the pandemic. Now you're seeing consumption of the kinds of products you buy from Amazon fall back down to earth. Amazon also looks like maybe pulling back on some employment in non- warehousing parts of its business, in cloud computing or other sectors. That may be the result of greater anxiety about the overall economy, rising interest rates, risk of recession, et cetera. I think this is not the only institution or major company that right now is trying to re-evaluate how to position itself in this very uncertainly economy. And I wouldn't be surprised if you see other big announcements from companies in the weeks or months ahead. Not necessarily signaling layoffs. Some may be.

The flight from Arizona to Hawaii went through severe turbulence. And 36 people onboard injured, including a 14-month-old baby. The FAA says, throughout these incidents and even worse if there's was a crash, your arms are not strong enough to hold onto a baby that is in your lap. So the Association of Flight Attendants is renewing its call to have children under 2 in a car seat onboard a commercial airliner. But also backed up by NTSB chair general, Jennifer Homendy, who says this is one of 25 recommendations the NTSB has made for new regulations from the FAA that would make turbulence a lot less dangerous.

You should be required to have a baby on your lap strapped in, something that the airlines could do on their own or the FAA could do.\" The big thing here, if you have to do this, make sure you have a car seat, front facing or rear facing, with this label on it, that red label, that says the car seat is certificated to onboard airplanes.
