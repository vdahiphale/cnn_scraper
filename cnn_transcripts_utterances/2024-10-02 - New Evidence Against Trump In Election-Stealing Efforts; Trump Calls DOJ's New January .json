Live at the table, Bakari Sellers, Scott Jennings, Ashley Allison, Bryan Lanza, and Bomani Jones. With 33 days to go, Americans with different perspectives aren't talking to each other, but here, they do. (END VIDEOTAPE) PHILLIP (on camera): Good evening, I'm Abby Phillip in New York. Let's get right to what America is talking about tonight. Jack Smith makes his case in public just one month before the election. The special counsel is demanding that Donald Trump stand trial for his quest to cling to power. It is a revealing and damning new accusation in a major filing and it shows that the former president knew the conspiracies were B.S., he peddled them anyway, and he did so illegally in his personal capacity. But here are some of the newer headlines from Jack Smith that you should pay attention to. Donald Trump was told many times, many, many times by many people that these claims were false. He even acknowledged that one of his favorite conspiracy theorists was crazy. He was told that the conspiracies were, quote, effing nuts, and he plotted to declare victory, even if he had not won. He and his allies looked to spread conspiracies to create chaos, one even saying, quote, make them riot. When Trump was told that Mike Pence was in danger at the Capitol on January 6th, Trump responded, so what? And the testimony, the phone evidence, shows Trump refused to take action during the insurrection. But here is the big picture. There is a chance that the Supreme Court could throw this whole immunity case out. So, effectively, is this the last chance that voters will have to see the evidence that Jack Smith has before they cast their ballot? Take that to the table here. I mean, it is kind of unusual, first of all, for this to happen at this particular juncture, but some of it is because this case kept getting pushed back. And now we have basically Jack Smith putting all his cards on the table and saying this is what we have. This is why we need to go to trial.",

I think the American people deserve to know what happened in this instance on January 6th. Many of us watched it with our eyes. Many of us watched the January 6th hearings and heard people who were close to Donald Trump on that day, people who still haven't really come out against Donald Trump in terms of being a candidate, saying that he did things that were not to uphold the Constitution, and yet four years later, we still have this big question mark. I wish this case had been resolved months ago, even before the Republican primary, but here we are.So, I still want to know all the facts, even if it feels a little late because the reality is January 6th happened and we need to know exactly what Donald Trump's role was.",

I think if you're mad at Donald Trump over this, you still are. And I think if you think he got a raw deal, you still think that.You know, the issue of, democracy in the election was high up in the CNN poll this week, but that means different things to different people. There was a poll in Georgia this week that more voters thought Trump would strengthen democracy than Kamala Harris. So, I think it's gotten muddled as a political matter. But I agree with Bakari.

But one of the things about this is that Trump is actually running to be president again. And some of this information, I think, is pretty damning.I mean, let me just read an excerpt about -- this is the part about the rioting that was being discussed. When a colleague suggested that there was about to be unrest reminiscent of the Brooks Brothers riot, a violent effort to stop the vote count in Florida in 2000, one of the conspirators, who's not named, P5, responded, make them riot and do it. The defendant's campaign operatives and supporters used similar tactics at other tabulation centers.

We saw more videos and saw how crazy it was, not just some kooky people walking around with funny hats and doing stuff, right? That was the time to affect people. Now, this just feels like another time that Donald Trump has gone to court. Because the truth is, if you still need somebody to convince you one direction or another about what happened on that day, you're done for. People have decided, no, we are willing to vote for the dude that tried to overthrow the government the last time, and even if he tries to stick around for the rest of his life, there are some people who have decided that they're willing to go from that.

In Springfield, they're eating the dogs -- the people that came in. They're eating the cats. They're eating -- they're eating the pets of the people that live there. SEN. J.D. VANCE (R-OHIO), VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: In Springfield, Ohio and in communities all across this country, you've got schools that are overwhelmed. You've got hospitals that are overwhelmed. You have got housing that is totally unaffordable because we brought in millions of illegal immigrants to compete with Americans for scarce homes. (END VIDEO CLIP) PHILLIP: It's quite the contrast.
