There's the war in Ukraine, the munitions the U.S. is sending to Ukraine, and then two, that failed coup attempt in Russia. Now there's three stops that the president will be doing. He's going to go to the U.K. where he'll meet with King Charles, as well as the British prime minister. Then he'll go to Lithuania for that NATO summit and conclude his trip in Finland. But during the course of all of that, the question looming over those meetings will be, is there room for the Ukraine to join NATO? Now, national security adviser Jake Sullivan was asked about this by reporters on Friday, and he confirmed that coming out of the summit, Ukraine will not be joining NATO, but they could talk about steps forward. President Biden himself said that it's premature for now, but there could be a path he could discuss during the gathering. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I spent, as you know, a great deal of time trying to hold NATO together, because I believe Putin has had an overwhelming objective from the time he launched 185,000 troops into Ukraine, and that was to break NATO.He was confident, in my view, and many in the intelligence community. He was confident he could break NATO. So holding NATO together is really critical. I don't think there is unanimity in NATO about whether or not to bring Ukraine into the NATO family now, at this moment, in the middle of a war. For example, if you did that, then you know -- and I mean what I say -- we're determined to commit every inch of territory that is NATO territory. It's a commitment that we've all made, no matter what. If the war is going on, then we're all in a war. You know? We're at war with Russia if that were the case. So, I think we have to lay out a path or a rational path for -- excuse me, for Ukraine to be able to qualify to get into NATO. And we have, when the very first time I met with Putin two years ago in Geneva, and he said, I want commitments on no Ukraine in NATO. I said, we're not going to do that because it's an open-door policy. We're not going to shut anybody out. NATO is a process that takes some time to meet all the qualifications, and from democratization to a whole range of other issues. So in the meantime, I've spoken with Zelenskyy at length about this, and one of the things I indicated is the United States would be ready to provide while the process was going on -- and it's going to take a while -- while that process is going on, to provide security a la the security we provide for Israel. Providing the weaponries needed, the capacity to defend themselves if there is an agreement, if there is (INAUDIBLE) but I think a vote, you know, isn't now because there's other qualifications for being in there including democratization and some of those issues.

We understand three of them in the Queens neighborhood of Richmond Hills and then another one in the nearby Cypress Hills neighborhood of Brooklyn, all very busy and very commercial neighborhoods here, Jim. We understand that suspect was aboard a scooter, used a 9 millimeter pistol with an extended magazine at those five scenes, shooting four people, one of them fatally. We understand he was a man in his 80s who unfortunately did not survive the shooting. One of the ones who did is a 44-year-old man who was shot in the face. He's still in critical condition with the rest of the injured that we are expected to pull through. The arrest happened just a couple of hours after all of this started in the 11:00 hour earlier today here, Jim. Apparently the authorities here saying they quickly were able to obtain a photograph of this suspect that we understand right now is only a 25-year-old Hispanic male that has been arrested, quickly disseminated that information to investigators who then were able to track him down again just two hours after these horrific scenes played out.

Anyway, that's what I have been doing, getting reset. John Radcliff Hospital in Oxford gave me more or less a clean bill of health a few weeks ago, so it seemed time to come back and at least see where I stand.

Ordinarily, you would never bring in someone, nor would that person come in for this sort of voluntary interview if they were a target, if they were someone who was likely to be charged. It's unfair and bad practice for DOJ to do that if someone's a target. And no decent lawyer -- and Rudy Giuliani has a decent lawyer in Bob Costello -- without ever agreeing to do that. Also, ordinarily, I would say this is a precursor to full-blown cooperation. However, there's no way you can cooperate Rudy Giuliani as a prosecutor in the full sense of the world. You can't put Rudy Giuliani on the stand and offer him to a jury as a witness. He's one of the least credible people in this whole saga. So, what seems safe to say, given those two things, is that DOJ's doing its diligence here. They need to talk to everybody. They need to get all the facts. If they think Rudy's offering some facts that are useful and truthful, fine. If they think he's lying or shading the truth, fine. They'd never have to use him as a witness. It's a curious development, but I think they're trying to make sure they look under every stone here.",

Here, I think what's important to note is he's singling out these two people, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, who are part of the Mueller team. He has gone after them publicly more times than we can count. So it's no question he had it in for them. It's important to note that he asked about it. He did not follow through on it. There's no evidence that they were targeted by the IRS, but there's no question Donald Trump wanted to go after them.",

And just inherently, if you have two defendants, there's more work to do, there's more discovery to turn over, there's more motions to be brought than if you have one.
