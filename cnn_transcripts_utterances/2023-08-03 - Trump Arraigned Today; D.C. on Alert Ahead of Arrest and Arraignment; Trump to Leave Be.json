Keep your eyes on this courthouse in Washington, D.C., today. It now becomes the center of the legal and political universe really in some sense. Hours from now, Donald Trump will come here. And once he steps inside, he will again be under arrest. Under arrest for the third time in four months as he faces a new round of criminal charges. At this courthouse, Donald Trump is expected to be fingerprinted. He is not expected to have a mug shot taken. He is going to face a federal magistrate judge. And all indications are he will be pleading not guilty to all four criminal counts. New details on how his lawyers plan to defend the former president are coming in today. His lawyers plan to argue that Trump's lies about the 2020 election, they are protected speech under the First Amendment and that they are expected to try and prove that Trump truly believed the claims of election fraud. But, overnight, Donald Trump's former attorney general, Bill Barr, had this to say about that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BILL BARR, FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL: That does not protect you from entering into a conspiracy. All conspiracies involve speech. And all fraud involves speech. So, you know, free speech doesn't give you the right to engage in a fraudulent conspiracy. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And we do think that this is going to be a fairly brief appearance for Donald Trump in court. Again, we have now seen this a couple of times before in other courthouses across the country. He'll be advised of the charges against him. He's going to be advised of his rights. And it's possible that he'll be given an opportunity today to enter a plea. We would, of course, expect him to plead not guilty to these four criminal charges he's facing. So, we're going to be looking for anything that Donald Trump actually says in court.

That is now closed. They're only allowing staff in there. You can see some of the federal protective services. These are the officers who protect the outside, the interior of the building. They're out here with bomb sniffing dogs. And every once in a while we see them walking around. But this, John, is the street that we expect the former president to drive through as he enters the courthouse. And what we've seen law enforcement here do is they're now setting up these snowplows. You know, we've seen them in other high security situations. And this is what they're using as an extra level of security here. They just moved these in this morning. And you can see just a lot of media here because we thought we'd be able to get a clear shot of Trump going in but it's sort of blocked here. Bet me show you here where he's going to enter. You can see through here. This is the street he's going to enter. There is a garage here on the left. And we expect the motorcade to drive down that garage and then he will enter into the courthouse, taken into custody by the U.S. Marshals, placed under arrest and then head up to the courthouse. And all along this street, as you mentioned, John, we're seeing these metal barriers all around really. And what they're doing basically is they're keeping people to the sidewalk on this side and on the other side they're not even letting people walk because that is the side where we believe the former president will be entering. The other thing really significant here this morning, we're not seeing the number of people we have seen previously when Trump has appeared in court. Certainly not to the level that we saw in Florida and certainly not to the level that we saw in New York City. So, we're not seeing those groups, those crowds yet. It's early, right. He's not here until 4:00. But for now, law enforcement taking every precaution, getting ready, getting their people in place, getting equipment in place as they await his arrival here sometime around 4:00, John.",

I was speaking to one of the senior officials with the Washington D.C. Police. They don't expect to close traffic here. They're going to keep the road open. They're going to limit some of the pedestrian traffic. But these here, these snowplows they're using sort of, you know, to kind of -- as an extra layer just in case that they need to block any vehicles. You know, they're -- people are concerned. Not so much for the former president's security let's say, but they're also just concerned that people may try to disrupt the proceedings here. And also, John, just quickly, keep in mind, we're not far from the Capitol. Just diagonal over here, this way, is the Capitol. And, of course, that is on the top of everyone's mind. These are the same law enforcement officials that were here on January 6th. And so, as a result, they're really not taking any chances and putting all of these precautions in place.",

Well, as you can see, and you've been hearing from some of his attorneys, they're really narrowing in on this one defense about him having the First Amendment right to have argued that the 2020 election was rife with fraud. They're also arguing that he genuinely believed that the 2020 election was stolen and that a lot of his behavior and the way that he was acting in the leadup to January 6th of 2021 and after was him following the advice of his attorneys.Now, one of his lawyers, John Lauro, spoke with NPR about this yesterday. Let's take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN LAURO, Donald TRUMP'S ATTORNEY: He got advice from counsel, very, very wise, and learned counsel, on a variety of constitutional and legal issues. So, it's a very straightforward defense that he had every right to advocate for a position that - that he believed in and his supporters believed in. What we will argue to the jury, and we'll win, is that President Trump was arguing for the truth to come out in that election cycle rather than the truth to be denied. (END VIDEO CLIP) TREENE: Now, Kate, it's unclear if this type of defense would hold up in the court of law. But if you do look at that 45 page indictment that special council Jack Smith and his team filed on Tuesday, they point out that their evidence shows that the former president did know that he lost the election. He was told by many officials around him, including those in his own government. They also argue that he did not have the right, prosecutors say, to engage in a conspiracy to defraud the United States, nor to obstruct the January 6th proceedings. Kate.",

It's the kind of thing that gets raised occasionally in criminal cases, somebody committing securities fraud or something like that says, oh, I was just expressing my opinion. And as a general matter, it is not a very powerful defense if you've been breaking the law.What the indictment did that was important is it said, look, he had the right to say publicly what he believed. He even had the right to lie publicly. But these are actions. And so this is the kind of defense in part that may be aimed for appealing the case, appealing a conviction, rather than actually winning in the courtroom.",

And so what we're seeing here is a Republican Party that is so disconnected from reality that Jack Smith has his work cut out for him if one of the goals is to win in the court of public opinion.

I'm just here because this is what I want to do on a Tuesday morning.So, Jack Smith believes he has the evidence to find the president guilty, not only here, but in south Florida.

And that's where we're going to see the hardest part of this is, how do you prove what was in somebody's head. Mike Pence has some firsthand knowledge here that he was recording at the time. It's going to make him very, very important, not just in this trail, but if he qualifies for the debate, and it - and it looks like he's going to, to be that voice on the stage that take on Donald Trump in a way that the other Republican candidates have been very fearful of doing so thus far.",
