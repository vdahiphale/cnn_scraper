US President Joe Biden saying in the last hour, there is no evidence that three recently downed aerial objects are linked to China's spy program. He says that they were likely tied to private companies or research institutions. The objects were shot down in the days after a suspected Chinese spy balloon traveled over the US. Biden says that he will meet with China's President Xi Jinping and makes no apologies for having the balloon taken out. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

What this recall is essentially saying is that even with a driver in place, this software, this full self-driving technology, the software that is in many of these vehicles, 363,000, it is dangerous even with that driver in place. So I want to walk you through what this recall notice from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is saying is the danger here. It is claiming that this self-driving technology, the software could allow the vehicle to act unsafe, these Tesla vehicles to act unsafe around the intersections like traveling straight through an intersection from a turn only lane or entering a stop sign controlled intersection without coming to a complete stop or proceeding into an intersection during a steady yellow traffic signal without due caution. There were also concerns that it could respond insufficiently to changes in posted speed limits or it may not react properly if drivers start to go above that posted speed limit. So again, a lot of concerns outlined there. This report makes clear that Tesla did not agree with NHITSA, the Federal agency's analysis here, but it did agree to do this recall of their vehicles. The big question now is what will this free software update that Tesla is putting out actually do to fix the problem or at least, how much of the problem will it fix. Remember, this is coming just a few days after an attack ad during the Super Bowl from The Dawn Project that showed images, video of Tesla driving through mannequins of children. This has been a technology under the microscope, that ad saying that Tesla's are using unsafe self-driving software. So the big news here this 363,000 Tesla's being recalled, but a lot of questions not necessarily answers at this point to how the company's software update is going to fix the problem. Tesla hasn't put out a formal response yet, but Elon Musk has been tweeting saying the word \"recall\" -- this is what he writes: \"The word recall for an over-the-air software update is anachronistic and just flat wrong.\" So you can tell he does not want the word \"recall\" used for his vehicles, but that is what this Federal agency, NHITSA is saying and they want Tesla drivers to be aware of it.",

This is a good time for the World Bank to do that. So no regrets at all. In fact, I was very pleased that I talked with my Board of Directors yesterday, and they gave a long ovation. You know, we've -- I thank them for all they've done. Remember, during COVID, we set up this special system for a fast track approach to getting health aid to the countries, personal protective equipment, and then big vaccination programs that were some of the most important for the world in actually getting vaccines into people's arms and that was made possible by flexibility within the organization, plus the sizable resources we were able to get through IDA 19 and IDA 20. You know, we've had two record replenishments in my tenure in 2019, and 2022, I guess, for IDA 20 and those have been not massively important for the poorest.

The next in line is municipal infrastructure, water, wastewater, pipes, electricity distribution. And of course, also the airports, roads, the bridges have been damaged.

So the reconstruction only came the year after. So we did some comparisons in terms of assets destroyed, productive assets, residents. And it's a very rough estimate.

That will certainly (INAUDIBLE) new building standards -- not only seismic, earthquake proof but also greener buildings, as in this case mandatory, to reduce Turkiye's footprint.

The biggest issue here is the judge wanting to make sure that Sam Bankman-Fried is not improperlycontacting any former employees or he's not using the internet in a way that the government cannot track. That is the reason why he called everyone back to court today, just one week after they were here. The judge at the hearing today said he would give Bankman-Fried's attorneys more time to ease his concerns but he did say very clearly another option on the table is remand, putting Bankman- Fried in detention until his trial, set for later this year. The bigger issue, as you noted, Bankman-Fried had contacted former employees and used the VPN. Prosecutors came back to the judge saying, we have this broad restriction idea. We limit him to one cell phone, one laptop, have monitoring on those. And then only allow him to communicate on the cell phone using a voice communication and SMS text and also Zoom to communicate with attorneys. There is a concern the government acknowledges, he needs access to materials to prepare his own defense. And all these materials are on a cloud. So prosecutors saying they are trying to work with that. As the judge said, he lives with his parents. His parents are Stanford law professors. They have laptops, they have wi-fi. They have cell phones. How could you be so sure that Bankman-Fried is not going to use any of those devices to get around, to potentially commit crimes while out on bail? Prosecutors said, there is not a great solution to that. The judge said there is but no one is talking about it. That was the reference to potentially remanding Bankman-Fried. So he told SBF's attorneys they can have until Tuesday of next week to come back with them about this idea the judge proposed, having a security expert that would work only for him, that would help him try to negotiate and tailor this world of internet and cryptocurrency and understand all the needs Bankman-Fried would need and have to access the internet to prepare his defense. But also limited so he couldn't commit any crimes while out on bail. The judge really striking a harsh tone, saying right now there's probable cause to believe that SBF  attempted to or engaged in witness tampering. That alone, he suggested, was enough that could force them to have a hearing for remand. But he was not going there as far as today, giving them until next week to come back with this security expert idea. Also proposed other ways they could try to ensure that Bankman-Fried will not commit any crimes or potentially tamper with any witnesses or evidence while out on bail. Rahel.",
