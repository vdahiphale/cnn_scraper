      "sentences": "OUTFRONT nextTrump taking on New Hampshire. The former president, making his appearance after first spending most of his day in a New York courtroom. This as Nikki Haley is trying to force a two-person race with Trump and clean up her remarks today, declaring that the United States has, quote, never been a racist country. Plus, she accused Trump of groping her on an airplane and then testified against him in the E. Jean Carroll case. Jessica Leeds will be OUTFRONT tonight. And Putin saying the quiet part out loud, talking total domination of all of Ukraine. This as you'll see in a story first on OUTFRONT, Ukrainian military desperately trying to fight back with U.S. vehicles described as tank killers. You will see it all on the ground. Let's go OUTFRONT. (MUSIC) And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. And OUTFRONT tonight, the last to arrive. After spending the day in New York courtroom, President Trump is in New Hampshire. But it comes on the heels of his huge win in Iowa. He just started to speak about last night's caucuses and he arrived this evening after spending his day in New York -- as I said, in a courtroom, face-to-face with a woman that he was found liable of sexually abusing. And Trump's court appearance today kicks off a trial about how much he will have to pay E. Jean Carroll for defamation related to that. The man who just won the Iowa caucuses by more than any other contested candidate in American history spent his day in a courtroom regarding a case in which he was found liable of sexual abuse. So it is just worth saying that again and pausing for a moment to consider it, because in some ways, it is hard to, you know, square this with the reality that in many ways it is business as usual on the campaign trail. Now, Nikki Haley tried to force a two-way race with Trump, even though she was a close third in Iowa. Today, she actually canceled her debate with DeSantis. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He is not my concern. I'm going after Trump. He's the front runner. He's the one that I'm seven points away from. He's the one that were fighting for. There is nobody else I need to debate. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So yes, he won young voters. Yes, Haley, actually won one county, the only one Trump didn't, by one vote. But turnout, yeah, it was the lowest in 24 years. But these layers of the onion do not change the bottom line, which is that Trump's victory in Iowa was overwhelming. And the next few days in New Hampshire will show whether Trump can continue to build on his momentum and end this race quickly or not. Jeff Zeleny is OUTFRONT. He's live in Henniker, New Hampshire. Obviously, that town hall with DeSantis and Wolf Blitzer is slated to begin later tonight.
