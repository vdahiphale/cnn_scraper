(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DAVID CULVER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): So, police stations like this one here in Port-au-Prince are main targets for gangs. They feel like as soon as they can get hold of a station like this, they can then take siege and take control of much of the community, and they've tried coming after this one. Many at times, reinforcements have been built up, not only because of the police, but because of the community. They've got barricades all around here. For the police station to function properly, they need to rely on the community, and to have these almost vigilantes building a lot of the barricades to keep out any gang members. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Perhaps, it's the Kenyan police officers, perhaps it's help from others in the international community, but they've gotten to a point, Isa, where they have realized that maybe the necessary steps here, because it has fallen on so many within these communities to figure out how to navigate this situation. And we even spent time going to some of the refugee camps that you have to imagine, it's refugees or folks who have fled violence within their own cities, they're refugees of their own hometown.

Thousands are still believed to be trapped inside that hospital where they have been told to remain. The Israeli military launched this operation overnight. It involved not only ground forces, tanks, armored vehicles, but also apparently, airstrikes as multiple eyewitnesses on the ground reported missiles being fired around the Al-Shifa compounds, including several according to one doctor on the scene hitting a building within the Al-Shifa medical complex, setting the surgical departments on fire. Now, this operation, according to the Israeli military was launched because they say that Hamas has begun using that hospital once again for its military operations. You'll remember of course, that the Israeli military back in November raided the Al-Shifa Hospital because they claim that Hamas was operating a major underground command and control complex. They were able to show evidence of tunnels beneath that hospital at the time, although, it fell short of showing some extensive command center which they had described. But nonetheless, the Israeli military now claiming that Hamas is back at that hospital again, saying that they engaged in firefights with militants, killing at least 20 during the day. Hamas, interestingly also said that it engaged in firefight with the Israeli military around the Al-Shifa complex. The Israeli military also says that they killed a senior Hamas operative on the scene. But what is also clear is that they were clearly civilian casualties resulting from some of those strikes that we saw around the Al-Shifa complex. Major strikes to several buildings in the Al-Rimal neighborhood near Al- Shifa, and among them, we saw women and children among the deceased. We also know that the Israeli military has ordered now the evacuation of that neighborhood, Al-Rimal in Gaza city, with people now fleeing to central Gaza, where uncertainty awaits them there as well.",

Each of them recognize that we are at a critical moment in this conflict. They share a common objective, that is for Israel to prevail over Hamas. And they have a different perspective on this operation in Rafah, and they went into some detail on that, and had the opportunity really to elaborate each of their respective views in a full-throated way, in the way they always do when President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu talk. So, in that sense, I would say this call was much like previous calls that the two of them have had. They each agreed to have the teams get together, and then they agreed that the two of them would stay in touch as we go forward. Yes.",

So, we have taken steps. The President reaffirmed today the need for Israel to do everything in its power and even more than it has already done to address the humanitarian crisis. And obviously, we saw a U.N. report today, which Director Power of USAID spoke to quite eloquently. It's an alarming report about a possible impending famine if everyone doesn't do their responsibility to ensure we address that. That starts first and foremost with Israel, who has an obligation to step up and ensure that more is done to deliver food to starving people in northern Gaza. But it's also incumbent on us, the United States, and the rest of the international community to step up as well. We're proud to be the largest contributor of humanitarian assistance to Gaza, but there's more we can do and there's more others can do as well. This has to be an all-hands-on-deck effort. Yes.",

And it is clear that Hamas fired back at Israel from that hospital. Second, we have seen Hamas, over the course of this conflict, use civilian facilities, including hospitals, to store weapons for command and control and to house fighters. And that places an added burden on Israel that very few militaries have to deal with, an entrenched insurgency, a terrorist group using the shield of civilian institutions to protect themselves during a fight rather than meeting Israel on some open field of battle. And then third, it also tells us something else that of some concern that I spoke to in my opening comments. Israel cleared Shifa once. Hamas came back into Shifa, which raises questions about how to ensure a sustainable campaign against Hamas so that it cannot regenerate, cannot retake territory. And from our perspective, it is connecting Israel's objective to a sustainable strategy that is the vital thing we need to focus on right now rather than have Israel go smash into Rafah.

What is clear is that the U.S., this administration, is deeply concerned over plans for Rafah. The U.S. apparently hasn't seen -- hasn't been presented by any plans and says that any major ground operation in Rafah would be a mistake. In terms of the tone of the call where Jake Sullivan was asked about this, he said it didn't end abruptly and said it was businesslike. That to me doesn't say like it isn't particularly a strong relationship, but they do share a common objective, of course that is, and putting it into Hamas, but they have a different perspective on the operation in Rafah. And before we went to the National Security Advisor, I was speaking to the former Prime Minister of Israel, Ehud Barak. Mr. Barak, I'm sure you were listening in as we heard there from Jake Sullivan. It's clear that that was -- I mean, it was described as a businesslike conversation, clearly perhaps a tense call. It seems this relationship between both leaders has become somewhat acrimonious. And one of the glaring disagreements is what we were talking about -- what we just heard there, is this proposed Israeli offensive in Rafah, which President Biden previously called it a red line in an interview with -- a red line -- and we know that, pardon me, the Netanyahu has doubled down on that. What happens? What will be the impact of this assault, not just for civilians and humanitarian causes, but also for the U.S.-Israeli relations?",

But, you know, when you look at the overall picture, I believe Israel has to make a decision. In fact, it had to make it several months ago. We have a binary choice to make. Are we going with America, even if we say, yes, but we have a lot of reservations, a lot of security interests, a lot of worries from our experience with Hamas in the past. But the choice is whether to go with America, say yes, but, and sit behind closed doors to clarify exactly how to do it. America is leading an axis of moderate against the axis of rogue states led by Iran and backed by Russia. And that's the choice.
