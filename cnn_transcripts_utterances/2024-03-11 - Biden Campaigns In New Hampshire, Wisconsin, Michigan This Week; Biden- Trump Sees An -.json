But Joe Biden and Donald Trump taking their campaign pitches on the road and lobbying personal shots at each other in the same critical swing state.Plus, new reporting on what Donald Trump says about dictators like Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un behind closed doors. You won't believe how his former chief of staff says Trump once described Adolf Hitler. And Senator Bob Menendez was just arraigned again, on new charges of bribery and extortion. Prosecutors accused the Democrat of acting as a foreign agent for Egypt and aiding the Qatari government. So why is he sitting -- still sitting on key Senate committees and receiving classified briefings. I'm Manu Raju in for Dana Bash in Washington. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. First up, Joe Biden in full-fledged campaign mode. Trying to build on his State of the Union by traveling to multiple swing states this week. Today he's headed to New Hampshire, state with one of the oldest populations to talk about healthcare. You can expect him to remind voters that his opponent wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act. CNN's Kevin Liptak is in Goffstown, New Hampshire where this president will speak this afternoon. Kevin, you've been talking to Biden campaign aides. What are you hearing?",

So, they just want to keep building on that momentum. It's obviously one speech is not going to change the perceptions of voters. So, they feel that in Georgia and in Philadelphia last weekend, in New Hampshire today, they want to keep building on that contract that he's -- that they want to present with Donald Trump.

Seeing the poll numbers that have been bad for the president time and time again, or Donald Trump winning and questions about his age and fitness.Some of them has been alleviated on the left in the aftermath of his State of the Union. Just an example of which the liberal columnist, Ezra Klein had a couple of headlines in recent weeks. This one is a recent one. It says fine. Call it a comeback says, it's Joe Biden who showed up to deliver the State of the Union address last week is the Joe Biden shows up for the rest of the campaign. You're not going to have any more of those weak-kneed pundits suggesting he's not up to running for reelection. Here's hoping he does. And of course, there was a client also wrote just a pretty recently I think, Democrats have a better option than Joe Biden. That's a past headline, what does it say, February 16. So not too far ago. You been talking to Democrats. How -- are they -- do they feel better? Or is it still -- the jury's still out? JOHN BRESNAHAN, CO-FOUNDER, PUNCHBOWL NEWS: Well, they feel better. I think they definitely -- as you were talking about the State of the Union was a big pivot point for them. But it's one speech, it's not enough. You're talking about on the left, they're still huge concern over the war in Gaza. That's a huge issue. They want to see the president do more on that. I think -- I think, until they get past that, I think that's going to be a big problem. But, you know, they were looking at the polls out of Michigan. They were looking at the polls out of Wisconsin, where he's going this week. They were not good bowls. And they're saying, you know, their chances of winning the House also and keeping their losses down the Senate also ride with Biden. So, you know, they have a lot at stake here. Not only, you know, Trump's return and everything with that means. But you know, what is it -- what is the next Congress? What is the 119th Congress look like?

He Trump, views himself as a big guy. He likes dealing with other big guys and big guys like Erdogan in Turkey get to put people in jail and you don't have to ask anybody's permission. He kind of likes that. And ex-Trump Chief of Staff John Kelly tells Jim. Trump even praised Hitler. He said, well, but Hitler did some good things. I said, well, what? And he said, well, Hitler rebuilt the economy. But what did he do with that rebuilt an economy. He turned it against his own people and against the world.

Our excellent panel is back. What is it, you know, you are on the campaign trail a lot with Nikki Haley. She attacked Donald Trump for his praise of autocrat strong man.

Many of them told me they would vote for Trump ultimately if faced with a choice between Trump and Biden, and a lot of them said they just didn't know.So, you know, I think where this goes, next is a big question.

But first, I want to get into another big story at the moment. In an interview this morning with CNBC, Trump said Congress should not move forward with a bill that could ban TikTok from the United States.

And I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people, along with a lot of the media. If you ban TikTok, Facebook and others, but mostly Facebook will be a big beneficiary.

And they added and kind of repeated what Donald Trump just said there, which is that there is a concern that if TikTok were to be banned or bought that some of its users would migrate to Facebook.And of course, Donald Trump has been very critical of Facebook over the past several years. He believes personally that they had some role in him losing the 2020 election. Of course, there's questions of whether that is true or not. But that's where some of this is stemming from. And also, it's important to note that this comes as the House is expected to vote at some point this week on a potential ban on Facebook or to force it to be sold away from ByteDance. And so, that's where the timing of this comes into it. Now, I also just want to point out that Donald Trump was also posting about this on Truth Social last week, and that post came just hours after he met with Jeffrey Yass. He's someone who has a big Republican donor and also has a huge stake in TikTok, more than $30 billion. And here you see that post there where he wrote if you get rid of TikTok, Facebook and Zucker, schmuck will double their business. I don't want Facebook who cheated in the last election doing better they are true enemy of the people. So, we're going to see this continue to play out this week. But I also just want to know, Manu, that when I spoke with Trump's advisors, they argued that unlike with the bipartisan border bill that we saw Donald Trump really go scorched earth on and really have a role in tanking it. They argue that he doesn't feel the same way about this. That if Congress decides that they want to move forward with this bill, he will support them in that decision.",
