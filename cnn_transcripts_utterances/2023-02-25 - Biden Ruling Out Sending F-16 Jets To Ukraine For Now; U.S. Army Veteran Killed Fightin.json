Last February the world watched in horror as Russian troops rolled across the border and into Ukrainian cities. Many, especially those in Russia, thought the invasion would be swift and that Ukraine would fall quickly. But Ukraine had other plans. They have surprised the world with its strength and determination. That defiance, though, has come at a heavy price for the country and its people. The U.N. estimates that at least 8,000 Ukrainian civilians have been killed since the war began. And many observers wondered just how long Kyiv can continue to hold on in the face of so much Russian aggression. Days after his historic visit to Ukraine, President Joe Biden spoke with ABC News about how he sees the war progressing at this point and what he thinks about the idea of a negotiated settlement.

I found an amazing country, you know, that defied everything that we thought we knew about Eastern Europe.It turns out that I knew people in Ukraine who were graduates of school that I've been to, the Defense Language Institute, who were in the Ukrainian army. And then when the -- you know, we knew the invasion was coming. We knew it was imminent. And when it came, the ferocity of the Russian attacks on civilians was just too much. I mean, I understood that this was the eastern wall of democracy. That Russia was not attacking Ukraine over Nazis or Zelenskyy. It was about not having democracy on the Russian doorstep, and that he was trying to take over also 25 percent of the world's grain. 25 percent of all flour in the world, produced in this world, comes from Ukraine. It was a war of extinction. The Russians said that. It was going to eliminate the Ukrainian language, their intellectual class, their government class. You know, as a person like myself, I spent decades in the armed forces and in the intelligence community. And I thought, you know, I'm not going to be able to look myself in the mirror doing reporting on this.

And four minutes later, 8:49, his son's and wife's cell phones are locked, suggesting that it is around the time they were killed. A short timeframe for someone to come and commit this double murder.

But look. If the jury does not adopt the prosecution's timeline, this is where the defense is going to go in their closing arguments. They're going to say the prosecution's time of death is based on the lack of cell phone activity. And in addition to the medical examiner and coroner's testimony, both of whom said that they cannot give the exact time of death. They can only give a range of time. And so the defense is going to say, well, look, the prosecutor has not proved that beyond a reasonable doubt. So there is a reasonable possibility that this crime happened between 9:00 and 10:00 based on the medical data. Nobody can tell you what was going on with those cell phones at the time. And jury, if you believe that this crime could have been committed, especially after 9:06 where everyone agrees Murdaugh was no longer at the scene, then you cannot convict.

The entire day, I-5 has been closed. This is a major highway between Los Angeles and San Francisco, and yet, everyone around me asking me, \"When are they going to open it?\" Because no one knows. And authorities are already saying, look, we can't do anything about this weather. People in Southern California are just not used to this type of snow. I mean, if I just take a few steps, you'll see how deep the snow is. You talked about eight feet, that is in the high elevation areas, seven or eight feet of snow. In the lower elevation areas, maybe three, four feet.

So it is just unbelievable in terms of what we can see over the next couple of days. Now, in LA, further south and a little bit east, it has been a mess because of the rain. A lot of flooding, cars that had been stranded, and again, it's a similar scenario because people from Los Angeles are not used to the water. So no one is used to all this rain.
