If you're just joining us, let me bring up to date with our top stories this hour.At least five people are dead and eight others injured after a gunman opened fire inside a bank in Louisville, Kentucky. The 25-year-old suspect was an employee who officials say was told that he was going to lose his job. He left behind a note for his parents and friends informing them of his plans. And later today, U.S. Presidential Biden will head to Northern Ireland to celebrate 25 years of the landmark Good Friday Agreement that mostly ended decades of sectarian violence. And I say, mostly because some of it is still going on. On Monday agitators with a fringe Republican faction attacked police during a parade that they staged to mark the 1916 uprising against British rule. And from the Unionist side, its largest political party is boycotting the legislature that the agreement set up over Brexit trade rules that they say would separate Northern Ireland from the rest of the U.K. But some Northern Ireland businesses say that they're now seeing a bonanza from those same rules. CNN's Nic Robertson is in Belfast, Northern Ireland, for us on that part of the story. And Nic tell us more about the political challenges but also opportunities that Brexit has caused there.",

The White House says the move does not affect a separate public health emergency, which will end on May 11th. But when both emergencies are formally over next month that will end government funded tests, treatments and vaccines, as well as some other social safety net programs designed to help the U.S. deal with the pandemic. West Virginia has settled a lawsuit with e-cigarette maker Juul Labs for $7.9 million. That is, according to the state's Attorney General. The state accused the company of unfair and deceptive advertising that was aimed at teenagers. Juul says the settlement is another step in its ongoing commitment to resolve issues from the company's past. A new study warns that weight loss in older adults can come with the risk of early death. The study published Monday examined 17,000 adults in Australia who were 70 and up and 2,000 in the U.S. who are at least 65. And found that even a 5 percent weight loss increases the risk of mortality particular -- particularly in older men. One of the researchers said that dropping weight can be an early symptom of conditions like cancer and dementia.

And he gave this rare news conference on Monday evening against the backdrop of plummeting poll numbers, which show that he is not only no longer Israelis first choice for Prime Minister. He's not even the second choice. And that if an election were to be held tomorrow, he and his far-right allies in his governing coalition would be turfed out of office. That's according to a poll held by channel 13.Now Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu brushed off this poll, saying he's kind of opinion polls come and go. But he gave this new conference rarely to try to reassure his supporters and also to warn his enemies, particularly Palestinian militants in the West Bank, in the Gaza Strip, in Lebanon and Syria, that despite Israel's internal divisions that have seen hundreds of thousands of protesters against his judicial overhaul plans over the past three months, that Israel is still capable and willing to act when it feels the need to do so. He also used the opportunity to blame the deteriorating security situation on the previous government, which was in office for one year. The previous Prime Minister, one of the previous prime ministers in that government, Naftali Bennett, tweeting that Netanyahu's comments were un-leader like and shameful. And I suppose the final reason -- and this is an important one. That Netanyahu held this news conference was to officially rescind his firing of his defense minister, Yoav Gallant. And you may recall that it was his firing of Gallant who had the temerity to call for a pause to Netanyahu's judicial overhaul plans that brought hundreds of thousands of Israelis onto the streets, prompted a general strike and ultimately lead to Netanyahu, pausing those judicial overhaul plans -- Bianca.",
