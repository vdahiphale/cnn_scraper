How can the most vulnerable countries protect against climate change if they're drowning in debt? A major international aid agency revealed this week that 93% of the world's worst affected countries can't even afford to safeguard against natural disasters. Some are being forced to slash public spending or invest in fossil fuel industries just to pay back their debts to central banks. ActionAid International says it is high time for a radical overhaul of the way debt is managed to stop the climate crisis spiraling, pointing to the IMF and World Bank meetings this week in Washington. The COP 27 Climate Summit in November made historic progress on creating a fund for countries most at risk. The impact of our changing climate is all around us all the time. Like the two apartment buildings that collapsed in a landslide in Mexico this week. Landslides affect people all over the world. And scientists say that climate change is only making them worse.

On the other end, you can have very large landslides much, much larger. They might move very slowly in some instances. Those are the kinds that damage roads and cause closures. When you look at a global scale, the numbers we have in terms of the estimates for casualties are largely an underestimate. Many landslides aren't reported, many casualties aren't reported. And often what you'll see is that landslides are secondary hazard. They're associated with something bigger, for example, an earthquake or a big rainstorm, and so often casualties are kind of lumped under the primary hazard an earthquake, for example. One thing that many researchers and state agencies, and federal agencies are looking into is how does this change in climate control the rate of landsliding, and the associated hazards with it. It's under the suspicion that this -- that our changing climate will drive more landslide fence. Effectively, we might expect more extreme precipitation events in certain parts of the country, and that can drive significantly more landsliding. One potential driver of landslides is snow melt, especially when snow melts very quickly. We're seeing larger fires. These larger and more intense burns can also predispose the landscape to more landslides. More hurricanes, et cetera, could also result in more landslide events. It's complicated. Landslides and our interaction with landslides as people is often viewed as a negative, you know. It can cause casualty, it can cause property damage and damage to our infrastructure. But in reality, landslides are a natural process. They shape the landscape. They make the mountains look like they look like. So in the end, you know, it's just one of those many natural things that might pose a hazard to people but are part of the natural process on the planet. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So in the United States alone, since 1860, we've lost about 60 billion metric tons of topsoil. So that means that there are all these cascading effects that make it harder for trees to catch on harder for roots to take, because we exploit the environment around us. And I think that's something that people in the past, in the very distant past were extremely aware of, that if you over exploit your natural environment. There are ecological consequences that can like make life precarious, as in the case of landslides threats to life. But it can also damage our ability to grow things to make the land work in the way in which we want to need it to.",

      "sentences": "Well, I guess it's three things. First, when we go back to the beginning of recorded history, human history where people start to writethings down. All the people in the past were worried about ecological collapse. The story of the creation, which is sacred to Jews, and Christians, and Muslims, is all about God creating an environment that is perfect. And if you transgress and disobey God, you're punished with Adam and Eve being expelled from the Garden of Eden and finding it difficult to make things grow and the displeasure of God through the floods of Noah, or through Chinese belief systems or Indian belief systems, to show that if you get things wrong, there are consequences. I think that's important. Second, as a historian, the spread of human history is all about rises and falls. And some of those great cities in the past aren't here anymore today. Places like to Tikal or Chichen Itza.",

These were greatcities that people don't really know of any more, the name, let alone being thriving civilizations. And that's because if you fail to adapt to change, if you fail to adapt to rising populations, to water shortages, to the ability to exploit and grow things, then there are consequences. So there's a bit of a warning, I think, around that. But third is around about the ecological world we live in today, which is clearly at a series of tipping points where we need to be very conscious of what happens when there are vulnerabilities of a warming world. So for example, there are about 300 cities in today's world where the average temperature is above 35 degrees centigrade. We reckon by 2050, there'll be more like 600 cities, and that's nearly 2 billion people who are obviously going to be living in conditions that you can defeat through sciences, you can invest in air conditioning, but life becomes much more difficult and dangerous. And I think that one of the things I'm very aware of in the world today is we don't connect with the world around us particularly well, you know. We are aware that fossil fuels create carbon dioxide and these emissions that make the world warmer, but we don't think too much about where things come from, how they're grown, how many -- there are 20,000 plastic bottles sold every second or, you know, a couple of years ago, when there were big Russian forest fires, 10 football pitches per minute are lost from forest.",

It put out a report today saying that wind and solar power produced a record amount of the world's electricity last year, and it sees that trend continuing in the years ahead. So, I mean, a, do you buy that? And b, can science save, as you said, we don't particularly adapt. Well, we don't particularly pay attention to this, you know, effect and the consequences, et cetera.

Everyone's aware of recycling but it might well be that a price to pay is different kinds of political decision making to lead us to those transitions.",

And when you createinequalities, you can have situations that lead to social unrest. For example, in the 1780s in France, very severe winters and wet springs reduced the amount of wheat that was grown, that forced prices up, cost of living went up, inflation. And then the king tried to say, well, look, listen, anybody who's got a grievance, please send it in writing. And 25,000 people submitted documents -- 25,000 documents were submitted. And that then spilled over into calls for more dramatic action that led to the French Revolution, and the king's head in a basket a couple of years later. So those kinds of things can happen when there's when there's sudden shocks. You can produce volatilities. And I'm, you know, going back, Christiane, what you're asking about now. I think that the problem is, is that we're in the middle of such a big crisis here in Europe because of the war in Ukraine, because of Russia, because of energy. That it's concentrated lots of our minds. So funnily enough, one of the byproducts of Putin's invasion of Ukraine has been to accelerate a green transition.",

And that's metalswhich, lo and behold, lots come from Russia. And then lots of the rare earths we need for the super magnets and for the other materials are from China, where we also have a very fractured relationship and difficult relationship for many good reasons at the moment. So those transitions aren't as simple as saying, let's just put turbines up everywhere. It's how do you make those, where do you find them, how we got the metals and materials, what happens when suddenly everybody tries to act the same way. The price spikes work in different ways too.

But here we are in 2023, and although there's chronic poverty in most developed countries, as well as around the world, you know, we managed to do just about OK, you know. Actually, famines are relatively rare. When they do happen, the industrial communities tend to respond reasonably well. And I'm quite hopeful about that. It could be the demographics that are falling in most developed countries will start to alter the number of people, but people on their own are not the problem. It's how do you -- how do you spend what you've got. And I don't just mean financially, also, ecologically. I mean, every single pair of jeans requires 7,500 liters of water.

And working with Amazon Web Services, we sort of actually got that data set ready to be ingested and to be ready for AI ML. And then, we were able to find signatures that were associated with some of the larger events back over the last 50 years, and actually find some signatures that going forward. We know we should look for these signatures in future large space weather events. And since we've just had such an active sun with lots of great Aurora being visible, we've certainly got some great candidates for new science datasets that we can apply these AI ML techniques to.",

And weare learning all about the atmosphere of a star. So, you know, for decades and decades, we've studied the sun, we've studied it. We've looked at it in all different wavelengths. We've been in at that time, as far as the planet Mercury. And so, we've been able to study the extended atmosphere of the sun. But we really didn't know, I mean, you know that things are happening in certain regions, you know that there's suddenly an increase in heat, and there's a big increase in energy, and it causes that, that corona, to accelerate away very fast. But you don't know what the processes are, because you haven't been -- you haven't flown through them. You haven't actually flown and found out what is happening in that region. And so with Parker Solar Probe, we've been able to do that. We've certainly found that things that the -- the sort of the processes that we thought could be causing heat, things like magnetic field lines, sort of kinking on themselves, and then snapping back straight, which actually can release a lot of heat and energy.  That is happening further away from the sun than we originally thought on our very first perihelion path, or our closest approach, the very first one, where we thought, oh, you know, that'll be nice, we'll see some interesting stuff. And we actually started seeing these little features, these little switchbacks. They're like sort of S-shaped features in magnetic field lines, where it kind of kinking back on themselves. We saw those in the, you know, the very first orbit. As we get closer, we've seen them getting larger and getting more frequent. And so, you know, finding out these sorts of reasons that the sun is such an interesting star. And what we learn about our sun, we can apply to other stars in other stellar systems where we also see space weather. We see, you know, these big flares and big events that we see on our sun. We see them on other stars as well. So as you're looking for habitable planets, in other stellar systems, you know, what you learn about our sun is directly applicable.",

It was tough because sometimes, you know, youfelt like I don't understand something. But I don't want to ask the question because I don't want to be the one who looks dumb. And so, you know, it takes a little while to get comfortable with being OK, asking the questions. And, you know, I guess, I did my degree, I did a masters in engineering. And then I came back to Imperial College and did my PhD. And, you know, move to the US. There was -- there weren't a lot of women. I've seen a great increase in the number of women coming into the industry, taking up very leading roles. And I think it's, you know, it's important as a woman to talk to other, particularly to girls, and say, you know, you can do this. And there is a role for everybody in this type of business. And to make sure that, you know, you're being very supportive. I'll do things like I'll ask the dumb question, you know, the one that, you know, that I'll embarrass myself and I asked the question.

And now we've got -- we've sent our own spacecraft that have left even our protective bubble, our heliosphere, the two voyages that we have, you know, gone past every planet, and then now out in interstellar space. You know, looking at next generation missions that might go very fast out of our heliosphere and actually explore interstellar space, thinking about what it would take to get to the next nearest star, and how do we just -- how do we expand what we know.

And, I mean, being at NASA is, is even, you know, we're studying things that are just amazing. The technology is at the forefront, the science is at the forefront. And there are always more and more questions. Every mission you fly, you have three questions roughly you want to, you know, they have sort of high level science goals.
