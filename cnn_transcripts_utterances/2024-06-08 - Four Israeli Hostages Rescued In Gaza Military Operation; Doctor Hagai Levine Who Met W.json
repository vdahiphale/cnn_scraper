      "sentences": "You are in the CNN NEWSROOM, and I'm Jessica Dean in New York.And we begin this hour with breaking news and an emotional day for the people of Israel as four hostages were rescued from Gaza after eight months in captivity. Loud cheers there from a crowd greeting the rescued hostages as they climbed out of a helicopter and took their first steps back in Israel, the four hostages kidnapped by Hamas from the Nova Music Festival during the October 7th attacks, and they include 25-year-old Noa Argamani, 22-year-old Almog Meir Jan, 27-year-old Andrey Kozlov and 41-year-old Shlomi Ziv. And you may remember Noa Argamani from this horrific video from October 7th, showing the attacks and showing her screaming and pleading with Hamas fighters as they took her away on a motorbike. Israel says the special military operation took place this morning in central Gaza among residential buildings where Hamas had been keeping those hostages. Palestinians there describing the raid as hell on Earth as heavy shelling and artillery fire bombarded the area. Hospital officials in Gaza say the death toll has climbed to at least 236 people, with more than 400 injured, including women and children. CNN cannot independently verify those numbers, and Gaza's government media office, which provided initial numbers does not differentiate between the number of civilians and militants who are killed. CNN's Paula Hancocks joining us now live from Tel Aviv with more on today's rescue and the aftermath in Gaza. Paula, just first, how are those four rescued hostages doing tonight? PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Jessica, this is the first night in eight months that they are not in captivity. So, it is an incredible time for them, for their families. And what we're hearing from the doctors is that they are in good medical condition. But it has certainly been an emotional day for both the hostages that have been rescued and their families. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) HANCOCKS (voice over): Their first video call in eight months. Friends of former hostage, Almog Meir Jan welcomed the 22-year-old home.",

The way to rescue them is with a ceasefire deal. PROF. HAGAI LEVINE, HEAD OF THE HEALTH TEAM, HOSTAGES AND MISSING FAMILIES FORUM: That's not the way we can bring 120 hostages back home. We must, all of us together, the world, follow President Biden speech and go with the deal. HANCOCKS (voice over): But the price paid in Gaza for these rescues has been unquestionably high. More than 200 killed, more than 400 injured according to the enclave's government media office. There is no clarity on the breakdown of civilian and militant casualties. This man says there are children torn apart and scattered in the streets. They wiped out Nuseirat, it is hell on earth. An endless cycle of dead and wounded rushed into Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital Saturday, a medical center already well over capacity and dangerously understaffed and undersupplied. It is a jarring view of two clashing impacts of one rescue mission. (END VIDEOTAPE) HANCOCKS (on camera): And that death toll has risen once again. We now understand it is at least 236 Palestinians that were killed.

They don't need politicians visits for PR purposes. They need some quiet. They need to be able to recover, to think, to regroup, to get more into some kind of a routine. It's personal. It's dependent on the people.And, you know, I just was in the hospital when Almog visited his friends, visited him, and it was important for him to thanks his friends who were for him for the last eight months working to release him. But still, they need comfort. They need what we call tender love and care and examine all their medical conditions, but try to get them back to life. Try to get them more independent, because they didn't have any control of themselves. And you know, the first time they take a shower or choose what to eat, that's great things for them. It's very exciting. I must say that together with that, they get a lot of bad news. They now hear about the close family members or close friends who got killed over the last eight months, either in October 7th or later, that's also very difficult for them. And things may appear on the surface as OK, but even behind it, other things that we will have professionally and tailor made for each and every one of them find the proper solutions. Of course, also with the other families, I must say, It's great excitement, but also great worry that this heroic operation will confuse the government from understanding that the only way to bring on back all the 120 hostages is by a deal with the Hamas, and we need -- after President Biden's speech, we need all the world leaders to put the pressure on Hamas and its allies to accept the Israeli suggestion on the table, to have a deal for ceasefire and release of the hostages.",

And Trump certainly is playing into that. But I think the electoral calculation obviously is not the most significant element of this. I mean, what Trump is signaling and what is being signaled as much by the reaction of other Republicans to what he is saying is that a second term would be a whole different order of magnitude in terms of the degree of threat that it poses to the rule of law and the principles of constitutional democracy as we've experienced them through American history.",

Mass firing in the civil service, unilateral military action in Mexico.I mean, we could go all the way -- sending the National Guard into blue cities over the objections of mayors and government. We can go up and down the line, so there's a more aggressive agenda. And at the same time, as I said, the clear signal to him from this response is that there is not going to be -- there are not really many red lines that he can cross with Republican elected officials. And I think what he -- you know, if nothing else, Trump has always been a great student of human weakness, and he understood in his first term how far he could push the Republican Party, and he knows now that he can push it a lot further. Now, you know, as you say, this is politics that excites his base, I think, on an electoral basis, you know, narrowly looking at it that way, it is -- it is a net negative for him. But that doesn't mean that it will overcome all the doubts people have about Biden or all the other reasons they might have for voting Trump. And I think, you know, if you look at this -- and by the way, if you look at the Supreme Court decision, any amount of immunity they give him from criminal prosecution for actions taken during president is another signal to him. So, you have the legislative signal, the court signal both pointing in the same direction if he is re-elected, that whatever constraints existed in his first term would be far diminished in a second.",

One thing we will be watching to see is if the pressure that President Biden is putting on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and of course, Hamas to come to a ceasefire agreement can quell any of this mounting dissent.

According to authorities, a 45-year-old woman who was attacked just after 1:15 PM suffered significant trauma to her midsection and pelvic area, as well as the amputation of her left lower arm, and then a 2:56 PM, two girls between the ages of 15 and 17 were also attacked. The first victim suffered what officials described as significant injuries to one upper and one lower extremity, both requiring the application of tourniquets. The second victim has minor wounds to her right foot. Walton County officials said what happened is both tragic and terrifying, but historically, shark attacks are exceedingly rare.
