      "sentences": "All right, this just in. CNN has learned that Harris campaign chair, Jen O'Malley Dylan, has called on her team to begin the work of, quote, \"protecting America from the impacts of a Trump presidency,\" end quote.She sent that message to staffers after Vice President Kamala Harris' loss to former President Donald Trump. The vice president has called Trump to concede the race. Let's get to our panel right now. M.J., let's talk about what you are hearing from inside the Harris team. M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yes, first of all, this was a concession phone call that we had expected all day long. We got no indications that the Harris campaign wanted to contest this race in any way. Importantly, we are told by a senior aide, on this phone call, with the former president, now President-Elect Donald Trump, she talked about the importance of a peaceful transfer of power and the importance of being a president for all Americans. Which ironically, were some of the themes she actually ran on during her campaign. Now, these are some of the things that I think we suspect she will talk about when she talks in the next hour or two at Howard University. This is going to be a significant speech. Both for the vice president, in terms of how she talks about this moment, and what tone she uses. As so many millions of Americans were disappointed by the results of last night are tuning in. And also just for her personally. It goes without saying, this will be a bittersweet speech for her and a tough speech for her, and not the one she hoped to give. She wanted to be giving a victory speech and says she is having to, in some ways, console a lot of Americans who did not get the outcome that they wanted last night.",

We are certainly -- I shouldn't say -- who knows nowadays.I do not believe we are going to see her use the same language that Jen O'Malley Dylan used in the note to staff where she said now, you know, the next -- I don't want to put words in her mouth. But basically, the resistance begins. I think that is really the first sign we have seen from the Democratic Party starting to wake up from this knock-out punch that they have taken. Realizing, you know, that they have got to wake up, come off of that very quickly. But this comes as the People for American Way, which is the center point for liberalism, has also come out and said they're going to put out a project called Resist Project 2025. And they are trying to pull together all these liberal entities to come together to try to put a restraint basically, mainly on President Trump's judicial picks and trying to put some kind of reforms into the Supreme Court. Which mind you, they will have a tough time on both of those.",

Did the Harris camp just miss this economic message to this very important voting bloc.",

I think when the Harris campaign came out with their economic vision for Latino voters a few weeks ago, one of the things that struck me was it seemed like it was copied and pasted from their plan, their economic plan targeting African-American voters.And when I talk to Democratic operatives about this, they dismissed that. They essentially said that this was a strong plan. They touted everything that was in it. A promise for new small businesses and loans and et cetera. But when I spoke with friends of mine across the country, Latino men specifically, they didn't know that it even existed. And that is despite it getting substantial coverage on this network and others. Contrast that with what you are seeing from Donald Trump and the prosperity that a lot of those working-class folks felt when he was in office. The lower prices that they paid for everyday goods, plus, obviously, the persona he built for himself as this successful entrepreneur, whether it is merited or not, who exaggerates his wealth, who exaggerates his exploits. And it's something that resonates with these working-class communities when you compare that to a message that doesn't really get across, when there is no real compelling counterargument, you get what you saw last night.",

They we're skeptical this was going to cause a serious disruption in votes. And you see it in the numbers. I want to show you some numbers from three different counties across the country with large Latino populations, predominately Puerto Rican populations. In Lehigh County, this in the area of Allentown, 54 percent Latino. Harris did win there by 2.5, 2.4 points. But look at what Joe Biden won by in 2020, 8 points. So Donald Trump closed the margin there. He won in Burks County, in the Redding area, another largely predominantly Puerto Rican area by a larger margin than he did in 2020. And then the one that speaks to this point more than any other, I think, is in Osceola County in Florida. This is in the Orlando area. A majority Latino community, largely Puerto Rican. Look at the margin that Joe Biden won it by in 2020, 14 points. This time around, Donald Trump flipped it, winning by a point-and-a-half -- Wolf?",

I want to focus right now on Pennsylvania, the state we were told would ultimately decide this election, and apparently it did. President-Elect Trump didn't just win there, he won it substantially. The Harris campaign was counting on a massive turnout in the state's urban areas, like Philadelphia, where Kamala Harris held her final rally Monday night. That turnout didn't materialize. We are joined now by Democratic Congressman Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania. His district includes part - part of Philadelphia. Congressman, thanks so much for joining us. Congratulations to you on your reelection last night. I want to get your reaction to not just Trump's overperformance in Pennsylvania but the fact that Harris underperformed. What did your country -- what did your party, I should say, miss? REP. BRENDAN BOYLE (D-PA): Well, first, it was a systemic loss here in Pennsylvania.

None of that will help us rebuild for 2026 and 2028. What I would like to focus on specifically is that we have to be honest as Democrats. We do have a problem connecting with working- class voters. This started to emerge about a decade ago. And it was focused on white working-class areas. That has now spread. It is not just white working-class voters. It is black working-class voters and Latino working-class voters. And unless we Democrats address that issue from heavily working-class parts of Philadelphia, to heavily working-class parts of northeastern Pennsylvania to working-class parts all across the country, then we will not be able to win as many elections as we want to and we need to.",

Either way, though, it will be yet another term in which, whatever party controls the House, will not have a very large majority. But I'm confident that whether we're slightly in the majority or slightly in the minority, House Democrats will be able to respond to the needs of the American people. We have a track record on this. Trump was president once before. We served in the minority for two years and then in the majority for two years. I think that we are up to the battle.",

I can show you some of the bank stock performance today. They are soaring. Energy stocks, oil and gas players, there are also the huge beneficiaries today as well. The difference on the downside, renewable energy stocks. Solar having an appalling day. Because they are pricing in less government support in a Trump versus a Harris administration.
