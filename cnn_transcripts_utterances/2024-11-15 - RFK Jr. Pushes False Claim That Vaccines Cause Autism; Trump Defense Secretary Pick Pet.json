One former health secretary even calling it, quote, terrifying for the American public. Even former Vice President Mike Pence says he opposes the controversial choice. His issue was with his stance on abortion. But Trump and his allies obviously disagree. Trump, for his part, heaped praise on his controversial choice last night at a gala in Florida.

And then he says he wants to get good science into the equation. These two things, sort of, Pamela, are at odds with -- with one another. I mean, he has this belief. That belief has persisted for him, although he does seem to say different things in different interviews.Where -- where this came from was really in the late 90s, there was a paper of 12 children that showed 12 children who'd received the MMR vaccine who had autism. And the author of that paper, Andrew Wakefield, drew a cause and effect relationship there. That paper was subsequently retracted, but it did, you know, inspire a lot of different studies over the last 25 years, huge studies, you know, hundreds of thousands of children who've been followed for more than a decade. A certain percentage had vaccines, certain percentage did not. The question was -- was there some sort of relationship between vaccines and autism? There wasn't. So the question was asked and it has been answered. Subsequently as we've been able to get better science actually looking at the brain, even inside the womb of babies, you find that there are changes that happen in the brain while babies are still in the womb, meaning that there's probably a genetic component to autism that is still being discovered. Point is that they had changes related to autism in their brains long before they would have ever received vaccines. So there's all this science that has emerged, much of what he has seen, probably RFK Jr. and yet still here we are, you know, him -- him -- him saying these same things. And it's -- it's causing a lot of fear, I think, among people and a lot of vaccine hesitancy.",

I mean, there are many people who have come out, including the Democratic governor of Colorado, who have applauded Trump's pick of RFK Jr. There are many people, people I've spoken to who are excited about his proposal when it comes to regulating chemicals in food, right, getting rid of toxins, getting -- taking on big pharma, as they call it, calling for fluoride to be removed from the nation's water supply. I mean, some of these proposals are appealing to a lot of people, vaccines aside, which obviously is causing a lot of consternation. Tell us about that.",

      "sentences": "Yes, so, I mean, there -- there is -- is part of the issue here is that some of the things that RFK Jr. says, I think have a lot of support. I mean, you know, we've been reporting on the concerns about food for a quarter century, you know, it's part of why I started my career as a journalist, to report on these things. We -- we -- we know that as a country, we spend $4.5 trillion on healthcare, and yet we have some of the worst health outcomes in the developed world. And much of the chronic disease, 70 percent of the chronic disease, according to some studies, is preventable. And a lot of that prevention is probably dealing with how we nourish ourselves in some way. So, yes, there's a lot of concerns about our food supply. One -- one top level point though, you know, when it comes to things like fluoride, Pamela, is that when you -- when you look at these things, and we're going to all have to look at this pretty carefully over the next several months, is that the -- the amount of fluoride that -- that exists, if -- if it's at a high dose, it can be a neurotoxin. That is true. But that is why you have regulations to try and keep the fluoride at a -- at a level that is lower than that. The dose makes the poison.Same sort of thing about Ivermectin, something else that RFK has talked about. Ivermectin in a test tube in -- in -- in collaboration with viruses can actually kill those viruses. The problem is to get that dose, the appropriate dose in the body to actually be antiviral would be toxic. So people will hear, hey, yes, Ivermectin works, it kills viruses. Yes, in a test tube. But you couldn't achieve those same doses in the human body without being toxic to the human body. Now, I'm just giving you that high level sort of description because I think you got to apply that to many things that he talks about, whether it be fluoride or whether it be something like Ivermectin.",

There are those cases where you want to waive a jury trial, for example, and this may be on the -- on one of them, a child victim case. I had a case where my client was alleged to have planned a school shooting. You can't say that to a jury of six or 12 people because there's so much emotion tied to it. So in a case like this, the idea of avoiding the emotion by going to a judge only trial is understandable. On the other hand, all of those rules, all of those issues that may arise in a jury trial, those appellate issues, like something wasn't done right or a piece of evidence should not have come in, all of that is pretty much waived when it's just the jury, meaning not only will the case be quicker, but his appellate remedies may be almost non- existent.
