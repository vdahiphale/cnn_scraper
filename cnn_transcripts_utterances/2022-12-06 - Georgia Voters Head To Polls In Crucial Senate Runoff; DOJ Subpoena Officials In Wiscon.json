We've seen people coming steady throughout the day, but their wait times are about one to two minutes and that is roughly the state average right now around two and a half minutes, according to the Secretary of State's office, no more than 20 minutes at this point, even in the worst parts of the state.A lot of that has to do with the fact that people came out and did early voting, more than 1.85 million early votes cast already and when we talked to voters, they talked to us about why it was so important to come out yet again for an election in Georgia and why they decided to actually vote on Election Day.

You can see the blue areas, the Atlanta metro area, around Savannah and around Columbus, the more urban areas or suburban in this case.And just to give you a sense of the margins, right, you talk about Fulton County, which is the biggest county in the Atlanta area, you can see he won 73 percent to 24 percent, a 200,000 vote margin there. In Gwinnett County nearby, 50,000 vote margin; DeKalb County right here, 210,000 vote margin, 84 percent to 14 percent. So that's where he needs to perform well. For Herschel Walker, it's a little bit of a different situation. What he needs to do, I'll show you, he just trailed by 37,000 votes, it's not that much, 1.9 million votes for Herschel Walker. If you look over Brian Kemp through public and gubernatorial candidate did, he got 2.1 million votes. So he got 200,000 plus 200 - that's a bad plus sign - plus 200,000 more votes than Herschel Walker did. So for Walker, he's got to or, or try to do what Brian Kemp did. [15:05:02] Where can he do that? Well in places like Cobb County which is right next to Fulton County. Now, Cobb County has voted Democratic last two elections, but it used to be a Republican area suburban Republican area. You can see Walker got 40 percent there, but Brian Kemp got 47 percent there. So Herschel Walker needs to make those margins better and I put it out to you and I'll just show you again. I like this little fact, there are three counties that voted for Raphael Warnock, the Democrat for Senator and voted for Brian Kemp, the Republican for governor, it's Jefferson County, Sumter County and Clay County here. These are not big counties. I will show you the margins here. You can see 572 votes to 528 votes, but something we can look at as a bellwether as this night progresses, guys.",

Okay. What are the factors that you think are driving Georgians to the polls today?SHANNON MCCAFFREY, POLITICAL REPORTER, ATLANTA JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION: Well, I think the factors are different for the different candidates. I think some of the folks that are coming out to support Herschel Walker are looking past some of his flaws and some of his gaffes and other issues because they simply want another Republican vote in the Senate. So I think in some ways while some of them really, like Herschel Walker, I think there's a significant number who are holding their nose a little bit and just trying to give Mitch McConnell an extra vote. And I think it's similar with Raphael Warnock, people are looking - he's making the case that 51 is better than 50. But folks who are supporting Raphael Warnock tend to be talking a little bit more about his character, his personality, the lack of scandals surrounding him, compared to Herschel Walker, that he's just in their mind, a superior candidate when it comes to his - him as a person. He has also really been pushing many of the issues that Herschel Walker hasn't even talked about. So it depends on the voter, but I think they're both turning out for various different reasons.

So if we have a high black turnout, that is really good news for Raphael Warnock.And in terms of turnout, also, we'll be looking at Fulton, DeKalb, Cobb and Gwinnett counties, those sort of metro area counties that have large, large numbers of people. It was interesting, because Herschel Walker spent a lot of his time yesterday, the day before the election up in the north Georgia Mountains. Those are tiny counties. They don't have a huge amount of people. But he really needs those folks to turn out for him. And yesterday, he was also in Cobb County as, I think, John mentioned, which is interesting, because Brian Kemp did over perform him there. And I'm - I think he's really hoping that even if he doesn't win Cobb County, he could perform a little better than he did last time.",

I can tell you that Raphael Warnock has really been making a play for those voters.He appeared Sunday at the University of Georgia. He appeared yesterday at Georgia Tech, really trying to rev up those voters. They tend to be a little unreliable about turning out, but he has definitely been pushing that particular demographic. Again, I think a turnout - a large turnout by youth voters would again I think, help Raphael Warnock.",

I think for us, the question will be whether those voters turn out, whether they'll turn out and vote for Warnock, whether they'll stay home or whether they'll switch their votes, it's hard to say right now which direction they're going to go.I mean, anecdotally, I've talked to some people who voted for Brian Kemp and Raphael Warnock who intend to come back out and vote for Raphael Warnock. But those - that's anecdotal. Brian Kemp's ad is definitely helped Herschel Walker. But I don't know if all of his support is just transferable to Herschel Walker. I think there are also some people in Georgia who are just tired of elections and may just be a little bit weary to come back out and vote. But certainly Brian Kemp support has helped, but I'd be very curious to see if Herschel Walker really can get some of those voters in his corner.",

Remember the Republican Conference met, they voted, Kevin McCarthy got 85 percent of the votes in the conference meeting to be the party leader and to be the candidate for speaker. So what you have now are a handful of people who are holding the vast majority of the Republican Conference hostage. They are strengthening the Democrat hand. They don't have a candidate that can actually get elected Speaker of the House.And so when you have a very narrow majority, the only chance you have to affect meaningful change is to have party unity. That's what's made Pelosi really successful. She said party unity, even with a narrow majority these last two years. These saboteurs who are trying to sabotage Kevin McCarthy are already throwing in the question whether the Republicans can stick together enough to actually affect change that conservatives would like. So I think this is a terrible move. It's a terrible look. I currently still believe some of it is theatrical and McCarthy will make it, but I think it sends a pretty bad message to the people who just voted for Republicans to control the House, that this party can get its act together and act cohesively to push for conservative policy changes.",
