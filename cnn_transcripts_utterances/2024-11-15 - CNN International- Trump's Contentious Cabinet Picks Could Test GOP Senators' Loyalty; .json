Just ahead here U.S.President-Elect Donald Trump picking science and vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The latest reactions and the possible impact of that decision. Plus, the final major international engagement of Joe Biden's presidency. He's meeting today with world leaders at the APEC summit in Peru. Then the South African government says it will not help hundreds of illegal miners running out of basic necessities inside an abandoned gold mine. You'll hear directly from their families. Thanks for joining me on this Friday morning. Basically flat. At this point, we're going to keep an eye on the market futures there, of course, just about 30 minutes until the market opens here in New York. Go wild. That is Donald Trump's message to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., after picking the prominent anti-vaxer to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. The Department oversees the regulation of food and medicine, as well as important Medicare and Medicaid programs. And in another break with tradition, we're also learning that Trump's team is actually bypassing FBI background checks in some cases, choosing instead to use private companies to vet some pics. Let's take a closer look now. Molly Ball joining us is Senior Political Correspondent with the \"Wall Street Journal\". Molly always good to talk to you, but there's a certain element of this that should not perhaps be surprising to anyone. Donald Trump has been telling us and signaling what he planned to do for some time, looking at both these picks that are sort of outside the norm for a lot of people And also, the path that Donald Trump would like to use to get them confirmed. How is Washington handling that this morning?",

We, particularly with Congress comingback into session this week, a lot of particularly Republicans, have a lot of questions about these nominations. And so, you know, I think there's going to be -- continue to be, a lot of discussion about how this vetting process is going to go and how much resistance the Republicans in the Senate want to put up at the very least. I think we're in for some pretty fiery confirmation hearings as these nominees come before the Senate. And Senators from both parties have the opportunity to ask them a lot of questions about their views, about their backgrounds, about their records and about how they would intend to lead these agencies.",

I mean, I think Republicans are still in the mode of talking amongst themselves and trying to figure out where they stand.Frankly, they all know that, you know, Donald Trump just won a big election, and he takes credit for a lot of their elections as well. In his point of view, you know, they sort of came in on his coattails, and they owe him a debt of gratitude for being there at all, and certainly for being in the majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives. So, Republicans certainly want to appear supportive of the new president. They feel he has a mandate, and they want to help him staff his administration. So, you have, for example, the newly elected majority leader, the leader of the Republicans in the Senate, John Thune, saying, sort of, we'll cross that bridge when we come to it, that all options are on the table, was his phrase. But Republicans would hope that they can do this in the normal way that it does not get to this point. But you know, it was clear throughout the campaign that Donald Trump was not particularly interested in sort of the traditional norms and guardrails around executive authority, and his opponents called him an authoritarian, in part for that reason. So, he believes that he has a mandate to really smash through some of those guardrails in order to get things done, and he expects his party to be behind him, and we'll see whether that's the case.",

Now that's going to be disturbing to a lot of people who don't necessarily believe that the entire apparatus of federal law enforcement needs to be upended in this way. So, in addition to a lot of the character questions and ethics questions that have been raised around Matt Gaetz. I think there's going to be a lot of questions about the functioning of the Justice Department, not only whether he's qualified to lead it, but what his intentions are and how he sees himself executing Donald Trump's plans for that agency. But again, this is certainly something that Donald Trump campaigned on. He absolutely has been focused on changing the way the Department of Justice operates, and he has clearly selected someone who he believes is in sync with his vision of really tearing up from the foundation an agency that he believes is corrupt.",

I'm joined by CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta. Sanjay always good to see you. So, we know RFK Jr. has this history of promoting false claims about vaccines, including this one, I just want to play it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR., FORMER INDEPENDENT PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, I do believe that autism does come from vaccines.

SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yeah. I mean, there's no question. I mean, vaccines have been around a long time. We have a pretty good sense of how much of an impact they have. If you look at, for example, the projected impact of vaccines for children who are born between 1994 and 2023 and you and I both have kids that fall into that, that age group, you can sort of project ahead like, what is the impact of those vaccines? Probably a million lives saved, they say hundreds of millions of illnesses averted, tens of millions of hospitalizations prevented. So, there's a real impact to vaccines, and there's a real impact to not vaccinating as well. You know, I got to say, Erica, that sound bite you just played. He says, I do believe vaccines cause autism. And then he says, science, you know, I just want to see these things tested essentially. It's really interesting because he has this preconceived notion about vaccines linked to autism. This was a question that was raised in the late 90s by a paper that was subsequently retracted. But since the late 90s, there's been a lot of studies done on this, huge studies, Erica, were you talking to millions of kids following kids who got vaccinated, kids who did not get vaccinated, following them along for over a decade and a half to see if you see some sort of correlation between vaccines and autism? Many, many studies like this have been done, and they have not found that. So maybe it was a worthy question to ask, you know, 25 years ago, whatever, a number of years ago, but now it's been answered. And, you know, he has seen a lot of these studies, and yet, as you point out, he just said what he said in June. He's -- he could be the guy who's going to lead scientists on issues like this, which is, I think, what's concerning so many people.",

But this does seem to be a sad stepping of what has been a protocol that's been in place for decades now. It's one a background check that really looks to make sure that there are no unknown foreign ties for these candidates, for these nominees, before they're put into these positions of power. And also making sure that there's no other issues that could cause national security problems down the line. And look Donald Trump, his disdain for the FBI and disdain for the intelligence community is very well documented, and he's been very vocal about that. So, in some ways, it's not a surprise that his team would not put a lot of stock in subjecting their nominees to this FBI background check process. But at the same time, it does appear, given the controversy surrounding several of these nominees, it does appear to be an intentional effort to maybe sort of smooth out the path for potential confirmation. And also potentially, you know, suppress any potentially politically damaging information that could still come out. So, look, this is causing criticism, or prompted criticism from Democrats and some Republicans that we've talked to saying, look, the only reason that you would not put your nominee through this FBI background check process is because you're confident they would not pass one, which speaks to the kind of quality of nominee that Donald Trump has put forward. Again, Donald Trump says that this process is slow and it will prevent him from implementing his agenda at a quick pace. So those two kinds of diverging viewpoints about what this means, but the end of the day, clearly not a conventional way to go about vetting your candidates.",

But when you look at the relationships, first of all, that Musk already has with the U.S. government and with world leaders around the world, they're quite significant. You talk to U.S. officials currently in government, and they talk about the fact that Elon Musk has been intimately involved for quite some time. You know, conversations with U.S. government officials about Starland, conversations about SpaceX, you know, it really runs the gamut the way in which he has had to have conversations with U.S. officials. But the difference here is going to be, presumably, that it appears he could be involved in the actual policy making. Not just conversations with U.S. government officials, but potentially shaping where the Trump Administration goes on policy questions of engagement, of the larger strategy that they pursue with these countries, overseas, Iran, Russia, and potentially others. So, this is one area that we'll be watching incredibly closely. Particularly as you know, the report from \"The New York Times\" just this week is that Elon Musk met with Iran's Ambassador to the United Nations, as you said earlier in the week.

For the leaders of the host countries, it's merely to thank them for their leadership, for both the APEC and G20 summits that are being held here. For the leaders of Japan and South Korea, it's to really affirm the friendship that's developed between those nations over the last four years. And then when he meets with Chinese President Xi Jinping, President Biden is expected to try to chart any progress that's been made over the last four years. Whether it's on goals as simple as keeping the competition from spilling over into conflict or tangible goals that they've set in recent years on establishing military level communication or curbing illicit fentanyl trafficking. But in speaking with China experts, they say that President Xi Jinping is likely to withhold any deliverables from that meeting as essentially negotiation, bargaining chips for when he eventually faces an incoming Trump Administration 2.0. With Trump threatening a sweeping increase in tariffs against China and other countries, with Xi wanting to retain some of that leverage and not give it away to the Biden Administration as it goes out the door. That's really a dynamic that's overshadowing a lot of Biden's interactions with these world leaders. And U.S. officials acknowledge that while they're physically here in South America. All anyone can think about is what's happening in Palm Beach, Florida and what is happening in Washington, with a feeling or a sense that these world leaders are discussing amongst themselves, how to prepare for a second term and to insulate their own economies from some of the threats that Trump has put forward. Of course, the Biden Administration is excluded from those conversations, and so it's a fairly awkward dynamic here in South America, even as the president tries to burnish his legacy in re-establishing and fortifying some of those relationships. He's going to be talking about some of the climate goals that they've set and reached during his term when he speaks from the Amazon.
