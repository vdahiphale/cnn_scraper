Less than 48 hours from now, Donald Trump is set to appear in a federal court in Miami. The former president is facing 37 counts of mishandling classified documents and obstructing an investigation after he left office. That did not stop Trump from hitting the campaign trail this weekend, where he lashed out against the indictment, calling it a political hit job and calling Special Counsel Jack Smith deranged.

The level of detail of photos showing boxes apparently containingclassified documents around Mar-a-Lago, kept in a bathroom, spilled on the floor, in a storage room. And so Bill Barr is saying that in this investigation, it has not gone to a jury yet, it has not gone through the court system, but as of what we know now from this indictment, Barr is saying that the government acted responsibly and it is Donald Trump who is acting recklessly keeping documents like these in his possession.

Donald Trump is going to travel to Miami tomorrow and then he's going to stay just around the city in his own resort. He's going to be talking to his lawyers at that time preparing for what's to come. And then on Tuesday he'll be in the federal courthouse here in Miami downtown and then after that he's going to leave the state, fly the whole way back up to New Jersey, Bedminster.

So that's the bad news. Here's the good news. Donald Trump's no longer in power. He cannot direct law enforcement or military in any way to protect himself. The January 6th prosecutions have meant that within the sort of cesspool of hate that some of us follow, that there is no -- that there's a lot of skepticism about him and there's a lot of skepticism about their ability to be granted a get out of jail free card. Remember when he's president, he was basically promising them pardons. They all know that not to be true. Finally the right-wing extremist groups are turning on each other, the Oath Keepers, the Proud Boys, they are turning on each other and they are also turning on each other internally. All of those are good news in terms of, have we been able to at least put eyes and ears on what potentially could happen and stop it before it does.

The driver who shared this with CNN says he was picking up his son from the airport driving southbound at the time.And this is the view from his dashcam. Right now the right now the highway remains closed to both directions around the area. And we're also learning President Biden has been briefed on the collapse and has reached out to Pennsylvania's governor and the mayor's office to offer assistance. Let's bring in CNN's Danny Freeman right now there in Philadelphia. So, Danny, city and state officials plan to hold a news conference soon to give an update on the situation? DANNY FREEMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, that's right, Fred. Just in the past few minutes we got that official word that at 5:00 we're going to hear from Pennsylvania Josh Shapiro, Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney, as well as other state and local officials to just give the latest information on this real tragedy that happened behind us after this collapse. And this is about 11 hours after it happened at around 6:30 earlier this morning. I just want to talk, though, to that video, Fred, and then show you a little bit of what we're seeing here. I actually spoke to the man who filmed that video. His name is Mark Fusetti. He said he was driving to the airport, normal day really, normal Sunday morning, and then he saw this huge plume of smoke. He thought it might have been a brushfire initially but then as you saw he hit that bump right behind me, that southbound bump, and that's when he realized something was going on. And then by the time he got home, he realized how extreme it had been. Now I know you're looking at some footage right here of the overhead, the northbound lane of I-95, that is what at this point suffered the majority of the damage. That's one that collapsed. The southbound, though, as this point still compromised. That's in the word of city officials. And basically city officials are saying this all started because a tanker truck was underneath this overpass where we're standing just here on Cottman Avenue, the on-ramp actually on to I-95, and that tanker truck caught fire. That fire got intensely hot and then part of the highway here collapsed. I just got to say, Fred, it's been a bit of a chaotic morning. We saw manhole covers start to explode because there may have been compromised gas lines underneath. We also heard from the Coast Guard that they're looking to see if 8500 gallons of gasoline may have leaked into some of the water areas. The Delaware just on the other side of this highway. But take a listen to what one official said when thinking about how long it may take to clean all of this up. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Our two countries have stood together all the major times of crisis, we've come together, we've shed blood together, we've fought for peace together. Those bonds are incredibly strong.But, look, we can't dwell on history is my view. We have an incredible history together, our two countries, but we've got to reimagine our relationship to make sure it's relevant for now, that it's dealing with the particular opportunities and challenges that we face today. And that's why the declaration that President Biden and I announced today, that close partnership between our two countries are so important. It's the first type of agreement like that that either of us have reached and it speaks to making sure that we are ready for the future. And that's what I'm excited about. And our values are enduring, the strength between our two countries is evident for everyone to see. It's delivered incredible benefits, I think, not just for our two countries but for the world, and I think that will always be the case. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
