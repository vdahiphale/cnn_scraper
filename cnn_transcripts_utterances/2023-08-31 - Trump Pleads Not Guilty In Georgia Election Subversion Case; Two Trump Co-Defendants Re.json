This was an expected plea from Trump. He has already pleaded not guilty in three other cases in recent months. And he and his lawyers have been very clear that any talk of a deal is out of the question.And Trump's lawyers just filed to sever his case from some of the others. They argue they will not be ready for an October start to the trial, which some of his co-defendants are seeking. We have CNN's Sara Murray and Zachary Cohen here following all of these. So, Sara, first about this new filing in which he was basically saying he's not going to show up at the arraignment. I mean, he sometimes likes to take advantage of the public spectacle.

He's also reaching out to donors according to our colleague Manu Raju and he also made it a point to carry on with his schedule. He attended a fundraiser last night for Jim Banks a congressman who is running for senate and people who were with McConnell yesterday said he was totally fine and as sharp as ever.

MITCH MCCONELL: He came back home to Louisville. I was with him with Jim Banks who's running for senate in Indiana. He met with a group, answered questions, worked the crowd and was you know on top of it sharp and fully in command of you know all the all the politics and issues of the day so.

In fact, there is some early chatter according to our colleague Manu Raju from rank-and-file Republicans about calling for a special conference meeting to discuss his leadership. It would only take five Republicans to call for such a vote.

McConnell's office just releasing a letter from Dr. Monahan explaining what happened. This is what it says. I'll read it to you in full. It's a brief statement. It says, I have consulted with Leader McConnell and conferred with his neurology team. After -- evaluating yesterday's incident, I have informed Leader McConnell that he is medically clear to continue with his schedule as planned. Occasional light-headedness is not uncommon in concussion recovery and can also be expected as a result of dehydration. Now, that is the full extent of this letter. This is the first time we're getting any indication as to why Senator McConnell had that moment yesterday in Covington, Kentucky, where he froze for roughly 30 seconds before the cameras, and also in July on Capitol Hill, where he also refroze for roughly 30 seconds. And whether this has anything to do with his fall that occurred back in March. Recall, at the time, he hit his head at a Washington hotel, suffered a concussion, broke ribs. He was out from the Senate for about six weeks. After that initial July incident, in fact, I asked Senator McConnell if that freeze-up moment had anything to do with his fall. He just said he was fine. They would not say. His office has not explained his most recent episode as well. But this letter indicates that it does have something to do with his recent concussion. Again, it says, according to this doctor, occasional light-headedness is not uncommon in concussion recovery and can also be expected as a result of dehydration. So, tying McConnell's situation that we have seen directly to him suffering that concussion from the fall -- from the spring. The first time that we have seen any sort of relation between the two here. But I will frame Jim here.
