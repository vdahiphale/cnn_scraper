I believe that he was the most impactful one-term president that we've had in modern times. And the reason I say that is that all the ethics laws that we have in the books today are due to him. We have energy security because of his three energy bills which deregulated natural gas and oil, created the first renewable energy incentives solar panel on the White House. He was an environmentalist. He doubled the whole size of our national parks that Teddy Roosevelt had created by the Alaska Lands Bill. And he was a man who deregulated all transportation, airlines, democratized airlines, brought it to the middle class, trucking, rail, telecommunications.In fact there wouldn't be a CNN today had we not deregulated and allowed cable era to go. And he really enabled with telephone deregulation to start the whole era with cell phones and abroad, his remarkable. Human rights embedded in his foreign policy. It's the standard by which every other president is judged. He applied it to Latin America, and got thousands of political prisoners released and paved the way for the democracies that occurred during the Reagan administration. He applied hard power to the Soviet Union as well as soft power. Soft power was showing that it was a dictatorship and that we had a better form of government. He got twice the number of Soviet Jews out when he came in 50,000 a year. And hard power as well. Anderson, every single weapons system that Ronald Reagan gets credit for deploying and I applaud him for doing it. Every single one was started by President Carter. He normalized relations with China when Afghanistan was invaded by the Soviet Union. He took what even his conservative critics said was a tremendously tough stand. And so all of these are enduring. And the one that's the most remarkable, and I think it's the single greatest diplomatic achievement of any personal president in his activism, and that's Camp David. 13 days and nights, 22 drafts. And one thing that occurred that's really almost humorous now as we look back on it. The 13th day came, Anderson, no agreement. We were close, but no agreement. Prime Minister Bacon comes to Carter's cabinet. Camp David says, I won't make any more compromises. I want you to get me a limousine, take me to Andrews Air Force Base. I've got an all Al plane waiting. The President, realizing this would collapse Sadat's great initiative and would be egg on his face, knew that Begin had a great love for his eight grandchildren. He got his secretary to make eight copies of the original photo of the three leaders as they came personally inscribed it, walked it over to Begin's cabin, and saw his eyes tear and his lips quiver as he read the names of each of those grandchildren to Jimmy Carter with hopes for peace. He put down his bags and he said, Mr. President, I'll make one last try. And that's what did the job.",

But his passing surrounded by family in his hometown of Plains, Georgia prompts us to look back on his legacy and enduring mark that he left on this country and the world.Jimmy Carter met his wife of 77 years, Rosalynn, in Plains. He -- his mom actually delivered her. She was buried there two years ago. Jimmy Carter will presumably be laid to rest next to her, near her -- near their family home. Before his internment, there will be public observances in both Atlanta and Washington D.C. That schedule has yet to take shape, but it's expected to be a long period of remembrance with to 10 days worth of events. The impact of former President Carter's policies around the world have been felt long after he left the White House. CNN's Nick Robertson has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

In his foreign policies, he pushed for nuclear, non-proliferation, democratic values and human rights. He cut off military supplies to Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet and dialed back support for other Latin American leaders in Nicaragua, Argentina, and Brazil. One of his signature White House legacies was the Torre Carta treaties that returned the Panama Canal to Panama in 1999. He also calmed Mideast tensions, brought together Israeli and Arab leaders at Camp David, opening the door to the Israeli-Egypt Camp David accords. He normalized relations with China, weakened U.S. Ties to Taiwan in a vain hope Beijing would weaken ties with Moscow. But after the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in December 1979, the last year of his presidency, he toughened his Soviet stance, backed the Afghan mujahideen in a war against the Red Army. The same year, 1979, Islamic Revolution in neighboring Iran dealt Carter a double domestic blow, spiked oil prices, and led to a humiliating failed raid, Operation eagle claw in April 1980 to rescue Americans captured by theocratic revolutionaries in Tehran.",

He helped the charity, Habitat for Humanity, change lives, building affordable homes, often showing up to help with construction himself.

But the scope and the span of Carter's activities, monitoring elections all over the world to protect democracy, negotiating in conflict zones, you know, eliminating the guinea worm in Africa, which was a persistent health problem in Africa. I mean, the scope of it is breathtaking. And the thing I think that is the through line here, both in his public office, years in public office, and out was his view of his purpose in life, which was service.He was as you know, all of these fascinating interviews you're doing are so great to listen to. And they underscore the fact that his principles were informed by his faith and he believed in the dignity of people, all people. And so he fought for civil rights, for human rights, and that became a cause that he continued to work on through the right up until his 90s. So, you know, just a remarkable life. And yes, I think, you know, in Washington you measure yourself or people measure you by wins and losses. And he suffered a brutal defeat in 1980. And I think he became sort of a pariah, frankly, for Democrats for a long time because of that, because he was identified as a loser. And we've seen more recent examples of people who categorize people by that way. We've seen a president who couldn't accept defeat not so long ago. So -- but he contemplated what he wanted to do with the rest of his life, and he decided that he was going to have the greatest impact he could possibly have and use the platform that the presidency had given him to make a difference. And he made a huge difference. And it's just so impressive.",

And, you know, I just so admirable. I was, you know, I think we should note Stu Eisenstadt's interview with you just a few minutes ago because Carter's presidency is undervalued. He, you know, was defined by two things, by inflation, largely as a result of the energy crisis that was exacerbated by the events in Iran and then the hostage crisis. But, you know, he was so ahead of his time. And the biggest thing, Anderson, was he was someone who brought a sense of ethics to office, Stu mentioned this. But remember, he followed the partial term at least of Richard Nixon. He resigned two and a half years before Carter took office.Gerald Ford did an admirable job, but he was connected to Nixon, having been his vice president. And along comes Jimmy Carter, a Sunday school teacher, a guy who was devout and who believed very much in ethics and truth and transparency and, you know, disclosed his tax returns, never been done before. Inspectors general, independent to oversee the federal government. And he challenged. He was an outsider who challenged the status quo, who challenged institutions, but challenged them for the purpose of trying to make them more responsive, not as a nihilistic kind of thing. So, you know, his presidency has been diminished in ways that are unfair, but his post presidency was something to behold.",

And I think for a very long time there's been this understanding of the Carter presidency as either a failed presidency or when people are being generous, they'll say it was a mediocre presidency. But instead, I think particularly given that we are almost 50 years out from Jimmy Carter's presidency, we need to take a look at it with fresh eyes. We need to look at it both through the eyes of a man who is coming in with his faith at the centerpiece, who said, I don't want to force my religion on the American public, but I do want to bring a sense of humanity to the White House, that the sole goal of being in the White House should be to end the suffering of the American people.But then also that as we look at the issues that surrounded the moment that Carter was inflation, energy production, the foreign policy crises that beset the presidency and beset the world, that one of the things that emerged very clearly about the Carter presidency is that he attacked these with great verve and that had long term implications that we didn't even begin to see the consequences of, the positive consequences of for many years. And that it also wasn't just foreign policy, it also wasn't domestic policy, that there were any number of areas, but in particular around deregulation, that we should be looking at this and saying, wow, Jimmy Carter had an impact on America, on the world that rivals this kind of post presidency that we laud him for. Like we should actually be looking at this and say this is one of the best presidencies of the 20th century. And what does that actually mean for how we understand the modern American presidency?",

But also taking a look at it and saying actually the airline industry shouldn't be as regulated in terms of travel, in terms of cost, in terms of price, there should be competition. It was part of this kind of, you know, I think we tend to think of deregulation as a conservative thing. Certainly the deregulation of Carter, of the quarter administration lays the groundwork for Ronald Reagan. But more importantly, what for Jimmy Carter what's about is there, are there unnecessary costs that we could get rid of that will open the country up for innovation, but also for democratizing things like travel.So this is what we see in the airline industry, but it's also what we see in the rail industry and in manufacturing and movement of goods and products.",
