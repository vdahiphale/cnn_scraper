We have a lot of news to get into so let's get going. We want to start with, it is 5:00 a.m. in Washington, and we have a brand new CNN poll for you all. That poll shows Donald Trump's lead in New Hampshire narrowing as Nikki Haley surges. The former president now at 39 percent of likely GOP primary voters with Haley just seven points behind at 32 percent. The rest of the feel hovers at least 20 points further back in the, poll taken just this week. Chris Christie is at 12 percent, followed by Vivek Ramaswamy, and Ron DeSantis in single digits. Now Trump is roughly where he was in the last CNN University of New Hampshire poll in November. The real change has been for Haley, who's jumped a huge 12 points since the last CNN poll. By the third of that, at the expense of Ron DeSantis. So, let's bring in \"Axios\" political reporter Stef Kight to discuss. We've got a lot to talk about here. But specifically, Haley's biggest pickup seems to be with independent voters who the state calls undeclared and allow us to vote in either primary. So, as we as ideologically moderate voters, that's 43 percent undeclared or independent support her, 55 percent of moderate. So what has Haley done in New Hampshire to win some of these new voters over?",

      "sentences": "You know, these poll results really are an indication that the hilly campaign strategy, and really focusing on New Hampshire seems to be panning out the way that they have hoped. You know, of course, Nikki has spent a lot of time in New Hampshire. Their campaigns have focused their ads in the state.They've specifically been focusing on independent voters there. We've also seen several outside groups that have been supportive of Haley over the past few months, really focused their efforts and their dollars as well on independents in New Hampshire. Of course, independent voters in New Hampshire have also played a really critical role in these primaries. They make up a large percentage of people who turned up to primaries. And, so they are a key demographic, especially in this state. So it will be interesting to see whether Nikki can actually end up giving Trump a little bit of a context in that state. And, of course, we're also watching whether she can overperform in Iowa and perhaps overtake DeSantis there.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, and it's been interesting seeing sort of where each candidate has invested their time. Ron DeSantis has invested a lot in Iowa. Nikki Haley's done a little bit of both, but Chris Christie has invested a lot of New Hampshire. But his numbers are far lower than hers, specifically, the CNN poll shows that 65 percent of his supporters say that they would vote for Haley if he was not on the ballot.I can tell you, I've talked to him about some of this dynamic before. And he's pushback and said, look, there's no guarantee. All of his supporters will go to Haley. If Haley dropped out, there is no guarantee all of her supporters will go to him. That said, could this intensify the pressure that he is no doubt facing to drop out of this particular race? Especially if he doesn't do well New Hampshire?",

So we'll see what happens there.I want to turn to the Democratic side because President Biden won't be on the New Hampshire ballad as the DNC is pushing for South Carolina, to be the first contest here. But when you look at this polling, 69 percent of likely Democratic primary voters say they would still write Biden's name in to their ballot. What is the Biden's campaign outlook there? I mean, does that help ease any anxiety that there might have been for him not appearing on the ballot, and potentially having, you know, an embarrassing defeat or at least a closer election to people would've thought why folks like Marianne Williamson and Dean Phillips?",

But, clearly their decisions have indicated that they're not that worried about New Hampshire. They are not still worried about illegitimate challenge to Biden's run.But it will be interesting to see how this dynamic place out, here and how Democratic primary voters decide to handle the situation in New Hampshire. One thing that's interesting is that because of the fact Biden won't be on the ballot in New Hampshire there actually has been some efforts to convince some Democratic voters or independents who maybe typically would've voted in the Democratic primary to instead be invested in Republican primary instead, especially behalf on the more moderate candidates like Nikki Haley.",

Now, they're related because throughout this campaign season, Trump is campaigning. He's also appearing in court. He's also going to be in court today, this time where his lawyers will be arguing he has presidential immunity in the federal election subversion case. Is his campaign, do you get the sense that his campaign is concerned about that dynamic of bouncing between courtrooms and the campaign trail especially as folks like Nikki Haley appeared to be gaining some ground in places like New Hampshire?",

I think his team still feels very confident that he will end up with the Republican nomination here, and I think once more in that general election season, I think that there will be more concerns about just simply the logistics of making sure Trump is able to get out on the road during the election season.But there's also an argument to be, made that his team, and Trump himself has really embraced some of these legal challenges that he's been facing. And we know that for a long time, Trump has always painted himself as the victim of the justice system. And we've seen him continue to kind of play on that theme as part of his campaign. You know, even the fact that he is deciding to go to court in person seems to indicate that it is something he has invested in, that he's wanting to draw attention to in some ways. And he sees himself as a fighter in the situation. So, while, of course, logistically, there's concern. There is something to be said that they're able to take this and spin this, and they have been campaigning on this and spending this in their favor.",

There has been many, including the U.S. and the U.N. that have criticized the sheer amount of displacement that has happened within Gaza itself.Remember, early on in the ground invasion, there was some 1.1 million people who were told to go from the north of Gaza, to the south, where they would be safer. And, that in many cases turned out not to be the case. So, clearly, this is not going to have a widespread support. So, what we're seeing from the U.S. secretary of state, and what we're hearing from the U.S. officials is that what he is focusing on, meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu at the moment. And also with many other ministers in the war cabinet is to make sure that civilian casualties are kept at a minimum. One in 100 -- every 100 people in Gaza, at the moment, has been killed, according to health ministry figures within the enclave. So, a staggering amount of civilian casualties. That will be one of the main focuses. Also, to make sure the humanitarian assistance gets to those who need it, and with the number of displaced people that becomes even more challenging. And, of course, the hostages themselves. That would be one of the key topics when Secretary Blinken speaks to many of the ministers, who will also be meeting with some of those families. Some of the hostages, as well and we really do feel as though we are a long way away from any comprehensive move towards more hostages being released -- Omar.",
