And I remember on that day, when the president signed it, he said God willing it's going to save a lot of lives. Since then about 18,000 Americans have been shot and killed.You are about to hold something called the Safer Community Summit this month. As we're seeing a sit-in, by the way, in the capital in Colorado of women, specifically asking for Jared Polis, the governor there, to ban guns, knowing the unconstitutionality of that, but that is what they're saying is the crisis and we need to address it.

And that law takes guns away from domestic abusers, it makes it harder for young buyers to get assault weapons, it locks up more gun traffickers. It is undeniably saving lives.

They've taken on the stock exchange, the headquarters of LVMH.This, though, Phil, is the main protest today. So, the police pretty heavy visible presence here at the front of the march. And just behind them, the demonstrators preparing to carry on walking. There's been a little bit of tear gas already. Not very much. But certainly the authorities are expecting a lower turnout today than what we've seen these last few weeks. The idea of the unions is, of course, to gather support ahead of that vote on Thursday, yet the government have already found a mechanism that will allow them to get around it, which has rather taken the wind out of the sails of the movement, as has, Phil, the announcement by the biggest union that this will be the last of the main protests against this particular reform ahead of the summer.

A charter school is funded by taxpayers, but it's independently managed. This online catholic charter school is expected to require more than $23 million in state funding in its first five years. The state's attorney general calls this unconstitutional but it has the support of the Republican governor. Ed Lavender is live in Dallas with more. Ed, this is so interesting, especially given the direction the Supreme Court has gone on all of this. What can tell us? ED LAVANDERA, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, you know, everyone watching this closely fully expects this to ultimately end before the U.S. Supreme Court. But on Monday a little-known government agency known as the Oklahoma Statewide Virtual Charter School Board, yes that is a thing, voted 3-2 to approve the application for the St. Isidore of Seville Virtual Catholic Charter School, which will be run by the archdiocese of Oklahoma City and Tulsa. The application was approved by a vote of 3-2 after a three-hour debate yesterday. Clearly, a lot of intense opinions about all of this. The governor of Oklahoma described this vote as a win for religious liberty and education freedom. It also has the support of the superintendent of education there in the state who described it as a monumental decision. But it has come under scathing scrutiny from the Oklahoma attorney general, also a Republican, who said in a statement, quote, approval of any publicly funded religious school is contrary to Oklahoma law and not in best interest of taxpayers. It's extremely disappointing that board members violated their oath in order to fund religious schools with tax dollars. And he goes on to say that this has exposed the state to hefty legal fees here in the future. So, a great deal of controversy swirling around the future of this school and what it means for public education in the state of Oklahoma and across the country. Poppy.",

The Federal Bureau of Prisons says workers found Robert Hanssen unresponsive at a super max prison in Colorado. Emergency workers later pronounced him dead. Hanssen was 79 years old.Now, Hanssen joined the FBI in 1976. And just three years later started spying for the Soviets. Using the alias Ramon Garcia, Hanssen accepted more than $1.4 million in cash, bank funds and diamonds from the Soviet Union in Russia. In exchange he handed over highly classified information, including how the U.S. planned to react to a potential Soviet nuclear attack should that ever materialize. Now, investigators say he compromised numerous Soviet sources who were providing information to the U.S., some of whom were later executed.",

After he dropped those documents, agents surrounded him and arrested him. He pled guilty to 15 counts of espionage and conspiracy. In exchange prosecutors did not seek the death penalty and a judge sentenced him to life in prison without the possibility of parole.Let's bring in our chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst John Miller.
