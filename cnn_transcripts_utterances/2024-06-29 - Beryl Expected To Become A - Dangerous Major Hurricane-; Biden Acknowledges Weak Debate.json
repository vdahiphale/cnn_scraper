      "sentences": "Hello, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me. I'm Fredricka Whitfield. And we begin with this breaking news.The National Hurricane Center, alerting, moments ago, that Tropical Storm Beryl is forecast to become a dangerous major hurricane. And Beryl would be the first hurricane of the 2024 season. Let's get right to CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar. So, you've been watching this storm? What's it going to do?",

      "sentences": "Right. I mean, I think the key thing here is how early in the season we are seeing this storm develop and the location too. So, here is a look at where Beryl is located right now, kind of that central tropical Atlantic, just east of the Windward Islands.Sustained winds are 65 miles per hour, gusting up to 75. For those that don't may not remember, 75 miles per hour is that threshold in which it becomes a hurricane. So, we're only about 10 miles per hour off of that. Forward movement to the west at 23 miles per hour. But what makes this storm interesting, we talked about how early in the season, normally, you don't get your second named storm until July 17th. The average first hurricane doesn't occur until August 11. And this one is actually forecast to get to major hurricane strength. We wouldn't normally have that until September 1st. So, just to put it in perspective, how early we're seeing this. And one of the major contributing factors to that is just how warm the sea surface temperatures are. The area where Beryl is located, you are looking at on average about three to five degrees above normal from where it would normally be this time of year. And I know three to five may not sound like that much, but it's enough for the storms to really flourish in that area. Also, to noting the location is important too. Storms early in the season, meaning in June, don't typically form east of the Windward Islands. But that's exactly where this particular storm formed. Now, when we look at the forecast for this, it is expected to become a hurricane at some point today. So, just the next few hours. Then, it's going to cross over the Windward Islands likely as a major hurricane, which is a category three or stronger before continuing into the Caribbean Sea. We do have some of those watches and warnings already in effect for several of the Windward Islands. But Fred, not out of the question for more of those to talk to take up over the next 24 to 48 hours.",

President Biden looking to reenergize his bid for reelection, following what he even acknowledges was a week debate performance. Right now, the president and first lady are preparing to depart for the first of several campaign stops in New York and New Jersey this afternoon. But these stops this weekend, come as there are growing calls for Biden to end his run. New today, billionaire Mark Cuban told CNN that it's time for Democrats to explore replacing the president on the ticket. And the New York Times editorial board released a scathing op ed calling on the president to leave the race. Biden's campaign insists that he is not stepping down, with one adviser telling CNN, the president still plans to attend the second debate which is scheduled for September. CNN's Arlette Saenz is in New York, where President Biden is about to depart for a busy day on the campaign trail. So, Arlette, what's on the president's agenda today?",

Typically, he has those 90-minute mock debates. It's unclear how exactly they might shift the strategy as they are looking at towards the September debate, but I think they probably would acknowledge that something needs to change after the president's performance on Thursday.",

Let's take that off the particular record, then, of course, everybody is asking what this means for the former president, as you just heard from Katelyn, I think this ruling is not the end of these charges for the former president, because part of what the Supreme Court said is that this section of the statute that Donald Trump is charged under, it refers back to the other part of the statute, which basically just means there has to be a document that's at issue. When you're charging somebody with corruptly obstructing an official proceeding what the Court said is, read that in relationship to the rest of the statute, and that requires something like document destruction.

One of the things that the moderates had said before the election even started, they said that they believed that they needed a strong voter turnout for him to actually even have a chance to get to the next round. Well, the voter turnout was actually really low. It was only about 40 percent of those who were eligible to vote. And, yet, he got by far the most votes, more than 10.4 million votes. And around a million votes, more than a man who's in second place, Saeed Jalili who is a conservative.Now Massoud Pezeshkian is someone who wants better relations with countries here in the region, and also wants better relations with the West and actually the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. He kind of warned voters beforehand not to trust politicians who want better relations with the U.S. too much, he didn't name Pezeshkian by name, but there are people who believe that he meant Pezeshkian. The conservative challenger, Saeed Jalili, he is someone who said that he wants to continue as he put it down the path of that president who was killed in a helicopter crash, Ebrahim Raisi, that would mean a continuing tough line towards the United States and certainly also a tough line towards Israel as well. Of course, one of the things that we always have to point out, Fredricka, is that right now, these elections took place, and will take place in a very volatile environment here in the Middle East with Israel and Iran on the brink of full on war just a couple of weeks ago, that could also have had massive repercussions for the U.S. and its assets here in the region.

He said that the Islamic Republic is strong when there is high voter turnout, and that the enemies of the Islamic Republic are strengthened and denounced the Islamic Republic when voter turnout is low.And if we look at the voter turnout, here it is as far as we could tell one of the lowest in presidential elections here in this country. We had 48 percent turnout when Ebrahim Raisi was elected. Now it's around 40 percent. Certainly the authorities can't be happy with that.

Those are the two NASA astronauts that are part of the crew of Boeing's made in test flight of its Starliner spacecraft. And they've been docked to the International Space Station since the beginning of June. But even though NASA says they're not stranded in space, those two astronauts are still going to be up there at the space station far longer than expected.There have been several delays of this returned to Earth. And now just Friday afternoon, NASA says there is now no target date for when those astronauts and that spacecraft will return home. The holdup has been some issues with the spacecraft's thrusters, and also a few helium leaks. And so now, NASA and Boeing are going to shift the testing and the troubleshooting of those thrusters from the actual spacecraft in space to some ground testing on some replica thrusters in White Sands, New Mexico that is expected to start next week. So and those tests are expected to take a couple of weeks to complete. So we're looking likely at mid to late July at the absolute earliest, before Butch and Suni can return to Earth. NASA, really stressing though, that those astronauts are safe. The spacecraft is safe. They've seen no new issues to report, but they really want to figure out what's going on with those thrusters.",
