There is now growing panic in the ranks. Democrats fearing it's going to be difficult at best to flip competitive House seats if President Biden remains at the top of the Democratic ticket. Two Democratic congressmen now calling on Biden to drop out of the race. Raul Grijalva telling The New York Times, \"If he's the candidate, I'm going to support him, but I think that this is an opportunity to look elsewhere.\" I also spoke with retired Congresswoman Annie Kuster. She represents a swing seat in New Hampshire. She tells me that she has been in talks with both the White House and the Biden campaign with \"concerns about how the president's well-being is impacting House races, particularly in challenging districts.\" Joining us to talk about all of this is Julia Manchester. She is national political reporter for The Hill. And Reese Gorman, political reporter for NOTUS. Good morning to both of you. Thanks for being here.",

But it's interesting to compare that to what happened at the White House during the governors' meeting last night. A source familiar with that meeting told me that essentially, the governors saw a Biden who had been stronger than in recent memory. He said he wanted to get back out there. He wanted to be unscripted. But I think there's still a lot of trepidation, particularly among down-ballot Democrats.

But there is also the reality that she has been on the national stage. She has been serving in this role. She did run in a presidential primary, which as we know, is a crucible that really tests candidates. She has been more vetted on the national stage than perhaps some of these governors, as talented as they may be. Just go -- you know, call Ron DeSantis and ask how it feels to be the \"frontrunner\" when you've never done it before. People may tell you hey, watch out, this is a hard thing.

She's also become sort of a favorite stalking horse of Republicans and Donald Trump, and you're seeing these early, sort of, ads and memes, and comments like \"Stop, Kamala\" which is meant to energize his base further. So I think there are those sort of questions about what -- based on how Americans understand Vice President Harris' role in politics now, what elements of the American electorate would that turn out and sort of in what direction?

You've got Kevin Durant and A'ja Wilson sporting what Team USA will be wearing there in Paris.The men's squad -- they play their first game July 28 against Serbia. The women's team is going to face Japan July 29. All right, and with it being July Fourth, that means it's time for the annual Nathan's hog dog eating contest. But unfortunately this year, many Americans, including some of my colleagues, will be boycotting the event after 16-time and reigning champ Joey Chestnut -- he has a rift with Nathan's over his partnership with Impossible Foods. He won't be competing. So we will have a new champion this year. Chestnut, who holds the world record of 76 hot dogs in 10 minutes -- he will still be competing. He's going up against some soldiers at Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas. That's going to be YouTube. But this is going to be first time since 2000 Kasie that we're not going to have Chestnut or Kobayashi to watch in the contest on July Fourth. They will be going head-to-head on Netflix on Labor Day, so we can wait for that to see who is the best once and for all. But it's the end of an era of the hot dog eating contest, but we will have a new champion so it could lots of fun.",
