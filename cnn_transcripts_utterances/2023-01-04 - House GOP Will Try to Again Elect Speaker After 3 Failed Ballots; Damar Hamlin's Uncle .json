Good morning, everyone.In just hours, Republicans are expected to try again to elect a speaker of the House. Yesterday after three ballots, no one reached the 218-vote threshold to win that job. Congressman Kevin McCarthy earned the vast majority of Republican votes, 202, on the final tally, but a small group of hard right conservatives is holding out, keeping him from the speaker's gavel. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA):  The members are talking, we are walking through it. I think we will find a way to get there, and this is a healthy debate. It might not happen that the day we want it, but it's going to happen. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, for the first time in 100 years, the house could not elect a speaker on the first ballot, and that election, 1923, that took nine ballots. We have not seen that happen in 100 years. Up until Tuesday, when Kevin McCarthy, the Republican leader failed to get the 218 votes that he needed to be elected speaker.There was one ballot in which 19 Republicans voted against it, there is a second ballot where he lost the support of another 19 Republicans and then the third ballot, 20 Republicans voted against him and voting for Congressman Jim Jordan, who actually supports McCarthy for speaker. But these Republicans believe that McCarthy just does not have the votes, will not have the votes, concerns about some of the concessions that he made. Concerns about the ways that he isn't handled some of the negotiations, personality conflicts with Kevin McCarthy, all which raged major concerns for McCarthy and his allies about whether he can get the 218 votes to be elected speaker. Now, there is a plan in the morning on Wednesday to have a meeting of the full Republican congress, to try to hash out these differences. The problem, they had a meeting on Tuesday morning that did not go well for McCarthy. In fact, in that meeting he went after these members, lashed out at his critics. They suggested that one of his allies, that they could lose committee assignments over the whole issue. That's almost led to Republican opposition hardening in some ways, growing that is what the conservatives who sought to derail McCarthy's bid said, and so they came out of that meeting and were emboldened and planned to oppose him. Well, that changed Wednesday morning? Another question, but at the moment McCarthy is signaling that he plans to grind it, out go to a fourth ballot, go to a fifth ballot, go as long as possible. A number of his allies say that they will stick with, him but the only way this could possibly change is some huge development which maybe he wins over some of those conservative critics, or maybe McCarthy steps the side himself for a new speaker candidate to emerge, all of which raises deep uncertainty about the speaker of the House, the futures Republicans, and who will lead them as the 118th Congress starts off with paralysis and dysfunction.

But, if his support continues to erode as we have seen over the courseof those votes, he has a real problem and he has a decision to make. I think those choices are to keep fighting with no path in sight, figure out if there is not a Republican like a Steve Scalise or some caretaker public and who he could share power with or call the shots from behind the scenes, or there is the one thing that that flank of between five and 20 Republicans are really worried about, and that is the idea that he would make some kind of coalition with Democrats.

One of the team chief objectives instance that these holdouts have, other than just the animosity towards, him if there is going to be an ideology, is that they see him is too likely to cut to deal with Democrats.That is great if you are a hard-line member of the Republican base who are interested in the fight, but if you are an average overwhelming share of Americans, the frustration with Congress is that they cannot compromise an off and get anything done. So what you are setting up here is, theoretically, an agreement that would tie his hands and make it harder to cut any deals. I think, Christine, right now that looks like something that would be good for Democrats. If you watch Nancy Pelosi and Hakeem Jeffries on the sidelines of yesterday, it was all they could do to suppress their smiles. Jeffries has gotten more votes than McCarthy. Democrats have popcorn. This is very good for Joe Biden in the short term, if this is a contrast for his 2024 reelection bid.

They say that 500 Russian soldiers were killed or wounded. So it is unusual perhaps that there is no comment yet from the Russian side,, but it is unusual in itself the for Russia to comment at all on the death tolls when it comes to its soldiers. So the news coming out of the Russian side on that attack in the Donetsk region is significant. They are now admitting, as you say, to 89 soldiers having been killed. State media are sharing pictures of people mourning the deaths in various regions in Russia, but there is skepticism coming out of the blogosphere. Influential Russian bloggers casting doubt on claims by the Russian ministry of defense but it was the fact that soldiers were using mobile phones near the front lines that allowed Ukraine to pinpoint their location. One blogger today calling that not at all, convincing but also casting doubt on the death toll at 89, saying it is likely much higher. But taken together, it looks like potential to mass casualty events for Russian soldiers taking place within the space of 24 hours.",
