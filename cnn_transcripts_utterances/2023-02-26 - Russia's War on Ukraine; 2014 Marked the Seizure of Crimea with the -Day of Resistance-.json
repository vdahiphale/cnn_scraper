This is the highway that connects Los Angeles to San Francisco. So, they're trying to open it, but it has been difficult to do so just because crews are not used to dealing with this kind of weather in Southern California. I want to walk through some of the snow just so that you can see the accumulation. It is nothing like you see in other parts of the country.

But a former transportation secretary under Barack Obama says, deregulation under the Trump administration is part of the problem. Here it is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RAY LAHOOD, FORMER U.S. TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY:  While we were at DOT, we put into place some very, very tough rules and regulations having to do with safety, that was our number one priority in all modes of transportation. Unfortunately, some of those were eliminated during the Trump administration and some of the safety metrics were also eliminated. I think what we need to come to grips with is the idea that more safety metrics, more rules and regulations, and perhaps some laws, and -- need to be passed quickly in order to assure communities all over America that this transportation is going to be safe. And the industry ought to be on the front row of helping the Congress make this happen. When we had the Colgan air crash, when 49 people perished in Buffalo, New York, the families stepped forward, but also the airline industry stepped forward, and we implemented a rule for more pilot training and less hours of pilots working in the planes. And the industry came forward that's what needs to happen here. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Under the new rule, migrants would generally be denied asylum if they reach the U.S. border through countries. To be eligible for asylum, they would need to seek protection in those places first or use orderly pathways, such as, humanitarian programs offered to certain nationalities.Now, the proposed rule mirrors the so-called transit ban that the previous administration has proposed which also made migrants ineligible for asylum if they pass through another country. For more on this, I'd like to bring Raul Reyes, an attorney and immigration analyst who writes frequently for \"CNN Opinion\" and he is joining me from New York.

There are, you know, tweaks and tinkering, I would say, between that and Trump's so- called transit ban. But basically, I believe its effect will be the same and that certainly its intent is the same, and that is to deter people from coming to our southern border and applying for asylum.And what Biden is going through, to be fair, what he's going through is, in a way, the same thing that Donald Trump went through and even president Obama before Trump. We have a Congress that does not want to take responsibility for setting immigration policy. They have really abdicated their role. They are the ones who should be making our immigration policies and procedures. Because they have just stepped away from the role, we've seen successive presidents try executive action like Obama did with DACA, Trump's different, very conservative measures. And now, Biden embracing this so-called -- you know, this version of a transit ban to try to do something on their own. And one big problem with that, is that these measures always wind up in court. So, a president brings forth his immigration measure and governors or lawmakers from the opposing party start the legal challenges and the status quo doesn't really change. So that is sort of where we are right now. I think for Biden, he is trying to thread a needle with this new asylum policy and hoping that he could show conservatives, that he could be tough on the border, and that he -- you know, he's taking it seriously while also opening up some new pathways for legal access for my migrants. But the problem he just -- is that -- he just doesn't seem to be pleasing anyone. You know, the GOP is very against these measures. They believe -- conservatives believe that the first priority should be border security full stop. And that we shouldn't even be considering asylum measures until the situation on our southern border is completely under control. And then on the other side of the aisle, we have many Democrats who are saying, look, asylum is a legal right. We can't be outsourcing our problems to other countries. And we have immigrant rights groups that are pledging to sue over this measure. And I know -- I would assume from a political standpoint that the Biden team is -- that they are worried, for example, about alienating, say, Latino voters or people in the immigrant community when they're looking ahead to the next presidential elections. To me, what is most unfortunate is that the people at the center of this debate, you know, people who are fleeing their home countries because of persecution or people who are trying to access lawful -- their lawful right of asylum. They're, sort of, stuck in this limbo. And right now -- between right now and May and even after May when the new asylum policies go into effect, it's hard to see any change of the status quo. And, you know, that's really difficult for all these migrant asylum seekers, many who are women, children, LGBTQ community members, so it's a tough situation.",

The economy has taken a huge beating. Unemployment, a third of Nigerians are unemployed. So, those are things that will -- obviously on the top of people's minds. But one analysis tells us that it all comes down to religion and ethnicity for some people. That's the one thing that they think about who comes from what religion and who comes from what party.

      "sentences": "Well, with hundreds of thousands of people across Southeast Turkey displaced as a result of that earthquake almost three weeks ago now, the Turkish government is facing mounting pressure to provide long term solutions.And according to the authorities, work is already under way in the province of Gaziantep and at least two districts. Excavation work has already begun for the construction of more than 800 homes for those that have lost their houses, their apartments as a result of that earthquake. And the government has pledged to rebuild the area within a year across Southeast Turkey. But this has drawn some criticism, the union of engineers and architects and said this is simply too hasty. There needs to be more preparation done, more investigation done in order to ensure these new homes won't face a similar risk when it comes to future earthquake. Others have also raised criticism over the fact that Turkey is still experiencing aftershocks, more than 8,000 have been reported since that earthquake nearly two -- three weeks ago, including a powerful 6.3 magnitude aftershock recorded on Monday. Now, of course there are hundreds of thousands of people who are desperately in need. According to the authorities, more than 900,000 people are currently living in tents. And there are still families that are homeless. And we visited some of the areas impacted by the earthquake, including the cities of Antakya and Iskenderun in Hatay Province which was among the hardest hit provinces by the earthquake, and the need there is significant. And the U.N. has warned that this is only going to grow. There are only going to be more and more people in need of these long-term solutions. Of this stage many are being housed in tents and IDP camps. But the Turkish government has got plans underway to provide containers where people will be able to stay for a longer period of time. We even seen cruise ships now hosting people who have been displaced. But for those who have lost everything, there is a growing sense of frustration, a growing essential of anger, questions as to whether or not the government was prepared for a catastrophe of this scale, and whether aid has been able to reach those in need people quick enough. And with elections looming, President Erdogan's government is facing a significant amount of pressure to provide those long-term solutions as quickly as possible. But of course, there are real concerns around how safe this is in practical terms. Nada Bashir, CNN, Adana, Turkey. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
