      "sentences": "A warm welcome to \"First Move\". It's great to be back with you lots to discuss this Monday, as ever as the new U.K.Chancellor Jeremy Hunt gets blunt. Prime Minister Liz Truss's fiscal fumble led to a serious U.K. market stumble. But Hunt's underlying message today, I think is we've been humbled. The Finance Minister today delivering an emergency statement designed to steady government finances and financial markets. Promising fiscal prudence and rolling back virtually all the tax measures the government so recently announced to try and boost growth. Today's outline rolled out weeks earlier than scheduled to a nod I think to the fragile state of U.K. assets particularly, since the Bank of England wrapped up its emergency bond buying program on Friday a hurried response, of course, to protect teetering pension funds. Hunt therefore getting out in front and his message is having its intended effect. Investors who rejected earlier unpaid for stimulus plans and our welcoming hunts more austere approach. The pound today as you can see firmer against the U.S. dollar borrowing costs in the U.K. also falling to U.K. 10 year yields back below 4 percent after rising to some four and a half percent. If you remember last week, investors could ultimately I think cast the deciding vote on Prime Minister Truss's survival. Today she looks like she's in office. But out of power more on all this in just a few moments time. In the meantime, the favorite picture in equity markets overall U.S. stocks set to rise after last week's extreme volatility that sent the NASDAQ the tech heavy sector down some 3 percent on Friday alone. Europe as you can see also higher too, that including U.K. stocks as well. We might just give you a quick glimpse of that if we can or move over to Asia. In the meantime, a mixed picture there to the Nikkei softer by more than 1 percent. China rising as the week long Communist Party Congress continues, that's the Asian picture. President Xi set to win term number three doubling down on hardline decrees and that is where we begin today's show consolidating power President Xi Jinping reaffirming his commitment to Beijing's existing policies including zero COVID as he said to claim an unprecedented third term as Chinese Leader.

So it was all about the successes. Of course, this dramatic picture of progress that he's painting does come into sharp contrast with the severe challenges that he's facing at home and abroad. The economic damage from his zero COVID policy, which he reaffirmed isn't going anywhere. The record high youth unemployment rate, this property sector in crisis we did hear Xi Jinping emphasize this idea of common prosperity, which is the idea of increasing middle incomes as well as trying to reduce that income gap in China. But what we're actually seeing in China is people from all walks of life struggling to make ends meet because of that zero COVID policy. We also heard reaffirmation about Taiwan. What really struck me when I was listening to his speech live? That there was the loudest and longest applause from the more than 2000 Communist party delegates in that room.

His vision is that in order to make China great again, you've got to haveincreasing communist party control in every part of Chinese business, economics and society. So we are definitely going to see in this third term increasing party control and more control over that private sector. In that speech, you heard him talk about innovation underpinning growth, well, we can be sure that is going to be more state led innovation, as we have seen over the past year, market value being wiped out of top Chinese tech firms because of that increasing regulatory regulations on their big tech companies or big private companies. You also heard discussions about increasing self-reliance. That's going to be a huge challenge for China, especially in their chip making sector, as you're seeing the U.S. increase its sanctions. It's difficulty for these exports of critical technologies to China in that chip making sector. The other point that we also heard him talk about, which doesn't get talked about enough Julia, is demographics in China. He talked about trying to ease this problem of an aging population. China is dealing with this looming demographic crisis, but unfortunately, their efforts to get couples to have more babies isn't working. I've been interviewing young couples who say the financial difficulties that they're dealing with because of the economic downturn, all the restrictions from zero COVID.

Almost exclusively on an economic mandate to become Prime Minister on cutting taxes to stimulate growth on less redistribution of a small state but this is Jeremy Hunt now taking over because he obviously took this role on his own terms, saying that the priority of this government on this country will be stability. Which is a marked contrast from the language we were hearing from the Prime Minister over recent weeks, who said we have to have a change from the status quo. It can't continue that's the most important thing. And Jeremy Hunt did announce that there will be more pain to come. He said to departments, you're going to have to start looking at areas to cut, to fund the public spending that we do want to do. So now the Prime Minister is in a very difficult position as Jeremy Hunt addresses the House of Commons later today Julia, in about an hour and a half because he is leading at the moment. You know, political power in Westminster has to go somewhere. And it's definitely not with the Prime Minister. It's been drained away from her and Jeremy Hunt, addressing the markets first thing on a Monday being the representative from government to try and steady the ship is all optics that I think the Prime Minister is probably not altogether welcoming.",

That they'd be safe in their jobs that they'd be able to pay their school fees and mortgages. And we have a life plan for the next decade or so. But that isn't the case anymore. Looking at the polling, Liz Truss is putting the party in a position where if there was an election tomorrow, most of them would lose their seats. So the position for the Prime Minister is perilous and the market reaction will determine a lot. What's interesting is the removal of Kwasi Kwarteng as Chancellor. Board has some time, but the implication being now that if markets rally, it's because of Jeremy Hunt, and not because of the Prime Minister, she's almost incidental and has faded into the background a little bit as has become more of a liability. And that is exactly why we're hearing these open questions and plotting in Westminster about how she could be ousted. Most people I speak to Julia said that the Prime Minister is simply in an unrecoverable position. There is no clawing her way back from this, you know, when you've lost that trust, and confidence and credibility, when in politics, do you ever get it back in a democracy? So it's an issue of time for most, whether it's one week, two weeks, until Christmas. One of the priorities for the Conservative Party is to have a plan. Because when Boris Johnson was ultimately pushed out through all those resignations, there wasn't a plan in place. And look what happened. This is what happened. So the grandees within the party feel like there needs to be some kind of coherence in terms of the strategy, a unity of purpose about who would replace Liz Truss. And they want to avoid the vote having to go to the membership. So there's a lot of fiddling to be done behind the scenes.

We just returned recently, from the scene of one of those explosions a residential building. We're now hearing from Ukrainian authorities; at least four people were killed, including an elderly woman, a young couple. The wife was reportedly six months pregnant. And the target appears to have been a sort of power plant in the neighborhood that was also targeted in last week's barrage of missiles. And so far, it's unclear as to how much if any damage has actually been sustained to that particular plant. But clearly the goal here is very much to try to take out crucial civilian infrastructure such as electricity, heat power plants. We spoke to the Mayor of the City, Vitali Klitschko, Julia who said to us essentially, that while the goal appears to be to intimidate and depress people here in Kyiv. That actually these attacks are having the reverse effect that they are making people angrier and more resolved to try to win this war once and for all.

Now, of course, on the fiscal side, it's so interesting to see that tax cuts have been rejected, because they're unfunded. But you know, the really big problem if I step back, and the big picture problem across governments, especially in the developed world. Is that the government role just keeps getting bigger and bigger? And I think that's the fundamental problem with what we still call capitalism, that we have capitalism. But if you look at the trajectory of government spending across the world, you can include it. And this includes even the 1980s, the role of government, especially government spending, as a share of the economy has just gone up and up. And I think that there's no control on that, and very little discussion is still taking place. That what do you do to cut back on government spending, especially with, you know, the, all the pension liabilities and all the debt that keeps building up because the demographics are also turning against the fiscal situation? So I think that is really at the heart of a lot of problems we had, that the role of government keeps on increasing undermines productivity, and also makes very little room to do any experimentation with tax cuts, just because there's government spending is up significantly.",

But that takes us off in a whole different direction. And I want to rein myself in, and bring it back to an article that you wrote, which I loved recently, for the Financial Times, and you called the U.S. dollar and the rising strength that we're seeing in the U.S. dollar, a wrecking ball. Explain why, in light of what you're saying, with, with Central Banks around the world all raising rates but the U.S. dollar in particular benefiting from this. How dangerous this moment is, and how out of whack even that strength is relative to interest rates and other interest rates around the world?",

      "sentences": "Yes, if you look at the dollar's path over the last few months, it's become totally disconnected from the typical fundamentals that drivecurrency values. What are those fundamentals? As you said, interest rate differentials, general valuation metrics, current account balances, this is what drives currency values over the normal course. But what's happened is that the dollar's rise over the last few months has been just a safe haven trade which has become more and more speculative that people are buying the U.S. dollar just because they think the dollar is about to go up. And it is totally disconnected from these underlying fundamental realities. And this has grave consequences for the global economy. Because the dollar is in many ways a proxy for global liquidity, that everyone trades off the dollar, how much the dollar is falling, and rising? Dictates the Central Bank's liquidity across various countries from Brazil to U.K. to Japan everywhere really, this has a major consequence. And the point that I was making in that article is that something needs to be done about this, rather than everybody's saying, oh, the dollar has to go up because the Fed is increasing interest rates. That's true, but that's just not the simple logic that drives currency values, because other Central Banks, too, are increasing interest rates. So it's disconnected from fundamentals such as interest rate differentials, it's become unhinged; it's become a massive speculative trade around the world. And I think that this, the time is there now for some sort of a coordinated Central Bank intervention led by the U.S. Where in fact, the Treasury makes such decisions to try and stabilize the dollar's value or weaken it somewhat. And I think that Central Bank intervention, when done in a coordinated way can be very effective. So that's one policy tool that policymakers have to try and stabilize the global financial conditions at a time that they have no choice but to increase interest rates to target inflation. So these are thought of as two spread policy tools.",

Is this perception that if you allow your currency to weaken, and we're seeing it all over the world? Prices of goods that you import get higher; you import inflation at a time when inflation is already too high. You say this is not the case for the United States one because the sheer level of imports as a proportion of GDP is relatively lower compared to other countries but also that the U.S. dollars used to set prices around the world. Can you just quickly explain why the argument that it will mean that the United States suffers higher prices if they allow the dollar to weaken is wrong?",

And the second point is that 95 percent of all the imports are anyway invoiced in U.S. dollars. So the impact that a 1 percent rise on in the U.S. dollar has on U.S. inflation is statistically insignificant, it's virtually zero, right? So there's hardly any impact whereas on the other countries, when the currencies are weakening, the impact is greater. In the developed world, the impact is three times greater than what we have in the United States. And in emerging markets, it's six times greater. So if you end up having a policy where governments around the world decide to weaken the dollar or even stabilize it. That has really no impact on U.S. inflation, but it may actually help inflation come down in some of the other countries. Remember, inflation is a global problem. It's not just a U.S. problem now. So I just feel this policy intervention, where policymakers Central Banks around the world can come together in a coordinated way to try and stabilize the value of the U.S. dollar can have a lot of positive effect when the global economy needs some. And everybody's meeting up in Washington anyway. So you know, for the IMF meetings, to speak, to get in the same room and come up with some sort of a solution. And it's been done before, coordinate Central Bank intervention in varying forms, has been done from something as grand as the Plaza Accord to something as relatively smaller in the mid- 1990s. When in fact, Central Banks intervened I remember for the first time in my career, that I saw it live on our screens. And that was done to prevent the dollar from falling. So Central Banks and policymakers have in the post Bretton Woods era intervened, often in a coordinated way to try and stabilize currency values on the outside for the U.S. dollar.

So when it comes to something like the scaling back of the energy price support package, which the chancellor has announced this morning, that's all well and good that cuts the borrowing requirements, of course. But markets will be thinking that probably he will have to put some form of support scheme in its place when it reaches its end, which will not be next April.

I struggled to see how you cut further in this kind of environment when they're still talking about growth policies, reforms, infrastructure, investment, whatever it looks, look, Douglas, I think they've got a really tough job on their hands. Does Liz Truss survive this, as you said, even as late as Friday, having seen her own former chancellor stepped down, and she still did manage to galvanize confidence? In fact, it was a discomforting speech to watch. Does the party decide to replace her, in your view, given what you know, of the politics of the Conservative Party? MCNEILL: Well, she's clearly under intense pressure, there's clearly great unhappiness across many sections of the party with her performance. That said, to ditch another leader, so soon after ditching the previous one is clearly something that would be awkward, which would not look good. And it might well lead to a general election as well. And it's not clear that the party is in a fit state to face a general election just --. So there is a powerful countervailing force that argues against making any change in the leadership. I think as well, a lot of Conservative MPs will be inclined to give Jeremy Hunt a bit of a chance to show what he can do to show whether he can turn things around steadied the ship and so on. But you are quite right, when it comes to cutting public expenditure or even reducing the rate of growth of public expenditure, that's an extremely difficult thing to do. One of the obvious traditional ways of finding savings if you need to find cash savings is to look to the investment budget capital budget, you alluded to that in your question. And that is a place where you can find savings without disappointing people quite as much as when you cut day to day spending. But of course, if you resort to that, then in the medium and long run, economic growth will suffer.",

That was a relatively brief affair, so it was hard to get a sense that you were getting a full impression of her thinking.

Battling on in Tehran and beyond, Iranian women continue to take to the streets in a show of defiance towards authorities.CNN obtained all of these videos from the pro-reform outlet IranWire. It's been a month since the death of 22 year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody. And demonstrations continue across Iran. Also ahead the weekend a fire inside the notorious Evin prison, state media feeds eight prisoners died and dozens were injured in Saturday's Blaze. Tehran's prosecutors say it wasn't linked to the protests. But so far CNN is unable to verify this claim. My next guest says the battle for women's rights could be Iran's Berlin war moment \"A tipping point for lasting change\". Journalist, activist and political dissident Masih Alinejad lives in exile in the United States. From there and with 8 million followers on Instagram, she uses her voice to aid and amplify protests and the voice of Iran. She's also the author of \"The Wind in My Hair\" and \"My Fight for Freedom in Modern Iran\". And she joins us now. Masih, great to have you on the show! You're a powerful voice, both inside even from outside Iran. I just want to start with what we saw at the weekend and the fire that was started in this prison. From those that you're speaking to and what you're hearing, is this tied to the protests? MASIH ALINEJAD, IRANIAN JOURNALIST, DISSIDENT &amp; ACTIVIST IN EXILE: Oh, definitely, it was very heartbreaking. And let me tell you, some of the prisoners actually reach out to their family members. For them, it was clear that it was not just Evin prison in fire. Gunshot was hearing and some of the prisoners were trying to save their lives. They've been under attack by the security guard inside prison. They've been sprayed by tear gas. So definitely people of Iran they don't trust Islamic Republic and they see this as a link to the ongoing protests inside Iran.",

What can actually survive this, like regime, this brutal regime is the West; let me make it clear now. Everything that we have been seeing in one month, it's clear that Iranian people are asking the western countries stop saving the regime. First, we want the western country to recall their ambassadors. It's not me saying those miles away from Iran. It's the demand of Iranian people that I'm being in touch with them. Millions of people actually believe that it's enough is enough. They don't want to live with humiliation. Many of them say that, clearly industry that we want an end for the Islamic Republic, they're not chanting against America, they're not - there's no single slogan in the street saying that we want a nuclear deal. That's another demand. The West must stop negotiating with the Islamic Republic, while they're killing teenagers in the streets. And the West actually should close down the embassies or Iran's interest section, because that is going actually to help Iranian to see that the West is sending the right signal and recognizing this revolution. Otherwise, there won't be any reason for the Islamic Republic to kill its innocent people.",

You remember, for years and years, Garry Kasparov, a friend of mine was warning about the danger of Putin. The western democratic countries were telling him, didn't take him serious, labeling him like war monger or saying that you're asking the western countries to interfere, what happened, the war is in Euro. And now this is us Iranians warning about the danger of the Islamic Republic. If the democratic countries do not get united the way the dictators are united from Venezuela, to Russia to China to Iran, then believe me the western country must face dictators on their own soul.",
