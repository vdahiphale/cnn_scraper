But his lawyers, his legal team, is back in court for these opening statements, and these are expected to wrap before the end of the day. Now, earlier in the day, the business at hand was whittling down dozens of possible jurors to a nine-person jury. Now, this jury is going to remain anonymous. That's significant because, of course, we've seen with judges, court staff, other grand jurors who have worked on cases related to Trump, they have faced threats, so it is notable that they will remain anonymous in this case.But I want to emphasize, Trump did not have to show up to jury selection. He is not required to attend. He really doesn't have a role at this stage of the case. This is a choice. We have seen him make this choice multiple times over the past 10 days. He has attended oral arguments in federal court. Last week, he also attended a civil case here in New York and now he's back in federal court for this damages trial, all voluntary. He is not required to attend any of those, but it appears that he believes there is some return on investment. The opportunity to amplify this narrative that he is the victim of an unfair judicial system. We saw a little bit of that on display earlier today. His lawyer, Alina Habba, who is also his spokeswoman, sparred with the judge over their request to try to not have court on Thursday, so he could attend his mother-in-law's funeral. Now, the judge had already denied a similar request to push the whole trial back. Now, the fact that Habba brought this up again was significant, but it felt like she was making the argument really in the larger court of public opinion, because she knew this was likely going to be denied, and it feeds into that narrative that somehow he's not getting a fair shake. But, of course, the judge has pointed out he doesn't need to be here. There's no role for him and it's up to him whether he wants to attend court or the funeral.",

That's where you start getting cases overturned or reversed on appeal because they have been seen as stepping in the defendant's way.

I'm sure they would like to finish a little bit higher than that.But clearly, they felt their finish in Iowa was enough to give them the momentum that, at least, they want heading into this state here in New Hampshire. Obviously, yes, a different voting pool. But also a critical standing here. When you look at polls coming in to this, the CNN poll in particular showed Nikki Haley within single digits of former President Trump. That's a threshold that no other candidate has been at, at least in the recent few months, for this presidential primary. Take a listen to how Haley is framing, again, this next phase of the campaign.

I'm going after Trump. That's what I'm saying. And I'm doing that not for personal reasons, but the fact that I don't want my kids to live like this. At some point, something's got to give.

But the question is, will that perception actually meet up with reality? Despite her polling within single digits of the former president, nothing has ever showed her polling ahead.

So you can see that there's an international bridge that crosses into Mexico. Well, this part keeps on going. There's two bridges. There's a golf course.

On Sunday, it was about a thousand. And if you look around here, you don't see any migrants. There's National Guard members, you don't see migrants. So where are these migrants coming through? Well, that's the thing about border barriers. They don't stop migration. They only redirect migration. So according to a law enforcement source, migrants are actually being pushed through by smugglers further up river west of town in a residential area and beyond that, that's where Border Patrol is now actually apprehending migrants because, again, they don't have access to this area.
