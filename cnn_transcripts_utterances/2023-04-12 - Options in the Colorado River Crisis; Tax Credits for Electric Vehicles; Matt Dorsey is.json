A shelter in place order has also been issued for anyone downwind of the fire, which officials say could burn for days.This is new video.

So, well south of that two-thirds, right?But I will point that this 5.8 percent is up from 3.2 percent back in 2021. So, we're going in the right direction. It nearly doubled in the past year, the number -- the percentage that electric vehicles made up of all new vehicles that were bought. And the other thing that I will note is that the market is diversifying, right? When we think of electric vehicles, I think we think of Tesla, right? Look at Tesla's shrinking share of the electric vehicles bought. Other car companies are getting in on the act because in all of 2021 electric vehicles made by Tesla made up 72 percent of the market. In the beginning, through the third quarter of last year, it was 67 percent. But look at quarter four of last year, it was just 58 percent. So, more carmakers are getting in on the act, and that's a good thing if you want to reach that two-thirds goal come, you know, 2032.",

Quite low. There is this 45 percent who say they might in the future. But look here, 43 percent say they'd never buy one.But how do we get those people who have not bought an electric vehicle to actually buy one? It all comes down to money. It all comes down to cost savings because the top reason to buy an electric car, look at this, save money on gas. The top reason not to buy one, they cost too much. So, the fact is, if you can drive down the cost of electric vehicles, I think that people will follow. But its cost, cost, cost.

As you may know, before I joined the board of supervisors, which is our local sort of city council, I served for two years as a civilian member of the command staff of the police department.

We have violent crime. So, I don't want to diminish anybody's sense of fear. I think what the perception is -- really is around the public drug use, the brazen drug dealing, the kind of acting out retail theft, the kinds of things that are very unsettling to people and very visible. And for a city like San Francisco that relies so much on being a welcoming, you know, iconic city that people want to commute to and visit from around the nation and around the world, this is something that really hurts our economy.

What do you think the solution is? DORSEYit's not unique to San Francisco, but we have a real police understaffing crisis. This is a generational issue because there is a disproportionately large generational cohort of police officers hired during the Clinton administration. And right now they're all reaching retirement age and we're all going off a demographic cliff if we don't do more and better to make sure that we're hiring police officers.
