Certainly in some spots there were hurricane force and above. Not going to get there tonight. So 20 to 30, but the fire starts are already here. See, the problem, we would have had damage with the wind anyway, but it wouldn't have been such damage had we not had the sparks, had we not had the fire starts. Well, now there are millions of hot spots on this map. So any fire, any ember, any additional fire push could actually make more fires, of course. Still extreme for tonight all the way through the morning hours, but then by later on this afternoon, things do go down to only critical. And I'm not saying that tongue-in-cheek, but 20 to 30 with a gust of 40 is better than 60 to 70 with a gust to 80. So today will be better. As the sun rises, things will be better out there.
