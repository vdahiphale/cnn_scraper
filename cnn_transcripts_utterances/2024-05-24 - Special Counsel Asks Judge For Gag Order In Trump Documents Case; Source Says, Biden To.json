      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to a special early edition of Laura Coates Live.We begin with breaking news. Special counsel Jack Smith is now seeking a gag order against Donald Trump in the classified documents case. Jack Smith is asking the judge to, quote, make clear that Trump may not make statements that pose a significant, imminent and foreseeable danger to law enforcement agents who are participating in the investigation and prosecution of this case. So, now, why is the special counsel asking for this, you might be asking? Well, it's because of what Donald Trump said this week, when he falsely claimed that FBI agents who searched Mar-a-Lago were, quote, locked and loaded and authorized to shoot him. He was misrepresenting the standard language and documents that the FBI says it uses routinely. Here's, by the way, how Attorney General Merrick Garland explained it just yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MERRICK GARLAND, ATTORNEY GENERAL: Okay, on that one, that allegation is false and it is extremely dangerous. The document that has been referred to in the allegation is the Justice Department standard policy, limiting the use of force, as the FBI advises it as part of the standard operations plan for searches. And, in fact, it was even used in the consensual search of President Biden's home. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Keep in mind, this is the first time that Special Counsel Jack Smith has actually sought one in this case. And he did apparently do so on the Friday night before Memorial Day, seemingly because he very strongly feels the need for this gag order.With me now, former Federal Prosecutor Jennifer Rodgers, also Criminal Defense Attorney Joey Jackson, both are CNN legal analysts. Let me begin with you here, Jennifer, because this is significant, first of all, when we first heard about these statements, the locked and loaded terminology that was being used. It is not accurate, it was not what was actually going on, and yet it has caught fire. How dangerous is this, given that he wants to have a gag order now?",

I mean, it's ridiculous and that you can see some of his followers kind of take that as an invitation to go out and do some violence of their own, possibly against law enforcement.

The first is that he was not at the location at the time, Mar-a-Lago, when it was searched, very critical. Number two, the Secret Service was informed with respect to the actual search. And those things I say, because it puts it in context. It's not like he was there and ducking with his family while bullets were flying.And I think everyone needs to understand that language and rhetoric have consequences, right? And people, if the wrong things are said, particularly when you have a bully pulpit, like he does, where he has many millions of followers, people can take it in the wrong way. And when you're talking about law enforcement and what they're not doing, right, he's saying they are doing, they're trying to assassinate him, it puts people in danger and jeopardy. Last point, and I will continue to say, we saw this as it related to the former speaker of the House and what happened to her husband. Some deranged person goes and really, you know, attacks him, right? And that's a problem. And so to avoid any type of, you know, just danger to anybody else, you need to consider a gag order to stop things that are said that are irresponsible.",

And there was a lot of back and forth where she was really pushing back against the notion that this information should or shouldn't become public.So, my concern is that she doesn't really take seriously this notion that people's lives can be in jeopardy or turned upside down if their information becomes known to the public, which, you know, that makes me think she might not move on this as quickly as she should, but, you know, We'll see.",

And I think people understand in our process that that protocol needs to be respected. They respect the person in the robe and there's not a sense of entitlement because the normal person, when they do something, they say, excuse me, Mr. Jones, did you understand my ruling? You didn't. Okay, officers take charge. And when you don't have that to worry about, there's a different way that you comport yourself.And so I just hope that perhaps is a change in the rhetoric. I know there's an election. I get it. People can vote for who they vote for. Everyone has a side.

I know everyone thinks about the witnesses, of course, but the idea of what they're going to actually be able to decide on is so important. And one thing I'm looking at in particular is this idea of how they're going to quantify the word, substantial, when it comes to whether or not Donald Trump made this hush money payment reimbursement or otherwise because he was looking at his marriage and his family or for the campaign.

In fact, of course, according to Jim Clyburn, it did perhaps, that's the add to the inflation, that if you're looking at the migrant crisis, the fentanyl crisis, the problems in Gaza, the issues in Ukraine, the South China sea, that we have a world in disarray. It has happened on the watch of the man that promised to be the return to normal president. So, yes, it is their approach.

It is really something that they should be just grateful to have the opportunity to do so.Meanwhile, you do see the numbers coming in.

Why is this still different even from what happens in 2021? Well, they're still hiding behind the guise that they're not employees. And I think if once that facade is broken down, that wall is broken down, it's going to open up more labor issues. But to your point, that's all to the marketing of the NCAA. Oh, we give them room and board. Oh, we give them things.

They went to heaven together, Missouri State Representative Ben Baker posted. His daughter, Natalie, and her husband, Davey Lloyd, attacked by gangs Thursday night in Port-au-Prince. The couple, in their early 20s, served as part of Missions in Haiti, a Christian non-profit organization run for more than two decades by Lloyd's parents. The organization, posting Friday, they were ambushed by a gang of three trucks full of guys. Davey was taken to the house, tied up and beat. The gang then took our trucks and loaded everything up they wanted and left. At some point, as the attacks unfolded, Davey Lloyd called his father. DAVID LLOYD, DAVY LLOYD'S FATHER: He was injured, so he was hurt. And he was very nervous and very scared because I asked him why they tied him up. And he's like, well, because you're the only one that's got strength that we have to worry about. And so, they wanted to make sure he couldn't put up a fight back. And then he was begging me to find somebody to get in there to help him. And I did all I could, but I couldn't locate anybody. CULVER (voice-over): Three hours later, the group posted that the couple was shot and killed by the gang. Missions in Haiti says a third person, a Haitian staffer named Jude, was also killed in the attack. We're told he'd been with the organization for 20 years. The violent incident started as the missionaries were leaving church and lasted for several hours. Davey Lloyd's father says the three died barricaded in the Lloyd family's living quarters on the mission's compound. Haiti has been spiraling into gang-fueled chaos, which forced the resignation of Prime Minister Ariel Henry in April. The U.N. estimates some 80 percent of the capital city is under gang control. In recent months, CNN's made multiple trips to Port-au-Prince. We've met victims of the gang's brutality, including rape, kidnappings and murder. Hundreds of thousands now refugees in their own cities, as gangs have torched their homes and forced them to flee. We've also met with the leader of one prominent gang, he and others demanding a say in Haiti's future, a future that may again be shaped by foreign forces. President Biden hosted Kenya's President, William Ruto, for a state dinner in Washington Thursday, around the same time that the deadly attack on Davey and Natalie Lloyd was taking place.

We're expecting it could be deployed any day now, but experts tell us that if the gangs on the ground don't feel like they have an off-ramp, an alternative to resistance, then you can expect increasing bloodshed in a country that is already so desperate for healing.

      "sentences": "David Culver, thank you. Tonight in our \"Exonerated\" series, I want to introduce you to Anthony Robinson. In 2014, he was sentenced to 55 years for a murder he did not commit, going on to spend about a decade behind bars before he was even released. And you might be asking, why?Well, the story begins in Chicago in 2013 when a car pulled up next to two young men. A man got out of the car with a gun and opened fire. A security camera caught the incident. And the video allegedly showed the victims turning and running away from the shooter, the gunman sprinting after them, killing one of the men. Now, Robinson was wrongly I.D.'d as the shooter and was eventually found guilty of murder, attempted murder, and aggravated discharge of a weapon. But remember that security footage that showed the gunman running? Well, Robinson himself was shot multiple times less than three months before that incident. And the bullets shattered bones in his leg and left him with pins holding them in place. Not only could he not run, he could barely walk. Now, the security footage also showed a man with short hair. Robinson had shoulder-length dreadlocks at the time. So, in 2023, the Exoneration Project at the University of Chicago Law School got a hold of Robinson's medical records and filed a petition explaining that it would be impossible for him to have committed the crime. You know, just last month, the same judge who sent Robinson to prison vacated his conviction and he was released. Anthony Robinson, he joins me now along with his attorney, Lauren Myerscough Muller. Thank you both so much for being here today. Anthony, first, welcome home. And it just brings tears to your eyes to think about what you've had to endure. Can you tell us what have these past six weeks of freedom been like for you? ANTHONY ROBINSON, EXONERATED AFTER 11 YEARS IN PRISON FOR MURDER HE DIDN'T COMMIT: It's been good. I got a chance to spend time with my family and all my loved ones and just, you know, and just spend on top of everything I need to do to move forward with my life. But I'm just happy to be around my loved ones.",

What is next for you?MYERSCOUGH-MUELLER: Really, I just want to try to do-I got a book I want to write about my life story, so I want to come out with a book about my life story, like everything I've been through, like about me being innocent, about me going -- being 55 years for something I didn't do. It's basically like putting out everything. So, I'm working on coming out with a book about my life and just moving forward with my life and try to be successful in life, and write a book and try to talk about how messed up the system is, how people --how a lot of people in there are found guilty that are innocent just like me. It's just a lot that I'm going to break down like you know, just speaking like a motivational speaker and just speaking to motivate people and to show people like it is, hope that you're going to get out of jail because it was hope for me.",

It's fine. That's \"Doo- Wop That Thing\". The chart topper from Lauryn Hill's 1998 album, \"The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill\". And this week, \"Miseducation\" got dubbed the best album ever. That is, according to Apple.The company has been releasing their top 100 albums over the past several days. And now, we've got the ones at the very tip top, filling out the rest of the top five -- Michael Jackson's \"Thriller\", The Beatles' \"Abbey Road\", Prince's \"Purple Rain\" and Frank Ocean's \"Blonde\".

Harry, this is quite a list. It is walking down memory lane for me, most of them. But this is a subjective list, obviously. But run me the numbers. What do you see?",

But you know, there were a couple of interesting little nuggets that sort of popped out to me about these 100 best albums from Apple. And that is the genres. Let's take a look here.Look at this. Twenty- one of the genres -- twenty-one of the albums on this top 100. Genre, hip hop or rap. I think that's a little bit surprising to some folks. I'm not necessarily sure that always tops the list. But on this particular one, it did. Eighteen, a rock. We see the beautiful Beatles there. How about some pop coming in at 16? We see, of course, Taylor Swift, Tay-Tay, who's having a moment in the sun right now. And alternative music. I had to actually ask my producer, Sydney, what alternative music exactly is. I'd like to think I'm a little bit alternative. But when it comes to music, I'm not necessarily sure I consider myself alternative. And then, of course, there's the question of when were these albums actually produced? Apple's best 100 albums ever. Just one in the 1950s, 10 in the 1960s. Those are my decades, baby. Eighteen in the 1970s. We're getting a little bit better here. But in fact, the top decade for the songs, look at this. Twenty-three in the 1990s. As a child of the '90s, I like it. Of course, number one, as you mentioned, was from the 1990s. But that seems a little bit high to me. I feel like we should have a lot more in this general area, if I'm being honest. That's my critique of the list.",
