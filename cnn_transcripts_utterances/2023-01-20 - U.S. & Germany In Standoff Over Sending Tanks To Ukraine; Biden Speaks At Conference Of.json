And so much of significance consequence.But those things are consequential, and they affect people's quality of life more than any other group of people in the world. And mayors know that the measure of success is not in how many partisan points you score, but how many problems you fix. Can you fix the problem? So when I came to office, we had a lot of problems. Can you hear me now? The pandemic was raging. Our economy was reeling. But we acted together. Now, two years in, it is clearer than ever that our plan is working. And we are building the economy from the bottom up, and the middle out and not the top down. And when we do that, the middle-class can have a little breathing room. And the economy that benefits folks in the heartland and the cities and all across America. And so, you know, I know that when -- as I said, my family, when I was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, when coal died, we had to move. And the joke was everybody was from Scranton. And think of the towns that you know that you are mayors of. They go through school, and they want to stay where the families are, and the relatives are, and they know everything. And then you have to say that you have to leave, because there's no jobs here. There are no jobs here in my town. I am deadly serious. Earnest. And what we trying to do is to not bring back the economy, but bring back the pride, and the pride and the sense of belonging, and the sense of where I want to live now, and where I want to do what I want to do. That is the whole purpose of the cities to build out. But now they are starting to build back in. And the cities are growing. And not just small cities, but the economies as well. You can have a college degree, but you don't need it. Two years ago this week, 218 million people out of work, and now it is under 1.6 million, and that the lowest level in decades. (APPLAUSE)",

A lot of the marchers are telling us that they want to keep it now and turn it more into the grass-roots movement to go door-to-door to get the agenda across. And one lady told us that she wants to focus on what she calls the flooding of abortion pills into the country since Roe v. Wade was overturned. So you're seeing things like that, discussions like that taking place as to how the tactics have to change for the anti-abortion movement.

This is after months of delays.Three police officers and two paramedics were indicted on charges of manslaughter and negligent homicide in the death of Elijah McClain. The exact cause of death is still to be determined or at least in question. Now back in August of 2019, McClain, a young black man, was walking home from a convenience store with some iced teas. He was listening to music in his headphones when he was confronted by three Aurora, Colorado, police officers, who say they were responding to a call about a suspicious person. And even though he wasn't doing anything wrong, the police attempted to apprehend him. One of the officers, Nathan Woodyard, tried to restrain McClain with a chokehold to the neck that has since been banned, causing him to briefly lose consciousness. The other two officers helped him restrain him on the ground despite repeated pleas that he could not breath. The paramedics were then called. They injected him with ketamine. It later turned out it was too much for his body weight and he died a few days later. Brain dead. Then dead at 23 years old. Now the initial autopsy report listed the cause of death as undetermined, but it was amended to say his death was actually caused by complications from that ketamine injection following restraints. The manner of death remains undetermined. The various defendants, meanwhile, have been pointing fingers at one another as to who was responsible for the death. Which is why, this week, a judge ruled there will be three separate trials. Former Officer Nathan Woodyard, the one who performed the chokeholds, will be tried independently. The other officers, Randy Roedema and Joseph Rosenblatt, will be tried together. And the two paramedics, Peter Cichuniec and Jeremy Cooper, will also be tried together. And I should note that Elijah's death, guys, almost slipped through the cracks. Initially, the local D.A. didn't even take the case up, saying there was not enough evidence. It took statewide protests in the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd for the state attorney general to gather and convene this secret grand jury, which is why we are now here today -- Guys?",
