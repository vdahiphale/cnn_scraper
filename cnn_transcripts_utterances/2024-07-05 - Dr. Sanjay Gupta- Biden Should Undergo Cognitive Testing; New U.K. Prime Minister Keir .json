There were some 20 medical specialists that spent time with the president, including a neurologist, we are told, at that point.And they ruled out specific things like stroke, like multiple sclerosis, but also Parkinson's disease, for example. They said he did not have these things. And I will point out Parkinson's disease is the most common cause of what is known as Parkinsonism, but there are other causes as well. And they weren't fully -- it didn't -- at least from the medical report, did not seem to be fully investigated. And again, that's the sort of testing that we're talking about. If you want to distinguish if these are something that are more of these episodes versus a condition, you really do need that sort of testing. And I'll point out as well that you've heard about these cognitive tests, such as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. I think we have an image of that you can see. This is about a 10-to-20-minute exam that someone will do. And it's basically a blunt screening tool to try and figure out is there something to be more concerned about. We were told President Trump has had that done twice. It did not appear, at least in the medical records, that President Biden had that done.

The interview tonight with George Stephanopoulos. The events that he has coming up in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, all of the swing states. My understanding is he's going to sit down with additional journalists during those trips. I think that is what is going to show the audience, and voters, and everyone who is watching and waiting with bated breath for the president to prove that he does have what it takes to not just move on with a successful campaign but to be able to carry out what it takes to be president for another four years. I think that's more important than showing us a cognitive test. But what I also will say, Erica, is that as we are focused -- again, breathlessly reporting on every single thing that happens with President Biden -- let's not lose sight of the fact of the other guy that is in the running. In The New York Times piece that was so detailed in what was going on with Joe Biden's health, there were a couple of very interesting paragraphs -- in-depth paragraphs about what is going on with Donald Trump's cognitive decline. And those are things that we cannot ignore. And what I'm hearing from voters is let's take a breath. Let's give the campaign and President Biden time to prove what they have put out in terms of the schedule -- and they absolutely need to do that, and they probably took too much time to do that.",

      "sentences": "Matt, we have been talking this week about how this has really -- this has been a gift for the Trump campaign. Donald Trump uncharacteristically quiet for much of the week, which has also been attributed to the professionals he has running his campaign this time around -- that he's actually listening to them.But there is also rumbling -- and we've heard from our own reporters, and there's some additional reporting out from Axios as well this morning -- that there is some concern that if there were a change at the top of the ticket -- if Donald Trump were no longer running against Joe Biden -- if it was, for example, Kamala Harris -- that the vice president could really bring a lot of energy into this race and potentially excite voters. Is she a more formidable threat to Donald Trump? MATT MOWERS, FORMER TRUMP ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL (via Webex by Cisco):  Well, I think the challenge for the Democratic Party right now is they're stuck between an outcome that they know is going to fail, which is keeping Joe Biden, and an outcome that is likely to fail, which is replacing him with Kamala Harris. And the reason you know that is take out even polling from this week. If you look at their favorable-unfavorable ratings, Joe Biden, up until this past week, was the second-least popular politician in America. The most unpopular was Kamala Harris. Any time she's been in the limelight -- any time she's actually been under that spotlight you've seen her unfavorable numbers increase. Not to mention the fact that she owns a number of the policy failures of the Biden administration, whether you're talking about immigration, which she was put in charge of early in the administration and clearly has failed on. And voters are not responding well to the record of the Biden-Harris administration on immigration. But if you look at the stagflation continuing to come -- the inflation that we're seeing as result of these overspending that happened in the first two years -- she was right there in advance of that as well. Not to mention the fact that she is much easier to draw as a traditional left-wing progressive activist type of president in a way that actually has been very hard to paint Joe Biden as. I mean, you even saw some comments from Jason Miller today saying that Joe Biden enables the left wing, but Kamala Harris it he left wing. And I think that's the type of argument you'll see play out should she actually replace Joe Biden which, I'll be honest, I'm still skeptical of because I think there's too many Democratic strategists, not to mention Joe Biden himself, who also know that the moment it's Harris versus Trump, she 1) starts to race down as we've seen in every poll, and she hasn't really performed all that well every time the lights are on her.",

Hearing about what their voters want. Hearing about what the status of their races are. And they're going to come back here next week, and they're going to let the campaign and let the White House know what is up with their races. I think that's critical. Again, I think what happens tonight and what happens over the weekend with the president's events that he has coming up is going to inject a lot of knowledge into all of that. So let's take a beat. Let's take a moment. All the polls that you mentioned are up and down.

The security that working-class families like mine can build their lives around.
