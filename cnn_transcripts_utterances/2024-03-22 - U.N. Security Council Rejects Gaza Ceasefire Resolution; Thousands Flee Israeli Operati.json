It is 610:00 a.m. in New York, where the United Nations Security Council has once again failed to pass a resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. A short time ago, Russia as well as China vetoed the U.S.-backed resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire and sustained ceasefire in Gaza. Here's what U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield had to say about the veto. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LINDA THOMAS-GREENFIELD, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS: Russia and China still could not bring itself to condemn Hamas' terrorist attacks on October 7th. Can we just pause on that for a moment? Russia and China refuses to condemn Hamas from burning people alive, for gunning down innocent civilians at a concert, for raping women and girls, for taking hundreds of people hostage. This was the deadliest single attack on Jews since the Holocaust. And a permanent member of this council can't even condemn it. I'm sorry. It's really outrageous. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They claim that they havedetained the largest number of militants since the beginning of this war in this single operation. Hundreds of terror suspects they say have been detained. But what we also know, of course, is that civilians, including medical personnel, have also been among those detained. So it's difficult for us, of course, to independently verify the Israeli military's claims. The Israeli military says it is continuing to operate at the hospital and it says that there are still militants hiding out inside the hospital's buildings. But what we also know of course is that there are civilians, hundreds, perhaps even thousands still sheltering inside. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DIAMOND (voice-over): A crowded stairwell at Al-Shifa Hospital. Dozens of women and children await Israeli military instructions. For four days, thousands of civilians have been trapped here as the Israeli military raids the hospital, targeting Palestinian militants allegedly operating inside the medical complex. Soldiers are everywhere, the voice on the loudspeaker warns. If you leave the premises, the soldiers will shoot you. We have warned you. We have come here in order to get the Israeli hostages. Then we will let you go. Soon word of evacuations begins to spread. Now they are forcing out the women, the voice behind the camera says. We don't know where they're going to take us. The Israeli military says they have killed more than 140 militants in and around the hospital and detained these five men described as senior terror operatives among more than 600 suspects the Israeli military says they've detained. Eyewitnesses say medical personnel and other civilians have also been rounded up. Outside the hospital, the fighting continues, as seen through the lens of Hamas militants, who have been targeting Israeli tanks and troops around the hospital complex. Israeli airstrikes reducing parts of the surrounding al-Ramal neighborhood to rubble, sending thousands fleeing south. It's a journey marked by the sights and smells of death. We walked over the martyrs who are dead in the street. People are reduced to body parts, this woman cries. Where is the humanity? The newly displaced arrived on foot in central Gaza, carrying only backpacks and plastic bags, children clutching dolls and stuffed animals. Others, like this mother and her triplets, arrived with nothing at all. Tanks and artillery were firing at the buildings around Al-Shifa and forcing people to leave the building, she says. They make them leave with nothing on them, nothing. No pillow, no blanket, not even water. Nuzha isn't just fleeing the fighting. But the starvation that has left her eight-month-old babies thin and frail. You can see them, she says. Each of them is not even two kilos. Eight months old and not even two kilos. Anyone who sees them would think they are only two months old. And they are eight months. It's a catastrophe. No water, no food, and siege and gunfire. But her journey is not over yet. She is heading further south in search of food and shelter, no longer taken for granted in Gaza. (END VIDEOTAPE) DIAMOND (on-camera): And the Israeli military yesterday published photos of 358 men who had identified as terrorist suspects who are arrested at Al- Shifa Hospital. But today the Israeli military acknowledged that it erroneously identified some of those individuals as terror suspects who had been arrested when in fact an unspecified number of them have not yet been arrested. The Israeli military attributed that to human error -- Eleni.",

The question we've been asking for monthsnow is how much of that leverage is the United States actually willing to use. So far the key leverage we've seen the U.S. use is its voice, its rhetoric, that we've seen from top U.S. officials growing increasingly critical of Israel. But we know that the U.S. is pushing on multiple fronts today to try and reach a ceasefire agreement. The secretary of state, of course, was meeting today with the Israeli prime minister and the Israeli war cabinet in Tel Aviv. And we also know that CIA director Bill Burns is in Doha, Qatar meeting with the Israeli intelligence chief as well as the Egyptians and the Qataris as well. But today as part of those discussions that Secretary Blinken was having was also about this potential major Israeli military offensive in Rafah, where the U.S. is trying to prevent the Israeli government from ordering a major offensive into that city were about one-and-a-half million Palestinians are currently living. The Israelis have expressed an openness to listening to American ideas, but they have repeatedly indicated that they are not going to be swayed and today the Israeli prime minister after meeting with Secretary Blinken once again saying that there is, quote, \"No way for us to defeat Hamas without going into Rafah and eliminating the rest of the battalions there.\" And he said that he told Secretary of State Blinken we will do it with the support of the USA but if we have to we will do it alone -- Eleni.",

But it's alsoclear, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken acknowledged this, that it's not quite there yet. And there are gaps, even if there are statements coming from Blinken or the Biden administration that those gaps are narrowing, they still remain there. Of course, Bill Burns is the key player here, head of the CIA. He'll meet his counterparts in Doha, Egyptian, Qatari, Israeli, to see if he can find a way forward here. If he can find a way to close those gaps, there is clearly a sense of urgency on the part of the United States not only because of a need for more humanitarian aid to get in, that's a massive effort of the United States. But also because of concerns over what an Israeli ground offensive in Rafah could look like, what the results of that could be for the Palestinian population there. So this is where Bill Burns is trying to go in and see if it's possible to make significant progress to get towards a ceasefire, a hostage release that would allow the flow of more humanitarian aid in. The question of course is, will he be able to? And it's not just the meetings today. There are senior Israeli officials in Washington next week to discuss the future of the war here, at least certain aspects of it. The question of what might an operation in Rafah look like, how does more humanitarian aid get in. So this moment in time is the convergence of a number of meetings and that's one of the reasons it is so critical and why we'll watch very carefully what comes out of the CIA director in Doha with his meetings.",

CNN's Jennifer Hansler is following this for us from the U.S. State Department. A lot of meetings on the go today and of course expected over the next few days as negotiations continue in Doha. We know the story out of the United Nations Security Council, that U.S. resolution not passed. But how important is this meeting with Blinken and Netanyahu because the U.S. does have a lot of demands? It is requesting for more leeway from the Israeli side.",

So we will wait to see whether that pressure has actually yielded results. But it looks like at this point that these were very difficult conversations. Blinken was going into this meeting with Netanyahu with the war cabinet calling on them to increase the number of crossings to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza, into the millions of people who are on the brink of famine. He was also going to press them to hold off on any military incursion into Rafah, where more than a million people have fled the violence. At this point, we don't see any indication that there has been any change in the position from the Israeli government. Netanyahu has continued to vow to carry out that offensive with or without U.S. support. And we also, of course this morning saw that diplomatic blow coming from the U.N. Security Council, where the U.S. had put forward this resolution that they hoped would bolster these on-the-ground efforts to get this immediate and sustained ceasefire as they call it, in exchange for hostages. They said this would show a strong signal of support that the United Nations Security Council was behind this effort, and as we saw that effort did in fact fail. Now I want you to know, Eleni, we just saw the secretary emerge from his days of meetings and greet some protesters outside his hotel. So we'll wait to hear what he has to say -- Eleni.",

All right, as you can see, up to 600 people were arrested from illegally crossing the border by overcoming members of the National Guard. Meanwhile, an appeals court is deciding whether to allow Texas to enforce a new law which allows state law enforcement to arrest people they suspect of entering the U.S. illegally.

This year, a stark new report isbringing attention to a global water crisis. UNESCO says there are around 2.2 billion people who don't have access to clean drinking water and while climate change is global its effects are not equal. And now more than one- third of Africa is considered water insecure. Well, in an effort to make a better situation and a little sweeter, CNN's Bill Weir spoke with students at MIT who see a potential solution in our oceans. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): On a planet of nearly eight billion people, as aquifers are drained, reservoirs evaporate and sea levels rise, earth's freshwater supply is getting dirtier, saltier, and scarcer. And while desalination keeps some wealthy nations alive, making saltwater sweet demands the kind of energy and infrastructure that's just out of reach for the most desperate societies.",
