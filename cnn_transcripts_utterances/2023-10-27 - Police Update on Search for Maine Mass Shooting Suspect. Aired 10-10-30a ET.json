The shelter-in-place orders now spans some 700 square miles in the search for Robert Card, the 40-year-old man suspected of opening fire at two locations, killing 18 people here. We are learning more about the lives lost. We should note that just moments ago, we learned the identity of one more individual, Joshua Seal. He was taking place in the Cornhole Tournament for the deaf community at the bar that's right behind me. There are now several victims, it seems, who were part of the deaf community. On Wednesday nights, they played Cornhole at the bar here. We're told this man, he was a lead interpreter for the deaf for Maine Governor Janet Mills when she was holding her daily COVID briefings.
