Let's look at Nevada. We're now standing by for a press conference with officials from Clark County, which of course is the biggest County in Nevada, home of Las Vegas. The race -- the race here is between Adam Laxalt, the Republican, and the Democrat incumbent Catherine Cortez Masto. We are still 22,595 votes ahead from Adam Laxalt. But again, the lion's share of the votes that are still outstanding are in Clark County where Catherine Cortez Masto leads so this race is very much unknown right now.So now let's flip it over. Let's look at Arizona, another close one. The Democrat incumbent Mark Kelly there is still locked in his tight race with Blake Masters, the Republican. Mark Kelly is ahead by 89,969 votes. We are awaiting an update from there and also several 100,000 votes are still outstanding in Maricopa, the most populous county there. Let's look at Georgia because there we are awaiting the Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. He's going to be speaking any moment. We anticipate about the status here of this race. What you just heard Gabe Sterling, the elections chief there saying is heading into a runoff. Raphael Warnock, Gabe says simply there aren't enough votes outstanding for this to not go to a runoff. So, in the House, let's look at the balance of power flip over to the house. Still here can't tell you. There are still seats that need to be called, 45 seats remaining where we have been unable to make a call. Let's look at where Democrats are leading right now at this hour of the afternoon. Democrats are leading in 19 of the competitive seats that we are unable to call at this point. Let's flip it over and show you where Republicans have the lead in these competitive races. And there as you can see 16 seats. So too early to call the Senate too early to call the House, that's where we are suspense builds this afternoon. We have a team of reporters standing by in all of these battleground states. Let's start in Georgia where that Senate race is now headed to a runoff. Eva McKend is there. And, Eva, I know we're awaiting an update from the Secretary of State who just easily won reelection there, Brad Raffensperger, on the race.",

That's what his campaign had been hoping for. They fell short of that last night.Still, declined to concede yesterday at his victory party but he did just issue a statement a short while ago. I just want to read for the viewers a part of it. He said I would like to congratulate New York Governor Kathy Hochul on her election to a full four-year term. This race was a once-in-a-generation campaign with a very close margin in the bluest of blue states. So, Lee Zeldin, of course, making reference there to the fact that leading up to Election Day in the final days, according to some of the polls, this race appears to be very close. But in the end, the math just did not work out for Lee Zeldin, Governor Kathy Hochul, not only becoming the first woman elected governor here in New York but actually managing to get enough votes. She's up by more than 300 votes -- 300,000 votes, I should say at this hour. And she really was helped by that big turnout here in New York City, as well as wide margins in her hometown of Buffalo where she did very, very well. So, Lee Zeldin finally conceding, congratulations -- congratulating the new governor on her full four-year term. And New York now has elected its first woman governor, Erin.",
