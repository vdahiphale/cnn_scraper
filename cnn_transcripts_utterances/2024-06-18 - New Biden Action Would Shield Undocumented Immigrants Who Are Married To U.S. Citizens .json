As the president's campaign hopes it will please the very same people he angered with more aggressive border rules, he announced just two weeks ago.Plus, he loves me, he loves me not. That's how Dr. Anthony Fauci describes his complicated relationship with Donald Trump and his new memoir. This hour part of his conversation with our own Dr. Sanjay Gupta, about how difficult it was to correct the former president in front of the American people. And why are so many Republicans turning on one of the most conservative members of Congress, hint in today's GOP, don't piss off Donald Trump. And right now, voters are having their say as they cast ballots in one of the years' most bitter GOP primary races. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. First step, the power of the pen. President Biden is poised to announce a sweeping executive action to protect immigrants living in the U.S. illegally but who are married to American citizens. The White House says, it could provide relief to more than half a million people and be the most significant action to protect undocumented immigrants since the Obama era dreamers' plan. CNN's Kayla Tausche is at the White House. Kayla.",

      "sentences": "Well, Dana, President Biden later today will announce that executive action that will authorize undocumented immigrants married to U.S. citizens as well as their children to apply for lawful residence without leaving the country. The Biden administration says that those individuals, those spouses must have already been married before this point and must have already been in the United States for a decade prior to today.The administration expects that about 500,000 spouses will be impacted by this order, and about 50,000 children. And those individuals are already eligible to apply for green cards, but they would have to do so under prior law outside the country. And if they were found to have been in the U.S. unlawfully, then they would have had to remain outside the country for up to a decade. Now that prior eligibility is a distinction that the Biden administration believes could help this order, survive any legal challenges that are sure to be brought as had been brought to presidents of either party when they announced executive actions, targeting this very issue. The President Biden today is hoping to do a few things with this order. Number one, to quell some of the frustration among immigration advocacy groups who are angered about rules to restrict asylum that he announced just a few weeks ago. Many of those advocacy groups will be here at the White House when he signs this order and announces it later today. There's also an expectation that he wants to neutralize immigration as a hot button issue, ahead of next week's debate and ahead of the broader homestretch into the November election. And then finally, experts say, he could really boost the economy with this order, allowing half a million people to seek better paying jobs would have that effect. And those are all things that President Biden really wants to do, Dana.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, it was a clear hint. The president told us what he's going to do. I mean, he didn't tell us exactly. Look, this is enormously consequential for the half a million people that are affected. For the rest of the country, I don't want to say it's cosmetic, but this is largely about the symbolism of immigration and where you think the country should go and how welcoming you should be -- the country should be, and how firm the country should be on enforcing the border.And I think none of us at this table will be surprised, if immigration dominates a large part of the debate. That's coming up here on CNN in just a few days, a week and a half, I think. And the Biden campaign has always known they need a better answer on immigration because they know Trump hammer is on it. And this is part of it. Whether that will be adequate? I don't know. LAUREN FOX, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: And well, it's not adequate for a lot of Republicans on Capitol Hill, right. I was talking to John Thune last night as they were coming into the Senate. And his argument was that, basically Biden's trying to have it both ways. And this is creating more pull factors for immigrants who may not get or may not be eligible for this program but may view it as a symbol that they should come to this country. That is the view from the Republican side of the aisle. And last -- a couple of weeks ago, when he did the last executive order, it wasn't enough for Republicans. I think it's important to point out once again, they had an opportunity to vote on a bipartisan package. They decided not to vote it to support that and move it forward. But I do think that that gives you a sense that for people who are in the Latino community, this does send a signal. But for Republicans, this does not change. BARRON-LOPEZ: It's not just Latino community, though, because these are mixed families. These are, you know, it's more than 500,000 that will be impacted by the actions today. And then it's also those spouses that are U.S. citizens, and they're not all Latino, those U.S. citizens, they are, you know, of different ethnic backgrounds. And I was talking to a spouse today actually, a U.S. citizen, one that's married to an undocumented spouse who said that, in her community, in her state, people that are Republicans around her actually support this action. And the polling bears that out. That polling shows that a majority of voters do actually support, giving status to undocumented migrants who have lived here for a long time. And that's the key -- more than 10 years.",

Biden doesn't care that law-abiding taxpayers, crushed by inflation, are forced to pay for free food, housing, and healthcare for illegals. Biden only cares about one thing, power.

He is potentially on the list of vice-presidential candidates for Donald Trump. He talks about this issue much differently. Now, that is not a coincidence. That is a direct reflection of the fact that Republican voters are following Donald Trump's words. And that is a perfect example.BARRON-LOPEZ: One thing that I also want to point out that -- that I think was referenced in that statement, as well as from other Trump campaign advisors. In response to this action today was that they repeatedly said that -- that these undocumented immigrants are going to be able to vote, come this election. Now this is just to give out -- that's not true. That's not accurate. Many of these people will not even get you a citizenship until five years from now, assuming that it isn't stopped by the courts.
