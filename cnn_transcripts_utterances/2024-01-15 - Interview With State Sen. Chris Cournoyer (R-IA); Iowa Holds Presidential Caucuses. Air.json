Today, the candidates making their closing pitches to caucus-goers in the Hawkeye State, hitting the trail in the middle of a record cold snap. This is the capital of Des Moines, where it is two degrees below zero, so cold that even the traditional sky-high enthusiasm among Donald Trump supporters may not be enough insulation. Trump himself has expressed concern his margins could take a hit from the frigid temperatures. CNN's Eva McKend is on the scene in Des Moines. So, what are the candidates saying in these final hours?",

She says that she's not worried about the weather, that she's feeling a lot of momentum and excitement on the ground. She has really centered her campaign on this notion that she would be the strongest person to go up against President Biden in November, so principally about electability. Meanwhile, Governor DeSantis crisscrossing the state as well. Take a listen to what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  People are going to say there's only two possible nominees, Donald Trump or Governor DeSantis. We're the only ones that have strong support amongst bedrock Republican conservative voters. And, like, to win a Republican nomination, you have got to be able to do that. I think Iowa will show that very clearly. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The Iowans I'm speaking to say yes, that they take their role in this process very seriously. They think it's a huge honor that Iowa goes first, so that they have had the privilege of vetting these candidates, and that despite this negative -- negative temperatures, below-zero temperatures, they do plan to go out to their community centers among their community and participate in the caucus tonight, Anderson.",

And when you look at the polling and you look at the energy and you look at where Trump is, you see that it perhaps didn't translate. So are the elites able to influence the grassroots, or does the grassroots have its own inertial momentum despite the elites, which has, frankly, been the story of Donald Trump all along?

But given the vaunted importance of a ground game in Iowa, this is really a test for Kim Reynolds, a very popular governor. Can she convert that endorsement to people on the ground? Can Bob Vander Plaats convert that endorsement to evangelicals getting out, especially in these conditions? I think Donald Trump's throwing out the rule book on a lot of issues.

That benefits Nikki Haley. So it will be interesting. I'm looking at not just what the turnout is, but where it is and how. Does the evangelical vote split for Ron -- between Ron DeSantis and Donald Trump, or is Donald Trump able -- he got two-thirds of the evangelical vote in 2016. Can he hold on to that?

And I know, again, from my conversations with his team, that they really do think one of the best strategies on the trail for Donald Trump is to try and paint himself as a victim of political persecution. And that's exactly what the former president did during his rally in Iowa yesterday. He told supporters -- quote -- \"These caucuses are your personal chance to score the ultimate victory over all of the liars, cheaters and thugs.\" He continued to say -- quote -- \"The Washington swamp has done everything in its power to take away your voice. But tomorrow is your time to turn on them and to say and speak your mind and vote.\" Now, Anderson, we should note that much of his incendiary rhetoric around his legal issues isn't necessarily based in fact. But it is something that his team believes is working well with his supporters. And I also just -- a great example of this, I think, is what we saw last week, when Donald Trump took himself off the trail, not once, but twice, in order to appear in court for two of his separate cases. And part of that strategy was really -- and it enabled him to suck a lot of the media oxygen out of the primary and keep it on himself.

And, as I mentioned before, Ted Cruz really campaigned hard among evangelicals. And you can see that in these areas densely populated with evangelical voters, this is where Ted Cruz did the best and tried to run up the score. These are Cruz counties, Cruz counties, Cruz counties. That was 2016. I want to show you a couple of these counties that have some of the highest numbers of evangelicals. Look at this. In the northwest corner of Iowa here -- let me just X out of that -- the northwest corner of Iowa here, Lyon County, Ted Cruz was first in 2016, Marco Rubio second, Ben Carson third. Donald Trump wasn't even among the top three. One county to the south, in Sioux County, again, high number of evangelical voters, Cruz, Rubio, Ben Carson. Trump not in the top three in 2016. Now, as we're in 2024, in the latest \"Des Moines Register\" poll among evangelical voters, Donald Trump's at 51 percent. Ron DeSantis is at 22 percent. Donald Trump is just lapping the field, eight years ago, wasn't even among the top three in these counties. And to an extent, you think Donald Trump has the idea that he's pretty safe among these voters. Why do I say that? Well, where is he spending all of his money right now? We have one slide here. We're going to show ad spending over the closing weeks of the campaign. Donald Trump's campaign and his super PACs spent $4.5 million targeting Nikki Haley, zero dollars targeting Ron DeSantis, so not fighting for the evangelical vote.
