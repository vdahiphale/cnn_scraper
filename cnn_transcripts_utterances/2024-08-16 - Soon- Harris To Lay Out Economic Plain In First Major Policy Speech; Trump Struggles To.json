The child tax credit that was in the American Rescue Plan, that popular policy passed by Democrats in Congress, she wants to expand on that, make that permanent, but go from $2,000 to $3,600, $6,000 for mid class and low income families with newborns.That, of course, speaks directly to the criticism from former President Donald Trump's running mate, JD Vance, that Democrats are somehow anti-family. Also in her proposals, she's proposing policies that would lead to more access to affordable housing and more access to affordable healthcare. Ultimately, she is trying to set up a contrast with these policy principles. She's arguing that the Democratic ticket are principally concerned about everyday Americans, the American worker. And she argues that former President Donald Trump and his allies are more animated by passing tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires, obviously something that they would take issue with. Ultimately, though, this is just a wish list. These are Democratic policies that have been proposed before, and ultimately the greatest challenge is ultimately working in concert with Congress to get these policies passed over the finish line., Jess.",

Catherine, thanks so much for sharing part of your Friday afternoon with us. So these are about a dozen policy proposals. Some of them have been sort of in the ether for Democrats. They've been pitched before, they've been bills before, but they haven't exactly gotten across the finish line. Which of these policies do you see as most realistic for Congress, not only to take up but to actually pass?",

      "sentences": "Well, first of all, nobody can explain what price gouging means. It's like that old line about pornography, I know it when I see it in the sense that what does it mean to have an excessive price or an excessive profit margin. That seems to be shorthand for a price or a profit margin that that bugs me. That seems too high.So, you know, it's very hard to pin down what this would actually mean. If you look at the legislation that, as I mentioned, is already in the Senate, led by Senator Warren and Senator Bob Casey, and a slew of others, the particular way that this is written, which is likely to be the template for any proposal that Harris would eventually embrace is especially bad in that. It just bans excessive prices, grossly excessive prices, grossly excessive profit margins, and says that the Federal Trade Commission can use any metric it deems appropriate to decide what that would mean, which basically says, like it's not going to be markets, it's not going to be supply and demand that's determining how much your grocery store charges you for milk or for eggs. It's going to be some bureaucrat in DC, which seems like totally unworkable, first of all, for the FTC to be side deciding like how much Kroger charges for eggs in Michigan. But it also would be very bad for markets. We've seen this kind of thing tried in lots of other countries before, Venezuela, Argentina, the Soviet Union, et cetera. It leads to shortages. It leads to black markets. You know, plenty of uncertainty. And beyond that, the specific way this bill was written might actually increase prices because of some of the other language in it, things like requiring companies, public companies to disclose in their quarterly reports, the quarterly earnings reports, how they're setting prices, which is a great way to help them collude, which normally we don't want them to do. So anyway, you know, the devil's in the details, I guess, for that bill. But it's really hard for me to imagine any form of legislation that preserves the spirit of what she's proposing that would not be, you know, at best do nothing, at worst cause a lot of harm.",

During at times rambling press conference at his private golf club in New Jersey on Thursday, the former president alternated between economic remarks and insults aimed at his challenger. He admitted that he's angry at Harris and argued that he's entitled to personally attack her. Along the way, Trump made some 20 plus false claims.Let's get to CNN's Kristen Holmes. Kristen, how are the Trump campaign and his Republican allies reacting to this, given that earlier in the week, we heard so many calls from them for him to stay on message?",

      "sentences": "Yes. So I actually want to point to that answer in which Donald Trump was talking about being entitled to personal attacks, because the part where he said he felt like he was entitled to personal attacks actually made the most sense of that entire 15 minute answer, then he went into a diatribe. And that's when he started talking about how he was the victim of multiple court cases, that they were trying to put him in jail. There were so many unfair judges. He basically went through a laundry list of all of his various court cases.The answer to the question, which is about personal attacks, was probably 15 minutes, and had very little to do with anything other than airing his own grievances, which is what we've really become accustomed to with Donald Trump. And we got to a point in the campaign against President Joe Biden where he wasn't doing that. He wasn't really talking. Of course, we've seen him on during the trial saying those things, but he wasn't saying that as we were watching this kind of shift on the Democratic ticket, and now he is completely back in that. Now talking about messaging, his team, and really Republicans across the country who would like him to be elected in November, kind of holding their breath when he does these press conferences, because you could see the reaction on Twitter. I was getting calls from various allies as he was reading from the binder, saying, look, he's doing a great job. He's talking about the economy. This is really kind of what he had done the day before, then it went off the rails. And the question is whether or not Donald Trump can get it back, because the entire thing that they want him to do is win in November, but they believe that he can only do that by talking about these three specific issues in which he has pulled ahead of President Joe Biden on really Democrats as a whole, the economy, immigration and crime. They wanted to have events like yesterday, events like the day before, North Carolina, where he does this, but he just can't seem to help himself. Now, he does seem to have started to shift slightly away from all the conspiracy theories. Maybe, perhaps the allies that I talked to, who talked to him, are getting through to him, but he is still talking off script as Donald Trump does. I do want to play one piece of sound. This is from an event after the press conference when he was talking about Miriam Adelson, who was in the room, someone who he has had very good relationship with. Until recently, the New York Times reported he had an aide send her some kind of unhinged text messages trying to get that back. And then, he said this during the event. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND CURRENT U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  We gave Miriam the Presidential Medal of Freedom. That's the highest award you can get as a civilian. It's the equivalent of the Congressional Medal of Honor but civilian version. It's actually much better, because everyone gets the Congressional Medal of Honor, that soldiers. They're either in very bad shape because they've been hit so many times by bullets, or they're dead. She gets it, and she's a healthy, beautiful woman. And they're rated equal. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Great to have you here with us. First, just want to ask you about those comments from President Biden. Mediators are appearing cautiously optimistic. He says they're closer than ever, but there's probably still some ways to go. What's your sense? LEON PANETTA, FORMER U.S. DEFENSE SECRETARY: Well, look, I think the President deserves a lot of credit for continuing to push to try to get a ceasefire and a hostage exchange, and try to see if we can ultimately bring this war to an end. But as we've seen, there are some difficult challenges that still remain, and those challenges are Hamas, and whether or not they'll ultimately agree to this, and Netanyahu in Israel, whether or not he will ultimately agree. So there's still some challenges out there, but I give the United States and the other parties that are part of this effort a lot of credit for trying, because otherwise what could happen here is an escalated war in the Middle East.",

The problem is that, if Iran really conducts a very strong attack against Israel that results in a lot of deaths goes after Tel Aviv and other key areas, this is going to be a wider war, and it could very well draw the United States and Israel both into a war with Iran.Now, having said that, that might be what would discourage Iran from doing something like that, because I don't think they're particularly interested in a war with the United States and Israel, because that would mean the end of their regime.
