He would be the first black Republican governor in America. And this also showed the enduring influence of former President Donald Trump. Cameron secured the Trump endorsement early in this contest.

Republican strategists describe Governor Beshear to me as a warm cup of coffee. He does have mass -- like a warm cup of coffee, he has mass appeal in this state. But there are more registered Republicans in Kentucky than Democrats. This is a ruby-red state. And so, Republicans really view this has a prime pickup opportunity. This race is going to receive national attention. Cameron viewed as a rising star in the Republican Party. He spoke at the 2020 Republican convention. He's beloved by Republicans in this state. But also across the country. But he also earned the ire of Democrats for his response, and progressives and celebrities in California.

Because you do have Beshear, who maintains high personal image ratings. That's absolutely true. And you have his party, which maintains very low image ratings in the state. And Republicans here are ascendant, holding every other constitutional office in Frankfort. So I agree with the assessment. It's going to be the most watched race of the year. And it's really two young candidates who I think the winner of this race are destined for -- for national stardom.

But both sides emerged from that meeting yesterday without any clear path forward on how to avert a default for the first time in U.S. history. But these talks are starting to enter a new phase. President Biden has appointed two top aides here at the White House to start and lead those discussions with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy's office. That includes the counselor to the president, Steve Ricchetti, a long-time aide. Also, the OMB director, Shalanda Young, who has a long history up on Capitol Hill, working in the appropriations sector, as well as Louisa Terrell, who has been the legislative affairs director here at the White House. They will be negotiating with Congressman Garret Graves, a Republican who McCarthy has picked for these talks to play out. This is something that many had hoped might be a next step in the formal talks, as they -- some were hoping that they would be able to shrink the room of those conversations. But still, there are so many issues where the White House and McCarthy remain incredibly far apart. They still need to figure out what exactly the length for a debt ceiling raise would be. How long they would agree to when it comes to spending caps. And one of the key sticking points is that issue regarding work requirements for some social safety net programs. McCarthy says including those will be a red line for him, but the White House pushed back in a new statement last night, saying that President Biden will be fighting against any type of restrictions that would eliminate healthcare or push people into poverty.
