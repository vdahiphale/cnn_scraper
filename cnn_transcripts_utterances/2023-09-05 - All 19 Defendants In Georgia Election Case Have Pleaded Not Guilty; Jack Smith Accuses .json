      "sentences": "Tonight on 360Also, new polling and presidential candidate Chris Christie's reaction to it showing the frontrunner, Donald Trump pulling away from the Republican pack even farther, and the vast majority of Republican voters seemingly okay with him even if convicted of federal crimes. And later, stunning new claims about the Alex Murdaugh murder trial and whether they could lead to a retrial. Plus, exclusive stunning video from inside a Syrian Children's Hospital that ISIS used as a torture center, video that's now in the hands of war crimes investigators. Good evening, thanks for joining us. Hope your holiday was a good one. We begin tonight with breaking news wrapped in a mystery: A late-day court filing from Special Counsel Jack Smith in the 2020 election subversion case. In it, he accuses the former president of making \"daily extrajudicial statements that threaten to prejudice the jury.\" Now because this is part of a court fight being conducted largely under seal at the moment, we don't know specifically what Smith is referring to. We do know this isn't all he's focused on at the moment. There's also exclusive CNN reporting tonight from our Paula Reid that Smith is looking into former Trump election lawyer, Sidney Powell, her fundraising and its role in voting machine breaches in four states. Now as you know, she is one of 19 defendants in Georgia, all of whom have now waived arraignment entering not guilty pleas. Tomorrow, she and attorney Kenneth Chesebro has a court hearing on their efforts to sever their cases from the other 17. Meantime, co-defendant, Mark Meadows, one of five who pleaded today is waiting for a judge to rule in his request to be tried in federal court. Now, there is also a reminder of the high price to be paid for actions by some on January 6. Tonight, Enrique Tarrio, leader of the so-called Proud Boys drawing a 22-year sentence for his role in the attack on Congress. That's the longest sentence so far. So we've been busy post Labor Day tonight. CNN's Paula Reid starts us off. So what more do we know about this court filing from Jack Smith?",

And there is currently a dispute about whether that dispute will become public.So it could be a while before we get more context, but we're seeing this as we've learned what exactly Smith and his team have been up to in the weeks since they filed that indictment against former President Trump related to election interference. We've learned that they've asked multiple witnesses specifically about Sidney Powell. She is of course the Trump-allied lawyer who pushed a lot of these election lies and was actively involved in efforts to overturn the election. Now, of course, Trump was the only person indicted so far by the special counsel, but in the federal indictment, they did list a description of six co-conspirators. We've learned that Powell is one of those co-conspirators. And Anderson specifically, they've been asking witnesses about whether Powell ever showed them evidence of her conspiracy theories and her claims. They've been asking about her nonprofit, Defending the Republic, and how it used money that it raised off of election lies to find a forensic team that was able to breach voting machines in four states that Biden won. Now, it is unclear if Powell or anyone else will be charged, but Anderson, it is the first insight we've gotten into what exactly the special counsel has been looking at since they filed that indictment.",

We've got Republican presidential candidate, Chris Christie's take on that and the state of the race as campaign season gains momentum. Later, new video of an escaped killer on the run as the search for him, the manhunt continues and intensifies. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [20:15:49] COOPER: In light of tonight's breaking news in connection with Jack Smith's election subversion case against the former president, there is new CNN polling on how little impact even a conviction would have on Republican voters. They and Republican-leaning voters were asked if the charges were true, would it disqualify the former president for them from becoming president again? Sixty-eight percent, more than two in three said no, they are not relevant to his fitness for the job, which presents a real challenge as our polling also shows to any Republican challenging him on that basis or any basis, it appears, the former president now leads his closer rival, Ron DeSantis, nationally by 52 to 18 percent; all of the others in single digits or less. This, of course, as I said a national poll in the primaries run state by state. Joining me now, one of the challengers, former New Jersey governor, Chris Christie. How do you reconcile that 68 percent of Republicans say -- two in three say, yes, even if he is convicted, that doesn't disqualify him from being president. CHRIS CHRISTIE (R), 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think the distinction a lot of these voters are making and I've heard this on the campaign trail is that they believe that the charges were politically motivated, but a lot of those 68 percent, I suspect don't approve of the conduct. And I think that's where the difference is also going to kind of be made here, is that people have differing opinions about whether the Justice Department has approached this in a way that's fair or unfair to Donald Trump and the Hunter Biden case plays into that as well. But when I asked people about the underlying conduct, is that what they want from a president of the United States? A good majority of those people say no. So I think that's where the distinction would be. Maybe they can start to ask the question a little bit differently.",

They raided a house and arrested a man suspected of having been a senior ISIS commander in Syria. (voice-over): His arrest in the small, sleepy town where he lived a quiet life with his wife and children shocked the nation. Residents here were reluctant to speak to us about the suspect, identified as Aham al-Es (ph). He allegedly operated in Damascus, not Aleppo. So it wasn't the CCTV video that led to his arrest. It was a tip from a Syrian NGO and witnessed testimony that triggered a years long Dutch investigation. Sources say he had a long history of extremism in Syria, holding leadership positions, first within an Al-Qaeda affiliate and later ISIS. Aham al-Es (ph), who rejects the government's accusations, now faces life in prison.",

You also have thousands who remain in jail in Iraq and Syria. But you've had countries that have been dealing in recent years with returnees, the repatriation of foreign fighters.And in some cases, European countries like this have found suspected ISIS members who have made it into these countries through the stream of refugees. How many? We don't really know. And this is why evidence like this is crucial. It could help law enforcement agencies identify some of these suspects, and it would allow prosecutors to go after them for more serious crimes and offenses, not just for membership. And as you heard there from Chris, who we spoke to in our piece, we're talking about individuals who've already proven that they are a threat. And it is very important for organizations like CIJA, they say, to hold these perpetrators accountable. And as we heard also from the prosecutor in the Netherlands, this is also about justice for the countless victims of ISIS, Anderson.",
