Officials say the Line Fire is threatening tens of thousands of buildings and homes in parts of San Bernardino County, forcing residents to evacuate.The fire burning is so intense that it grew 14 times bigger over a 30- hour window this weekend. CNN national correspondent, Camila Bernal joins us live now from San Bernardino County. Camila, tell us what you're seeing and how they're able to battle this blaze.",

      "sentences": "Hey, Fred. So right now, the priority is protecting the homes in this area. We are near the Running Springs Mountain community. It is an area that is already under an evacuation order, so people had been told to leave.So the proof that you see here behind me, what they're doing is structure protection. They're waiting to see where this fire is going to come from and what I was told is, you see those hoses is behind the trucks. Well, those are the hoses that they wrap around the homes. So right now what they're saying is they have not lost any homes and they want that to continue to be the case because the problem with this fire is that there are many factors working against the firefighters. There are about 600 personnel on the ground and they've asked for more people, but the weather conditions are really not helping this area. We've had triple-digit temperatures for the last couple of days and look, the overnight temperatures are about 80 degrees or so, they are in the 80s, so there is no break, so that's difficult for firefighters. The terrain is very dry because there hasn't been a fire in this area in a while, and so that also adds to the problem. And then there are thunderstorms expected in this area. So yes, the rain could be very beneficial for firefighters, but also, you have the lightning, that can start a new fire and then you have the wind moving that fire around into unpredictable areas where firefighters do not even know where it is going to go, so that also makes it very difficult. It is a mountain terrain. We are talking about a national forest. And so it is steep, it is hard to access. You either have to fly firefighters into some of these areas or they have to walk in, so again another factor that makes it extremely difficult for these firefighters. Yesterday, they had trouble getting some of the aircraft up in the air because of the conditions. As we arrived here today, we did start to see some of the aircraft flying around, assessing the area, so they're starting that air attack today as well again, so they're very hopeful that they will be able to make some progress, but it has been at zero percent containment since this fire started on Thursday. So it again, just requires around the clock work from these firefighters who are giving it their all and, you know, trying to protect the homes and the people in this area, about 5,000 in total are under those evacuation orders. So, again, people just being told to be ready to go at a moment's notice -- Fred.",

They said that some of his teammates who are passing by actually witnessed the incident and they stopped by to offer their support in the situation. Drew Rosenhaus is Tyreek Hill's agent. He spoke to ESPN just before the game, and this is what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DREW ROSENHAUS, TYREEK HILL'S AGENT: Apparently, he got a ticket for moving violation entering the stadium. How things escalated into the situation that they had him in handcuffs and being held on the ground with police is mind-boggling to me. I am deeply concerned by that, very troubled.

Of course, he has a job to do, but he said that afterwards they absolutely want to focus on what exactly happened to make sure that his client, Tyreek Hill, wasn't mistreated. He said and he was physically okay, but he was rattled and mentally distraught. Miami-Dade Police Department has issued a statement. This is what their director, Stephanie Daniels had to say: \"We are aware of the recent detainment of Tyreek Hill by Miami-Dade Police Department officers. I have requested an immediate review of all details surrounding the incident and we are also reviewing available body camera footage. We will provide updates as further information becomes available and they might also be looking at some of the footage we've seen taken by passersby, much of it is now on the internet and everybody is commenting on that.

Now, this is a very rural area of Laurel County, not far from the city of London in Kentucky and that is making the search extremely difficult. We are talking about forest terrain, a lot of trees, very difficult to see and to move around and that's making this search complicated. One thing we did learn in the last hour, Fred, is that the terrain that they are currently searching in is pretty much just trees and forest and an open area, not a whole lot of residential, not a whole lot of businesses, and that is a good thing for these law enforcement officers who are of course, worried, not just about capturing the suspect, but also so making sure that everyone remains safe. Take a listen to the Sheriff's Office speaking about just how difficult this operation is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GILBERT ACCIARDO, PAO, LAUREL COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE: The area, it is all remote. If he planned this, it is so remote. That's probably one of the most remote exits along I-75. It is all wooded. There is one business, there are no residences. He couldn't have picked an area that is any more remote and difficult for us to try to locate him, and that's what we want to do. We want to safely -- we don't want our guys to get hurt.

Officials claimed they were able to shoot down more than a dozen Russian attack drones and three missiles. In Russia, a Ukrainian strike in the southwest, Belgorod area injured three people. Tomorrow, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken travels to London. He is expected to meet with top British officials this week to discuss the war in Ukraine and other critical global issues. And today, Venezuela's opposition leader landed in Spain, fleeing his country after a disputed presidential election. Edmundo Gonzalez landed in Madrid today to seek asylum after an arrest warrant accused the candidate of crimes related to July's vote. Many western leaders criticized the crackdown against the opposition movement since discovering polls showed Gonzalez to be the winner. The country has been in a state of crisis since those tallies, which sparked deadly protests this summer. Journalist, Stefano Pozzebon is joining me now live from neighboring Colombia. So Stefano, the lawyer for Edmundo Gonzalez is speaking. What is he saying?",

Well, Jose Vicente Haro, the lawyer of Edmundo Gonzalez spoke with CNN Espanol in Caracas a couple of hours ago, and I think he tried to put the man ahead of the political leader saying that it was a matter of life and death and this perhaps, Fredricka can work as a stark reminder of the conditions of doing politics in Venezuela, 2,400 people have been detained since that controversial presidential election at the end of July.But this is what Jose Vicente Haro told us a couple of hours ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOSE VICENTE HARO, ATTORNEY FOR EDMUNDO GONZALEZ (through translator): Put yourself in his skin, in his mindset and the situation he was facing with real fears for his life and that of his family at that moment. The bare survival instinct prevailed over everything else. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The political leader of the opposition, Maria Corina Machado, who as a reminder was barred from running in the election in July, and that's why she selected Edmundo Gonzalez as her surrogate, well, she presented a statement on X earlier today showing defiance and claiming now that Edmundo Gonzalez will be sworn in as the new president of Venezuela come January 10th, which is when the president officially takes office.Now, how can they force a transition and a change where nothing that they have tried over the last five weeks seems to be working. It is a reminder that there have been in thousands and thousands of people taking to the streets demanding the transition, showing the results of electoral tallies, that the opposition say they have collected and that gave Edmundo Gonzalez the victory in that election. None of that has been able to even open a small fringe within the coalition of Maduro. So, now it really looks like the options of the opposition are very, very limited -- Fredricka.",

Debbie Hines is a former Baltimore prosecutor and Maryland assistant attorney general. She wrote an opinion piece in \"The Baltimore Sun\" titled \"Democrats must do more to confront police brutality.\" Great to see you, Debbie. Your title says Democrats, but is this only a challenge to that party in your view?",

      "sentences": "No, it is really a challenge to both parties. I think we possibly know where Donald Trump stands with regards to police and brutality and reining in the police in some meaningful way such as the George Floyd Justice and Policing Act. But the title is geared at this point to the Democrats because it was Kamala Harris that made me think of it when she gave her acceptance speech during the DNC Convention and she said she he wanted freedom. That was her theme, that was always her first thing that she wanted. She talked about, We, the People, and those are her focuses.And so when I think of those two themes of freedom, what freedom means for me, in this instance, is that many Black and Brown people would be free from police brutality and killings by the police, because Kamala Harris did support -- and this is why it is leaning into the Democrats -- she did support three years ago, very strongly, very forcefully the George Floyd Justice and Policing Act and in that act, had it been past which it was not, it would have eliminated qualified immunity, which is a key the issue that is a great concern to me as a criminal justice advocate. Because qualified immunity, it is a fancy word, but what it basically means is that shields the police from any liability, any civil liability, I am not talking about criminal, but it shields them primarily from any civil liability. So, it means that when people are harmed, not necessary killed with civil rights violations, brutality, and even killings that they cannot seek justice in the civil arena against the perpetrator, which would be the police officers. It completely denies them that. So when we hear about cases where we will hear that there are settlements of millions and millions of dollars that have been given to families and those who are deceased or had been still living, but have been harmed by way of police brutality by the police, not one penny, not one single cent is paid by the police due to qualified immunity, and therefore, the money that is being paid in those instances is being paid by We, the People. It is being paid by taxpayer money. So I wanted to delve into it because this really is not a Black person's problem, a Brown person's problem, it is basically an American problem that we need to address. So what I would hope is that either in the debates or in an interview with let's just say both, with Kamala Harris and with Donald Trump that the question would be asked about what do they intend or what are their policies will with police brutality and killings of Black people and Black and Brown people because in this country, numbers are important. I was not a statistician, but I've learned to realize that numbers are important. And in this country, more than a thousand people are killed each and every year by the police, and if you break down those numbers, what that means is every seven hours, someone is killed by the police in this country, and the only way we can really deal with that issue right now in some meaningful way is to pass the George Floyd Justice and Policing Act, which would eliminate qualified immunity.",

And so I called the police and when they got there, they told me that they would have to take my mother to the morgue as opposed to what I thought would be the funeral home.I didn't understand it. I watch \"Law and Order\" and I am thinking she doesn't need to be in a morgue having been killed or anything, but at the end of the day, I started crying uncontrollably. I couldn't stop crying. And what the police officer said and I am very still traumatized today every time someone gets killed because I remember his stern voice saying to me, if I didn't stop, meaning crying, he would have to arrest me. So yes, every time I hear about a Sonya Massey, a Breonna Taylor, Botham Jean, someone that gets killed in their own home or in the home of a loved one that they are at, it relates me back to the racial trauma that I experienced each and every time from what I went through and the experience of police officers in my mom's home, the home that I grew up in, that she lived in for over 40 years. That's one of the reasons why. So yes, just like whatever credentials I have, I still have reason as a Black woman to fear the police and fear for my life in certain instances involving the police.",
