Chipmaker ASML cutting its forecast warning about China, and that's dragged the entire sector lower. Those are the markets, and these are the main events. Hezbollah, de facto leader, warning Israel to accept a ceasefire in Lebanon or face \"pain.\" Boeing plans to raise tens of billions of dollars in a bid to shore up its finances. And what's black and white and cute all over, two pandas making the journey from China to the United States. Live from New York. It's Tuesday, October 15th. I'm Julia Chatterley, in for Richard Quest and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. Good evening once again, and tonight, Hezbollah has a warning for Israel after Benjamin Netanyahu threatens to strike the militant group \"everywhere\" in Lebanon. Hezbollah's de facto leader responded directly to the Israeli public calling on them to accept a ceasefire or face pain. He said, without a truce, millions of Israelis could be displaced. The Israeli prime minister vowed earlier that the IDF will strike Hezbollah without mercy, including in Beirut. Netanyahu was speaking at a military base where four soldiers were killed by a Hezbollah drone this weekend. Jeremy Diamond is in Jerusalem for us tonight. Jeremy, good to have you with us. It's interesting to hear the deputy secretary general of Hezbollah talking about a ceasefire, and I'm assuming that's not tied, as it, along has been to a ceasefire also in Gaza, but it doesn't sound that the Israeli prime minister is willing to entertain that prospect, particularly after this weekend's drone attack.",

But listen, we've seen quite aggressive military action in Gaza, and the ceasefire negotiations there appeared and by the way, that has that other piece, which is the hostage release deal, as those many dozens of Israeli hostages continue to be held there, and that ceasefire talk has gone nowhere in a number of weeks.

And so the question is, does Iran simply say, okay, like in April, this period, back and forth, with Israel is over for now, or do we see further escalation? Because I was in Washington last week, and even that \"Washington Post\" story indicated that the Israelis have not entirely taken off a strike on Iranian oil facilities off the table. It's just not in this current round that they are planning. So the question is, if you have escalation, is oil potentially caught in the crossfires? Or are we done with this phase?

Some of it is about reaching people who avoid the news or cynical about the news, but I do think that upcoming interview with Fox News does belong in a bucket all of its own. That Fox interview is unique for the following reason: Fox is like going to the enemy camp for Kamala Harris. The network exists on a 24/7 basis to demean and disparage her with only little bits of news in between all of that pro-Trump opinion. So for Harris to go on to Fox, it's both a statement of courage, you know, at least to Democrats, she's saying, hey, I'm willing to go into the enemy territory. But more importantly, for Harris, it's also a way to reach persuadable voters, because most of the people who she needs to reach, they're not watching, you know, the outlet she's already been on.

Trump is doing interviews that seem sometimes random or unorganized, where there's not always a clear strategy about who he's trying to reach and if he ends up losing the election, we will look back and look, for example, at last night's random town hall that turned into a dance party, and we, people will say, oh, well, this was clearly not very organized in the final stretch.

And two top black CEOs warning companies against abandoning diversity initiatives after a conservative backlash. But before that the headlines this hour. The first day of early voting in Georgia is underway for November's presidential election. And there has been a record-breaking turnout. A state official says more than 250,000 votes have been cast as of 4:00 p.m. local. About 160,000 homes and businesses in Florida are still without a power after Hurricane Milton. The storm made landfall nearly one week ago. About half of those outages are in Hillsborough County where the city of Tampa is located. 24 people in Florida lost their lives due to the storm. North Korea blew up two major roads that once linked it to South Korea. They've not been used for years. It's mainly a symbolic gesture given the border between the two countries is heavily fortified. A few days earlier, the North claimed South Korea flew propaganda drones over Pyongyang. Lufthansa has been hit with a $4 million fine in the U.S. for civil rights violations. The airline prohibited 128 Jewish passengers from boarding a connecting flight based on alleged misbehavior by some of them. The U.S. says the passengers who were mostly dressed in orthodox garb were penalized as a single group. Lufthansa denies discriminating against anyone. Boeing says it plans to raise tens of billions of dollars while confronting several crises. The most pressing one now is a month-long strike that has shut down one factory. The acting U.S. labor secretary met with both sides on Monday. Talks broke down last week and the company is burning through cash. Vanessa Yurkevich is with us now. Vanessa, I read earlier that Boeing was already burning $1 billion a month in cash even before this strike began. What is their financial situation today? And do we have a real sense of how much money they need to raise?",

Just last week on Tuesday talks broke down between the union and Boeing which essentially has prolonged the strike even longer. And one estimate puts the losses for Boeing and workers at about $5 billion in just the first month. And then on Friday, you have a double whammy, a judge essentially not ruling on a guilty plea that Boeing had made with the Department of Justice. They would've settled for hundreds of millions of dollars over two fatal crashes of their 737 MAX jets. Instead, the victims, the family's -- victims' families wanted $25 billion, but now with this sort of non-ruling, they could have to pony up more money. And then that same day, Boeing announcing 10 percent of their employees are going to be laid off in the next couple of months. That's about 17,000 employees. And then just today, Boeing essentially saying we need more cash. They are about $33 billion in debt and that has been something that Boeing has really struggled with.

Chenault and Frazier are pushing their own hiring initiative called OneTen, which aims to create jobs for people without college degrees. Nathaniel Meyersohn spoke to the former CEOs and he joins us now from New York. This is so important because DEI has become a dirty, highly politicized word.

DEI is about promoting kind of inclusion and equal opportunities for people based on challenges that they face. Whether it's the color of their skin or the neighborhood they grew up in, or the school they went to. It's designed to encourage representation and equal opportunity among a broader pool of talent. You know, than traditionally which has just been white men. And the kind of the big challenges that companies are facing right now is that there's so much pressure on them from right-wing, you know, political leaders and legal threats.

You know, merit, we think of merit as promoting the best people, but the definition of merit is really kind of not balanced Chenault told me. You know, 50 years ago, the people who are being promoted and the people who were, quote-unquote, you know, the meritocracy was just, you know, white people (INAUDIBLE) was flawed then.
