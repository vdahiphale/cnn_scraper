      "sentences": "Hello and a warm welcome to all our viewers watching from all around the world. I'm Paula Newton.Ahead right here on CNN NEWSROOM, devastation in North Africa. 1000s now confirmed dead in Libya, after heavy rainfall triggered catastrophic flooding and swept away entire neighborhoods. And then, in Morocco help is starting to arrive and some of the areas hit hardest by Friday's devastating earthquake, but for many residents, help did not arrive in time. Plus, Kim Jong-un has crossed into Russia, where he's expected to meet with Vladimir Putin amid concerns the two leaders could be planning an arms deal. So, it is 8:00 a.m. across northeastern Libya, where heavy rains and flash flooding have washed away entire villages along the Mediterranean coast. The Libyan National Army and health officials say at least 2,000 people have been killed, and 5,000 to 6,000 still missing this hour. It's impossible to verify any of those numbers as many areas remain unreachable. Video from the region shows a building's collapsed cars submerged torrents of water rushing through streets. The city of Derna was especially hard-hit. Authority, say two dams collapsed there. Bridges were -- the three bridges were destroyed and phone lines are currently down. The storm system dumped about eight months of rain on the region in a single day. It caused catastrophic flooding in Greece just last week. The Red Crescent is leading relief efforts there with aid supplies and rescue teams coming in from Turkey and the United Arab Emirates. We go live now to CNN's Eleni Giokos, who has been following all of these developments for us from Dubai. Good to have you on the story, Eleni. I mean, look, we've been looking at the images, right, apocalyptic whole communities seem to be annihilated, and shockingly, the head of Libya's emergency and ambulance service has admitted to CNN that there was no warning to residents. No evacuations, no calls to get to higher ground. In light of all of that, what are you learning about how this tragedy unfolded?",

And that is why people woke up in the middle of the night seeing their homes flooded, some saying that up to three meters.And then, trying to make a dash for it to get out of almost an impossible situation. You're seeing these images right now. Entire homes, it looked like they were just melted away by the force of the water, and the storm water. You mentioned those two dams that collapse, adding more water pressure, exacerbating the situation. We're seeing people that you can see this has been taken from inside that vehicle. So, people were trapped in cars. Over 2,000 people fear dead. That number is going to increase. We're hearing reports that people's bodies are lying on the ground, some were swept away into the sea. Derna is a port city. So, you can only imagine the catastrophe. But, of course, other areas will also hard-hit. People are trapped right now. There is no Internet lines, phone lines are down as well. Search and rescue teams are in absolute need. This is Storm Daniel, it hit Greece. Now, it's went to Libya. And, of course, lack of preparedness has exacerbated the situation. Look, rescue teams from Turkey, from UAE, and importantly, as well from Qatar have arrived to try and help these eastern parts of the country. But it's the lack of preparedness that makes this story a lot more difficult to fathom. And as we see this increasing, we also anticipating more rainfall, about five millimeters or so, and that is anticipated. Unfortunately, Paula, the number of people that are missing over 6,000. Again, difficult to verify these numbers in the current situation, because they just don't know how many people are trapped and they are trying to retrieve people. And also, this is going to continue for the next couple of days in term -- in terms of ascertaining how devastating this has been.",

The West has now declared three days of mourning. But there is a central government entity that tries to speak to both sides. There is a hope of this catastrophe now that both sides will come together to ensure that as much assistance as possible, is sent to these areas. But here is the thing. Look, we know that the eastern part of the country has been mostly closed off. It's -- Derna is a port city. This is an important economic hub for the area. The question now becomes can they -- can they bring rescue teams together to work effectively to try and send aid as quickly as possible? Because now, it's still -- we are still in search and rescue, and then, the aftermath that will bring many questions as well to the point of very divided country, Paula.",

And to have you on the story, and as you reminded me, Putin is actually speaking this hour at this economic forum. You know, it's no mystery as to why Putin would want this forum and why is asking, perhaps, for weapons from North Korea.You know, the more pertinent question here, though, may be, what else? Where else could this alliance lead to? Could Russia be willing to help North Korea advance its nuclear program? CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Yes, Paula. I think that is perhaps the key question, one of the most dangerous things that could potentially come out of this, could be the transfer from Russia to North Korea of technology that could aid the North Korea's nuclear program. For Russia, who has, you know, really since 2006, back to as a member of the U.N. Security Council sanctions against North Korea, albeit with some reservation in later years, this would be something of a turnaround to go from sanctioning its nuclear program to aiding it. So, certainly, that would be a measure of the seismic shift in the global order that has been sparked by the war in Ukraine. And even if they don't transfer technology, the money that they could potentially pay in North Korea for weapons could be funneled into the nuclear program. They could also, you know, prevent further sanctions as a member of the Security Council. So, this is certainly one to watch. And, of course, we know that Russia has amped-up the nuclear rhetoric, certainly in Europe by pulling out of the last nuclear arms nonproliferation agreement with the U.S. by stationing nukes in Belarus, and this would ramp up the nuclear stakes over in Asia as well. Putin, as you say, speaking right now. He is talking about development in the Far East. But we have heard elements of the sort of anti- Western rhetoric playing into these. Saying that Western countries have essentially ruined the systems they have created in terms of financial integration, trade, and things like that, talking about the multipolar world. And this is part of it as well, aside from the transactional elements of this meeting, a potential arms deal, and whatever North Korea wants in return is the politics, this building up of the so-called multipolar world, these anti-Western, anti-sanctions axis. So, I think even though, you know, the White House talks about weakness and desperation as the motive for Putin wanting to court North Korea, I think it's clear that any deal between these two countries could potentially make both of them more dangerous.

If he can outlast, outlast Ukraine's will and capacity to keep fighting, but even more, outlast the West. Because the critical potential point of failure is us, if we decide that we've had enough, if we decide to stop or scale down the amount of financial and military support we provide Ukraine, then Kyiv finds itself in a much, much tougher position.

Given that, if we go back to how Putin can prosecute this war at home, you know, do you believe, post Prigozhin here, that he could still have some trouble with the Russian public opinion?",

      "sentences": "I think so. I mean, I think we have to realize there's two different threats here. One is from the public. We're not likely to see grand protests, because remember, this is an increasingly brutal authoritarian police state. If you go out and protest, you're almost certainly going to be arrested. If you're lucky, you're going to be fined, if you're unlucky, you're going to prison and going to be roughed up by the police.So, I mean, I think there is a concern about not pushing the population too far. But we have to keep that in sort of limited constraints. Secondly though, it's the elite. That's, I think, what the Prigozhin mutiny really brought up. It's really striking how many within the military and security apparatus did not really want to get involved. They didn't want to join the mutiny but they didn't want to protect Putin either. But so I think, already, we're beginning to see a certain kind of calculus. People thinking, what is more dangerous? Letting Putin drag this country into increasing chaos and misery, or actually going against him? So far, at least, the risks in turning against Putin are greater. But the longer this war goes on, the more the misery accrues at home, then people may well start to change their minds about that.",

For the first time ever, all 15 Supreme Court judges are hearing a case together.They'll have to decide whether to uphold or strike down a law passed by Netanyahu and his supporters designed to limit the Court's ability to nullify government decisions deemed unreasonable. Israelis have been protesting for months over the issue that critics say erodes the Court's independence and harms Israel's democracy. Journalist Neri Zilber joins me now from Jerusalem with the latest. As we just noted, this is historic. What is the timeline here and do we have any indication on what could possibly be decided?",
