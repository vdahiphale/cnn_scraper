So, that just gives you a sense of exactly where we're located right now. And we did just hear all of those sirens in the city of Ashkelon and in other cities around the Gaza Strip.We're just hearing now from a Magen David Adom, that's the ambulance service, from a spokesman, that there were two injuries from those rockets in Ashkelon. And I think you guys have images up. I can't see from here right now, but I think you have some images of the damage that is already being reported. And it's important to note that, look, the Iron Dome obviously takes out a large majority of the rockets that are being fired from Gaza. But with every barrage of rockets, there is always this possibility of what we're seeing right now, big, massive structural damage but also, of course, the possibility of injuries and the possibility of people being killed. And this is kind of the psychological impact as well of these constant barrages. People are on edge here. People-- you do get the sense that this is a country on a war footing but that it is also a country where people are worried as they go about their lives here, as they try, at least to maintain some semblance of normalcy. Just yesterday, when we were in the city of Sderot, we had a woman who passed by our live shot location and asked us if we could accompany her to a gas station. Why? Because she was afraid. She was afraid of the rockets. She was afraid of a rocket hitting that gas station while she was simply trying to pump gas into her car. And that just gives you a sense of the situation that people are living with here, the fear that some people have. At the same time, we get a sense of resiliency from others. We spoke with another woman also in the city of Sderot who was delivering food to reservists. While we were speaking with her, we had sirens go off, Iron Dome intercepts right above us. And as we went into the shelter with her, I asked her, are you afraid? And she said, no. She said, when it's my time, it's my time. And that just gives you a sense of the other facet of this, the resilience of the people here and the sense of defiance in the face of what has really been a shock to the conscience here in Israel as this surprise Hamas attack unfolded over the weekend and we have seen continued barrages unfold. And, of course, as well, Israeli airstrikes bombarding the Gaza Strip, really pummeling the Gaza Strip, and we have seen the casualty toll in Gaza also rising.",

Those live pictures are now-- there's a siren. It looks like they're moving for cover right now inside a market.You can see where the strike had occurred. The camera is off that now, and also onlookers looking around cars that had shrapnel inside. Jeremy, to that point, both the very real and palpable fear but also the resilience, the unity tied to that resilience in a country that, at least, politically, had been fractured over the court of the last year-plus. That derives in part from the fact 300,000 reservists have been called up. Do we have a sense right now in terms of the preparations for what is an expected ground invasion at some point in the future?",

CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Yes, absolutely, Poppy. So, basically, Ashkelon is right here. That strike occurred right in the-- it looks like right in the city center of Ashkelon, which is a fairly large city in Southern Israel, South Central Israel. Jeremy is right about here, and that indicates that what you're seeing on the one side in Ashkelon is mirrored by stuff that is happening here in Gaza. So, you've got all kinds of activity going on here. And, clearly, this war is heating up at this particular point. You have got a lot of things happening, Iron Dome trying to intercept missiles as they approach Ashkelon, may have been successful with that. But you have got all kinds of things happening that indicate ground movement in addition to aerial movement, and that's complicating the picture at the moment.",

At least 20 Americans are currently unexpected for in Israel, according to the administration, though it's not clear they were all taken as hostages. We're learning more about some of them now. Adrienne Neta is 66. Her son says that he used to be a nurse and a midwife. Adrienne's daughter and son were on the phone with her when they heard attackers break into her home, and a scream, and then nothing. And 23-year-old Hersh Goldberg-Polin, we spoke to his parents. Hersh loves music festivals and was at the music festival on Saturday when Hamas began taking hostages. His parents told us they had heard he and a friend took grenades that landed in the shelter and threw them back out. He was badly injured.

That includes Americans who are missing, and it includes those Americans who we know, unfortunately, have been taken hostage by this brutal terrorist organization. What we have done over the past few days, the secretary of state has been on the phone since the early hours after this brutal attack to make clear to any leaders in the region once we knew that it did appear there were hostages who were taken, that if they have any lines of communication with Hamas, any leverage, any influence with Hamas, they need to use that influence to tell Hamas one very simple and clear message, release all of the hostages now. The other thing we have been doing, as the president said, is making hostage negotiation and hostage rescue experts from the United States government available for consultation with the Israeli government. That work is ongoing. And we will continue to pursue that work. It is our top priority to secure the release of these hostages.

Joining me now from Tel Aviv, IDF Spokesman, Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner. Colonel, thank you very much for joining us. And I want to begin with the pressing question on everyone's mind. As our colleagues see your troops amassing at the border, what is the status of what many expect to be a full-scale ground incursion of Gaza? LT. COL. PETER LERNER, SPOKESMAN, IDF:  Thank you very much. The main question is, how are we going to prevent Hamas from ever being able to attack us again. The tools that the IDF has is military force. As you can see, we are conducting airstrikes, targeting Hamas' capabilities, making sure that they are on the run and that they cannot manage another attack that like they did on Saturday, which has killed over 1,200 people, and that number keeps rising. So, I would say the IDF is prepared, and we will take all measures required in order to make sure that that can never end. We are currently continuing to amass our forces, not only on the border with Gaza, because we also need to be prepared for what potentially could happen from Lebanon.
