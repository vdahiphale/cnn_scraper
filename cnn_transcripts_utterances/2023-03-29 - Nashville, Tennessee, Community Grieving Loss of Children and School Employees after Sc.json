This is a significant win for the Special Counsel Jack Smith and a setback for Trump's legal team. On its face, what it means is that Pence must talk to investigators about conversations that he had with Trump leading up to that day. But the judge did say that Pence can still decline to answer some questions related to his actions on that day itself. January 6th. That's because he was serving as president of the Senate for the certification of the 2020 presidential election.But whether or not Pence will comply with this or maybe try to appeal this order remains to be seen.

Some of his advisors also speak regularly two members on Capitol Hill that includes Boris Ephsteyn, a senior Trump advisor, as well as Brian Jack, he is a former Trump administration campaign official.
