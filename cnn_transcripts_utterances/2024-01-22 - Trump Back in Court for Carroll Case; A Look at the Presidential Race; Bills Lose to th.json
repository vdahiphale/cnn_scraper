Carroll's lawyers are expected to rest soon. First, they may play that infamous \"Access Hollywood\" tape in court. They are also planning to present new evidence, including new posts on Trump's Truth Social, things he wrote even last week, like this one where Trump claims he never heard of Carroll before she brought the case.",

      "sentences": "Yes, good morning, Phil and Poppy.So, Donald Trump is expected to arrive just a short time from now at this courthouse, where he will be sitting in the same courtroom with E. Jean Carroll again. And what we expect today is that Carroll will call her final witness in this case, is her former boss at \"Elle\" magazine, where she wrote the \"Ask E. Jean\" advice column for nearly three decades. After that her lawyers are expected to play excerpts of Trump's videotaped deposition that we saw last year at the same trial where Trump is asked questions, including shown a photograph of Carroll and Trump at a charity event, and he mistakes her for his former wife, Marla Maples. So, we're expecting to see some of his videotape deposition while Trump will be in the room. He has reacted, the times he's been in the courtroom, to what's popped up on screens or to testimony. So, that is expected to be played. They also said they want to play some more of these out of court statements that Trump has made. Now, the question for this jury is not whether Trump has defamed Carroll. That was determined by a jury last year. The issue for them is, was Carroll harmed, and what kind of damages may Trump have to pay. And that is why they want to play these videotapes because they're showing that he has not stopped making statements that are defamatory, even after the jury reached their verdict last year. But once Carroll rests her case, then it will be Donald Trump's turn. Now he has said he - his lawyers said that they may want to call one of Carroll's friends. But the biggest question is, does Donald Trump take the stand today. And if he does, the judge has made it clear, Trump cannot say that he didn't rape Carroll, he can't call her a liar and he can't question her motivation. So, his testimony, if it happens, would be very limited. And as we saw last week, he has clashed with the judge, he has not wanted to abide by the orders. So, if he does take the stand, it is expected to be a pretty tense moment. Phil. Poppy.",

I had the greatest -- what the hell did I do? I got indicted more than Alphonse Capone. This is a political witch hunt the likes of which nobody's ever seen before. Well, I think it's very unfair when an opponent, a political opponent, is prosecuted by the DOJ, by Biden's DOJ. This is a witch hunt. And it's a very corrupt trial. It's very unfair.

A lot of this is how the Republican base gets its news. A lot of this is how the echo chamber that they are living in.But it is so interesting. All year long in Iowa, here in New Hampshire, other state, you did find a lot of Republicans who were eager to move on. There's no doubt that that exists out there. But he has coalesced the Republican base at least that they want a rematch. They want vindication for what he's been saying all along. So, now that this is a head-to-head race with Nikki Haley and Donald Trump, which she's been waiting for and calling for, is there enough time for one? We will see about that.

And, of course, there's also the fact that he's running on a past record, unlike Governor Haley who has been out of electoral politics for years now and as ambassador, you know, that was less of an electoral position in terms of economic policy and domestic policy as well.",
