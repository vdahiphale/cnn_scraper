Trump drawing some outrage after he mocks the president's stutter.A red line for Israel. President Biden calling for an end to violence in Gaza, but Prime Minister Netanyahu not backing down. And Republican Senator Katie Britt backtracking, trying to explain her much maligned response to President Biden's State of the Union. Right, it's 5:00 a.m. here in Washington, a live look at that beautiful Capitol Dome on this first Monday under Daylight Savings Time, it's a little darker for all of us early risers, good morning to you, I'm happy to have you with us, I'm Kasie Hunt.

But let's get first to politics because right now, Georgia is on a lot of minds. The state is going to play a pivotal role in deciding the nation's next president in November even though Donald Trump and President Biden have all but sealed their party's nominations. It did not stop them from campaigning at dueling rallies in this critical purple state less than a 100 miles apart, with Trump trying now to claim he wants to bring together voters from all parties. He was -- did it in his own unique way.

And that kind of gives you a sense of what the priorities are at sort of that middle to high level of what's next for this new RNC team that's coming in.

And that is that, President Biden answered the question saying that yes, an Israeli ground invasion of Rafah would be a red line for him, but he didn't identify precisely what, if any consequences there would actually be.Because he followed it up by saying, as you mentioned, that he would never cut Israel off of all weapons,   never leave them without an Iron Dome, anything like that. And so, clearly, none of that was perceived as any kind of a threat by the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who very swiftly yesterday, in this interview with \"Politico\" and the German outlet Bild, said that, that offensive in Rafah will press ahead. And this is despite plenty of countries in the international community warning that this would be a catastrophe, including some of Israel's closest allies. The United States, for its part, has said that any incursion of Gaza should not take place until there is a credible plan to evacuate the 1.3 or 1.5 Palestinians -- million, excuse me, Palestinians, who are currently sheltering in that area with really no safe place to go. And given the humanitarian crisis there, given the fact that people are on the brink of starvation and dehydration and malnutrition, you have people according to the Hamas-run Ministry of Health, who have died already of these really preventable things. And when it comes to aid, you know, this -- you know, these dueling interviews seemed to expose this rift that we've seen between President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu. When it comes to aid, the U.S. has continued to urge the Israelis to do more to get more aid in faster. That hasn't really happened though. And so, the U.S. is resorting to what should be pretty embarrassing air-dropping aid on a territory controlled by its closest ally as well. And one of the things --  to very quickly mention as well is, the U.S. has also been preaching for calm when it comes to the northern Israeli border with Lebanon, and even in this interview, Netanyahu didn't rule out the possibility of expanding military action on that front as well.
