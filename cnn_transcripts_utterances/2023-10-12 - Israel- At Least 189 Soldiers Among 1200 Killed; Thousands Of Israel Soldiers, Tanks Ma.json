It is 9At least 1100 people have been killed in Gaza since Saturday, according to the Palestinian health ministry. Hamas militants continue to fire rockets into southern Israel. The Israeli military says at least 189 soldiers are among the 1200 people killed in the terror attacks. And we are seeing more evidence that Israel may be planning a ground incursion into Gaza as tanks and troops are massing at the border. Now that comes as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and some of his political rivals have formed an emergency government and wartime cabinet. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, PRIME MINISTER OF ISRAEL (through translator): We are fighting a cruel enemy worse than ISIS. We saw girls and boys who were shot in the head, men and women who were burned alive. Young women raped. Fighters beheaded. BENNY GANTZ, NATIONAL UNITY PARTY LEADER (through translator): Our standing here together, shoulder to shoulder is a message to our enemies, and most importantly, a message to all citizens of Israel.

And he was talking about these waves of strikes being aimed at the Nakba Elite Forces of Hamas saying that they were looking at taking out a weapons, stashes and rocket launchers. And what he seemed to be saying is that from some of the interrogations of Hamas militants that they have been speaking with, they're getting more intelligence as to who was responsible.Who specifically was responsible for this terrorist attack on Israel which began in the early hours of Saturday morning. And then from that working out, who these people are, where these people are and where certain assets be it weapons or storage facilities or rocket launchers might be. And that I think is giving the IDF more targets to aim for. But of course, one of the big developments we also saw over the last 24 hours, as you said is that one of Hamas' successes has been to unite not just Israelis, but also Israeli politicians who have been bitterly divided of course over the last night last nine months, ever since Prime Minister Netanyahu and his government launched this judicial overhaul. So now we saw Benny Gantz, the leader of the Opposition National Unity Party agreeing to form an emergency government with Prime Minister Netanyahu ahead of a possible ground invasion.

The Israeli military finally regained control after days of intense gun battles. On Wednesday, journalists were allowed in to see the carnage. CNN's Clarissa Ward has our report and a warning the content is disturbing.

Surveillance footage shows them lying in wait until the car arrives. They shoot the driver and enter the compound. More poured in on motorcycles, eerily at ease and in no apparent hurry. Thomas Hand heard the gunshots and immediately thought of his eight-year-old daughter Emily who was staying with a neighbor. THOMAS HAND, KIBBUTZ BE'ERI RESIDENT: She doesn't do it very often.

Our Air Force is conducting these strikes against specific locations where we know they're hiding out, stockpiling weapons, using a staging ground or preparing to launch rockets towards Israel.

We're in a very different position at the moment, and a very different place. This is uncharted territory. Because if Israel wants to, as they say, eliminate Hamas, it's going to require a long campaign. Because I would assume that if they thought this was easy they would have done it in the past. And they haven't succeeded in doing that, including, because, as we keep hearing from Benjamin Netanyahu himself, in some ways, and the people around him, it suits Netanyahu to have Hamas there because they undermine, together, the idea of a two-state solution. So it's a convenient excuse for why Benjamin Netanyahu isn't talking to the Palestinians about a future Palestinian state, or making any concessions. But when it comes to the military planning, as I said, the challenge of preserving civilian life is massive. We're already seeing casualties mounting in Gaza. And then of course you have the issue of hostages, not only Israeli hostages but potentially American and many other nationalities. And I think that that's why the regional parties and international community are getting, very quickly, involved.
