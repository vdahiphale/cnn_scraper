Colorado is a deeply blue state.And unless every other state engages in this, which may -- a couple of them may, it's going to be Donald Trump versus Joe Biden in the end. And this will also help, by the way, to mobilize the Democratic base, who does see Donald Trump as -- and the election of Donald Trump as an extinction level threat for the future of our country.",

CNN's Joan Biskupic is breaking this down for us. Joan, we anticipated that they wanted the Supreme Court to weigh in on this. Not the filing that we anticipated.",

      "sentences": "No, no. This is right, Boris. And you were exactly right when I saw you an hour ago. You thought we would be getting it soon.But we knew, for this stage, Donald Trump's lawyers do not want the Supreme Court to weigh in at this point. They want it to go slower and have a federal appeals court hear it first. This response that we just got a few seconds ago, Boris and Brianna, is response to Special Counsel Jack Smith's request last week to the Supreme Court to intervene immediately. Special Counsel Jack Smith has said the question of whether a former president is immune from prosecution, from criminal prosecution for election subversion should be decided right now. It should not wait to be decided by a lower court and then the Supreme Court. He clearly wants an answer to this. He was looking, in fact, at March 4th, when the trial of former President Donald Trump was going to start. So now what we have is Donald Trump's response to that, saying, no, Supreme Court, do not intervene at this point, wait until you U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit actually hears it first. And then, in due course, let it go up to the Supreme Court for the immunity question to be decided. What we are probably going to see -- this really tees this case up as opposed to the Colorado one that I know you and Brianna have been speaking about all afternoon. This tees up the immunity question, which is a very important one, about whether Donald Trump will go to trial this spring, facing all the charges that the special counsel has brought about his election interference, including the events from January 6, 2021. What's going to happen next is that the Supreme Court will now tell us within, you know, maybe a couple of days, maybe another week -- I would hope it would be in a couple of days just so that we have some clarity here -- whether it will hear this case out of order. But because of its importance, hear this case, set a schedule, and be able to resolve the important, unprecedented constitutional questions of immunity from criminal prosecution for the former president of the United States.",

And this is so important. As the special counsel wrote in his initial filing last week, this is whether a former president is going to be held accountable for his actions arising from the 2020 election subversion. So it's a really important case question. And the judges will have to decide it no matter what, Brianna. The justices will have to answer that question at some point. So the question is, do they do it now at a point where they can resolve it, you know, and have enough time for a trial to occur before we get too deep into the 2024 election cycle, or will they insist that it go first to the appellate court, which is where it is now. So, first to the appellate court and then up to the Supreme Court. And if it goes right to the Supreme Court now, then we are going to have -- you know, it'll be resolved in the next couple of weeks. If it goes first to the appellate court, we won't have an answer to this perhaps for months.",

They help with his base because, frankly, his base believes that Joe Biden should be a little more aggressive in making the contrast of Donald Trump being a danger to our democracy.So Joe Biden commenting on how he believes, which the majority of the country believes, that he was aiding and abetting an insurrection, that's playing out in the courts. I don't think, and I don't think you will see him comment on either what the Supreme Court should do, what a decision would mean, or anything that, right now, is in front of the court. But I do think this is another opportunity for Joe Biden, generally speaking, to make the contrast between what a danger to democracy Donald Trump is and will be if he gets a second chance to get into the Oval Office. Through Donald Trump's own words, which I just mentioned as well, when he said he would be a dictator on day one. He has also laid out everything he would do if he gets another chance in the Oval Office. I think those kinds of contrasts, for President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, continue to make, I think that'll help in ensuring that his base knows that he is out there fighting. And then that is going to be a big, big reason for the contrast going into 2024.",

And how you hear from your sources, the White House is concerned about this. M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: You were just talking about that newest Consumer Confidence Index. And that's an interesting one. Because that is one that the White House watches closely and puts quite a lot of stock into. It's one of those data points that makes the White House feel hopeful that the outlook on the economy has been improving and will continue to improve. But the reality right now, of course, is that the public outlook on the economy is not great. And we see the president taking a hit for it. If you look at the most recent CNN poll, the majority of Americans, 67 percent, saying that they disapprove of the president's handling of the economy. And it's why we are seeing the president travel to a place like Milwaukee and try to sell his economic record overall, basically saying, here are all the ways in which the economy is better off under Democrats.

And while that's not anywhere near the jump that we have seen for things like Ozempic and Wegovy, it does show that more patients are seeking out weight loss treatment at the doctor's office.

But then she said she lost access. She said, in the following three months, she gained back about 80 percent of the weight that she had lost. She was really alarmed by that pace in weight gain. So she and her doctor decided to start her on Bupropion. And she said that halted the weight gain. Although now there is a new drug available in that new class, Zepbound. She's been able to get access to that and she's trying that one. Look, guys, it can be a real journey, a real rollercoaster for a lot of patients. And it is incredibly frustrating.",
