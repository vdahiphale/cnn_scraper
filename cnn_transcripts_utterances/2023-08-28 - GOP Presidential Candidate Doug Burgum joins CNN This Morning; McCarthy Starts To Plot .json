How many months, six months before we had sanctions on oil and gas? And then when, you know -- in the meantime, Russia makes a bunch of money, then we put sanctions on.

If you're going to have a negotiation with China, the first thing on the table is energy.And instead, we've got an energy policy in this country that I think was written by China, because we're trying to kill the U.S. energy industry, moved all EVs, and then buy all our batteries from China. Are -- if we're trying to strategically decouple, then why do we have an energy policy -- which is not good for the environment, because China's making those batteries by tearing up the whole planet in the Congo, in Indonesia, and then they're building them in factories that are powered by coal, because they're opening a coal plant every two weeks in China.",

But there is no constitutional requirement that they actually need to have a floor vote.And because, as you mentioned, Kevin McCarthy doesn't actually have the votes right now, amongst this conference. There's a lot of moderates and vulnerable Republicans who are still skeptical of this whole idea. They are contemplating just skipping that floor vote altogether. And that would spare moderates from having to take a tough vote, while allowing them to start to get the ball rolling on the impeachment process, and hopefully, in their minds, give them more time to actually get some evidence for these allegations that they have yet to prove about President Joe Biden and his son's foreign business dealings. And not to mention, Phil, McCarthy is under enormous pressure from his right flank and from Donald Trump to show that he is taking action here and that he is moving forward on this process. And so I'm told he has spent some of the August recess telling former Republican -- current Republicans that he is really serious about an impeachment inquiry and strategizing about how to do that this fall, Phil.",

A lot of that comes due in the next couple of years.So just as a business, they were already struggling. Then I think a lot of that's outweighed by the sheer extent of liabilities that they could face tied to the opioid crisis. According to the Wall Street Journal's reporting, we're talking about 1,000 plus federal lawsuits that have all been consolidated in Ohio. They've got a somber -- a similar number of state based lawsuits and then a civil case that the Department of Justice hit them with just this year. What chapter 11 bankruptcy allows them to do is buy breathing room. It allows the pharmacies continue to run as a business, but that they can consolidate the debts and that includes debts that they don't even know they have yet, aka potential legal costs and opioid lawsuits, battle them all out together, find some kind of resolution. They don't know what those liabilities, the scale of those are going to be. But this suggestion in this report is that they're going to be treated as unsecured debt. So the hope is that in a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding, these people eventually if they do settle, will be able to get some of their money and the business will be able to continue to go as an ongoing concern. The company at this stage not confirmed anything so it's an open guest. But when you look at the financials of the business, it figures.",
