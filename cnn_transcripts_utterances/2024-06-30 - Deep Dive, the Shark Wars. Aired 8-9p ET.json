These apex predators have reputation for attacking all sorts of marine life, which sometimes includes the occasional human. But are sharks a danger to people or are people a danger to sharks? According to scientists, more than one-third of shark species are at risk of extinction, mostly due to overfishing. Some fishermen in the U.S. argue that sharks are coming out in greater numbers than ever stealing their catch and making it harder for them to earn a living. CNN's Boris Sanchez is an experienced diver, and over the next hour he takes us under water with sharks to show us both the beauty and danger of these creatures. We want to warn you some of the images you'll see in this hour may be disturbing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN ANCHOR (voice-over): Below the surface at Tiger Beach, you're supposed to steady your breath, limit your movement, and keep your head on a swivel. There are shadows lurking, ancient predators with remorseless eyes, and staggered rows of razor-sharp teeth, circling closer. Jagged silhouettes that hold a lethal reputation. A beast that inspires dread and awe. KARYL BREWSTER-GEISZ, NOAA FISHERIES RULEMAKING BRANCH CHIEF: They are such fascinating, iconic creatures. DR.
