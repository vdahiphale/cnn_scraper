Just ahead, the U.S. is expected to approve a new military aid package to Ukraine that will include the controversial cluster bombs. But rights groups are urging the Biden administration to stop that plan.Then Sudan gets a first-hand look at the camp, Wagner fighters will be located in if they went to Belarus. We will show you what the tour uncovered though with Matthew. Plus, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is in Beijing for the high stakes meetings in an attempt to improve relations between the world's two largest economies. United Nations is providing grim statistics on the civilian toll in Ukraine as the country prepares to mark 500 days since the start of Russia's full scale invasion. The U.N. confirms more than 9000 civilians have been killed, and more than 500 of them children. It comes as the death toll from the recent Russian strike in Lviv rises to 10. Ukraine says it's ending its search and rescue operation in that Western city located pretty far from the front lines. And CNN's Ben Wedeman has just traveled to the frontline in Bakhmut. He joins us live from Eastern Ukraine. What did you see though what progress of the Ukrainians making?",

Now, they'd say they don't specify where it is. But in the same statement, they say that they've taken ground in the south and the north. It appears that they continue to pursue this strategic goal of encircling the city. And now when we were speaking with artillery units, one unit told us they firing 50 to 60 rounds a day into Russian lines. And the focus is really on the trenches around the city that are very deeply dug. And there are a lot of troops around there with the Ukrainians estimate as many as 50,000 Russian troops are in and around Bakhmut. But what I can tell you, just from the accounts we heard from Russian POWs, we spoke to. It sounds like there have gotten a lot of men there a lot of troops. But they're poorly supplied, poorly equipped and poorly led as well. So the situations for the Russian seems to be deteriorating, fairly drag, gradually, but nonetheless, noticeably from the perspective of those who are closest to the fighting, Max.",

That's according to defense officials. They tell CNN changing battlefield conditions inside Ukraine over the past two weeks prompted by the administration to seriously consider giving the controversial weapons to Kyiv.The U.S. has a stockpile of cluster munitions that it no longer uses are to facing them out in 2016. We'll have more on these weapons their potential impact and why more than 100 countries around the world have banned them, coming up shortly. Now CNN has just visited a site in Belarus where the country's President says Wagner fighters could be housed. Should they take up Belarus his offer to move there?

And we saw the success of that sort of mediator position last summer.When Turkey alongside the United Nations managed to broker this grain deal between delegations from both Russia and Ukraine and this was a landmark agreement. Of course, we know that there are many countries that are desperately dependent on those grain and fertilizer exports from Ukraine. And its thanks that deal, that there was the decision to actually go ahead with this and contend to alleviate the food security crisis that we saw last summer. But of course, there is a huge amount of concern because that deal is set to expire in 10 days they've already extended it a little bit. It was actually set to expire back in May. And the hope today is that discussions between President Erdogan and President Zelenskyy could lend themselves to potentially easing tensions around the potential renewal of this deal. But of course, those tensions are originating from Moscow we heard earlier in the week from the Russian Foreign Ministry, raising questions around who this deal is benefiting, whether it's benefiting those countries most in need. Or in the words of the Russian Foreign Ministry, whether it's benefiting well fed countries, namely Ukraine's Western allies. But of course, as you mentioned that the Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov spoke to journalists earlier today. He did say that the Kremlin will be closely following this meeting between Zelenskyy and President Erdogan. He also thanked and commended President Erdogan for the mediator position that he has taken on over the course of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and also noted that there is a talk around a potential meeting between President Erdogan and President Putin at once again, although no official announcement or date has been revealed yet.",

The meeting featured some of the most radical ideas about ways of overturning the election, including declaring martial law and seizing voting machines.Multiple sources tell CNN that the special counsel investigating Trump has called numerous witnesses before a grand jury to talk about what happened in that meeting.

And this was a meeting where people from outside of the White House, outside of the Trump administration, not government employees had the ear of the President.And we're trying to convince him to do things, that some of which he very likely was not able to do legally such as seizing voting machines. There was also an idea of him potentially appointing someone as a special counsel to investigate election fraud. And they were trying to convince him that there were votes that were switched by computers in the 2020 election. That of course, did not happen. And people in the administration, including the Attorney General, at the time, Bill Barr, as well as his White House Counsel, other top figures, were saying quite publicly, and to Donald Trump himself, you can't do these things, and there was not fraud, and that this is not the route to go to be listening to these outsiders. Now the outsiders in this were people like Sidney Powell, the lawyer who had represented his Former National Security Adviser, and then Trump himself and his campaign, Michael Flynn, the person that Sidney Powell had advised when he was under criminal investigation. He had come back into the fold talking to Trump and then a CEO named Patrick Byrne, who believed in election fraud as well. They were the ones that got into the White House, and that were opposed to the people in the administration floating these ideas. And so what we are learning now is that the prosecutors from the Justice Department investigating Donald Trump and others after the 2020 election. They are focused and making sure they understand this particular meeting on December 18 of 2020. Very clearly, they are asking lots of people about it. They have focused on it even in recent days. And in particular, they've talked to Rudy Giuliani about it, one of the other outsiders, advising Trump at that time that was insistent that there was fraud in the election as well. He wasn't in this camp, but he was there on the premises at the White House and just recently sat for voluntary interviews over two days with criminal investigators.",

Today, the Biden administration is expected to announce a new military aid package to Ukraine that will include for the first time cluster munitions, also called cluster bombs. They're canisters film filled with smaller bombs that can be dropped from the air and released across a wide area.They pose a major threat to civilians not only at the moment of the attack, but also long afterwards because they pollute the battlefields with unexploded munitions. These weapons have been banned in more than 120 countries under 2008 convention but Russia, Ukraine and the U.S. declined to sign that treaty. Both Ukrainians and Russian forces have been using cluster munitions since the war actually began. For more on this CNN's U.S. National Security Reporter, Natasha Bertrand joins us from the Pentagon. I mean, they're very effective, aren't they, if nothing else and they will be useful to the Ukrainians to clear the Russian trenches?",

And in recent days, U.S. officials have started making it too, Max, the Biden administration has been debating whether to provide the Ukrainians with these cluster munitions for several months now.The Ukrainians have been asking for them because they say the Russians are using them. And therefore they also have the right to use them. And they are running low on ammunition. So these cluster munitions could really help them prosecute their counter offensive against the Russians. Now, the reason why the Biden administration has only recently come around to this is because the counter offensive has not been going as quickly as Western officials had believed it would by this point. And they believe that by providing them with these cluster munitions, they could allow the Ukrainians to make more progress against the Russians. And importantly, fill that potential gap that the Ukrainians are experiencing in artillery ammunition, because the counter offensive has been going so slowly. The Ukrainians have been using a large amount of this artillery ammunition. And it is not clear if that is sustainable without these cluster munitions that the U.S. has sitting in its stockpiles. So the U.S. now saying that they are preparing to provide these munitions to Ukraine, we are expecting an announcement on that as soon as this morning. And it is a big turnaround for the Biden administration, which was so concerned previously, about the risks that these could post to civilians, and importantly, the fact that they're banned by over 100 countries, including some key U.S. allies, Max.",
