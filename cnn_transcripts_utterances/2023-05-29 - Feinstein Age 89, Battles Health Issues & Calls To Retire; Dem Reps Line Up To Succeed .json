The 89-year-old California Democrat is vowing to stay in office through her term despite being combined to a wheelchair as she recovers from a series of health issues.Now The New York Times reporting, \"Since returning to Washington, Feinstein has missed six votes and has not participated in any committee hearings or caucus lunches\". And The Washington Post speaking to divided California Democratic delegates over the weekend. This is from one, from Rosemarie Willimann, \"She's just following orders as best she can at this point. She's not herself\". Marsha Conant, on the other hand, said, \"It's extraordinary, her career, and I think that's getting minimized, and that makes me angry\". Now, Feinstein's issues have been happening for some time. She just suffered shingles and related issues with it after she came back. She didn't deny she had broader health complications, and then she did have broader health complications, as we reported on May 9th. But she also had memory issues that she suffered for some time. She was pushed aside as the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee. She passed up being the president pro tem, which is for the most senior member of the majority party. Patty Murray now has that. So these are issues that have been -- that she's been dealing with for some time. Can she sustain this? TIA MITCHELL, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, ATLANTA JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION: So I think there are two things at play, and unfortunately, the politics is one of them and we can't ignore that. We can't ignore that she has -- even though, she's no longer the top Democrat on Judiciary, she's a crucial deciding vote on that very important committee, especially in this divided government, where so much of what Democrats can accomplish is focused on confirming judges and other Biden appointees. So I think Democrats need Feinstein, and there will create a lot of headaches if she were to step down. Governor Newsom doesn't want the headache that would be --",
