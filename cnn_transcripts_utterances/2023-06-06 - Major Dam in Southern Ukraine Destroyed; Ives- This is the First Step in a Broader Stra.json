And just ahead on today's show Moscow and Kyivtrading blame for the destruction of a large dam in Russian held Southern Ukraine with hundreds forced to evacuate due to flooding and new fears over Ukraine's massive nuclear power plant with the very latest just ahead. Plus Prince Harry versus the tabloids, the Duke of Sussex testifying against the \"Mirror Newspaper Group\" in London's High Court, accusing reporters of phone hacking and illegal surveillance. And VisionPRO ready to go Apple unveiling the long awaited mixed reality headset. Its first major product launch and yours many calling it the dawn of a new computing age. But what about that hefty price tag we will discuss with tech investor Dan Ives. And turning to the global markets U.S. futures a bit weaker after Monday's modest pullback the S&amp;P 500 coming very close to finishing the day in bull market territory or 20 percent rise from recent lows. Europe trading mostly lowers as well. And mostly downbeat close in Asia the Australian Central Bank, surprising investors with an unexpected quarter of a percent rate hikes that drag the market lower. And China reports say that Beijing is asking its big banks to cut deposit rates to try to jumpstart growth. Meantime the Ukraine dam collapse impacting commodity markets the price of wheat currently up more than 2 percent on fears that flooding in the region will affect supply. And let's get the latest from Ukraine now. That's where we begin the show. It's not clear at this moment what caused the destruction of the dam in the Russian controlled area. Ukraine claims that the Russian military blew up the dam and \"Panic\". But the Kremlin says it was a sabotage attack by Ukrainian forces. Downstream people are getting out of their homes as floodwaters rise. A reservoir upstream from the dam supplies water for the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. The UN nuclear watchdog IAEA says there's no immediate threat to the plant. But of course, lots more watch here. So let's bring in Clare Sebastian. She joins us now. So Clare, what more do we know about the cause of the attack because as I said, Kyiv blames Moscow. Moscow blames Kyiv what more can you tell us?",

Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin Spokesman said just a little earlier that this was done by Ukraine, because as he said, having launched their large scale offensive two days ago, of course, that hasn't been confirmed by Ukraine. Now the Ukrainian Armed Forces are not achieving their goals. It also accused them of trying to choke off the water to Crimea, because of course, that reservoir just upstream of the dam supplies water to the Crimean peninsula. The Ukrainians though are of course, saying this is a terrorist attack by Russia, the Foreign Minister calling this deliberate and long planned and the Head of the Presidential Administration saying this is Ecocide a reference to the potential environmental damage of this. What we do know for sure, is that the flooding is now increasingly widespread. We understand the water levels are still rising, the Ukrainian Interior Minister just in the last hour or so saying 24 settlements are flooded, they have evacuated over 1000 people. And we know that evacuations are happening on the Russian side as well. This is a dam that straddles the Dnieper River, which in itself is basically the front line in this conflict, Russian controlled territory to one side Ukrainian controlled territory to the other. So it is very much on the front line here. And both sides are affected by this flooding.",

And this is why Ukraine allegedly did this. The Head of the Joint Forces of the Ukrainian Army, though did reference the counter offensive as well and said, look, this isn't going to affect us, because we are already essentially modeled for Russia doing something like this back in the autumn. President Zelenskyy himself had said that Russia had mined the dam and might be considering blowing it up. So it was already something that they were looking at with some concern. I think if you look at the map of where this is, you could potentially say that it might complicate the any Ukrainian effort to cross that Dnieper River, potentially towards Crimea, or the Sea of Azov. It might take attention away from other areas of the frontline where we know that attacks have been intensifying. But as of now, Ukraine is saying that it's not going to affect their plans.",

Now Prince Harry has given his witness statement a 50 page document detailing the impact the British tabloids under \"Mirror Newspaper Group\" have had on his life for those that have those around him. He spoken about the details revealed in media publications, including of course, the tabloids, which he says should the telltale signs of unlawful information gathering. We're talking about phone hacking about the interception of Prince Harry's voicemails and the voicemails of those around him as well as the use of private investigators to glean information not only about his life, but that of his late mother, Princess Diana. Now he's gone into detail around the impact this has had he said it caused him to feel a huge amount of paranoia growing up it caused his circle of friends to become smaller and smaller and also caused him to suffer from bouts of depression. And he's spoken about the details that have been revealed in some of these articles. A number of them have been submitted as part of his claim by his lawyers, including private intimate details around conversations he had with his brother William, the Prince of Wales in the past, as well as the ups and downs of his past relationship with former girlfriend Chelsy Davy. Details which he said eventually led to the breakdown of their relationship. He's spoken of course very recently about how this has impacted his family including his wife, Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex and children. It was a big reason as to why they chose to withdraw from their positions as senior members of the Royal Family and to relocate their family from the United Kingdom to California. But this is a deeply personal matter for the Prince. He says that he wants to hold those responsible to account to transform the media landscape here in Britain, particularly, of course, over the death of his mother, which he's feels was deeply influenced and impacted by the tabloids, who have been, of course highly interested in the ins and outs of the British Royal Family's life Rahel.",

VisionPRO a mixed reality headset sits atop your head like a ski goggle. Now you might know a virtual reality a full screen that blocks everything out. This is mixed reality a combination of the real world and the virtual world overlaid on one another that Apple is banking on being the future of computing. Now, what does it do? That is the big question. Apple showed a video which had a desk with different workstations with different screens that you can adjust. They showed a home cinema with a TV screen as big as you want. But the big question though, is will people spend $3,500 on it especially when its closest competitor Metis Oculus is only around $300. Well, Tim Cook and Apple say that they've cracked the code on a device they're calling historic. There'll be available in stores early next year Jon Sarlin, CNN, Cupertino California.

If you live in the United States, and you're a day trader, you're not allowed to trade a crypto derivative that's just against the law. And the platforms who are selling these derivatives are supposed to register with the SEC or the CFTC if they're going to offer these products in the United States. And none of those companies have registered with these entities. So they don't have a license. It's really, it's big for crypto. I mean, they are in a transition point where they're trying to gain mainstream authenticity and mainstream adoption. And that's really hard when these regulators haven't like the crypto industry says they haven't provided enough clarity for them to register and to do it the right way. Of course, this is all going to get worked out in settlements that we'll see over the next months and years. But bottom line, this is not a good look for crypto six to seven months after one of the biggest implosions in the industry.
