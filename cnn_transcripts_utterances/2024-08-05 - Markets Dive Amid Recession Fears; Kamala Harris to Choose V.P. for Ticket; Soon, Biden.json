So, Julia, what's your analysis of what we're seeing this afternoon? JULIA CHATTERLY, CNN BUSINESS ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT:  Okay. So, I think it's an ugly day. You're using the right word. There's a palpable fear globally. As important as the U.S. economy is and the data, the jobs data that we got on Friday, it's also important for our viewers to understand that this is not the only thing going on. We've seen for now a number of days, tech stocks, which have been the big strength in this market, coming down. Those stock prices have been coming down. So, that's been wobbling. Then you can add in the fact that this is summer time. There's a lot of investors that aren't there. So, it makes people concerned and it makes markets more choppy. Then what we saw overnight, the Japanese stock market fell 12 percent. You don't see a big market in the world falling 12 percent without seeing some kind of payback in U.S. stocks. So, we're seeing that, too. I think the important thing to note today is we're off the lows, which is a good sign. And the silver lining for borrowers out there across America that are watching this is the conversation has changed on the U.S. economy. We're no longer asking if the Federal Reserve will cut rates in September. It's by how much. And we're already seeing mortgage rates coming down as well. So, some of this concern is having positive effects, but I do understand the fear, but I think we have to keep calm and just watch this. This is not panic. This is fear.",

But remember, this economy is still adding jobs overall. It's weakening, but we're not at the point where we should be talking about recession. So, again, it's a concern, but I do think people need to keep calm. And, you know, Julia, you touched on it a little bit, but obviously there was a lot of concern and what ended up being, I think, maybe rightful criticism, in some respects, about the Fed not cutting interest rates last month, or I guess last week when they had the opportunity.

Quite frankly, that idiocy and I think that's fear mongering and we should avoid it. However, what we are seeing is important for the White House. We know that this White House has been given relatively little, if any, credit when the economy was solid. And now it's slowing.

Tomorrow, Harris and her V.P. pick are set to launch a week-long campaign tour across seven key battleground states, starting in Pennsylvania. But you got to name your V.P. pick before then. So, we'll see.CNN's M.J. Lee is in Philadelphia, where Harris will introduce her new running mate. So, M.J., where do things stand right now? M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, we are standing by here in Philadelphia, where tomorrow night, as you said, the vice president and her future running mate will hold their first political rally together as a joint ticket of the 2024 cycle. Sometime before then, of course, the Harris campaign will have to unveil that decision, arguably the most important political decision that the vice president has had to make so far. I am told that even as of this morning, the vice president had not yet made that decision. It is expected to come sometime later today, at which point she would, of course, inform a small team of advisers and, of course, make that phone call to her chosen running mate. But we are being cautioned that this is a fluid situation and this is ultimately her decision and hers to make alone and that that decision timeline could ultimately slip to tomorrow. Now, yesterday, as you said, the vice president was in Washington, D.C. and met in person with at least three of the finalists, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, and Arizona Senator Mark Kelly. Based on all of our reporting, it would be very shocking if that ultimate choice did not end up being one of those three. And we know that the two biggest questions that the vice president has been making throughout this process have been who can actually help her win and who can be a helpful governing partner for her. Now, after tomorrow night, that rally in Philadelphia here, the two are going to hit the ground running, traveling to some seven cities and five different battleground states. When we are actually going to find out, this decision is really anybody's guess, but we do know that the campaign is obviously trying to keep this decision when it comes tightly under wraps. The hope is that they're going to be able to keep this from getting out into the public until that Philadelphia rally, and the model would likely be what we saw some four years ago when President Biden revealed that he was choosing Kamala Harris as his vice presidential running choice with an online message. So, that is the model that we expect to see again sometime in the next 24 hours or so. Of course, this has been a sprint of a transformation for Vice President Harris over the last 15 days, and she is trying to keep that momentum up with this expected decision and news.",

He's a former Democratic state representative in South Carolina.

As Bakari points out, you know, vice presidents don't really ever make a huge difference, but they do give you a half a percent bounce generally, maybe 1 percent bounce. And that may be all that's needed in Pennsylvania to put her over the top, if she does pick Josh Shapiro.Look, Mark Kelly, war hero, a decorated combat veteran you know, Navy carrier pilot, astronaut, Walz speaks to the progressive base. I mean, I can make the case for and against all three of these gentlemen to be on the ticket. But, you know, Brianna, I am hoping that we get past this pick and we can start talking about the things that matter to Americans, like inflation and crime. I just noted what a good friend of mine sent me a thing this morning about -- it is kind of interesting, the Denny's Grand Slam breakfast. In 1977, the Denny's introduced the Grand Slam breakfast in honor of Hank Aaron. It was $1.99 in 43 years, it went up $4 in price. And in the four years of the Biden-Harris administration, it's gone up $7, $5.99 to $12.99. Those are the things that matter to Pennsylvanians. You go to soccer with your kids. You can't go to Denny's afterwards because it cost $50 now as opposed to $10. Inflation is going to be foremost of people's mind, the border. So, I want to get past this irrational exuberance, as our friend David Axelrod says, and let's start talking about the issues that matter to Pennsylvanians and let's hear from the campaigns about what they're going to do to make people's lives better. I want to hear a debate on the merits.",

It's not irrational. It's something that she cultivated. It's here as present. And a lot of that has to do with this simple fact, and I think that David would probably agree with me. This week, we just owned the news because of the simple fact that she's going to announce the vice president. And then she's going to hit seven different swing states. On the schedule this week for Donald Trump, today, he is with streamer sensation Aiden Ross down at Mar-a-Lago. And then he has one event in the swing state of Montana. I'm saying that facetiously. And so while Kamala Harris is hitting every single swing state, talking to voters, meeting the voters where they are, Donald Trump, I'm afraid of showing the fact that he's 78 years old and may not be up to the task of --",

President Biden is on his way back to the White House, where the Biden administration writ large is bracing for the potential for retaliatory strikes on Israel after those attacks last week shook the already fragile status quo in the region.Now, that high-stakes national security meeting will take place in the Situation Room in just about an hour's time, but it's a departure from the norm that the White House chose to disclose it so far in advance. That puts the world on high alert, that the West is very closely monitoring the situation and preparing its potential response. It also serves to telegraph publicly the role of Vice President Kamala Harris at President Biden's right hand in discussing these very developments and crafting the U.S.'s response. Now, just a few months ago, when the U.S. was evaluating the retaliatory strikes by Iran on Israel back then, the White House disclosed that Situation Room meeting nearly concurrently as it was happening, as well as the participants in this meeting, which just goes to show you how much of a departure it is for the White House to have laid this out. But it also comes as, at least one source believes, that those strikes from Iran could come as soon as today or tomorrow, and there was a very real near term risk of an intensifying violence in the region. And it also comes after a President Biden and his top deputies have had a series of very tense calls in recent days. Yesterday, President Biden spoke with Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and a source described that call as incredibly fraught, as the two leaders discussed the potentially dimmer prospect for a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. And then today, President Biden spoke with King Abdullah of Jordan, where they discussed the need to de-escalate tensions, Omar, but, certainly, the situation has only intensified in recent days, as the U.S. and the west at large are on high alert.

So, what are the assets that the U.S. already has in the region and how are they preparing?COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Yes, Brianna, there is a lot going on in this department. First of all, the USS Abraham Lincoln, this aircraft carrier, and the Associated Carrier Battle Group, are steaming into the Persian Gulf and -- excuse me into the Mediterranean and other assets are in the Persian Gulf as well as other places. You've got the USS Wasp. You also have destroyers and cruisers, about 11 of them, that are capable of ballistic missile defense and also offensive missile capabilities, plus a squadron of F- 22. So, what they're going to do is they're going to be parking themselves in places like this, off the Israeli and Lebanese coasts, potentially in the Red Sea, because of Yemen and the Houthis down there, and, of course, here in the Persian Gulf. And that, of course, impacts Iran. Plus, there are other assets, right, that we could look at, for example, in Qatar, where potentially the extra squadron of F-22s would be based, or the UAE where something similar could happen there.

Of the 16 that the American Enterprise Institute and the Institute for the Study of War analyzed, you had basically about two that were destroyed, just two, degraded, nine of them that you see here, mainly in the north and a little bit in the center.But then you look at this, five or combat effective. The fact that these units are combat effective now means that they can do stuff against the Israelis, whether in Gaza or even outside of Gaza. And seven of these units, maybe not as effective as the others, are totally reconstituted now. So, this means that Hamas, is able to re-grow itself, it can do things that you would not expect it to do.
