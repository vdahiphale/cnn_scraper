      "sentences": "Hurricane Milton may be over, but the state of Florida is still reeling from some of the impacts. When you lookat the scope of the video, this shows all of that water. The concern here is that that water takes time to recede. So in a lot of these instances, that water has nowhere to go. This is a look at where the heaviest rain was across the state of Florida. That white line indicating where the storm itself, Milton, crossed over the state. The heaviest rain being on the north side. You can see that widespread swath of pink color indicating at least 10 inches of rain across a very wide swath of the state. Now here`s a look at river flooding. All of those purple squares and purple dots that you see there on the screen, those are river gauges that are still at or above major flood stage. Now two specific rivers to talk about. Many of them on the western coast of Florida have finally crested and are going to start going down in the coming days. But it`s quite a different story for some of the rivers on the eastern half of the state that are still going up. So here`s a look at one of those rivers on the western side. You can see again really starting to go back down now and expected to finally get below major flood stage very early Monday morning. On the eastern half of the state though, quite a different story. This specific river, the St. Johns, this one is not expected to crest reaching its peak until very late in the day on Wednesday. So those rivers are still going to continue to swell and cause flooding in those local communities until we reach that point. Part of the problem that Florida has is that Florida is an incredibly flat state. So the rivers do not recede very quickly like they would say in a mountainous terrain. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The demo mission maneuvered the 232-foot-tall rocket booster called a Super Heavy to a massive landing structure after it burned through most of its fuel and broke away from the upper Starship spacecraft. It was successfully caught mid-air with a pair of massive metal pincers that SpaceX calls chopsticks. Recovering and rapidly reflying Super Heavy boosters and Starship spacecraft for future missions is a feat that SpaceX is testing as the company considers quickly reusing rocket parts essential to efficiently getting cargo to space. Pop quiz hot shot! What is the fastest animal found in the world? Pronghorn antelope, peregrine falcon, cheetah, or marlin? Ding ding ding! If you said peregrine falcon, you are correct, which has a diving speed of over 200 miles per hour. The peregrine falcon can be found on every continent except Antarctica, and they were commonly found in the U.S. until the apex predator became severely endangered several decades ago. Now, a U.S.-based conservation group has brought the falcon back from the brink of extinction. Take a look at how they were able to save the species and the wild steps they take to keep tabs on them. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This is Bluff Country, an area in the Midwest U.S. along the Mississippi River known for its steep cliffs and rugged landscape. Part of the Mississippi Flyway, one of the largest North American bird migration routes, it`s also where one particular keystone species had almost vanished.",
