This is from John Favreau, who of course, was speech writer in the Obama White House. He says the president doesn't get credit for being privately enraged while he still refuses to use leverage to stop the IDF from killing and starving innocent people. These stories only make him look weak. I can't imagine that's being perceived terribly well among Biden colleagues. It's a little bit of a shot across the bow.",

He does need to continue to show it. But look, this is an incredibly complicated and challenging situation. And adjusting American weapons assistance to Israel has significant consequences throughout the region. I mean, Israel is our ally and signaling to those in the region who are not our allies that it's open season is a dangerous thing. It's complicated. So no question, tensions are high. Emotions are high. They should be. What we witnessed, what we have been witnessing is horrific. It is complicated. But you know, I think for Biden ultimately, is he going to have to -- is there going to have to be some policy adjustment here? I suspect that there probably is. But I think that that has to happen in the larger context of what that is going to mean for the united states. What that's going to mean for the region. And even though it's hard in the moment, I don't think that can happen purely as an emotional reaction, even to an incredibly horrific thing like we saw earlier this week.",

And I think it's part of what has crystallized this as just potentially a major turning point.DAVID FRUM, STAFF WRITER, \"THE ATLANTIC\": Well, Chef Jose Andres is a noble and compassionate man. The World Central Kitchen does amazing work, and people are looking for charity to support that does work all over the world, you can't do better than World Central Kitchen. Israel faces an enemy that uses ambulances to move terrorists. Many of the people kidnapped on October 7 who have emerged have reported being transported in ambulances. Israeli faces an enemy that has recruited international organizations as allies in all but name. At least a dozen U.N. employees were actively involved in the October 7 attack. Hundreds are complicit. Thousands of families in Gaza that are terrorist families, that have a terrorist as a breadwinner, are employed by the United Nations. And so Israel faces a problem where how -- the enemy also has obligations to laws of war. It has obligations not to use hospitals as -- as headquarters, but it does. It has obligations not to use ambulances to move its troops or to move kidnap people. But it does. So in this very treacherous environment, against this unscrupulous enemy, people are going -- trying to prevent friendly fire incidents, to protect Israel's own troops. Israel is going to make mistakes from time to time. And this one looks like an absolutely harrowing one. It's really important for people as they consume the news fast to remember how many of the stories we've heard since October 7 have turned out to be very different from what you first hear. You hear that Israel bombed a hospital and that hundreds are dead. Well, then it turns out it was a Hamas rocket that fell on the hospital and not hundreds, but dozens or dead. You hear stories that the U.N. denies any of its employees were working for Hamas. Well, maybe one or two. OK, Maybe a dozen. OK, Maybe hundreds, maybe thousands of families. So this is a harrowing situation. It's a terrible war and the -- it achieves nothing. And the only way out is for Hamas to be defeated and to go away. And if Hamas had never done this thing on October 7, then all the people -- Palestinian, Israeli, and the heroic workers for World Central Kitchen -- they would all be alive.",

But also, the officials themselves really didn't know, some of them hours before they were leaving Washington, D.C., that they were heading into Afghanistan to be part of this evacuation effort. They had incredibly important roles. And they talk about the situation on the ground, according to one of those State Department officials, changing minute by minute. They also talk about the fact that they weren't really following any actual plan here. There was a NEO that was created. That's a non- evacuation -- noncombat evacuation plan. Officials said that was created in, you know, April or May. But they said when they got on the ground, there effectively wasn't one of those in operation. They were creating that plan on the fly by themselves, trying to figure out how to get these Americans and these Afghans who had worked with the U.S. for the last two decades, out of the country, while we saw that tumult, that chaos around the actual Kabul airport.",

They don't want to expand the war. In Israel, they want to support Israel against Hamas, but they don't want to have bad things appear on television.

Also on this question of a NEO, you know, announcing a NEO three months before you leave signals to the entirety of the world that you have no confidence in the Afghan government. So it was -- it was a chicken and an egg situation that was challenging. We, you know, certainly didn't want to be in a situation like we wound up in, with people crashing the gates and crashing the planes. But you also can't, three months ahead of the departure, signal to the world, we're rushing people out of the country, because we have no faith that the government is going to stand when we go.
