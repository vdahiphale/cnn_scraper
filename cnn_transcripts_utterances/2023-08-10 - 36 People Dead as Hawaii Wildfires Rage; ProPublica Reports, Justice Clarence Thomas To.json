      "sentences": "Yes. Good morning, Poppy. An astonishing series of events yesterday, the suspect was under federal investigation for allegedly making these threats against President Biden and, as you mentioned, a host of other prominent Democratic officials.Now, prior to the President's arrival in Utah yesterday, the FBI secured an arrest warrant. They go to the suspect's home in an attempt to take him into custody. I'm told from a law enforcement source that as the SWAT Team was giving him commands, the suspect then brandished a weapon towards those agents, a fatal decision. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CAMPBELL (voice over):  As President Joe Biden was heading to Utah on Wednesday evening, FBI special agents tried to arrest a Utah man they said was making threats against the president. When they arrived at his residence in the early hours Wednesday, FBI SWAT agents said he pointed a gun at them while they were giving him commands.",

Alvin Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney, was one of those prosecutors Robertson was allegedly targeting. In one of his posts, he wrote, heading to New York to fulfill my dream of eradicating another two-bit political hack D.A. In another Facebook post, Robertson said that he was getting ready for the election in 2024 and that he had guns in his house, guns and other potential evidence which may now be in the hands of law enforcement for further review. (END VIDEOTAPE) CAMPBELL (on camera):  Now, guys, we live in this heightened threat environment. Federal law enforcement has warned about it. You know, there's all kinds of vitriol online. That's the challenge for agencies, like the FBI, trying to sort out who were just these so called keyboard commandos, those who are spouting off and those who may actually pose a threat. This suspect's social media history, you look through a lot of these vile, deadly threats against these officials, and now we see the FBI going to try to take him into custody, the suspect pulling a weapon on those agents. Just as troubling as we look into 2024, I was looking online, there are some fringe corners that are already lionizing this guy, calling him a victim, saying that the FBI assassinated him despite the circumstances that we've described there. And again, that is the challenge, law enforcement on the lookout for others who might pose a danger. We've seen in the past folks -- people attacking FBI field offices, people attacking law enforcement. And as we move into the next presidential election cycle in earnest, this is something that federal law enforcement will certainly be on the lookout for, people that are online who may have not only the intent to cause harm, but also the capability, guys.",
