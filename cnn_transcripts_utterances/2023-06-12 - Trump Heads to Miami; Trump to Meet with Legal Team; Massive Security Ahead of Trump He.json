Very shortly Donald Trump will leave his Bedminster, New Jersey, golf course, where he is accused of displaying sensitive national security documents to guests. He will then board his plane, that is waiting on the tarmac, at Newark Airport. He will head to Florida. We are awaiting his departure.Trump will appear inside a Miami courthouse tomorrow and be placed under arrest on 37 charges relating to his handling of classified documents. This morning security is tight and getting tighter. Trump is calling on supporters to rally. Today we are going to get an update from law enforcement as fears of mass protests and possible violence grows. We're also getting new details of just how quick this trip to south Florida will be. After court Trump will fly back to New Jersey where he will speak at a fundraiser. He is vowing to stay in the presidential race even if convicted. We have crews covering every angle, every development this morning. Let's begin in Miami. CNN's Katelyn Polantz is there. Katelyn, why don't you just set the scene of what's going on. KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME AND JUSTICE REPORTER: Well, John, the scene of the alleged crimes here is just along the Florida coast in Palm Beach. But we are in Miami, and that is where Donald Trump is going to have to go to make his first appearance in federal court facing this unprecedented indictment. So, the way that this is going to play out is Donald Trump has to travel into the state of Florida. He's up in New Jersey. So, he's going to travel into Florida, into Miami, stay at his resort, get together (INAUDIBLE) so that they're going to be able to tell him, you know, what to expect in federal court, what's going to happen in this proceeding. And then tomorrow he and his entourage, security that protects him, they will be coming to the courthouse. So we might not see him at all physically walk into the courthouse. And once he's inside, then it's even more of a lockdown. This isn't like his case in New York state where there were cameras in the hallway watching him to go into the courtroom and then photographs of him in the courtroom itself. There will be nothing like that. So, he will be appearing before a magistrate judge. Also, his co- defendant, Walt Nauta, is summoned to be here at that same time. They're going to be read the charges or told what they're charged with. So, the willful retention of documents for Donald Trump. And then for both of them, obstruction of justice. They're both accused of trying to obstruct the investigation by moving boxes around Mar-a-Lago so the feds wouldn't find them. And then they'll get the opportunity to enter their pleas. We do expect them both to say that they are not guilty, even if there could be the possibility of a plea deal on the horizon or further along in this. And that will all be before a magistrate judge. What will happen after that is what we'll really be watching for because that could be a pretty short proceeding, John. After that, that's when the federal district judge, Aileen Cannon, she'll come in and she'll help set a timeline and discuss a little bit more details about how this is also going to play out toward trial.",

That's after Donald Trump abruptly removed two of his attorneys, Jim Trusty and John Rowley, on Friday. And we are told that he also spent the weekend calling more attorneys and that his attorney, who he just hired a couple months ago, Todd Blanche, will appear with him in court tomorrow. Now, tonight, Donald Trump is expected to stay at his Dora Resort in Miami. And then immediately after his arraignment tomorrow afternoon he's going to be flying back to Bedminster where he'll host a fundraiser and speak publicly to the crowd there. Now, Rahel, we have seen this playbook before. Donald Trump, when he was indicted in April in Manhattan, he left his - that arraignment and abruptly flew to Mar-a-Lago, where he took to a stage ahead of a crowd of his supporters and he railed against the charges and framed them as very political.

That is Judge Aileen Cannon. She was appointed by Trump. She has already faced scrutiny for some past decisions that some have said were biased toward Trump.

And that really kind of hinges on the idea of an attorney/client privilege because when we're talking about Trump or any client, the attorneys are the ones who are obviously the experts on the law. A client should be able to ask their counsel questions about the scope of the law and what bounds that actually has. So, I'm interested by the fact that in the indictment itself, if you read the statements from Trump, they're really not statements at all. Many of them are actually questions that are posed.

It's very -- it's very uncommon for the most part, but certainly there are situations where you can pierce that privilege.
