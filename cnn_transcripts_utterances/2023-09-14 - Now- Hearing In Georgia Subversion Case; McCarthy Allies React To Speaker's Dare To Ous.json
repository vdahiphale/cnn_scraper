And threatened yesterday to take a procedural vote -- a rule vote on the House floor on a single defense appropriations bill.That has really made this week in the House of Representatives largely a wash on the floor, given the fact that the whole point of lawmakers coming back was to try and pass individual spending bills. They were unable to do that yesterday, given the fact that you had a handful of conservatives who wanted a lower spending number and therefore were willing to take that procedural step. So, where do they go from here? House Speaker Kevin McCarthy again being defiant as he left that conference meeting this morning, saying that he isn't afraid, he doesn't feel threatened by these members and instead is willing to fight if that's what it takes. Meanwhile, allies of the House speaker had this to say about McCarthy's message this morning. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE (R-GA): He told the entire conference. He said if you want to throw in a motion to vacate, that's fine. I didn't -- I didn't survive 15 rounds for nothing. And I'll survive another 50 rounds. REP. DUSTY JOHNSON (R-SD): Nothing has come easy to this guy in the last nine months. He has an incredible optimism. He's got resilience like all of us. He does occasionally get frustrated by how many members including myself can be knuckleheads in any given day. But listen. I mean, he understands that he's the right guy at this moment. And he's not going to be dissuaded by the fact that the job's hard. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And so, I think we have a long way to go.Even though it has been 60 years, there are things today that are still rocking our nation that we need to come to grips with.
