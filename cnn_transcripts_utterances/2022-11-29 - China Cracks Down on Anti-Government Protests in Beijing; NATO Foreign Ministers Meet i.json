Great to have you with us thisTuesday, and it is a terrific Tuesday, in fact, for World Cup football fans. Later today, England battles Wales. And the U.S. Takes on Iran in a key winner-takes-all faceoff. The very latest on today's crucial day of play, just ahead. And from the white knuckle World Cup to global markets trying to move up, U.S. stock futures pretty much flat at the moment after Monday's 1.5 percent pullback and European shares a bit firmer after a strong Asian handover. All of this on hopes that the unprecedented lockdown protest across China will force some sort of communist party reevaluation of its zero-COVID policies. Later on this hour, Leland Miller, the CEO of China Beige Book, gives us his take on the China protest and also the outlook for economic reopenings there. But, first, let's go to China's capital, Beijing, eerily quiet on Tuesday night with a heavy security presence keeping protesters off the streets. That's a stark difference from scenes on Sunday when crowds of protesters gather to challenge the government's zero-COVID policy. CNN's Ivan Watson joins us now from Hong Kong. So, Ivan, what happens now? Because I don't think anyone expects the protests would just go away and the issues at the center of this protests, of course, these zero-COVID policies, still remains intact. So, what happens now?",

So, it is hard to get information. And that is why the images that have emerged of these protests that erupted over the weekend are so striking. There are more images of kind of protests and crackdown. This is from the eastern city of Hangzhou on Monday night, where police were seen detaining people and you had bystanders screaming and very emotional, and saying, you can't do this. And we have also heard and seen in Beijing and in Shanghai of a substantial police deployment since demonstrations were allowed to take place on Saturday and Sunday and not seeing a repeat of those protests on Monday now into Tuesday, also hearing about detentions in Shanghai, of barriers being put all up along roads to prevent people from being able together, and, ominously, hearing anecdotal accounts of police stopping pedestrians, searching their phones for images of the protests that took place in Shanghai on Saturday and Sunday. And the Chinese government has an enormous system of surveillance and state security, many levers that they can use to intimidate and stop expressions of dissent, which it has freely used in the past. There are signs, however, of kind of tacit acknowledgment that, hey, maybe things need to be loosened up a little bit. Senior health officials who gave a briefing today, these do take place almost on a weekly basis. And take listen to kind of the tone coming from a top health official when discussing the COVID restrictions that have triggered so much discontent. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Look at where we are today, big gains, up more than 900 points compared to yesterday. Also gains on the notable Shanghai Composite Index. And as you mention, there are these plans in place to vaccinate more individuals in China with a big focus on the elderly population. And that is something that investors have been wanting to hear, they have been craving to hear. They want some kind of roadmap for the future. If there is a point that has come up at my conversations, in my emails, in the analysts' reports, it is the fact that traders are really trying to grapple between two different narratives right now in China. One, we have very strict lockdowns, two, and in the past, over the past few weeks, there have been some signs that perhaps things were going to ease up a bit. They don't know which narrative is the one that will prevail. And that is why we have seen so much rockiness. But this plan of attack, this plan forward, obviously, is striking a chord with investors, and it needs to, because the implications of this from an economic standpoint are very broad. First of all, many of these lockdowns have led to unemployment in China. It has impacted iPhone production. It is even impacting the price tag of oil. So, Rahel, everywhere that comes from China, from government leaders, any kind of plan of action, is taken very seriously and impacting these financial decisions.",

That opening match against England, the playersof Iran's national football team chose not to sing the national anthem in an apparent show of solidarity with the protest movement in Iran. But that second match is when we saw players singing the national anthem and, in fact, facing boos and jeers from members of the crowd and supporters in the stands, of course, in relation to their decision to sing the national anthem. But, of course, now we are learning from a source working closely on the security of the games that the Iranian national football team is facing pressure from the regime, and not just for the players themselves but for their loved ones and family members back home in Iran. According to the source, family members in Iran have been threatened by the regime with imprisonment, with violence, even with torture, if any of the players are seen to be participating in any form of protest against the regime and any sign of solidarity with the protest movement at home, and, of course, importantly, not singing the national anthem ahead of today's match against the United States, of course, a crucial match for Iran, nonetheless. But this has raised concerned over situation not only at home but for the players themselves. According to this source, the players were held with a meeting with the members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, as well as their head coach who had a meeting with representatives, essentially warning them to behave, not to act inappropriately ahead of this match. And there have been reports of an increase presence of security officials monitoring the actions and activities of the players as they take part in the World Cup, and, clearly, a lot of concern there around their safety. And this isn't the first time we have seen Iranian athletes and sports, people coming under the pressure of the regime.

Now, that was predicted to happen this year earlier this year. There was going to be a real slowdown, the Fed was going to raise rates and it's all pushed out largely because of one thing, which is U.S. consumer, who is spending money. And we just got our spending from Thanksgiving to last Saturday and it was up 3 percent over last year, which is up 23 percent over the year before, 20 percent over where it was in '19.

They're worried about the virus, they're worried about the deaths, they're worried about the legacy of the party from mishandling COVID zero. So, maybe you have a timeline of March to June next year where they would do some things. That timeline has likely moved out. Maybe it's to start things in February or March. The point is they can't wait probably as long as they thought they could, but this does not mean that they're going to rip back COVID zero in December. They're not going to rip back COVID zero in January. They have got to keep things under relative control in order to make sure the virus don't lead to spiraling death counts.",

The number onething markets are looking for is a date certain in the future where they can see a horizon where COVID zero no longer exists. That is the signal that businesses are waiting for. If you look in China Beige Book data, they have been telling us for months and months and months that they won't borrow, they won't invest and they won't hire until COVID zero is over. Not an announcement COVID zero is over but until it is over. So, to the extent you could ever provide even a rough date for when there's an exit ramp, that would be very helpful. But for obvious reasons, including being backed into a corner in the spring, in late winter the authorities have, so far, been very hesitant to move in that direction.",

And to some degree, that has been the case. But the problem has been that Xi Jinping has been so personally associated with the COVID zero policy that nobody in the provinces, in the towns, nobody wants to have any daylight between them and a very aggressive form of COVID zero policy. So, I think what they are doing in terms of just slowly changing the narrative in the official, central publications that COVID zero can be lived with, that it is not as scary as you think, I think that is moving in the direction where Xi is saying, look, it's okay to have a little bit of daylight between this draconian COVID zero and what we want to implement on the ground.

It was some eagle-eyed Twitter tweeters, people on twitter last night pointed out there was a page on Twitter's website that outlines this policy. And I think we have a picture we can show you there. There was basically a little addendum added to it saying, we are no longer implementing this policy. Under that policy, by the way, 11,000 accounts were suspended or banned from the platform. It is very, very possible that a lot of the accounts will be coming back. We've heard Musk pledged that as soon as this week, a lot of those banned accounts will be back on Twitter.",
