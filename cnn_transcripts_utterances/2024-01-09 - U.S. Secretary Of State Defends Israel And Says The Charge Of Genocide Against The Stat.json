Tonight, the U.S. Secretary of State defendsIsrael and says the charge of genocide against the state has no merit, but admits the civilian cost in Gaza is too high. We have the very latest. And while conflict rages in the Middle East, Ukraine is facing ongoing Russian bombardment with dwindling U.S. aid. So what are Europe's leaders doing about it? I'll put that to Slovenia's Foreign Minister live with us this hour. Plus, I did absolutely nothing wrong. Donald Trump doubles down on his claim that he is immune from criminal charges for trying to overturn the 2020 election. Did the judges buy it though? The latest from the U.S. coming up for us. Tonight, though, America's top diplomat is back in Israel trying to thread a delicate needle. Voicing firm support for Israel while calling on its military to do everything in its power to protect civilians. Secretary of State Antony Blinken's spoke in Tel Aviv just a short time ago. Have a listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It's particularly galling given that those who are attacking Israel, Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis as well as their supporter, Iran, continue to openly call for the annihilation of Israel and the mass murder of Jews. On this trip, I came to Israel after meeting with the leaders of Turkey, Greece, Jordan, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia. All of those leaders share our concern about the spread of conflict. All of them are committed to using their influence, using the ties that they have to prevent it from escalating, to deter -- from opening. In addition, all express grave concern about the dire humanitarian situation and the number of civilians killed in Gaza. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We have just heard in the last few minutes, in fact, from Secretary Blinken. I wonder if you could lay it out for us in terms of what he says was achieved with this shuttle diplomacy.

It is a country that is facing domestic crises on multiple fronts from politics to economics. And of course, we've been hearing from the Lebanese government saying that they do not want to see a war with Israel, that they want peace on their southern border. But of course, as we have seen over the last few weeks and particularly over the last few days, there has been an intensification of crossfire along the border. And what we are beginning to see, Isa, is really the broadening out of that conflict on the border. We have seen the skirmishes largely contained from the beginning of the war in Gaza along that borderline. But we are beginning to see that now expand, and we saw last week a precise strike in Beirut, in the capital. Of course, Israel neither claiming nor denying responsibility for that strike at the southern suburbs of Beirut which of course, killed a senior Hamas leader. But the U.S. official has said Israel was behind it. And then as you mentioned, Isa, we have today, a senior Hezbollah carrying out a strike on an Israeli base in northern Israel. The deepest into Israel that Hezbollah has carried out from the outset of the war. So, of course, we are seeing that escalation, we are seeing that crossfire really ramping up along the side of Hezbollah. It is growing more strategic, it is growing more targeted, focused on military assets belonging to the Israeli military. In turn, of course, we have, of course, seen the Israeli military carrying out precise strikes along Lebanon's southern border. That has been a daily occurrence now from the outset of the war. But of course, we are seeing the targeting now of senior members of the Iran-backed group we saw just  yesterday with son of Dahdouh Wael(ph); a senior commander and Hezbollah targeted. There is a concern, of course, that this could trigger or provoke further action by Hezbollah, and potentially pull Lebanon or at least, Hezbollah into a more direct confrontation with the Israeli military.",

Aid is desperately needed to, as you well know. But with U.S. funding currently stalled in Congress, there are concerns over where this leads Ukraine's fight.

Trump's lawyer said that, if this principle isn't upheld, it would open a Pandora's box whereby presidents would be repeatedly prosecuted by their successors going forward. The special counsel, Jack Smith, who is holding this case, and his team of lawyers are arguing in court that, essentially, if Trump's position is allowed to go ahead, that would mean presidents are essentially above the law, they're like the kings that  the American revolution overthrew. And they are completely without any constraints whatsoever. I think what's especially interesting about this, and with the collision of the Iowa caucuses and the beginning of the U.S. Presidential race officially next week, is that we're seeing this is Trump's vision of the presidency. He came out and gave remarks after the case in court today where he said, if you're president, you have to have immunity.

Other children who've survived Israeli strikes are left with catastrophic, life altering injuries. Save the Children says on average 10 children have lost one or both of their legs every day in Gaza since the war began. Let that sink in.

We now know that he was treated for prostate cancer in early January. That's when it was -- it was detected early, we know. And the prognosis we heard was excellent. Expected to make a full recovery. As you all know. Austin's health came under scrutiny after it was revealed that he was hospitalized on New Year's Day, but it wasn't known by the White House apparently for several days. We know that he first had hip and leg pain. They believed it was a urinary tract infection, but they went on to say that he's recovering well, is in good spirits. No time as of yet as to when he will be released. But hinting and talking to the fact that understands the concern from the public. So, we'll stay on top of this breaking news story, of course.

So, some things need -- it's got to give more consequences, clearer messages that this will not be tolerated, that this is on the government of Israel if all these thousands -- millions of people continue to be targeted and at risk of death and injury.
