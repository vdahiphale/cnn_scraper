The U.S. says controversial cluster munitions will be included in a new U.S. aid package for Ukraine.The move is in light of Ukraine's struggle to make gains in their Russian counteroffensive. Ukraine has been for those munitions. But cluster munitions are a major risk to civilians because when they're fired, they release bomblets that sometimes don't explode. Those explosives pose a threat similar to landmines to civilians for years, even decades. CNN's Ben Wedeman joins us from Eastern Ukraine this morning. Ben, is there any sense of what kind of an impact that these powerful and controversial weapons could have on Ukraine's offensive?",

      "sentences": "Well, Sara, I can give you a pretty good example. We were today at a Ukrainian artillery battery that was firing 155 millimeter high explosive antipersonnel munitions. These are artillery shells that burst over the trenches, spraying shrapnel over a large area.But a cluster munition drops dozens, hundreds, sometimes, of these small bomblets over a much larger area, sometimes several football fields. So, their effectiveness is much larger than the sort of ammunition that we saw being used today. And it's particularly necessary around Bakhmut, where, according to the Ukrainian army, the Russians have deployed 50,000 troops in a pretty small area, and they are deployed in multiple layers of trenches that are dug deep. And cluster munitions, despite all the problems that go with them, are an effective weapon to try to basically destroy these defenses. But, of course, there are problems. For one thing, the United States actually discontinued the production of these weapons in 2016. And as you said, the problem is they have a very what's called the high dud rate. The number of these bomblets that don't actually explode can be up to 40 percent, and they can stay in the ground for months, years, decades afterwards. And, hopefully, when this war is over, the problem is civilians will come back to these areas, which are farmlands, by and large, and there's a real danger that there could be injury and perhaps death to them for decades to come.

BERMANThese have been used in Ukraine already by the Russians on Ukrainian civilians. You can see the series of explosions. But I want to point out one thing here. You saw the explosions. You also see right here on the ground an unexploded bomblet. And that's the concern that some of these explosives don't go off right away. They could be found by civilians, by children later. With us now, CNN Military Analyst, former commanding general for the U.S. Army, Mark Hertling. General, great to see you. Can we talk about the theoretical pros and cons of these munitions? First, let's talk about theoretically. Why do people argue that they are effective? LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Well, because they do have the film that Ben showed during his piece showed the cluster munitions in a desert environment covering a wide area, as he said, several football fields. That is absolutely correct. The problem is well, we'll get into the cons in just a second, it can cover a wide area when those cluster munitions, U.S. munitions are fired by U.S. artillery, not the HIMARS type, the rocket type, but the artillery round, you get between 72 and 88 bomblets that come out of that shell over a target land and that can strike both soldiers and equipment. John. So, it does cover a wide area but in order to explode, they have to hit something whether it's the ground, a vehicle, a group of people. They were designed in the '80s against large elements of Soviet, both equipment, primarily artillery and air defense, but also large consolidations of people, men. So, those are the pros. It does cover a wide area but as you said, it has a very high dud rate as well.",

      "sentences": "Yes, that was on top of a Bradley Fighting Vehicle, John, and that was in 1991. During that period, in fact, at 2We had, in a period of a short few minutes, about 33 soldiers injured. It damaged, did not destroy any of our equipment. It sheared the antennas off my Bradley, the one you just showed in the picture, and it also punctured the Tow, the missile launch tube on the Bradley, but it didn't debilitate any of the armored vehicles. So, we learned firsthand that some of the publicity about what DPICM can do to armored vehicles, rather than just trucks or soft-skinned vehicles, as we call them, was overblown by the artillery community. The 33 soldiers that were wounded, 29 of them returned to continue to fight. I was one of those. I still carry a couple of pieces of shrapnel in my right leg from that attack. There were only two that had to be medevac, and both of them survived the attack. So, they had to have a little bit more medical treatment. And that was in a desert environment, a flat surface. When you're talking about launching these rounds against a trench line, those trench openings are only about two feet wide, two or three feet wide. So, you're talking about covering an area that's several football fields but not a lot of them are going to go into the trench itself. As Ben said before, that Ukraine thinks this is going to be a very good weapon to fire against trenches. I would debate that. But, again, I'm not a commander on the scene. I can't question General Zaluzhny and his request for this. I'm just suggesting that these things are not as effective as some of the other munitions, like the airburst artillery. One other thing, these munitions were all designed before the age of precision guided artillery, which the Ukrainians have a lot of, because we've given them the (INAUDIBLE), the HIMAR rounds that can precisely hit a target. So, whereas this is an area to fire weapon that basically takes away the maneuver space around an area, those more precise rounds will hit targets, not human targets, because you're not going to waste an artillery round on an individual, you certainly do have those air bursts that can cover the ground with shrapnel and not leave some of the residual bomblets that come out of a DPICM shell.",

The special counsel investigating Donald Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election is now focusing in on a chaotic Oval Office meeting held in the final days of his administration. The meeting happened on December 18th, a few days after the Electoral College had named Joe Biden the winner of the presidential election.During that meeting, a wild array of ideas were offered up to the president to try to stay in power. Ideas were floated like having the military seize voting machines, invoking martial law, even appointing Sidney Powell as a special counsel to investigate voter fraud. Here's how people described what it was like inside the room to the January 6th congressional committee. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But the question of whether or not it's resonating with voters, well, it's just still not clear.We have to remember that so many voters across the country have been experiencing inflation for the past several years. So, even when you hear Biden come out and say he's taking these cost-cutting measures that inflation is down, even if it's just a phantom effect, a lot of people are still feeling like they are having a hard time affording gas, affording groceries at the grocery store. Even over this summer, we know that that July 4th barbecue, it was a little bit cheaper but it was still very expensive for so many people. So, as he kind of starts this campaign on Bidenomics, the question is whether or not voters are going to actually believe him that the economy is better. Remember, they believed that the economy under former President Trump was better because they were actually seeing those low interest rates. And right now, it is just too early to tell. This is likely something that's going to be a continual push for the Biden White House and also going to be something that we're not going to really see the effect of until closer to that November election.",
