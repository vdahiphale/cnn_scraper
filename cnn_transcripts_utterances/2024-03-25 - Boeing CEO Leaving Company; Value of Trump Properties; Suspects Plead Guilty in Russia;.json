And there's been a lot of question about whether or not there was proper documentation for this door-plug work that took place at the Boeing factory.Some work needed to be done near the door-plug. They removed the door plug and then it was clearly not properly put back in. And so many workers at the bottom at Boeing have been feeling a lot of scrutiny and they've wanted to know whether or not there would be change at the top. But it's a great question, will Calhoun stay until the end of the year? That remains to be seen. And you're right, there is a lot of months left.

Leo, I just want to walk through the mechanics of what could happen starting today. If the attorney general decides, you know, I'm done waiting, how does it work? How does she get a hold of a bank account or a property? LEO JACOBS, CEO AND FOUNDER, JACOBS, P.C. AND COMMERCIAL LITIGATION AND BANKRUPTCY ATTORNEY: Very simply, you put out a notice, the AG's office puts out a notice, which is - function as an execution. After the execution it gets sent out to a sheriff. The sheriff has to deliver, right? He has to levee assets. There's two types of assets in the world, personal property, real property. So, say, for example, she wants to sell 40 Wall Street. There's an execution that's sent out to the sheriff. The sheriff puts out a notice, Donald Trump has eight weeks to do something about it. With real property - I'm sorry, personal property, she sends out an execution through the sheriff to a bank account, say a Chase bank account. He has about two to three weeks to do something about it. And the something about it that he has to do is really get a protective order. It's a fancy way of saying, you know what, you've got to pause or halt this enforcement proceedings because I'm going to limit condition and modify the judgment. That's the process.",

And real property is a lot more complicated, unfortunately, than going after cash in a bank account. These buildings, in particular all - all these problems properties, Trump owns them most likely in a labyrinth of LLCs. And with joint venture partners.

A lot of people inside NBC not at all happy that former RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel has been hired by the network. And the criticisms, very public and on TV.Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MIKA BRZEZINSKI, CO-HOST, \"MORNING JOE\": We believe NBC News should seek out conservative Republican voices to provide balance in their election coverage. But it should be conservative Republicans, not a person who used her position of power to be an anti-democracy election denier. And we hope NBC will reconsider its decision. It goes without saying that she will not be a guest on \"Morning Joe\" in her capacity as a paid contributor. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And the - today it was \"Morning Joe.\" Yesterday it was Chuck Todd on \"Meet the Press\" absolutely ripping the network for this hire.And as you heard, Mika Brzezinski say there, it's not because she's a Republican, it's because she was an active participant in trying to subvert democracy back in 2020. That's the issue here. She was an election denier, but she was an active participant in trying to basically overthrow the election over in Michigan. And so that's the red - bright red line that NBC journalists are really upset was crossed by their - by their brass here and also she has a long history, John, we should mention, demonizing the press. You know, this is not someone who was just slightly critical. This is someone who launched really ugly attacks, vial attacks, on MSNBC anchors over the years. She launched ugly attacks on NBC News journalists over the years, even questioning why some of them have jobs. And so for NBC News then to bring her on as part of the team, as they said, really struck people the wrong way. Now, what they do, I'm not sure. They're dealing with a huge public relations disaster to say the least. And I sense it's only growing. You know, when you have anchors like this speaking on the air, it gives you a sense of how enraged the journalists are behind the scenes. And so over NBC, Cesar Conde, who is the chair of NBC Universal Newsgroup, he has a decision to make. What is he going to do? And I think it's going to speak volumes about not only him but what NBC News represents as an organization moving forward. John.",
