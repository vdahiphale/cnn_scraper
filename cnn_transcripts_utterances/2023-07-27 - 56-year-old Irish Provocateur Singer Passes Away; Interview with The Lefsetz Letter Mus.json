Wednesday night to announce the Constitution had been dissolved or institutions suspended and the nation's borders were closed.President Bazoum has reportedly been held by his own presidential guard since earlier Wednesday. A small number of people gathered in protest of the military power grab, which regional African leaders have called an attempted coup.

Most of the region has experienced unconstitutional transfers of power just in the last few years. It's one of the poorest countries in the world with one of the highest birth rates, it has endemic problems of poverty, of terrorism. So, there are, you know, a great many factors contributing to instability in the country. That said, it was the first transfer -- democratic transfer of power in 2021, with President Bazoum coming to power, he seemed to be at least doing and saying many of the right things, certainly to an international audience. And I think what we're -- what we're discovering here today though, is that not all was well on the home front, that the security officers in the country, were feeling overwhelmed and under resourced. We've heard similar kinds of complaints from Burkina Faso and other countries in the region, which are fighting on the front lines against terrorist groups, you know, besieging the country. So, it's a very fragile state and a very fluid situation right now. And until we hear more from the coup plotters themselves, it's hard to know exactly what their motivations are right now.",

Again, we've heard that from coup plotters in Mali and Burkina Faso in the past.So, it's, you know, it's hard to say exactly where this is going to go. But clearly, if the military is more concerned with domestic politics, then there's a risk that they are no longer going to be fighting the fight against these terrorist groups that are now encroaching in on Niger and on the Capitol. And so, I think that presents a problem if the military has a kind of divided set of priorities, and they're not focused on the terrorist fight. And they're focused on domestic politics that I think we could see, you know, a spreading and a worsening of the terrorist situation in Niger in the coming days ahead.",

This front has been a major priority in this counter offensive over the last few weeks since it started. We have seen Ukrainian troops prodding along that southern front trying to get through and in recent days, they have made some modest gains. Elsewhere along the southern front today, we did see video of Russian troops fleeing from the fighting, retreating from the Ukrainian side. And recently, we have spent time on that southern front with the 47th Mechanized Brigade. This is one of the Ukrainian brigades that got American training in Germany, they received those Bradley Fighting Vehicles and they tell us tonight that they are using that combined arms and maneuver training that they learned from the Americans that their soldiers are advancing on foot under the cover of Ukrainian artillery. Meanwhile, those Bradley Fighting Vehicles are taking out Russian infantry positions as well as Russian equipment. But as Ukraine presses forward in the south, we are continuing to see Russia attack all across Ukraine from the sky. Dozens of missiles fired at Ukraine all across the country. Today, the Ukrainian Air Force says that some 40 Russian missiles were taken down, there were cruise missiles used, those hypersonic Kinzhal missiles, at least four of those were fired as well. The Ukrainian Air Force saying that the Russian missiles enter the Ukrainian airspace from the southeast and headed west, constantly changing direction. But as we have seen recently with the wave of strikes in Odesa, even if missiles are taken down, there can be significant damage on the ground, that falling debris hurting or killing people.

Vladimir provides security for a number of African countries. North Korea is rolling out the red carpet and bolstering ties with allies Russia and China, who sent high level delegations to Pyongyang, marking the 70th anniversary of the Armistice Agreement which ended fighting on the Korean Peninsula. According to state media, leader Kim Jong-un has been discussing strategic cooperation with the Russian defense minister who presented him with a signed letter from President Putin. They also toured North Korea's Hall of Weapons. State media also reports Kim Jong-un had a warm and friendly talk with the visiting members of China's Politburo or executive committee, who handed him a personal letter as well, this one though from President Xi Jinping.

In Portugal, hundreds -- excuse me, firefighters were able to contain a fire that broke outside the capital city Lisbon, but wildfires are still burning in other parts of Portugal also in southern Spain. Europe is not the only continent gripped by high temperatures, a large part of the United States is also suffering a suffocating heatwave, more than 140 million people are under some kind of heat alert.

So, that means that the reasonableness law is enforced at this point in time, it also means that right now, Israel's Supreme Court could not shoot down measures by the government of this country on the grounds that it deems them to be unreasonable.Now, the court also decided, however, that it would hear a case of petitions against that law in September. There's a law professor that CNN spoke to who said it really doesn't make very much of a difference whether or not there would have been an injunction because the Supreme Court is in recess anyway until September, so it wouldn't decide on any cases until then anyway. Some of the groups that have put forward these petitions to stop, the reasonableness act say they are happy with the decision made by the Supreme Court. It was one of the bar association that says never really wanted an injunction, but they are looking forward to having their day in front of the Supreme Court to continue to fight that legal battle. Another group came forward and said yes, they are also going to go in front of the Supreme Court. But they also say in the meantime, protests here in this country are going to continue.

They got -- Lindsey Horan got that incredible textbook corner across to the header and it was -- the place erupted even probably louder.

And so, she's angry. And within a couple seconds, there comes Rose Lavelle on the corner kick the ball to her head. It was beautiful. It was just poetic. It was theatrical. It was soccer at its best. One of those great highlights, and reminiscent for the United States, John, of Abby Wambach, who was known for her headers. And Moran puts it right in the back of the net, U.S. is tied one to one. Frankly, the U.S. had so many opportunities to go ahead and win the -- win the match, they did not. But it was certainly a highlight. And to think that the U.S. had not had that.

What could happen then on Tuesday, when the two teams play at the -- this two games are the exact same time so there's no funny business going on. I mean, you can't watch and then decide what you want to do. It could happen that if the Netherlands really takes it to Vietnam, and scores more than three goals, or has a differential more than three goals, and the U.S. has trouble against Portugal, which could happen, then the Netherlands could be the winner of the group. And if the U.S. were to win, if they both win, they would make it through.
