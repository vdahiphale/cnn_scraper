I mean, they're an organization that represents Black journalists across the country, and I think they have an obligation because of their role to interview presidential candidates, individuals who want the highest, most powerful job in the country, arguably the world if you're American. Other countries might disagree with us on that. So I think it was an important moment.My analysis, you know, we talked earlier. I was pretty emotional because the racial stuff, I always draw a line there. That's just something where I just think no one should really go, regardless of what ethnicity you are, in terms of discussing the heritage of someone else. That's just something that I think is just, you just don't go there. On the policy front, I thought his comments about the cost of goods, that was pretty good. I thought talking about how inflation, generally speaking, has impacted Black people, the Black community writ large, was pretty good. And if I was advising him, and Brianna, you and I were talking about how he could have pivoted. There were moments. We all know who Donald Trump is. We know that Donald Trump doesn't really like tough questions. I get it. It's his personality. There are certain things about my personality that I know I've got to check sometimes, even when on air. And I'm consciously reminding myself of that. But I would have said, Mr. President, when those questions are asked, you don't like them. You get a little pissed off a little bit. You're an entertainer. You can charm the audience. Pivot and say, look, I don't really like the question. I don't like the way it was phrased. But let me talk about what a lot of Black Americans are experiencing in terms of how the economy has impacted them. Let me pivot and talk about this or that. And so I just think strategically speaking, there were a lot of moments that he could have used to his advantage, in part because of his background of being an entertainer, that I just don't think he did enough of.",

People on the right are going to praise automatically.So let's talk about that 4 percent to 5 percent of folks in the middle, right? We know this is going to be a very close race. We know in 2020 you're looking at 81,000 votes across just four states. And so for the Trump campaign, I'm looking at low-propensity voters. I'm specifically looking at men. And I'm looking at younger men because if you look at 2016 against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the former president performed exceptionally well. He had an 11-point advantage with men writ large. That mathematically makes a difference across a national election. You fast-forward to 2020, President Biden was able to improve his odds. It was almost split evenly among men. So if I'm looking at Vice President Harris' campaign, I know this is a weakness for her. So if I'm looking at Donald Trump and I'm thinking you're improving somewhat with young men of color, Latinos and Black men, do I want to put my candidate in a predicament or a situation where you may potentially diminish the outreach, the targeting, the engagement, the penetration of voters who fit in those categories? I personally as a strategist would not advise that. But some may look at this differently.",

The world is watching for Iran's next move after the killing of Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. Hamas and Iran are blaming Israel and have vowed retaliation.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has remained quiet so far, but he did acknowledge that Israel has delivered blows to enemies in the last few days. Haniyeh's death marks the second assassination in the region in fewer than 24 hours. Hezbollah is now confirming that one of its senior commanders was killed in a strike in Beirut, Lebanon, yesterday, which the IDF has taken credit for. Let's discuss with former Israeli ambassador to the United States, Michael Oren. Michael, thank you so much for being with us. I want to get your response to the supreme leader in Iran promising harsh punishment for the death of Haniyeh. How and when does Israel expect Iran to respond? MICHAEL OREN, FORMER ISRAELI AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S.: Great to be with you, Boris. Well, as you see, I'm doing a stint of reserve duty, and I'm up on the northern border, and we're braced. It's almost 11 o'clock at night tonight. You see we're all in our uniforms and our boots, though it has been a quiet day so far, but it could be very well the quiet before the storm. Israel is prepared. And Israel had to take a very essential response to the massacre of 12 children, Israeli children on the Golan Heights several days ago by Hezbollah that could not go unpublished. And the fact of the matter is there has been a war here. There's been a war here for 10 months with Hamas, with Hezbollah firing 7,000 rockets and drones at Israeli communities up here, and almost 100,000 Israelis have been uprooted and displaced from their homes. So it's really an impossible situation. Just up the road yesterday, a 28-year-old Israeli near Popko was killed by a Hezbollah rocket in his backyard.",

We're facing enemies who don't want to change the government. They want to wipe us off the map.And at the end of the day, Israel has to make the decisions that are going to ensure not just our long-term security, but indeed our survival. I know from someone who has fought in Gaza, you see I've been in uniform, I've been in uniform off and on for many, many years. Israel goes to extraordinary lengths to minimize civilian casualties. But we're dealing with an enemy in Hamas who not only hides behind the civilian population but hides under the civilian population in 400 miles of tunnels. So it's actually a combat situation that no army in history has ever confronted. And if you actually look at the amount of civilian casualties, even according to the Hamas records, and you deduct the number of terrorists who have been killed and even the number of Palestinians who die from natural causes, you're going to get close to a one-to-one ratio, one combatant to every civilian death. Every civilian death is a tragedy, is one death too many. But to say that, you know, Israel is causing civilian casualties in a rate that any other army has chosen, this is a quarter of the rate that was registered by the United States of combatant civilian deaths in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.",

The world and Olympic record holder has not lost a race, Boris and Brianna, in this event in more than 14 years. And she extends her streak here at the Paris Games. She is now tied, Jenny Thompson, with the eighth career Olympic gold medal, further cementing herself as the greatest female swimmer of all time. This place absolutely erupted. It's a party here in Paris. Now, also, just coming through, one of the cool things is after Olympians win a medal, they bring them through here to celebrate. And we caught up with the women's rugby sevens team. They won the first ever medal for the U.S. in the event. They're more than just athletes, though. They have been inspiring an entire generation, uplifting women. And we caught up with Ilona Maher. She's been really the champion for change when it comes to how we see women, from body image to social norms.
