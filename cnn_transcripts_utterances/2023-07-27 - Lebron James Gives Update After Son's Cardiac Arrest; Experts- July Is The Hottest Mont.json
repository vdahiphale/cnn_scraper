That is how experts are describing new data showing that July will be the planet's hottest month ever recorded.Right now, nearly half the U.S. population is under a heat alert, impacting 150 million Americans in more than 30 states, all the way from Maine to California. The unrelenting heatwave is now spreading to parts of the Midwest and northeast, leading the nation's power grid to declare an emergency for the 65 million people it services. CNN Meteorologist Chad Myers joins us live from the Weather Center. White House correspondent, Jeremy Diamond, is also here because President Biden is considering taking steps to try to handle some of this. So, Chad, let's begin with you. Tell us where -- oh, my gosh, that's one big red map.",

It is bad everywhere.What else comes with this? Sometimes severe thunderstorms. We'll get to that in a second. It does cool down in New York and D.C. by Monday and Tuesday with a cold front. So this is only going to be a brief heatwave, unlike Arizona that had 26, 27 days above 110. This will be a three to four- day heatwave. What we've seen in July so far are numbers so far above the skew of the last 20 years that now today's Copernicus, our partners out there in Europe, have already declared July will be is the warmest July ever and the warmest month ever on record. A study hasn't been done yet. But how do they know? Because it is so far above anything else. Like this is a 10th or a 100th degree above. This is now two-tenths of a degree above everything else. And we have this severe weather possible today across parts of Michigan, also in Wisconsin. We're seeing a few storms that are already firing up across the northeast. And a severe thunderstorm watch is already in effect here. So some of these storms will be very big today. Make sure that you have your weather awareness hat on today. It could be one of those days where you get caught outside and go, wow, I didn't know this was coming.",

With nearly half the U.S. population under a heat alert today, President Biden reminding Americans that heat is, in fact, the number- one weather-related killer.It kills more people than floods and hurricanes and tornadoes. That was the message from the president today. But beyond the messaging, he also came armed with some concrete steps that his administration is taking to try and address these extreme temperatures. It begins with protecting workers, in particular, those who have to work outside. The Department of Labor will be issuing a hazard alert, which offers federal-related protections as it relates to high temperature for workers. And it reminds employers of those federal protections. There will also be increased inspections by OSHA, for example, to make sure that employers, particularly in the agriculture sector, in construction, where workers are working outside, are paying attention to these temperatures. And $7 million in additional funding to improve weather forecasting and $152 million to build out water infrastructure across the country. The president today also addressing this in the bigger picture, the bigger picture, of course, of climate change. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

A new poll showing President Biden and heavy Republican favorite Donald Trump are tied in a head-to-head match-up.This follows another poll that shows that despite Trump's growing legal problems, Republican voters are sticking with the former president. And 69 percent still believe he is the strongest candidate to take on Joe Biden. Joining us to discuss this polling and more, former Ohio Congressman Tim Ryan. He's also the founder of the new national advocacy group, We the People 250 Action Fund. Congressman, thanks so much for being with us. Let's start with the fund. You said that you want to move on from the toxic conversation that surrounds politics. How is the fund going to help you do that? What are you hoping to do with the money you are trying to raise? TIM RYAN, (D), FORMER CONGRESSMAN FROM OHIO &amp; FOUNDER, WE THE PEOPLE 250 ACTION FUND: Well, we'll be the home for the exhausted majority, which I think is the vast majority of the people in the country who are just really tired of the political conversation that is happening in the United States. And we want better. We're going to head toward better. We want to usher in an era of reform and responsibility and increased civic engagement and really elevate the conversation. But what we'll do is highlight the positive things that are happening in the country. There are so many ordinary people that are doing absolutely extraordinary things. It gets drowned out in the national conversation. We're going to make very compelling videos that highlight what's going on in the country. We want to build the organization in all 3,142 counties and begin to knit this country back together from a cultural perspective, not necessarily a political perspective.",

It is really a miracle that we've made it this far. And we want to make sure we leave it better for our kids. That means we all have to be a little bit more responsible. And we can have disagreements on policy but we can't tolerate people who want to undermine the democracy. And I think most people, Boris, are ready to come together. They're ready to heal. But we have to move toward better. And We the People 250 Action Fund will do that. People can go to WethePeople250.U.S. if they want to contribute and be a part of this organization. And again, we want to start the healing process. I don't think people have a place to go right now. We want to give them that place for the exhausted majority.",

I mean, that will be the recipe for success.We have, in Ohio, for example, and I know in Michigan and other states, really positive things going on from the initiatives that President Biden led and I supported when I was in Congress, the Inflation Reduction Act, the CHIPS bill that's allowing the reshoring of chip manufacturing. Ohio will have a $20 billion investment just outside of Columbus, making chips again for the first time. We have auto plants, electric vehicles, batteries, a lot going on. Natural gas, power plants in the eastern part of the state. A lot of positive stuff, mostly tied to these initiatives. So I think getting out and campaigning on those initiatives will be a recipe for success and the stability and the pro-democracy piece. So there is a lot of time left before the campaign starts. So we'll see what happens. Former Ohio Congressman Tim Ryan, thanks so much for sharing your time with us.",
