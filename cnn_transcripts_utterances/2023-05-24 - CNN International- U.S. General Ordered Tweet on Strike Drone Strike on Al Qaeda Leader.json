But in a way you could also look at the facts on the ground, which is that Russia has fought for the city of Bakhmut -- for the area of Bakhmut this very tiny significant, at least strategic wise, place for months now. And yes, they are claiming that they have control of it. But Ukrainian forces are still very much on the ground. And not being able to claim that win for the Russian military is significant.And Prigozhin has time and time again -- this is not unique as we know -- pointed to the Russian defense ministry. Criticize them, accused them of not providing ammunition on the ground. Calling senior officials in Russia fat cats who are sitting in their luxury offices. And yet again, he's using this opportunity in Belgorod to point out weaknesses he sees in the Russian military. He sort of asks this question -- and I think we're all asking -- how was the Russian border breached? How was this incursion allowed to take place? All forces stretched so thin that Russia's border -- and a very important border. Remember, Belgorod is right on that border with Ukraine. It's been used in military operations. How is that allowed to happen? That just a small handful of these two Russian national groups -- yes, backed by Kyiv's defense forces. But again, we're talking about two small groups were able to enter this territory and cause -- what Moscow calls deep concern. Launch an anti- terror operation, forced civilians out. I mean it's extraordinary. And the question really is here -- Kyiv has distance themselves from this attack saying that these Russian nationalists acted independently. The question is, is this one message and it has been sent? Or are we going to see more of these brazen ground assaults?",
