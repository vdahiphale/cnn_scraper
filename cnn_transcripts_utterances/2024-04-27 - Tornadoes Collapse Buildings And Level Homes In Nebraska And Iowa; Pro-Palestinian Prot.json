The area between Dallas and Kansas City is expected to get the hardest hit with tornadoes, baseball size hail and flooding among the hazards. At least 78 tornadoes were reported across five states on Friday with no fatalities reported. Officials credit the warning systems for saving lives.

It's a level four out of five that moderate risk there in the red.A little bit farther south than where it was yesterday going into parts of Oklahoma and Texas, but some strong tornadoes possible. Now, that outbreak yesterday in the Omaha area even headed into Des Moines. There were 42 tornado warnings issued by that one office in Omaha. That is the most in five years in a single day for a National Weather Service office. So, just incredible the amount of warnings that we had and all of the tornadoes. Right now, we have additional tornado warnings in parts of Oklahoma, just to the west there -- Oklahoma City as storms start to fire up. We are starting to get that daytime heat and humidity to cook the atmosphere and we're ready sorting to find storms explode. Here is a tornado watch that we've got for parts of Oklahoma and Texas. This goes into one 1:00 Central Time. We are expecting this to be expanded and strength that you know, as we go through the day to day, extended. We'll have additional tornado watches as we go through the day, because we're expecting another round of possibly strong tornadoes. Here is that risk for today. Strong tornadoes, damaging winds, large hail up to tennis ball size. You can see that red, moderate risk, a level four out of five. In that area, specifically, we could be looking at a chance of tornadoes that could be very strong. We're talking EF3 or stronger. That could cause severe damage. Similar to what we saw yesterday. We're talking about winds upwards of 135 miles per hour to 165 miles per hour. Just put that in perspective what an EF3 tornado can do. And weekend, we'll find these storms really blowing up as we go through the day today because that atmosphere is so super fueled already. Fred?",

So, I think that it's -- what I've seen, at least from former President Trump is, yes, he's probably violating the gag order at this point, but he is doing it in a way that a lot of people will view it as toeing the line.

Even if in the future down the road there's another holdup, there's another delay, or there's an attempt to block aid in the future, the Ukrainians want to strategically be able to produce more of their own weapons.

All independent media have been pushed out of the country. Dissidents are either in exile or in prison or worse. So she said that she's aiming to keep the network of activists together, to keep their morale as high as possible, and to find ways for people inside Russia to show dissent, even if it's in a small way, even if it's signing a petition or attending a flash mob or anything, to allow them to feel that there is hope for a Russia after Putin, there is hope for political change. That is not a very ambitious goal, but it's the only realistic one I think they can pursue in the context of the extreme repressions that are going on in Russia now.",

What I sensed from talking to them after Alexei Navalny's death was an enormous sense of despair and hopelessness.And Yulia Navalnaya stepping into his role, attempting to take leadership of this movement, really gave people some ray of hope that, yes, indeed, the movement can survive, can continue beyond the death in prison of its leader. But so far, I had the sense it's only been a couple of months roughly since he was killed. I have the sense that they're still looking for ways, strategies to continue on in the future without him. It's going to be a long road and a really difficult one because the repression are very extreme there.",

When we look at ozone pollution, ozone is a big part of smog. Most ofthe cities are also in California, one in Arizona.
