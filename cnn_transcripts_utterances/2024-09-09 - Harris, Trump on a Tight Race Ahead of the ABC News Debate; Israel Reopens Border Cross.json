The search for a man suspected of shooting up an interstate in Kentucky stretches into its third day, the latest details on the investigation. And a wildfire continues to rage in California, threatening thousands of structures, forcing evacuations and prompting a state of emergency. UNKNOWN (voice-over): Live from Hong Kong, this is \"CNN Newsroom\" with Anna Coren. We are now just one day away from the high-stakes U.S. presidential debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. This will be the first time the two candidates meet face-to-face, as they hope to sway still undecided voters in a very tight race. A New York Times-Siena College poll shows no clear leader. A similar theme also found in a new CNN poll of polls, which shows Harris at 49 percent and Trump at 47. For polls not only showing a close race nationally, but also in key battleground states like Pennsylvania. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. JOHN FETTERMAN (D-PA): It's going to be very close. It's going to be very close. And we have to do everything that we possibly can to make sure and have the conversations with all across Pennsylvania and all kinds of rooms that may be hopelessly red kinds of counties, but it's going to be the one on the margins. And I've always maintained that. And that's what happened in 2016 that Trump won and then of course Joe Biden won by 80,000 votes. So I've been predicting this is going to be close regardless.

The latest polls, what do they tell us, and more importantly, how accurate are they? LARRY SABATO, DIRECTOR, UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA-CENTER FOR POLITICS: They tell us almost nothing we didn't already know. The last 19 or 20 polls have had the contest between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, tied or nearly tied, well within the margin of error. And because of that, we know already it is going to be a highly competitive, closely contested race. That's the most important thing to know about it. What you shouldn't do is to overly respond or overinterpret each new poll, which might have been done by the \"New York Times\" poll that hit town today and caused consternation among Democrats. It showed the same thing that all the other polls have shown. I think a lot of Democrats thought that Kamala Harris would just continue to move up and up and up.

The text simply said, quote, \"I'm sorry, mom,\" as CNN confirmed earlier today with Charles Polhamus, Colt Gray's maternal grandfather. It was after receiving that text that the mother placed the call to the school before beginning a 200 mile drive from Fitzgerald to here in Winder, but by the time she arrived, the tragic shooting had already happened. The painful question that hangs in the air here in Winder is whether this tragedy could have been prevented based on the new information we have learned about what the suspect's mother tried to do. The answer, of course, is that we will never know, but these new revelations are very consequential and may widen the investigation into the shooting. Throughout the weekend, we have witnessed how thousands of people have arrived here at Apalachee High School in Winder to pay their respects, bring flowers and show support to the families of the deceased and the school itself.

We've seen some very large overnight barrages on August 26th. There were some 100 missiles and an equal number of drones fired, some very deadly attacks like the attack on Poltava last week that killed at least 55 people.But they are happening with such regularity now, literally every night so far this month has seen an overnight attack of some degree. And Ukraine is, of course, struggling to put them down. And we see that President Zelenskyy is calling on his allies using this moment with the momentum of that incursion to call for more air defenses, more military aid. He told allies at the Ramstein U.S. Air Force Base last week that a significant amount of air defenses that have been pledged are not getting through. So he is definitely continuing that lobbying effort and I think a measure of the scale of these attacks. The drone debris was found over the weekend outside Ukraine's parliament in Kyiv. Latvia is saying that Russian drones strayed into its airspace. Ukraine say also Romania, those are two NATO members as well so this is clearly a stepped up effort from Russia. And I think look if one of the stated goals of the course concussion was to try to reduce cross-border attacks perhaps shelling into the Sumi region that may have lessened, but it has not been able to reduce these longer range attacks, which as I say, have been stepping up and all of this underscores the communication issue that Ukraine now has at home trying to convince these beleaguered troops already beset by widespread issues of desertion, low morale, insubordination. Commanders have told CNN, some confused, they've told us, by why Ukraine would launch this incursion when things were already so fragile on the eastern front. Internationally though, the messaging strategy perhaps showing more success. This effort to prove that Ukraine still has that grit and that ingenuity that was so on display at the beginning of the war.
