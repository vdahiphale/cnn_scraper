That has been a particular pain point for the FAA, really a microcosm of the staffing issues that they are having. And the FAA Administrator warned going into this travel rush that the FAA may have to do that to keep things safe.The good news is things are moving relatively smoothly here on the ground at airports. The line here to get through standard screening and pre-check here at the Terminal 2 North checkpoint at Reagan National Airport under five minutes. Right now, the TSA says today is going to be even bigger than yesterday. They saw about 2.7 million people at airports nationwide yesterday, but a 2% increase from the same day a year ago. Today they're anticipating about 2.9 million people at airports nationwide. The number just keeps getting bigger. Today is the biggest day leading up to the Thanksgiving rush. We will wait to see though, because the rush could be even bigger coming back. That could set an all-time air travel record on Sunday. Since we are on the subject of lines, I want to show you this new technology that American Airlines has rolled out at gates across the country. This is to tackle a problem that is called Gate Lice. The people who rush the gate and try to board out of their boarding group. It's a particular concern on American because they have nine, count them, nine different boarding groups. So it's a little bit easy to get confused. Now, what happens when you scan your boarding pass if you're not in the proper group? an alarm goes off and you have to do the walk of shame essentially back to board with your group. We got to see it in action here at Reagan National Airport. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WOMAN #1: Okay, you're in group five -- WOMAN #2: I'm sorry. WOMAN #1 You're all set. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It is clearly also a busy Thanksgiving week in the halls of Mar-a-Lago, as President Elect Donald Trump quickly fills more key roles in his incoming administration. Just last hour, he announced that he has chosen Retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg as special envoy for Ukraine and Russia. Kellogg previously served as National Security Adviser to former Vice President Mike Pence. Now, Trump has now named 19 cabinet members. This is a huge difference from where we were at this point in 2016, when he had only made four cabinet picks. Joining me now to discuss is CNN Senior Political Analyst Ron Brownstein. Ron, always good to see you. I mean, it sounds like -- I mean, his Cabinet has pretty much filled out nominations and confirmations rather aside. What are your thoughts about what his selections tell you about Trump's vision for his second term?",

No alarms are going to go off while I'm talking.But look, you know, I think, you know, you have to look at Trump's Cabinet and other appointees really in two big categories. I mean, you have a number of them that probably would have been appointed by any Republican president, just kind of, you know, the standard conservative, in many case, business oriented appointees. Doug Burgum at Interior, Lee Zeldin at EPA. But then you have the group that Trump chose, I think, very explicitly to kind of rattle the foundations of Washington, where he picked Matt Gaetz as AG, Tulsi Gabbard to run the Nation's Intelligence agencies, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. At HHS, Pete Hegseth at the Defense Department, all of whom I think are very much put down as a gauntlet for Senate Republicans by traditional metrics. It's hard to imagine another Republican president nominating any of these for the jobs they hold. It's not really so much that they are necessarily unqualified. They're kind of anti-qualified in the sense that they challenge the traditional ideas of what those jobs should be. Matt Gaetz withdrew without a vote. That may leave more room for Republican senators to cast a public vote against one or more of these. And I think that's where the controversy and the focus is going to be in the weeks ahead.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, I think -- I think your second point really kind of -- the thread that runs through all of this is personal loyalty to Trump, you know, and people are kind of imputing onto, for example, some of the economic choices. Maybe Trump will not go as far as he said during the campaign on things like imposing tariffs, you know, but there he is on social media, you know, threatening 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada and big tariffs on China, the three largest trading partners, you know, right out of the box.I mean, they -- I think the expectation that, you know, there's a broad expectation certainly in the stock market that Trump will not try to do some of the most extreme things that he said he would do as a candidate, I think that's wrong. I mean, forget about Trump. If you just look through history, presidential candidates who get elected overwhelmingly try to do what they said. Sometimes they get stopped by the courts, sometimes they get stopped by Congress. Both of those may be less of a threat to Trump given the Republican dominance, you know, the Supreme Court and both chambers of Congress. And I think that it is wrong for anyone to assume that when he says he's not going to -- he's going to impose sweeping tariffs or mass deportation or talking about unilateral military action against the cartels in Mexico, that all of that was just bluster. He's going to go further down those roads than many people expect. SOLOMON: Yeah. I mean, the market reaction is an interesting point, Ron, because on the one hand, you look at that muted reaction to the tariffs and you wonder, is that perhaps because he has folks like Scott Bessent in his cabinet, folks who are considered more moderate, folks who are considered a steady hand who truly understand capital markets? Or is it because we've been here before, we've obviously lived through a term before, so investors have an idea of whether he's using this as a negotiating tactic?",

      "sentences": "Right -- and right. That is the question, right? Is Trump two the same as Trump one? Certainly in the campaign, I think Rahel, his proposals across a wide range of issues were more explicit and more militant than what he ran on in 2016 or even in 2020. I mean, he has talked explicitly about sending Special Forces into Mexico, for example, with or without the permission of the Mexican government.He's talked explicitly about ending the Education Department and obviously mass deportation and the use of the National Guard for that. And so I think, you know, there is a sense, and perhaps even among many voters, I think, you know, voters who are dissatisfied with the economy wanted to vote for Trump because they thought he would be better for their immediate economic situation. I was told by one person who was doing focus groups and public opinion research that voters who decided that Trump was better for their bottom line were actively resisting information that would cause them cognitive dissonance about what else he might do, what else might come with the package. Well, that's going to be harder to do once he is actually in office. You know, against the backdrop of dissatisfaction with Biden, I think voters looked at Trump primarily through the lens of he's going to bring down costs, he's going to get the border under control. But there is a lot else that goes with electing Trump. And I think you're going to see inevitably more of that come to the fore already with these, you know, with these threats to Mexico and Canada and certainly once he takes office.",

Specifically, Trump's proposed tariffs include 25% on all imports from Mexico as well as Canada, and an additional 10% on imports from China. Let's discuss the implications with Justin Wolfers, Professor of Economics at the University of Michigan, and Douglas Holtz-Eakin, Chief Economist on President George W. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers. Thank you all for being with us. Doug, first to you. The Biden administration kept in place many of the tariffs that we saw from Trump's first term. I wonder what your reaction is to this proposal and how these policies differ from what you saw during the first Trump administration.DOUGLAS HOLTZ-EAKIN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, WH COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS UNDER GEORGE W. BUSH: Well, these are very big proposals. 25% on Mexico and Canada is about $100 billion in tariffs a year. That translates into $800 or $900 per American household. So that would be a significant hit to the American consumer. So they're not to be taken lightly. The question with Mr. Trump is always, is this something he wants to do or is this a negotiating tactic and something he wants to drop when he gets what he wants? Well, what he said the terms were is -- they stay in place until we get no more border crossing by migrants, no more drugs, especially fentanyl, coming into the United States, those are sort of non-economic objectives. Those are typical of when he wants to cut a deal. And indeed, these are both signatories to the North American Trade Agreement, the USMCA. And this really sounds like him kicking off negotiations on the new version of the USMCA that was scheduled to happen next year. He's just starting it this year. So I think this looks like a negotiating tactic. That doesn't mean he won't go ahead and attempt to do this. Now, I do want to say this is different than 2017 in one very important way. The world has seen him do this already. They have seen him be in office. He has levied tariffs. They stayed in place. And there was sort of shock and amazement when he made proposals in 2017. You sense none of that now. The world has been watching him campaign. They've been getting ready to retaliate. It took the Mexicans about 38 seconds to say, fine, we'll do 25% too, and we'll keep going up until the U.S. auto industry screams, so this is not the same as the last time around. And the economic damage will be greater if both sides go ahead and do the tariff and the retaliation.",

Who might be the biggest winner?JUSTIN WOLFERS, UNIV. OF MICHIGAN ECONOMICS PROFESSOR: Well, the biggest losers are you and me and the folks who are watching TV at home right now. Between these three countries, Canada, Mexico and China, they account for almost half of all American trade. So think about your fruit and vegetables. Huge amounts. Nearly half of our fruit and vegetables come across the border from these countries. We're going to see a 25% tariff on those. So going to the grocery store is going to become a whole lot more uncomfortable. I'm coming to you from just outside Detroit. We have a vibrant auto industry here which actually straddles the Canadian border. Our supply chains are very tightly linked, where something as simple as a car seat might go back and forth across the border to and from different factories up to half a dozen times. And that's going to become very uneconomic. And you saw, actually the stock prices of the big three automakers plummeted on this announcement. It's also worth noting that one auto company has a very different business model, that being Tesla. The president's very good mate, Elon Musk, and it's much less of a threat to that company.",

That's what the USMCA really is. And now, despite the fact that it's his trade agreement that he passed with two countries, he's now ripping it up with sharp tariffs on both of those.Look, disentangling American business from Mexico and from Canada would be very bad for Mexico, very bad for Canada, and very bad for American business.",

And that world is gone. There is now a protectionist tilt to trade policy everywhere, not just in the United States. Mr. Trump has left that world behind and believes, evidently quite sincerely, that we should simply get rid of all imports and make everything here, which is completely economically irrational and undoable. So I would be at a loss as to how to convince him to simply recognize that there are smart workers and smart consumers and smart businessmen all across this country who are relying on trade flows because that's the best way to do things that are good for America.
