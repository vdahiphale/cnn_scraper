I also want to note, the prosecutors subpoenaed the document that he refers to, and they still don't have it. It's unclear one, what this document was, if it was indeed a real document, though it appears by this transcript, he does clearly think that he is in possession of something that he is showing them something that supports his argument against Milley. But at this point, it's not clear that the government even has this document in its possession. So, we don't have the indictment at this point. It's unclear when that will be unsealed. But it would not be surprising if this audio recording or quotes from it come up in the indictment. But, at this point, we don't know. It's clearly though a piece of evidence that even the former president's legal team acknowledges is a problem for him.",

And if it is, that sets this recording up to be a key piece of evidence as this heads to trial, it would be something that the justice firm would very likely play to the jury almost certainly if that is part of what is indicted here as a retention charge. And once they have that retention charge -- that is something we know that is going to be charged in the case because Donald Trump's attorney last night, Jim Trusty said it would be. We don't know exactly what paper it will be around, what classified documents. But if it is about this document he's describing in this audio tape, and that episode is part of this from July 2021 at Bedminster, if that's part of the case, they have to prove to things that Donald Trump knew he had a classified record or a National Defense Information piece of paper in his possession, and that he was willfully keeping it from the federal government outside of a protected classification area. And not that he has the ability to declassify it, although it is quite sensational that he says, as president, I could have declassified, but now, I can't. But the other words in this, I'll show you.

Look, the -- a challenge here is that, declassification reclassification doesn't really matter as an element of the offenses he's charged with. Merely what matters is their government records. And most importantly, that there was a series of acts taken to obstruct the justice department's investigation. So, it's a little bit of a red herring to go down the road of saying, you know, if he declassified it, therefore, there would not have been crimes committed here, because the simple fact is once the documents were removed, mishandled, misappropriated, whatever words you want to use, that's when the crimes were committed.

This tape was something that they learned existed.When this aid to Trump testified, the prosecutors were already in possession of this tape. They didn't get it from the aid, although it appears the aid had a copy when it was subpoenaed later. But this is -- and has been described to us this way by multiple sources, since you guys broke this incredible piece of reporting many days ago, as a really problematic piece of evidence for Trump. Now, I think they're going to stick to their line of, you know, he says things, he didn't mean it a certain way. You know, I'm sure that they can come up with all kinds of explanations for why he used the language he used, but it's on tape. And one of the thing that's really striking, Poppy, about this, to me again, is this is someone Donald Trump, who is incredibly paranoid over many decades about people taking notes of what he says, and people taking notes of what he's doing. And here he is, with people, because he also has a habit of showing off when he is in certain meetings, and trying to, you know, sort of puff himself up. And that, you know, is what many people close to him said to me they thought he was doing in this tape. And it's not as if he didn't know, you know, tapes were -- or audio recordings were rolling. He knew what he was doing. And he went ahead and just said this. So, look, we don't know whether this will be part of a criminal complaint.

Katelyn, Kaitlan, Evan, our competition, Maggie and I, we've all been reporting on this for a really long time. And it wasn't clear to me that the former president was absolutely going to be charged. And if he was charged, what they could possibly charge him with beyond obstruction?But once we got this recording, it was so clear that this was going to be a key piece of evidence. I didn't need his legal team to tell me that. It was pretty obvious because in here, he is admitting in his own words, this is a recording. This is the one of the most damning kinds of evidence that a prosecutor can have against someone. He is admitting that he willingly knowingly retained secret information. He seems a little confused about the classification level of this alleged document. But that is incredibly damning. We also don't know where this document is. So, I am sure that prosecutors are working on that, why they -- if they have -- if they don't have it back, why they don't have it back? But then also the fact that he's undercutting his own claim of his power to declassify, so, if at any point in this investigation, they have argued that, again, to prosecutors, that they didn't have to return something because he had declassified it. Well, this completely undercuts that, and could potentially go to obstruction. But it will be interesting to see, we don't know at this point how this recording will factor into the indictment. But it's clear, it's one of the most valuable pieces of evidence. And as we've reported before, this really changed our entire understanding of this investigation; the time, right? The place, and the kind of evidence. I mean, the time, this goes all the way back to the summer of 2021. It's a year before the search of Mar-a-Lago. This is the kind of evidence that they have. Remember, he's at Bedminster. Up until now, we didn't believe that there were any classified documents that had been found at Bedminster. So, this takes this into yet another theater. And then, lastly, Maggie alluded to this. You know, the former president is someone who's very careful not to e-mail, not to text. That has really been an obstacle in previous investigations. They didn't have the kind of evidence that they needed to tie him to any alleged crimes. And here, really, arguably, are probably one of the first times they have this recording, and it is so incredibly damning. So, we're waiting to see if and when the justice department unseals this indictment, how these factors in? But it will likely be a key piece of evidence.
