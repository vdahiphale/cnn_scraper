This is not only an historic visit, it could be also described as a nostalgic pilgrimage for Mr. Biden and his family like more than 30 million of his fellow Americans, he holds a strong connection to his Irish ancestry and says that being back in Ireland feels like being back home. This less intense leg of his trip follows a brief visit to Northern Ireland where he urged the main political parties to resume their power sharing agreement. Let's get you live to jump in now and to CNN's Nic Robertson. And you were there in Belfast. And as we do await Joe Biden speaking to parliamentarians there in Dublin, let's just talk about what was achieved and perhaps not achieved in Belfast? Some critics suggesting he might have spent more time in the north and more time on trying to get this power sharing back in business in Stormont in the assembly? You know, more time around what is the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement a day in Belfast and three, as it were in Dublin to some feels a little sort of un-weighted.",

And some people have said, look, you know, youhave to remember that the President has actually gone to Northern Ireland, that his visit there, even though the power sharing assembly wasn't actually up and running something he'd hoped that it would be that he had still gone. And it's important when the President does visit. And it does seem that although on the surface, it doesn't seem that he's shifted the political mood or the political climate. On the surface, at least, that he really has coped helped bring it alive and promote the narrative that the power sharing government is an important part of what came out of the Good Friday Agreement. And that everyone should continue to work towards trying to build it. It was interesting that Jeffrey Donaldson, the Leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, that is the party that has refused to join the power sharing government actually commented after about President Biden saying that he hadn't shifted the political discourse, but actually did say that he didn't think that President Biden had really had shown partisanship to either side that he was quite neutral. And indeed, Jeffrey Donaldson highlighted the fact that President Biden has spoken about his English roots, highlighting that as well as his well-known Irish ancestry. And I think that has been taken as a good political sign in Northern Ireland that the Leader of the Democratic Unionist Party didn't come out and say, oh President Biden was just was critical of President Biden in any way. And the indications are that perhaps over the summer, that Democratic Unionist Party could get some laws put into -- put into effect through the British government that could get over some of their problems and get them back into power sharing government. So I think it all works towards that we may not see it on the surface. So a short visit? Yes, I think that spoke to the sensitivities. But I think the general assessment is that the President pulled it off, no damage done, in fact, encouragement that was heard by those that need to hear it the most, Becky?",

The demonstrations coming just ahead of a key decision from the country's Constitutional Council on the validity of what is a very unpopular law, rising the retirement age. Well, earlier protesters stormed the Headquarters of LVMH that's the company behind Louis Vuitton and other luxury brands and it's seen as a capitalist symbol. A union activist was quoted as saying if Macron the President wants to find money to finance the pension system he should come here to find it. Well, this controversy has gripped the country for months. And as CNN's Saskya Vandoorne now tells us from Paris it may doom the French President's plans for other reforms.

VANDOORNE (on camera): The deficit balancing moves slammed by many as tone deaf will face its final hurdle here Friday, France is the equivalent of the Supreme Court. It will either rubber stamp it or deem that some parts or indeed the whole thing is unconstitutional, which would be a further embarrassment for President Macron. VANDOORNE (voice over): For the young reformer, pensions were supposed to be the first of several policy revamps.

It's a really tense situation right now, between the police here and the protesters. We've seen the cops, charging people. In fact, we look a little further back there's a group of police officers who's charging a bunch of people here right now. But you can see the police officers here in the foreground also with their riot shields. They just conducted a charge; let's say a couple of seconds ago. So certainly a lot of tension in the area, we have seen a good deal of violence, I have to say as well. We've seen some of the protesters hurled rocks and bottles at the police officers who've seen the cops retaliate with pepper spray and also with their batons and their shields as well. In the last couple of minutes, we've seen a couple of people be detained as well, as you can see a group of police officers now going through here you can see these cops here still sort of holding the line. But it really is a very tense situation with a lot of people that are on the streets here. One of the things that we do have to say, Becky is we're at one end right now of the protests, the largest part of the protest has been very peaceful. But there certainly has been a notable amount of events like what you're seeing right now where the cops are being pelted by some of the protesters that has been notable as well. But again, a very, very large crowd, and certainly doesn't seem to us as though this protest movement is losing any sort of momentum. And of course, as Saskya just noted, in her report that was on before tomorrow is such an important day for these people here on the streets for this nation, as the Constitutional Council will then decide whether or not Macron's plans to increase the retirement age? And in general that was horrible, whether that is constitutional, or whether the whole law or part of the law is unconstitutional.

Obviously, that is not something that has happened. But it is very important Becky. It's a really important question that you ask because I think this is something that a lot of people here will say if you speak to them, a lot of people have been saying it to us. They don't believe that there's been a real dialogue between the people and the government about this law taking place. They believe that Emmanuel Macron and his government have been tone deaf. In fact, if you look at some of the unions they've been trying to speak to the government who've wanting to speak to the government, the government has said yes, they'll speak to the units, but not about this topic. They say that this pension reform is going to go through. It is a key project for an Emmanuel Macron. Furthermore, he's done a lot to get this project through. And it's certainly seems to a lot of people here that he is just hell bent on bringing this law through an aggregate. A lot of people feel that they just simply haven't been brought into a real dialogue, or haven't been asked or allowed to voice their opinion on it.

Right now the situation that we have, where I am, is that you have the police, and the protesters sort of pushing and shoving each other. We're kind of behind the police right now. But there is certainly a lot of energy on the part of the protesters. As I said there's a lot of anger and discontent on the part of the protesters but also at the same time, the police are taking a very firm line on this as well. And we can see a lot of police officers that have been deployed we can see the police using the riot shield. And as you can see right now also, with this pushing and shoving going on it really is a standoff in many cases that at some, you know, in some cases, has certainly descended into violence as well.

And also agree that the Supreme Constitutional Court of Israel is a bit of a closed club that clones it. And instead, it needs to pretty much, you know, reflect the diversity of opinions in Israel. Therefore, if we take those two principles, what we would need is well, the second principle, of course, is that we need to achieve any reform in consensus; he can't shove it down the throat of the other side. So, we agree we need to reform, but we also agree that we need to achieve it in consensus. So, I would say, yes, a gradual change in the way we select and appoint the Supreme Court judges also do it in a more transparent way.

And I think Prime Minister Netanyahu now understands that they overreached, both in the tone and in the content of their actions, which is why he basically trimmed off 90 percent of the original reform and even diluted the 10 percent that's left. So, what we need now in Israel is not to pull to the extremes. We don't want to pull to the extreme left or extreme right.

At this point, by most estimates, the Russians control about 75 percent of that city. What's going on just for some context, essentially, the Russians have the ground on the west, rather the east, the north and the south. It's a pincer movement. They're trying to cut off the only ways into Bakhmut to resupply Ukrainian forces. And really, they have been throwing everything into the battle. Now, let's remember that we're sort of at the tail end of the Russian winter offensive, which didn't achieve much, but it seems that they're ending this offensive with a crescendo of violence, trying to take something to achieve something from this offensive. Now, according to one member of the General Staff of the Ukrainian army, within the last two weeks alone, the Russians have lost or rather have had suffered casualties of four and a half thousand.
