I'm Jake Tapper.This hour President Biden just arriving in San Francisco preparing for his first meetings ahead of his one on one tomorrow with Chinese President Xi Jinping, this time unlike any of their past conversations. Plus a defining vote for the new house speaker but does he have bigger problems as GOP colleagues are now physically throwing blows? House Republican will be here to talk about chaos in his conference. And leading this our new video of co-defendants of Donald Trump's spelling out in chilling detail efforts to overturn the 2020 election with some new details you have not heard of before. This bombshell new video is out of Fulton County, Georgia, \"The Washington Post\" and ABC News obtained a series of recordings from the parts of the statements made by four of the defendants as part of their plea deals from Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, former pro Trump lawyer Kenneth Chesebro, former Trump campaign lawyers Sidney Powell and Jenna Ellis and Georgia bail bondsman, Scott Hall. Now, remember, this case stems from efforts to overturn Georgia's 2020 election results, 19 people were charged, including Donald Trump. Many revelations in today's news including the \"Post\" report, that Kenneth Chesebro, the architect behind the campaign's plot to put forward slates of fake electors, Chesebro admitted for the first time that he played a role transporting documents signed by fake electors from Wisconsin to Capitol Hill. Those bogus electors were intended to be used as part of a plan to throw our democracy into chaos so Trump and his team could steal democracy from you. It gets worse. Trump attorney Jenna Ellis said that in late December, weeks after the election was called for Joe Biden and Trump had run out of legal options, Ellis said former White House aide Dan Scavino was unfazed. And you might wonder why. Why would he be unfazed? The answer, according to Ellis, well, it's quite chilling. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JENNA ELLIS, FORMER TRUMP LAWYER: I emphasized him. I thought that the claims and the ability to challenge the election results was essentially over because of the dismissal, the Texas versus Pennsylvania case from the United States Supreme Court. And he said to me, and I kind of excited to say, well, we don't care, and we're not going to leave. And I said, what do you mean? And he said, well, the boss, meaning President Trump, and everyone understood the boss, that's what we all called him, he said the boss is not going to leave under any circumstances, we're just going to stay in power. And I said to him, well, it doesn't quite work that way you realize and he said, we don't care. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And if he had done so she said she would have tried to seize election equipment. She even said she had considered using the military to get that equipment. Tellingly, Powell admits she had never even practiced election law before. When prosecutors asked her why Trump would rely on her for legal advice on election law when she had never worked in election law before she responded, quote, \"Because we were the only ones willing to support his efforts to sustain the White House. I mean, everybody else was telling him to pack up and go,\" unquote. I wonder why. At this point, Trump's attorney general and his White House attorneys who did have experience in election law, they were telling him he had lost the election. Just to get an idea of how tense things were in the office at that time. Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But I think what we pick up from these videos, and what you see in these interviews is kind of the roadmap that prosecutors are going down with each of these witnesses. Maybe not entirely surprising, but we're seeing what they are confirming to them for the first time. And we've seen Fani Willis do this before, Jake, with other RICO cases where a lot of people have been indicted, a lot of people have gotten plea deals.And often those plea deals in the past have led to potentially incriminating information that can be used to bolster her case against the remaining defendants. And so we don't know that that's going to happen in this case, but it very clearly appears to be the direction that she's headed with at least these witnesses and these co- defendants have now taken guilty pleas.",

But he also was a deputy chief of staff inside the White House and had a very high ranking position inside the West Wing, and he was someone who was making that comment at a Christmas party at the White House, Jenna Ellis says. But still, regardless, was making that comment to an attorney who was representing him.

And despite that optimism, though, and the very real progress that is being made that appears to be being made in these negotiations, it's important to remember that just a few weeks ago, we thought a deal was perhaps in hand and then those talks broke down again. So important to inject a little bit of skepticism here right off the top. But this deal that is being discussed, the parameters of them go effectively as follows, Hamas would release somewhere between 50 to maybe 70 hostages, that is the number that they have put out as a possibility.Israel would an exchange release some Palestinian prisoners, and also agree to a ceasefire that could last as long as five days. But some of the major questions here still revolve around exactly how many hostages, exactly how many Palestinian prisoners, and exactly how long that potential ceasefire would last. We did see today, Jake, in Tel Aviv, families of hostages beginning a five day march to Jerusalem, clearly trying to ramp up the pressure on the Israeli government to reach some kind of deal to bring their loved ones home.",

And there's real danger, you talk about everything that's on his plate, you don't want to add a heightened crisis with China. And you've seen a succession of Cabinet members visiting China over the last several months, including the Secretary of State to pave the way for this conversation.You've also seen by the way, you mentioned state media. State media has taken a decided turn in its attitude toward America in recent weeks and months. Well, weeks certainly, leading up to this meeting, which suggests to me that they understand too, that they need certain things from the United States. But you're quite right. You can't look like you've been taken by the Chinese. And I'm pretty sure the President knows that. And they've planned for that. And you're probably going to have each of them coming away saying that they've improved relations to the degree they could. They've taken some steps on some issues like fentanyl, for example, which would be good for Biden. And no one's going to go away with a huge victory here.",

However, he would still have to be charged. He hasn't been accused of wrongdoing. He would still have to be indicted, that would have to probably take a year between then and trial.

They traced, they sent the package to the FBI lab to have it swab for DNA.

Ultimately, if you say you care about the American people, well, paying our customs and border patrol agencies caring for the American people, paying our military members and making sure our veterans maintain their health care and mental health services is caring about the American people working in a bipartisan manner to get this spending bill through so that we can get our conservative appropriations bills through the House and then negotiate with the Senate to make sure that we fund the government while we're also looking forward to the future.
