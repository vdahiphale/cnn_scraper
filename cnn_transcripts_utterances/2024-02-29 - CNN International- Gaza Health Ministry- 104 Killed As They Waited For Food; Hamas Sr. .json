I am Fredricka Whitfield, and we start with this breaking news.The Health Ministry in Gaza says at least 104 people were killed as they waited for food. Eyewitnesses say civilians had gathered around aid trucks that had just arrived when Israeli tanks and drones opened fire in the western Gaza City. An Israeli official tells CNN that IDF troops used live fire when the crowd approached the forces in what the official says was a manner that posed a threat. CNN's Paula Hancocks is in Abu Dhabi, and joins us with the latest. What are you learning, Paula?",

      "sentences": "Well, Fredricka, our team has managed to get information from eyewitnesses, also from the Palestinian Red Crescent, saying that when these aid trucks, these desperately needed aid trucks arrived in this area, it was just in the eastern part of Gaza City, Al-Rasheed Street, then there were many hungry people that swarmed around the trucks themselves. Now, according to those eyewitnesses and the Palestinian Red Crescent, then the Israeli troops and tanks opened fire and panic ensued, saying that there were also further deaths and injuries as those trucks tried to escape from the area. It does appear as though there was clearly panic, as they did try to escape.It is unclear at this point the loss of life, whether it was mainly due to Israeli fire or the trucks trying to escape the area afterwards. We do understand, though, from eyewitnesses and Red Crescent that they believe that this death toll and they fear the death toll may rise because they say there are some areas they are still unable to get ambulances to. There is rubble in certain areas, and they are unable to access, and also, of course, the concerns of further gunfire. Now, from the Israeli point of view, we have spoken to the IDF, and they say that while they were escorting these aid trucks to this particular area, they say that certain individuals did approach them in a way that their troops on the ground found to be threatening, and then they did open fire. So, at this point, it's not clear exactly the order of the events. We have two differing accounts, the IDF saying that the incident is under review, but a devastating incident for people who are desperately hungry, who desperately need this aid, and at a time when very, very little aid is actually getting to these specific areas in the northern part of the Gaza Strip.

There are clearly a number of different aid trucks that have been managed to get through to this area. And we have been hearing from the UN, we've been hearing from NGOs, that they have found it increasingly difficult to try and get through to northern Gaza even when they have pre-arranged information and pre-arranged routes cleared by the Israeli military. So, we understand that the Israeli military was alongside these trucks. They had been taking them to this particular area.But, just looking at that footage, you can see the sheer number of people that are desperately trying to get close to the trucks, trying to get close to aid, any kind of food, water, anything that they can take back to their families. Now, we heard from the Gaza Health Ministry as well earlier, saying that at least six children died in recent days from dehydration and malnutrition. You have USAID (ph) aid groups -- UN aid groups, sorry, warning of potential famine, saying that the Gaza Strip at this point has the highest level of malnutrition in children under the age of two than anywhere else in the rest of the world. So, it just speaks to how desperate the situation is. And you can see from those images how people are trying to get anything they can to keep their families alive. Fredricka.",

      "sentences": "Well, overly hopeful, some would say. There was sort of swift response, Fredricka, to the prediction from the President just a few days ago that there could be a ceasefire in place as early as Monday. So, just a few days from now. We've been told by multiple sources that in fact there is no sign of that.And so, the big question today is going to be, how does this horrific incident that we saw take place in Gaza City impact that? We're already hearing warnings from a senior Hamas leader that this could severely impact the talks, Izzat al-Risheq saying that we will not allow for the pathway of the negotiations to be a cover for the enemy's continued crimes against our people in the Gaza Strip. So, some stark words there from a senior Hamas leader, Fredricka. It did appear that the talks for a hostage release and a temporary ceasefire were going well. We've seen a flurry of activity, meetings in Paris with senior intelligence leaders, meetings in Doha with technical teams to essentially iron out the finer points of this. We know what the broad strokes of a deal would look like. It's believed that it would be weeks, at least around six weeks of a pause in the fighting which, of course, Palestinians in Gaza so desperately need. Israeli hostages released, Palestinian prisoners in Israeli prisons released as well. We understand that Hamas had kind of backed off some of their demands in order to get this first phase of a ceasefire in place. So, even if it doesn't look likely or didn't look likely for as early as Monday as the President had had said, it did look like some progress was taking place. This incident, however, at least 100 Palestinians died or killed in this incident, could certainly throw those things off and put those talks in jeopardy. Fredricka.",

      "sentences": "Well, they are not providing many details. But, this is what an Israeli military official told me this morning. They said that the crowd that swarmed around these trucks, then approached the forces, the Israeli forces that were in the area, in a manner that posed a threat to the troops and that they say that those troops then responded with live fire. The Israeli military is also pointing to a chaotic situation, pushing and trampling that also led to injuries and deaths on the scene. The Israeli military says that this incident is under review.Now, we've also been speaking with eyewitnesses on the scene, including one of our local journalists who was there, and said that the chain of events effectively was that there were hundreds of people who were gathered, waiting for this aid. When the trucks arrived, people who, again, keep in mind as others have noted already, that this is a place where about a half a million people are on the brink of famine, very few aid trucks have made it in. It appears that hundreds of people then swarmed these aid trucks when they arrived at that location on Al-Rasheed Street in western Gaza. And then, it was at some point after that that the Israeli military opened fire. That triggered, according to those eyewitnesses, a chaotic scene in which people were stampeding, in which aid trucks were then running over people as they tried to escape the scene. So, that is the chain of events as we understand it. But again, none of this would be happening if the humanitarian situation in northern Gaza were not so desperate. These are people who are just trying to get a bag of flour because they have not tasted bread in weeks. People in northern Gaza have resorted to eating soups made with dirty water. They have been resorting to eating a grass and animal feed. I mean, this is how people are trying to survive in northern Gaza. And one of the reasons why there have been so few aid trucks going into northern Gaza has been, on the one hand, a lack of coordination with the Israeli military for these aid convoys to safely make it in. And as of late, as we saw the World Food Programme ending its aid deliveries to northern Gaza, because of some of the looting, some armed people who were looting these trucks and a lack of security for those trucks, that is partly due to the fact that the Israeli military has targeted members of the police force that is ultimately controlled by Hamas in Gaza. But, these are police officials who have been trying to protect these aid convoys, and they have been targeted in strikes by the Israeli military. And so, you have a lack of security for these trucks. You have thousands -- hundreds of thousands of people in northern Gaza who are increasingly desperate, who are hungry. And this is the kind of the deadly combination when you put all of those things together with the Israeli military nearby and the Israeli military then, for one reason or another deciding to open fire on some of these individuals. This is ultimately the end result.",

I've not heard any speculation that Navalny's family will be able to take that body away and have a post- mortem done independently.Their allegation, of course, is that Navalny was killed in prison on the cusp of being freed in a prisoner swap, which was being negotiated between Russia and the United States. The Russians have not commented on that. They've rejected, as I say, any allegation they were involved with his death. But, what we are going to see tomorrow is potentially a big flashpoint with these thousands of mourners coming out onto the streets in Russia, potentially in Moscow, to pay their last respects to Navalny, and that's something -- there is a big preparation, security-wise, being prepared for here.",

Hundreds of people, according to human rights groups, were detained just for the act of laying flowers, and sort of paying the last respects to this prominent Kremlin critic.And so, when it comes to his funeral, I think the expectation is that we could see the same kind of approach by the authorities as well. Certainly, we expect to see a big security operation around the cemetery where the funeral is being held, and in anticipation of large crowds, something that Putin, the Russian President, wants to avoid, particularly as it's only a couple of weeks to presidential election that he is seeing as being kind of inevitably going to win.

Now, you can see from the aerial images just how many people were there. We have accounts from eyewitnesses on the ground and also from the Palestinian Red Crescent Society that there were hundreds there who were swarming around these humanitarian aid trucks, trying to get any aid that they could for -- from this particular area. This is just in the eastern part of Gaza City. Now, very little, if any, aid has gotten to the northern part of Gaza in recent weeks. This is Al-Rasheed Street.

      "sentences": "Fred, President Biden is expected to hammer Republicans over walking away from that failed Senate border bill. That was a bill that included some of the toughest border security measures in recent memory, including an extraordinary authority that would allow the Homeland Security Secretary to shut down the border if certain triggers were met. That is something that Republicans have called for before. But, all the same, they have not agreed to sign on to this deal at the encouragement of former President Donald Trump. [08But, all the same, this is really a remarkable move by the White House which has sought to distance itself from border security. This is an administration that has dealt with multiple surges on the U.S.-Mexico border. Now, sources telling me that within the White House, discussions on this matter have been tense as it increasingly became a political liability. But, that Senate border bill was really a turning point for the President because it gave the opportunity, according to White House and campaign officials, for the President and Democrats to go after Republicans and flip the script, putting the blame on them for not wanting to move forward on this bipartisan deal on border security. So, that is really the focus of the President's remarks today when he visits that Border Patrol facility right behind me, where he'll also meet with Border Patrol agents as well as other frontline personnel. All of this, as you mentioned, while former President Donald Trump also visits the border, about 300 miles from here. So, this comes at a critical time. Of course, we're in a presidential election year. Former President Donald Trump is making border security a key issue of his campaign. And polling has shown that this is an issue that President Biden often meets a lot of disapproval among voters. So, the President today really taking the opportunity to seize on border security in a way that we just haven't seen up until this point. Fred.",

At least 104 civilians who were gathering around food trucks were killed and nearly 800 others injured when Israeli forces opened fire, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza. A warning here, new footage showing the aftermath of the attack. The dead are being taken on donkey carts. An Israeli official telling CNN that IDF troops did use live fire when the crowd approached in what one official describes as a threatening manner. A Hamas senior member says the incident could jeopardize ongoing negotiations over a ceasefire and the release of hostages.Let's bring in Alex Marquardt. So, indeed, this is going to be a real setback. What now?",

      "sentences": "Well, Fred, when you and I were speaking earlier, I think you raised the possibility that this could accelerate talks, and I think the talks over a ceasefire could really go one way or the other. Hamas is already warning this morning that this horrible incident with more than 100 killed or dying in stampeding around those aid trucks could essentially lead those talks to fall apart. [08At the same time, I can certainly see a scenario in which the main mediators for this temporary ceasefire, so, that would be the U.S., Egypt, and Qatar, could essentially step up the pressure on both sides to get to a pause in the fighting that is so desperately needed by the very people you're seeing right there, swarming those trucks, because a major component of the ceasefire deal that is being talked about is more humanitarian aid for Gaza. It's not just about hostages being released and Palestinian prisoners being released and a pause in the fighting. It is -- so much of it is about getting the aid to the people who so desperately needed, not just in southern Gaza in Rafah where so many people are gathered, but all across the Gaza Strip. The incident that we've seen today, that was in the northern part of the Gaza Strip, around Gaza City. And so, I can see American negotiators essentially going to Israel today, saying this was a horrific incident. This really highlights the need for a pause in the fighting. The U.S. has really been emphasizing that the civilian death toll is far too high at the hands of the Israeli military, and that not enough aid is getting in or getting to where it needs to be. Even if the quantity of aid manages to get into Gaza, that does not mean that it is getting to the people who actually need it. And one of the major reasons is because those trucks can't drive wherever they want to either because of damage to the roads or because of the ongoing fighting. But, Fred, the bottom line is, today, major questions about how this will impact the ongoing talks around a ceasefire that had been showing some progress, small progress, but progress nonetheless.",

But, it was attacks by Iran-backed militias against U.S. bases in the Middle East, including one killing three U.S. service members on January 28, and the U.S.-UK military counterstrike in Iraq and Syria that brought the U.S. and Iranian tension to a new level.
