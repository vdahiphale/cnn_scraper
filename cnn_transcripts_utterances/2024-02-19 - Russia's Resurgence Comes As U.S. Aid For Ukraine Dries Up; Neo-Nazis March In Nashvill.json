Tonight, Ukraine is arguably in its worst shape since the early Russian assault nearly encircled Kyiv. The frontline is nearing a breaking point. Ukrainian soldiers have abandoned a critical city in Donetsk following a months-long siege. Now, Russia is advancing and Ukraine is retreating and the United States is sitting, watching it happen. Funding is frozen, which means the weapons are sitting there in crates, in warehouses. Europe is panicking. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But is the Trump resistance about money at all or is it about the Russian dictator that he wants to like him?Now, just remember, Trump is the man who promises to end this war in 24 hours, the man who calls Putin smart, the man who refuses to condemn Putin, no matter what vile atrocity he commits. Putin gave the world a reminder of who he is when Alexey Navalny died suspiciously. Putin is now refusing even to release the body. Trump gave the world a reminder, too, in his first reaction to Navalny's death. He talked about his own legal problems in a social media post that was supposed to be about Navalny, and instead of, say, Putin, or even Navalny's family.

And yet here is critical aid, about $60 billion that has been passed bipartisan approval by the Senate, and the House decides to go on vacation for two weeks. And Mike Johnson, the speaker, says, when I get back, my priority, and rightly so, is to fund the government but no talk at all about doing something to help Ukraine, which really is in serious trouble here.And part of the reason, I think, is his own interior politics. The only way he could pass this because there is not enough support among Republicans to pass it, is with Democratic support. And when you pass bills with minority support from Republicans and majority support from Democrats, that's how Kevin McCarthy became the former speaker.

We had just left an event honoring a black sorority here during Black History Month and were confronted by these neo-Nazis marching with swastikas. At first, we didn't even know what they were chanting about until they got closer and could clearly hear them saying, save the white man, deport every Mexican. And it's something that was very unsettling but I'm sad to say it was not surprising because it's the same rhetoric that I hear from my Republican colleagues in the legislature who have weaponized hate against immigrants. Our governor just went to the border with Greg Abbott and instigated this hate.

While one of the horses is old, has hoof and mouth disease, and keeps quoting horse Hitler.

We are prepared to offer you $1 million a year for the rest of your life if you simply agree to leave the Supreme Court immediately and never come back. It is that simple.

She's also the host of \"Color Me Country\", a podcast that promotes underrepresented voices in country music. Rissi, good to see you. Thanks for being here. Even Beyonce, she's a huge global superstar, initially didn't get airplay on country radio when these two singles dropped.

I think that, you know, country music is at a really interesting place right now and that it's trying to figure out what it wants to be and what it is and where it's going. And I think one of the beautiful things about Beyonce dropping these songs and kind of calling everybody to the carpet, is like, if white artists can use 808s and can use trap beats, why can't Beyonce, who is from Houston, Texas, who grew up in a Southern family and a country family, why can't she do country music?",

And while I think that this initial frenzy is most likely -- it's -- it's Beyhive and it's her fans and it's people that love her. And rightfully so.
