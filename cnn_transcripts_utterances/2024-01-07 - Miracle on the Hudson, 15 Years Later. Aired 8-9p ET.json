      "sentences": "Welcome to THE WHOLE STORY. I'm Anderson Cooper.Last week on a runway at Tokyo's Haneda Airport, Japan Airlines Flight 516 collided with a smaller coast guard aircraft. Five crewmembers on the coast guard plane died. But amazingly, all 379 people on the Airbus survived. They were safely evacuated before the plane was engulfed in flames. Investigation into what happened is still under way. It got us thinking about another miraculous story of survival that happened 15 years ago this month. U.S. Airways Flight 1549 took off from New York's LaGuardia Airport heading to Charlotte, North Carolina. There were 150 passengers on board and five crew members, including the pilot, Captain Chesley \"Sully\" Sullenberger. It should have been a quick two-hour flight. But soon after takeoff the plane collided with a flock of geese. Both engines went out. The plane headed down. Captain Sullenberger acted quickly, steering the aircraft toward the Hudson River for an emergency landing. His decisiveness saved the lives of all 158 people on board. But this potential tragedy turned miracle was traumatic for many on the plane, including the captain. Over the next hour, you'll hear from them about what they went through on that flight and get an intimate look into their lives 15 years after the event they say changed them forever. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) C.B. \"SULLY\" SULLENBERGER, CAPTAIN, FLIGHT 1549: Cactus 1549, hit birds. We lost thrust on both engines. We're turning back towards LaGuardia.",

That would have destroyed him, having just one person die on that airplane. Nobody wants to be on that airplane and have that experience.

And it just said \"America needed a win. Thank you.\" And that came through on our fax machine. I have no idea who it was from or how they got our fax number. Mail was being delivered to our house. Our mailman would come at night, and he would put those bins that you have like when you're away, you know those Tubbs that have mail in them, and they would be full of letters from people all around the globe. A letter that I quote often, she said, in the last year, I had lost my father to cancer, I lost my job, and then my home. I had lost my faith. You, sir, gave it back. That is in essence the same story that they all tell us. DR. SONJA LYUBOMIRSKY, PROFESSOR OF PSYCHOLOGY, UC RIVERSIDE: I have said all along I would love to be able to meet with a psychologist and find out about the study of when as a nation we have a collective, like, good feeling story. Evolutionary theorists argue that emotions have functions. And when you think about the specific emotions, why do we have anger? Because when we are being attacked, anger prompts us to fight. Why we have fear when, you know, a tiger is running after us, it will prompt us to flee. There is an emotion called elevation, and elevation is this warm feeling in your chest when you see acts of moral virtue. Elevation leads to inspiration, and you're inspired to also help others, to also be a hero. My hypothesis is that many people watching the \"Miracle on the Hudson\" felt that emotion of elevation, that warmth in their chest, and were just inspired, inspired to call up their mom and say hello, you know, inspired to help their neighbor with their groceries. Any evolutionary theorist would tell you that social connection is maybe sort of the most important kind of like evolutionarily adaptive experiences that human beings have. We band together. We protect each other, we feed each other. If humans didn't feel this emotion of elevation, you would be less likely to survive. You would be less likely to pass on your genes.",
