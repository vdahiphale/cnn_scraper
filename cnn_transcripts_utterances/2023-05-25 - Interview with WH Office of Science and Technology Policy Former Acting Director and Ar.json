Harris about taking on \"The Sign in SidneyBrustein's Window.\" Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in New York. As we enter an uncharted era of artificial intelligence, we begin with the risk of a creation turning on its creator. OpenAI, which is the company behind ChatGPT, is calling for an international regulator, much like the U.N. nuclear watchdog, to prevent a catastrophe endangering our very existence. In a statement on their website, OpenAI's three co-founders write, we can have a dramatically more prosperous future, but we have to manage risk to get there. Given the possibility of existential risk, we cannot just be reactive. The real-world impact of this technology, which is still only in its infancy, is already being felt, like the bogus A.I. image of an explosion at the Pentagon, which caused a selloff on the stock market this week. But it's also driving incredible scientific breakthroughs, like the paralyzed man who just took his first steps in a decade, thanks, in part, to A.I. technology. Alondra Nelson was acting director in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy thereof, and the architect of the Biden administration's \"Blueprint for an A.I. Bill of Rights.\" I ask her about the threats and opportunities and the global moves to regulate A.I. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, what's encouraging here is that conversations are happening early on in the development of a new technological sort of paradigm and we saw that most recently last week, Senator Blumenthal chaired the hearing that you show that included OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. So, we have seen the Biden-Harris administration over the last year show that it's committed to getting automated systems right and A.I. technologies right and making sure that the benefits of them are maximized and the harms are minimized, and that work has been ongoing, including with policies, laws, and regulations that are already on the books that can be expanded to sort of offer guardrails around A.I. and obviously, conversations about new ones that we need, the sides (ph). In addition, I've been encouraged to see congressional leaders, so members of Congress, who, not just the usual suspects or not just the members of Congress who have had careers of working on tech policy, but people who work in the national security space, who think about domestic policies issues as their primary portfolios also thinking about the implications of A.I. And so, I think this moment is different in part because we've got a bigger tent, I think, of congressional leadership understanding that this is really an all-hands-on-deck moment and that they all need to be engaged in learning enough about this technology to be able to offer guidance to the nation about how we can use it responsibly.",

It did have an impact on the stock market and it shook people for a while. That is a very visual demonstration thereof. So, I want to know how dangerous you think that stuff?

So, it was a story -- that was a (INAUDIBLE) story that was about Twitter andabout the -- effectively, the collapse of the verification regime at Twitter that would've offered at least a few signals about whether or not this was true and whether or not it should or could be believed. And so, we no longer have that system of guardrails at Twitter. So, it's worrisome in that case. And it was also worrisome, of course, because it traveled so quickly. And there are things that we could've done, I think to have made a different outcome. In addition to sort of Twitter, I think, behaving more responsibly, it's also the case that companies that make tools that allow the creation of video. So, we're not talking about deliberate bad actors who were going to try to get around these, but at a very basic baseline you should be able to mark or have to be required to identify that you are using A.I. systems in the product that you are creating, whether or not that's a visual product or voice product or it's text. And that was -- when I was working in the White House, up until a few months ago, we developed something called \"The Blueprint for an A.I. Bill of Rights\" and one of the, sort of, principles there was that you should -- there should be notification, one should know when an A.I. system is being used. And I think that's just a kind of fundamental principle that companies have the ability, right now, to exercise in the way that they are sending out these tools for consumers to use them. Again, that's not going to correct for a bad actor who is trying to create a deepfake or a misinformation or disinformation that's intended to do harm, but it could do a long way to prevent casual actors, accidental actors and consumers from being able to create these kinds of dystopian (INAUDIBLE) and using these technologies.",

The tools are too broad in their potential use cases. But that is something that, you know, this misidentifying someone as being, you know, a sexual predator or having false information, you know, what we call so-called hallucinations, there's much more that can be done on the company's side before these things are released.

There are laws and policies and regulations already on the books that are allowing us and can allow us toget traction on the sort of fast-moving pace of automated systems already. And partly what the \"Blueprint for an A.I. Bill of Rights\" was trying to do was to point to some of those. So, it is the case that the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has the ability to regulate discriminatory uses of automated systems for -- if they're used for recruitment, for hiring, if they are discriminating against people with disabilities, it's the case of the Department of Labor can in cases of workers surveillance, when there's workers who are using their rights to organize require reporting of surveillance tools, including automated systems in those moments. Part of -- when he spun out the \"Blueprint for an A.I. Bill of Rights\" we also pointed to things that might be done. So, for example, we're thinking -- you know, there's obviously some concerns in the space of education about, you know, is ChatGPT is going to allow cheating in the like?

So, I wonder what you think about that, because that's happening now, a big, big, you know, disparity.

The communique said that we should advance international discussions on inclusive artificial intelligence governance and interoperability to achieve our common vision and goal of trustworthy A.I. in line with our shared and democratic values. So, finally, that's all well and good for those who shared democratic values, but what happens with known interference and disinformation experts, China, Russia, and all of the other state actors, forget companies, state actors who will potentially not be bound by this?",

And then, there are sort of biosecurity and other kinds of, you know, nuclear security issues that need to be appreciated as well, for a more catastrophic and national security concerns that we have about how the tools might be used by, you know, malign actors, by pernicious actors who are caught intending to do harm. You know, there are -- there have been historically and there being, in the current moment, sort of sets of tools and levers that we can use. So, this include things like international treaties, this include things like export control, like sort of not sending the enabling capabilities, you know, the technical capabilities to actors that we don't think are going to use them safely, sanctions. So, it's the case that there is a whole suite of levers that can apply, I think, in the A.I. research and development space with regards to whether or not they get in the hands of other kinds of actors. But I think there's also an opportunity here for collaboration and conversation, well, be on the G7. So, you know, I think we both want to constrain, on the one hand, what could be the most dangerous uses, but also appreciate that, you know, in many cases, even our adversaries, I think, don't want the most catastrophic outcomes to the extent that they might be indeed planetary.

DR. GROSSMAN: Honestly, I was really concerned. As you know, these bans on abortion generally allow abortion in the cases when the pregnancy threatens the life of the pregnant person. But as a practicing physician for almost 30 years, what constitutes a life-threatening condition is just not always as clear as it might seem, it's not black and white. You know, how severe does the condition need to be, how eminent does the threat need to be? And because these answers are so unclear, I was really concerned that my colleagues in states with these abortion bans were going to be forced to hesitate, to wait to provide the care that was medically necessary. And after the Dobbs decision and these laws started going to effect, we did see some reports from the media about cases where patients have pregnancy complications but they couldn't get the care they need, even though the condition, apparently, threatened their life. And then, at the same time, we also started hearing reports that doctors were being told by their hospitals and their employers not to talk to reporters. They were essentially being muzzled. Their voices were being silenced. And so, that's really why we started this project to give doctors and nurses and nurse midwives, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, anyone who cares for a patient, an opportunity to be able to share these stories about poor quality care anonymously if they wanted to.",

In general, we think of pregnancy as a positive thing. Socially, people are excited about it. And we think of it as resulting in babies and family growth. But in actuality, there are a number of ways, a huge number of ways that can go wrong. And I was really interested in understanding what the patient experience is, what they're facing, what they've learn about, and what are the consequences of having a pregnancy in states that have banned abortion, and therefore, taking that tool out of the toolkit of the prenatal care providers, of maternal fetal specialists, of all the people who are supposed to take care of these patients, what happens to the patient then?

So, we structured it to be fully anonymous to allow people to submit cases, even when their maybe hospital system wasdiscouraging them from speaking about it and even when they were concerned that maybe they potentially would be at risk of legal or criminalization. What we heard from, is we heard from doctors and nurses in states that have abortion bans about cases of patients who they took care of where they weren't able to offer the standard of care. And then, we also heard from physicians who were in states that were receiving these patients, right? So, when the patients weren't able to get standard medical care, many times, they would then travel to a state that didn't have an abortion ban in order to receive what they could have received before the Dobbs decision in their own hospital, from their own providers. In our study, thankfully, we didn't get any reports of deaths. That miraculously, all of the patient cases that we heard about resulted in the patient ultimately getting the care they needed. But I think the question is sort of, what -- at what cost? And what we see in these examples is they had to travel, they had to experience the both physical extension of repercussions of the delay in receiving standard medical care and they had to then be away from family and friends. And for some, they had to then fear that what they were doing was illegal, right? So, we have instances of people doing all of these things that they need as basic medical care under an umbrella of fear that what they're doing could result in them needing to go to jail, being fined, and potentially in long- term, physical repercussions.",

And in fact, it ranks among one of the highest for a country as wealthy as the United States is and particularly among certain groups.

So, these are women who were dying in childbirth or within a short period of time after giving birth. And it's even more devastating in many of the states that have enacted these abortion bans, right? So, these abortion bans are layered on top of a maternal mortality crisis. The people who rode in and shared their cases in our study describes going to extreme lengths, spending a huge amount of time and resources, and it is -- it absolutely follows that that meant that they are taking away time and their effort toward other patients. The other piece that's important to underscore about the effort that these physicians were taking on behalf of their patients to ensure they could get the standard of care is that many of them were relying on their personal social networks. They were contacting their colleagues and friends in other states that didn't have abortion bans. And so, what that means from a patient perspective is that your care and your ability to have standard medical care may actually depend on the social networks of your physician, right? This is something that, suddenly now, whether or not you are able to have standard of care depends on who your physician is friends with.",

And so, this idea in law and often in our public discussion about abortion is that there is some sort of black and white setting, right, that we can say this is an abortion and this is not. And what we get into in actual medical care is a lot more gray and it becomes a lot more difficult to draw a really firm line. And what we see, in this study, is that over and over again, when people try to draw a line through the law, what ended up happening is that patients got sicker, patients were denied the care that they needed, that their physicians, their doctors and nurses knew was the best care. There really is no bright line where you can just segment off abortion and say that this is never necessary or isn't a part of reproductive health care. And instead, what we find is that abortion and the procedures related to abortion are fundamentally important tools in keeping patients safe. And doing things like ensuring their future fertility, ensuring that they have a reduced risk of complications and reduced risk of mortality. DR. GROSSMAN: I certainly recognize that people have different belief systems and may feel differently about abortion bans, and these laws restricting abortion. But I just want people to know that these laws are having an additional effect. They're causing real harm to the very pregnant women that I think we all care about and want to protect. And it just feels really important to me now to share this information about the harms that we are seeing so that people are aware of this as they're having discussion and thinking about what kinds of laws and policies they want in their state. You know, clinicians, like myself, we just want to provide the best high- quality care that we can to patients, and that's no longer possible in some of these states.
