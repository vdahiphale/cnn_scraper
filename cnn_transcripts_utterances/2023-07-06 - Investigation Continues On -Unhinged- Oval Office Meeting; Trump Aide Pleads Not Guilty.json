More of that reporting in a moment. Plus, Donald Trump's personal aide, Walt Nauta, who is charged with helping the former president hide classified documents and lying about it, just pleaded not guilty. He is now Donald Trump's codefendant. And Donald Trump's political pack is paying Nauta's legal fees. So, how will that all work at trial? My panel has thoughts. And how Donald Trump's Republican rivals are making their cases tonight. Here's what Chris Christie told Jake Tapper about Donald Trump's woes. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

You had Sidney Powell, who was one of his legal advisers at the time, Patrick Byrne, former CEO of overstock.com, Michael Flynn, fired national security advisor. They came up with a number of ideas. One of them was to seize voting machines in some of these key states. Another one was to declare martial law. Another one was to put Sidney Powell in as a special counsel to investigate some of these claims of voter fraud that they knew were already disproven. And so, that's what this meeting was about. And we know that Jack Smith's investigators have asked a number of witnesses about this months ago. And more recently, this -- this meeting again became the subject of some of the witness testimony, including from Rudy Giuliani just a couple of weeks ago when he went in for consecutive days of testimony. Here's the January 6th Committee taking testimony from a number of key witnesses who were privy to what happened at that unhinged bonkers meeting. Here you go. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Of course, that is kind of weird because in Moscow and Russia, there is no rule of law. But they are building a public case against him with regard to criminality and corruption.But here's the problem. The problem is that Putin was on television not too many days ago saying, by the way, all that Wagner stuff that you heard about, they are paid by the state. We are the ones who fund them. Putin said this publicly to all Russians who happened to be watching television at that time. So, the Russians already know that if there is any corruption, all the money that they find, all the stuff they found in his apartment, if you put two and two together, it is from the Kremlin. So, how they are going to square the circle and just kind of hope that? I guess the propaganda works. It is often times doesn't Russia.

Apparently, from reports I have seen, he actually has been able to collect some of the articles and money that was confiscated from his apartment.So, I think there is perhaps -- what we are perhaps seeing, Alisyn, is ambivalence on the part of the Kremlin about what to do with Prigozhin because, on the one hand, he is a pain for Putin, but on the other hand, he is also a very useful thug for Putin. We can speculate that, perhaps, Putin does not know exactly the best way to deal with him. But, again, I want to stress that this is all speculation.

He's been much more in favor of free speech. Anybody can post, post what you want. They can hold bunch of people who have been banned and put them back on the platform.

Whether the algorithm promotes stories, promotes posts, promotes comments that are emotionally-triggering and start fights, or whether it does the opposite.

You think of them as very specific kinds of people. But then as the show unfolds, you actually got to know what's really underneath them. I think it brings a lot of complexities, a lot of complexities of black life into the forefront of these people's living room.",

There was backlash when the first seasons came out, when the second season came out, when the third season came out, when the fourth season came out. The truth is that we are one of rare shows that has multiple seasons on Netflix. I think that is a testament to some of the backlash sort of being from perhaps a small group of people screaming very, very loudly. I think Netflix did quite well in spite of the so-called backlash.",
