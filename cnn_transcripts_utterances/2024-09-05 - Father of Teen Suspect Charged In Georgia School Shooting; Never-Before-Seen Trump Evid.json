They advised him of his Miranda rights and kept talking, and they said he's still talking. So, you could get from that the questions that they had about where weapons were stored, what his access to those weapons were, what his access to ammunition would be came from him. The second thing is the search warrant at the house they conducted, which would have given them a first-hand look about how weapons were stored, where they were stored. There are reportedly additional weapons beyond the one that the suspect used in this case. And third, their interview with the father himself, where they asked those questions.

Remember, a 17-year-old suspect killed 10 people, eight students and two teachers.And the attack, it is deeply personal for Clint because his two children were at the school. Now, they, thank God, were safe. He took it upon himself to become an attorney for the victims, and they ended up suing the parents of that suspect. In civil court, Clint argued the parents did not secure the family's guns nor did they get their son proper mental health treatment. Now, a jury ultimately decided the case, the civil matter, that the parents were not responsible. But the suspect and an online story that sold him ammunition, they were found liable. The families were awarded $330 million, but will likely never collect. And the accused gunman has been charged with capital murder, but then was found incompetent to stand trial. Clint McGuire joins me now. Clint, thank you for being here.

She has not -- has not scheduled additional hearings or even a trial date at this time. That updated schedule largely sided to what Special Counsel Jack Smith proposed at a D.C. hearing today.

Here we are, the first hearing in this case before her in 11 months. Time has really flown. But what evidence do you anticipate that we would actually see?
