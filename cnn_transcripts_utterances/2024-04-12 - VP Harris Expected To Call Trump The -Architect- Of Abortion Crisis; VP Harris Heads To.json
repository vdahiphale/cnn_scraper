Vice President Harris is on her way to Arizona where she'll attack Republicans for the state Civil War era abortion ban that could soon be back in effect. Now it's an issue and a state that the Biden campaign hopes will carry them to reelection.Plus, it's the final countdown. The people of the state of New York versus Donald Trump that kicks off on Monday. The former and perhaps future president will spend the next two months in court fighting criminal charges. We have new reporting on team Trump's plans for inside that courtroom. And where does a Republican go when fighting for political survival, Mar-a-Lago, of course. Today Speaker Mike Johnson lands in Florida but will embracing Trump's election denial protect Johnson from the pitchforks in the House Republican caucus. I'm Audie Cornish in for Dana Bash in Washington. And we're going to head behind the headlines at Inside Politics. First up, Vice President Harris has a message for the people of Arizona where abortion rights are rolling back to the time before x rays and antibiotics. That message is Donald Trump did this. And CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is there. Give us a little sense about how the vice president will be talking about this today?",

He poses to personal freedoms and also healthcare in tying these unpopular abortion bans directly to former President Donald Trump.Now in her prepared remarks that were shared with reporters, the vice president is expected to cast this state court ruling as a quote, one of the biggest aftershocks yet from the overturning of Roe v. Wade. She's also expected to say the following quote, Donald Trump is the architect of this healthcare crisis. And as much harm as he has already caused, a second Trump term would be even worse. If Donald Trump gets the chance, he will sign a national abortion ban. How do we know? Look at his record. Congress tried to pass the national abortion ban before in 2017, and then President Trump endorsed it. Of course, the Biden campaign sees abortion as a salient political issue that can mobilize voters, especially in the critical battleground state of Arizona. And in fact, the Biden campaign launched an ad buy -- this week a seven-figure ad buy here in the state following that court ruling, claiming again putting the blame squarely on Donald Trump when it comes to the issue of abortion. And just moments ago, the vice president putting out a fundraising email on this exact issue. So, you can expect that she's going to package this message of the threats that Donald Trump poses particularly on personal freedoms and healthcare all around reproductive rights. Here in Tucson, Arizona, later this afternoon, of course, Democratic strategist tells me that ultimately this state court ruling serves as another data point in the Democratic argument against Republicans on this very issue. And one that she will be hammering home today.",
