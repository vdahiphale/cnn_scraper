That equates to 37 square kilometers in that specific region in that access since the start of the counteroffensive. That's about two-thirds the size of Manhattan for context. But Ukraine is a huge country so this still is very slow and they are making gains in the south as well as they try to split Russia's gains in half and cut off that land bridge between the Donbas and Crimea, having taken one small town of Staromaiorske at the end of last week.
