      "sentences": "Hello, welcome to CNN \"Newsroom\", I'm Max Foster in London. Just ahead, America's top diplomat is in the Middle East, urging calm on all sides after a weekend of violence. Serious questions for British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who just months into the top job is facing yet another controversy. And the fewer the letters the higher the price and look at Hong Kong's ultra-competitive vanity plates market.U.S. Secretary of States Antony Blinken has landed in Israel, where he'll work to help restore calm following a shocking weekend of violence between Israelis and Palestinians in the region. Israeli authorities say they're taking strict measures to manage escalating unrest after a man they call the terrorists fatally shot seven people near a Jerusalem synagogue on Friday. That after Israeli forces killed nine Palestinians on Thursday in a raid on a refugee camp in the West Bank City of Jenin. Just after landing Secretary Blinken said everyone has a responsibility to calm tensions, and he condemned the recent violence. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: So Friday's attack was more than an attack on individuals. It was also an attack on the Universal Act of practicing one's faith. We condemn it in the strongest terms. We also condemned the subsequent terrorist attack in Jerusalem on Saturday in which a father and son were wounded. And we condemn all those who celebrate these and any other acts of terrorism that take innocent lives. No matter whom the victim is, or what they believe? (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He'll meet with the Prime Minister and broader session with some of the Prime Ministers, other officials he meets one on one with Prime Minister Netanyahu. We're expecting them both to make some comments are made also with the Foreign Minister.The Foreign Minister, who I - was there to greet Secretary Blinken when he arrived in Tel Aviv, but yes, his message is absolutely going to be one of support for Israel in the face of shootings such as was witnessed outside the synagogue in the past couple of days. And the message will also be one to try to find ways to calm tensions. And on that account, you will probably look to Prime Minister Netanyahu not to rush ahead with some of the things that he is proposing, which is a potential revoking of the citizenship rights of families of Palestinian attackers and also about the comments made by the Prime Minister in the cabinet session over the weekend, that he will be strengthening settlements. We know his far right coalition the Prime Minister's far right coalition wants him to do that to expand settlements. And potentially these moments of tension are a time when he can move forward with that. And that is something that would bring anger from the Palestinian side. So potentially there, the Secretary of State looking for the Prime Minister to find different language and a different way through this moment but the coalition of the Prime Minister is strong that this time he may face some international pressure, there may be growing economic pressures. There are internal pressures as well, from the main from opposition factions here in Israel. But in essence of his leadership and of the coalition that he commands at the moment, Prime Minister Netanyahu is in a relatively strong position.",

But that influence and the power they have over Netanyahu, because of the simple nature of Israeli politics will be very evident.According to statements put out in advance of Secretary of State Anthony Blinken's meetings with Israeli and Palestinian leaders, he used to say a two state solution is the only possible outcome to avoid spiraling violence. And that may sound nice on paper. But that seems like a very out of touch, almost pointless statement coming at this time. More immediate steps you might try to accomplish or to restore any security coordination between the Israelis and Palestinians. After Thursday's Israeli raid in the West Bank City of Jenin, the Palestinians threatened to cancel or stop coordinating with Israel. And that's one of those elements that are important for both sides on the security side, and it's unpopular with each of the governments and with the people so tends to be done quietly. And we've seen the Palestinians threatened to cancel it. It's unclear to what extent they have pulled back from the coordination, but that might be the smaller sort of step he tries to take to move this process forward and to see if there really is any possibility of de- escalation. The West Bank has been boiling for quite some time. Now, it might not have made the news on a daily basis. But there were Israeli experts and some of the strategic thinkers there who clearly saw what were happening in the West Bank. So it was possible to see maybe not these specific incidents, but the rise in violence come in quite ways away, that doesn't make it any easier to stop. And now that it's begun to spin up, the question is, how do you get off that cycle? We've seen calls from Egypt, were Blinken just came from to de-escalate as well as from some other Gulf countries. So those are important statements, what impact they have in the ground is far from clear.",

So the majority of the worshippers in that mosque are actually law enforcement officials.And it's almost like there's a sense of deja vu for the people of Peshawar, because just last year, there was a similar attack, a similar blast at a mosque in the City of Peshawar, where more than 60 people died. We've been told that there are still people stuck in the rubble of this mosque because the entire roof fell in. So their rescue efforts still underway it's dark now in Pakistan, and this happened in the afternoon. So it's been many hours since the last itself took place. There's an investigation underway. The Prime Minister in a statement said that it's a suicide blast. We're being told by police officials that it's probably a suicide blast. But like you said, there hasn't been a claim of responsibility. But there has been in the past couple of months and at least since the fall of Kabul in 2021. In the summer of 2021, there has been an increase in militant attacks in Pakistan. Especially in the north of Pakistan, Islamabad the capital where I am, has been on at in a state of high alert. For the past couple of weeks, there was an attempted suicide attack in the heart of the capital city just at the end of December, just a couple of weeks ago. So there is this heightened sense of fear. In Pakistan there is this understanding that the situation which in the past couple of years, the security situation in Pakistan, which had considerably improved is not the same anymore. And like I said earlier, it's a sense of deja vu for the people of Peshawar, who have already suffered many, many such attacks in this city, Max.",

They're saying that they feel that they were thrown into a hopeless fight in which they claim and it's all alleged we've got no independent verification for this for some 300 dead in one series of operations. The Ukrainians are equally saying that the Russians are suffering heavy losses there; they would be making that claim. Of course, they are the enemy of the Russians in this fight.

The fact that Boris Johnson looms so large, and he's still taking a very sort of powerful role in Britain's support of Ukraine he's just been to the country he's met with Zelenskyy. We know how much Zelenskyy has appreciated Boris Johnson's leadership in Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Ukraine's defense. So that's going to continue to be a problem for him. And also, a lot of the electorate needs Sunak to distance himself from Boris Johnson, but the party will resent Sunak if he does try and fully distanced himself which is not really possible to do anyway.
