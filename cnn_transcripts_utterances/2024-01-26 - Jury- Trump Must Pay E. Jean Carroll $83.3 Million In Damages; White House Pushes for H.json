Plus, as fighting intensifies in Gaza, you'll hear from an American doctor who has just returned from the area. Why he calls this conflict and what he saw on the ground? The worst he's ever seen. And new tonight, a potential border shutdown. CNN learning a key group of senators have now agreed to close the southern border if illegal migrant crossings hit a specific number. Let's go OUTFRONT.

      "sentences": "Good evening. I'm Erica Hill, in for Erin Burnett.OUTFRONT tonight, breaking news, $83.3 million. That is what a jury says Donald Trump must pay E. Jean Carroll for defaming her while he was president. This is the woman, of course, Trump was found liable for sexually abusing. $83.3 million is a massive number. There's no way getting around that. It was agreed upon after nearly three hours of deliberations. Here's how that number breaks down: $7.3 million for emotional harm, $11 million for damaging Carroll's reputation. The bulk of that money, though, as you see, some $65 million is in punitive damages. That's money intended to stop the former president's ongoing attacks against E. Jean Carroll, attacks that he continued even today, firing off some two dozen social media posts after storming out of the court during closing arguments. Now, many of those did mention E. Jean Carroll. Donald Trump was not in court when the verdict was read. He left shortly before the jury came to a decision. He had to get to an airport so he can get on a plane to get to a political event in Nevada. He did though respond to the decision on social media, calling it, quote, absolutely ridiculous, saying he fully disagrees with the decision and will be appealing. There is a lot to get to here tonight. Let's begin with Brynn Gingras, who's outside the courthouse in New York, Kristen Holmes is in Washington. So, Brynn, what happens now in this case?",

Jean Carroll was asking for in the initial lawsuit, and as you sort of underscore yourself, I want to sort of put fine point on that punitive damage number, $65 million, but it shows that the jurors really picked up here on what E. Jean Carroll's attorneys were saying in closing arguments, that the only way to stop Trump is to basically hit him where it hurts, which is his pocketbook. They said on those closing arguments that this verdict was meant to punish Trump for what he did, and continues to do, but all to send a larger message that rules apply to everyone, including Donald Trump.Now, his attorneys said that he shouldn't have to pay for all the threats that E. Jean Carroll received, but, of course, jurors not buying that. As you said, they returned a verdict in just under three hours, a jury of seven men and two women. And while that verdict was read in court, E. Jean Carroll was holding the hands of both of her attorneys and then hugging them after realizing the amount that she will receive in damages. And as for Trump, as you noted as well, he was not in the courtroom. He did tweet immediately after saying that, you know, this verdict was ridiculous and that he did plan to appeal. Now, what happens next is that the judge will make a final judgment in this case. We expect that to happen in the next few days. But, Erica, something to point out before he let the jurors go, he thanked them, and then he said that they don't have to speak publicly about serving on this jury and actually advised them that they don't -- Erica.",

And just to be clear before I read this statement, there is absolutely no evidence that Joe Biden had anything to do with this case, of course. This is a defamation case in New York. So here's what he saidboth the verdicts and will be appealing this whole Biden directed witch hunt focused on me and the Republican Party. Our legal system is out of control and being used as a political weapon. They have taken away our First Amendment rights. This is not America. One thing I do want to point out here is that one of the things Donald Trump has tried to do is use this in his favor while he's campaigning, running for president, and sometimes it is successful, not just with his base but also with Republicans who feel like the system is rigged, and those are the people that I talked to even though this has nothing to do with Joe Biden, he has managed to link everything together and then say it's political persecution.",

You know, when I heard -- I was sitting in my office and everyone sort of gasp as we all heard this number, as we heard it from reporters live outside the courthouse, you have dug extensively into the finances of Donald Trump. Bottom line, is there $83 million available?ANDREA BERNSTEIN, AWARD-WINNING INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST, PROPUBLICA, NPR:  I mean, probably yes, because he does own assets. They're worth a good deal of money. I mean, one of the really interesting things is yesterday in the courtroom when it was wrapping up its case the plaintiffs played a deposition of Donald Trump from the business fraud trial, and what's at issue in that trial is how much money he has. So, he was talking I have Mar-a-Lago worth $1.5 billion and the Doral Golf course is worth $2.5 billion and I have $400 million in cash. So they played the deposition in that case in this case where Donald Trump is saying I have $4 billion and $400 million in cash and he's saying he has a lot of money. So he was sort of hoist on his own petard. He's made these claims and they were able to say to the jury he has this. Does he have that money? I think he could certainly come up with it, but, I mean, $83 million is real money for Donald Trump. He cares about small amounts of money. In his licensing deals, he would care about being paid for the robes and hotel rooms people purchased. So, this is a very big verdict, and I think we all noticed that he didn't do what he's been doing every day, including until yesterday, which is essentially saying sometimes in the courtroom you can hear him saying, I didn't know the woman, I don't know her, or when he was watching a videotape of himself criticizing her, he said that's the truth. I mean, he is talking out loud in the courtroom defaming her repeatedly there, and then sometimes after court he would give press conferences, defame her again, and that would become evidence the next day. So that's what the trial was like.",

He believes that he was wronged in this case, but perhaps the message that E.

And he really wanted to be able to say I didn't do it.And the judge said very clearly, you don't get a do-over. You don't get -- you already had a chance to testify in another case, you chose not to. You're not allowed today come here and relitigate. And he asked his lawyer, Alina Habba, have you personally told your client he's not allowed to say this? Before she could answer, Trump started to say, I don't know the woman and et cetera, et cetera, and all the things he keeps saying. And the judge only allowed her to ask him a yes or no question, which is did you say this to defend yourself from an acquisition? And it wasn't clear when he was thinking about coming to the courtroom yesterday whether he had in his mind he was going to say I didn't do it. But by the time he got to the stand, the judge made it perfectly clear that he could not say these things. And one thing that was interesting is Trump's criminal lawyer in New York, the criminal lawyer for the hush money case was also in the courtroom, and there was a question about, you know, would he be violating any kind of criminal statute, maybe Ryan knows more about this, if he got up on the stand and said something a judge said you were not allowed today say. So, that was really what was at issue. After his three minutes of testimony, he did actually storm out. Today was a quiet day. He didn't talk while he was leaving, but yesterday he did.

You can't go further with this.I think that's really bad on her part. I teach law students this would be class 101. This is what you should never do in a classroom because she's also in a sense dirtying herself in terms of credibility vis-a- vis the jury. The judge is probably the most credible person in the room. The jury doesn't just have a relationship with the two lawyers but it's also the judge. He's the trusted source.

In terms of the key players all getting together in Europe this weekend, I mean, we're talking about the people who were able to craft that last deal that led to the release of dozens of hostages, a week long pause in the fighting and the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza.It's also because we're starting to see some of details emerge of the proposals being put on the table which include the longest ever pause in fighting that Israel has ever put on the table, up to two months of a pause in fighting, the phased release of hostages starting with the remaining women, elderly men, civilians effectively, and then moving onto soldiers as well as the bodies of some 28 Israeli hostages who were also being held as bargaining chips by Hamas. But we also need to be clear these two sides are not yet at the point of a break through for agreement here. They still remain very far apart. Israel for its part will not agree as part of these negotiations up until now to a permanent cease-fire to see the release of all these hostages while Hamas is pushing for an end to this war altogether as part of this and also hoping to get its senior leaders to escape unscathed. So a lot of progress being made, but certainly still a lot of work to be done.",

What we'll witness in Gaza is more shortage of food, of medicine, of clean, of medicine supplies, of fuel, lack of communication because of the destruction of communication.So the aid is not getting through. There's about 100 trucks getting through Gaza every day. What is needed is about 1,000 trucks of all kinds of stuff. People are hungry. People don't have access to clean water. Patients in the hospitals are dying because of lack of simple supplies like blades and tools for fractures, antibiotics. Patients don't have insulin, there's no seizure medications, no common blood pressure medications. These things should be happening, should be getting through the border, and what I've understood is that there's no political will from the parties involved, Israel, the neighboring countries and the United States of America to make sure that these supplies are getting through and people are getting some relief in Gaza. We know people die out of hunger and there are signs of hunger especially in the north. We don't want people to die because of diabetes and patients with diabetes who will need insulin are dying because of lack of insulin. And these simple things are not happening for no clear reason besides the lack of political help. So I hope that the Biden administration hear this plea and understand they can influence the situation and influence the parties in the region especially Israel, tto make sure that more trucks of aid are getting through Gaza and more aid is distributed so that way people can get some relief, some food, clean water to prevent outbreak, to prevent further suffering of the population.",
