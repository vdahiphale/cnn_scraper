It was absolutely incredible.There was a point in extra time where honestly, I didn't know whether I was going to laugh or cry and I wasn't cheering for either the team so can you imagine what it must have been like to be an Argentine or a French fan in this stadium. It looked as though Argentina had this one in the bag and Lionel Messi was going to fulfill his destiny, finally getting his hands on the World Cup trophy that has eluded him throughout his career because he has won everything else. But the French seem to come from nowhere and turned the game around, towards the end, then Argentina went back in front with another goal from Lionel Messi and then France equalized again with a hattrick from their megastar, Kylian Mbappe, and then it went to penalties. And by the end of it, I mean it really took us a good minute to really process what we had just witnessed. And it wasn't just the drama and the entertainment, which was so compelling. It was all these other storylines. Mbappe is an extraordinary young man. He came within a whisker of two world titles at the age of 23. That's Pele territory. But as it is, it is Lionel Messi that is the star of the show, and this is a moment that means so much to him and all of Argentina.",

The other big story we are following this afternoon, the House Select Committee investigating January 6 prepares for its final act. In less than 24 hours, the panel is expected to make criminal referrals to the Justice Department recommending the prosecution of former President Donald Trump. The referrals are expected to include the charges of insurrection, obstruction of an official proceeding, and conspiracy to defraud the Federal government. It will be the culmination of almost a year and a half investigation into the former President, his allies, and the attempt to overturn the 2020 election. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP.

More on all of that coming up in a little bit. You're live in the CNN NEWSROOM. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [15:20:03] ACOSTA: The City of El, Paso Texas has declared a State of Emergency as officials brace for a massive influx of migrants. We're already seeing an uptick in border crossings, but officials are worried that number could double in the coming days. That's because the pandemic- era policy which allows Border Patrol to turn migrants away is set to be lifted on Wednesday. CNN's Gustavo Valdes is on the Mexican side of the Southern border.

The Mayor admitting that they could see up to 6,000 people on Wednesday, and they don't believe the Federal government is prepared to deal with them. I just spoke with our reporters that we have along the border in Reynosa on the other side of McAllen, they tell me, in the Mexican side, they have 10,000 people waiting for Wednesday. So, this is not a problem only in El Paso, it is going to be all along the border. And right now the situation on both sides of the border is also the weather. It's about 42 degrees, about seven degrees Celsius. It feels a lot colder than that. People waiting here with little makeshift fire places. We see this family we've been following for a few days, they are just picking up the trash left behind by other people and they are trying to stay warm. You see it's just as a family, small children, many of them don't have a place to stay. They just try to stay warm until Wednesday and see what happens. Many believe that Wednesday is an important date, and they will be allowed in.

So many don't believe that there is a standing to keep that policy in place on a legal basis, being that it is not a matter of immigration policy, it was a health issue. Perhaps something needs to be worked out in other existing laws to allow the Federal government to act more swiftly.
