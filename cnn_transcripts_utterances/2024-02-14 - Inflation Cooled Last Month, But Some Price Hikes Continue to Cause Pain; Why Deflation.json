If you said, the 15th century you`ve won our hearts. According to the British library, the oldest known Valentine was written in 1415 by Charles to Duke of Orleans to his wife while he was imprisoned in the Tower of London. Well, today is Valentine`s Day. And when we think of this special holiday, of course, we think of love. We think of romance. But love can also hurt sometimes, especially when it comes to a breakup. So we spoke to a biological anthropologist who explains to U.S. exactly how our brains react when we get rejected and what can help to repair a broken heart. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DR. HELEN FISHER, BIOLOGICAL ANTHROPOLOGIST: Romantic love and attachment are basic survival mechanisms that evolved millions of years ago so that we could find the right partner and send our DNA into tomorrow. It`s a basic human survival mechanism.",

      "sentences": "Nobody gets how to love alive. We all suffer when we`ve been rejected. When I and my colleagues put 17 people who had just been rejectedin love. We`ve found about six or seven things that happen in the brain of everybody. A brain region with feelings of romantic love remain active. You don`t fall out of love with somebody just because they talk to. As a matter of fact, you can even love them more. A brain region link with feelings of deep attachment become active. You`re still feeling attached to the person. A brain region link with physical pain becomes active when you`ve been rejected. And then there`s three brain regions like with craving and addiction, particularly a particular little factory called the nucleus accumbens. And that factory becomes active with any kind of addiction like gambling addiction, food addiction, and it`s a brain region that becomes active as well. When you have been rejected in love. I do think that romantic love is an addiction, can be a perfectly wonderful addiction when it`s going well, and a perfectly horrible addiction when it`s going poorly. Basically we suffer because from ancient times, this jeopardized your ability to send your DNA on into tomorrow. And that`s your survival. No wonder we suffer so much.",
