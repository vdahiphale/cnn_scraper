Well the data for an Israeli ground incursion into Rafah has been set that is the word from Israel's Prime Minister who today said no force in the world will stop it from happening. Benjamin Netanyahu's comments come in the face of intense international pressure to avoid an Israeli offensive in Rafah at all costs that city, the last refuge for more than 1 million Palestinians who have fled fighting elsewhere in Gaza. Well, the Prime Minister spoke just days after Israel withdrew its troops from Khan Yunis in an apparent preparation for a Rafah operation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I don't think in the last 15years, Benjamin Netanyahu gave us a lot of reason to treat his comments as credible. And therefore, I sometimes feel that we're sort of feeding the troll by discussing the every statement that he makes about the Rafah operation, as if this thing is really happening. And I think we should check what Netanyahu does not what he says about this operation. I'll give you an example. Yesterday, the Israeli Ministry of Defense, Yoav Gallant spoke to the Secretary of Defense of the United States, Lloyd Austin, he did not tell him that there was a date for an operation in Rafah. Neither did any other Israeli official in his talks with the U.S. government. Therefore, I think we should take this thing with 30 pounds of salt and check what Netanyahu does. And until now -- didn't get any order to move forward with an operation Rafah or to move forward with an evacuation or give you another example. The U.S. and Israel was supposed to have talks on the operation Rafah this week. The Israeli side is the one who asked you know what, it's not urgent. Let's do it next week. So when that's the situation, I think, you know, I'm not saying an operation Rafah can happen sometime down the road, but I don't think that we're there yet.",

Well happening now a court in Michigan has just convened for the sentencing hearing for the parents of school shooter Ethan Crumbley after they weren't convicted of manslaughter.

But because they purchased a gun, which he used, and the son was allowed to get gain access to it. But I want you to look at these live pictures because they have not been in the same courtroom together for months, if not since 2022. I saw Jennifer just looking at her husband right there. They're still married. They have been separated, they cannot speak there is an order that they cannot communicate at all through letter or any way, shape or form. But I think today is also going to be about the victims because we do understand that the eight family members of those kids that were gunned down by their son will be able to make victim impact statements. They will step up to the podium. They will talk how their life has changed. They may address James and Jennifer Crumbley together, but the emotion will be so high in this courtroom. And that is the judge right there. Cheryl Matthews, she will start it all off and there will be a procedure that they follow.

This could start a trend where the parent is now responsible for what the minor child does.
