In two of the three blue wall states, Michigan and Wisconsin, Harris is showing a slight lead. The race tied, though, in Pennsylvania. And that is where our coverage begins with CNN's Danny Freeman, who is in Harrisburg with the Harris campaign.Danny, the Vice President addressing Biden's comments today. Tell us what we're hearing from her. DANNY FREEMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: That's right. Vice President Harris, of course, hoping to come to Harrisburg today in addition to the other battleground states she's visiting to make that pitch about unity. But this comment made by President Biden that you just referenced really has been dominating a lot of the news cycle over the past 12 to 24 hours since that statement was made. The Harris campaign understands this was not a good comment, did not come at a good time and it's not really what the campaign wants to be speaking at today. But as you noted, Vice President Harris has already earlier really distanced herself from those comments, saying that she strongly disagrees with criticizing people based on who they're voting for. She also noted that she thought that President Biden clarified his statements yesterday as well. Meanwhile, we're also learning a little bit more about the campaign's thinking through this particular issue as it's come up for the past day and a half or so. MJ Lee reporting that on the one hand, one advisor said we're not going to lose a single vote, referencing this particular incident right here. Another former administration official, however, saying, quote, \"The Biden gaffe yesterday is just so infuriating. Nobody wants him out there.\" So we'll see how much we see of President Biden in these final days of the campaign. But again, back to where I am right now and where we started earlier. Vice President Harris really trying to drill home, even in the wake of those comments, but even before that as well, that her ticket is the bipartisan one, that a vote for the Harris-Walz ticket is a vote for country over party. Take a listen to what she said in Raleigh about this subject not too long ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS (D), VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, CURRENT PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: And it is time for a new chapter where we stop with the pointing fingers at each other and instead let us lock arms with one another, knowing we have so much more in common than what separates us.

Now, of course, what we expect from him is more of what we saw earlier today.He is really trying to take this opportunity with those Biden remarks to flip the narrative from those pre-program remarks, from that joke that comedian told that was vile where he talked about Puerto Rico being a floating island of garbage and turn the tables on Democrats. He spoke about this in North Carolina earlier today. Here's what he said about those Biden remarks. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, CURRENT PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: My response to Joe and Kamala is very simple, you can't lead America if you don't love Americans. You just can't. And you can't be president if you hate the American people and there's a lot of hatred there. Look how they've treated you. They've treated you like garbage, frankly. They've treated you like garbage. You know what, the truth is they've treated our whole country like garbage, whether they meant to or not. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But Donald Trump has often criticized Democrats in some of the harshest of rhetoric, talking about how they're the enemy within when he's talking about Democratic leadership, attacking the party as a whole. So this message of unity is a new one. However, that doesn't take away from the fact that what Biden said has caused outrage among a number of Republicans. They're just going to continue to beat that down as they respond to those remarks.",

Also, we heard from the governor last night saying this was just Donald Trump being Donald Trump.

We don't have any indication that there is right now. What we're hearing from state and local officials is they are urging patience. They are urging these voters to be patient, to go through the process and saying that they are doing everything they can to ensure that this is a safe and secure election.

You're seeing a disproportionate number of these voters are either first-time voters or they're low-propensity voters, voters who are regular, may not show up. And you compare that to the Democratic voters who are showing up, who are much more consistent voters as a percentage overall.In particular, in the Sun Belt states: Nevada, Arizona, North Carolina, Georgia, you're seeing Republicans for the first time in a number of cycles, not even looking at 2020, which, yes, was a bit of an aberration. But compared to 2016, 2012, 2008, Republicans are actually going to go into Election Day with a lead in a number of these states, which they haven't done before. And, by the way, it's going to be a much closer margin going into Election Day in the Rust Belt states than it was in 2020 or 2016 as well. You are seeing signs of enthusiasm. And if you're a Republican strategist trying to parse who those are, these are the people you want to be showing up. These are not the people who are just going to show up every single year and vote for you regardless. These are the folks who maybe are listening to that Joe Rogan podcast or maybe keep debating about, eh, do I want to go out to vote or sit on the couch. They are showing up right now. That's the reason why you see Republicans so optimistic right now.",

The early vote data in general is down for both parties. Republicans are excited because they do see growth in the early vote data for them because more Republicans are voting early now than they did in 2020, even though Donald Trump is still poo- pooing early vote and mail-in vote, which I think is bad for Republicans in general.But right now, Democrats lead in the early vote by over 500,000 votes nationwide and especially in the battleground states. So that is a good number for Democrats. However, we're also seeing independents and Republicans who are voting. We can't really say who they're voting for. And I have a prediction that they, the independents, are going to break for Vice President Harris. And there are a lot of Republicans, and I know this from people that are going door to door, who are telling me, Maria, I am going to vote for Kamala Harris. I have had it with Donald Trump and the hatred that he is spewing. That is not what I represent, especially women.
