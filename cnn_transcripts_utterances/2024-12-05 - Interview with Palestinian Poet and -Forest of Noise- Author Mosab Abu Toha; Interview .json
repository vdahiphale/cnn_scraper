I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. The Middle East is in meltdown. The Syrian civil war has reawakened with a vengeance as rebel forces take two major cities, Hama and Aleppo, from the Iran and Russia-backed government forces. They are also going to be pressing on Damascus, the capital, they say. While just across the border, it is fire on all sides. The flimsy ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah holding, despite both sides alleging the other is violating its terms. And Israel keeps up its seemingly endless assault bombardment on Gaza. Just this week, Gazan authorities say 47 more people were killed in airstrikes, including six more children. Israel says it was targeting Hamas militants. Now, perhaps some of the rawest descriptions of this destruction are not coming from aid organizations or even reporters, but from writers, like Palestinian poet Mosab Abu Toha. He was forced to flee his home in Northern Gaza a year ago. Since then, he and his wife say they've lost almost 100 family members in the violence. Watching now from afar in the United States, Mosab joined me from New York to talk about his new book of poetry, \"Forest of Noise,\" which captures the horror and grief of this time and is receiving critical acclaim and brisk sales. Mosab Abu Toha, welcome to our program. MOSAB ABU TOHA, PALESTINIAN POET AND AUTHOR, \"FOREST OF NOISE\":  Thank you, Christiane.",

You came from Beit Lahia and that is, under attack now again and others, and the Israelis are telling people to leave.

So, people -- there isa school in Beit Lahia called Abu Tammam School and it was one of the last school shelters where people in Beit Lahia stayed in. They tried not to leave Beit Lahia because they know that if they leave it, they will, they are not going back. This is what Israel is doing. And we see this on Israeli media that said that settlers are going to Gaza to Beit Lahia and Bet Hanoun with some maps of some settlements that they are going to build. So, people in Beit Lahia know that if they leave Beit Lahia, they are not going back. So, people tried to remain there. But unfortunately, Israel keeps -- just like they did with Kamal Adwan Hospital, they dropped some grenades from quadcopters. They even bombed some classrooms, some hospital rooms in the past few days and few weeks even. So, people tried to remain, but it was impossible for them to stay. So, yesterday the Israeli army broke into the school and they expelled all the people from Abu Tammam School. And we saw the marches of people who are going from Beit Lahia to Gaza City. And there was an Israeli checkpoint still there. It's near the Indonesian hospital and that's where they usually let women and children who are younger than 15 to proceed but they keep the men. And that's where they abducted my brother-in-law. That's -- what -- that's where they abducted my wife's cousin, Sohaib (ph), who was the only survivor of his family, which was killed on October 26th this year. He was in a hospital and I would like to tell you his story. Sohaib (ph) was the only survivor of his family and he was -- he had the clearance from the World Health Organization to be taken from the Kamal Adwan Hospital to Al Shifa Hospital or Al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City because in Kamal Adwan Hospital, Israel expelled all doctors and nurses and even cleaners. So, he waited for a few weeks before the World Health Organization managed to get him a clearance to go from Kamal Adwan Hospital in Beit Lahia to Al Shifa Hospital in Gaza City. And when he arrived at the checkpoint, he had a relative of his, his uncle. And he was the one who told us this story. So, the Israeli soldiers opened the ambulance doors and they said, welcome, Sohaib (ph). We will treat you later. That was November 10th. And until today, we don't have any information about Sohaib (ph). And this is the case of so many of my friends and family members.",

But the fact that Israel not only occupied Rafah in Maythis year, but they also destroyed the Rafah Border Crossing. They destroyed the Rafah City, the border -- the city where -- which is -- through which you can go to Egypt and then to the outside world. And Israel has divided the Gaza Strip into three parts right now. There is Southern Gaza and there is Northern Gaza. Northern Gaza itself was divided into two parts. North Gaza and Gaza City. So, Gaza has imposed its military grip on the Gaza Strip. And even, by the way, Christiane, even before October 7th, Israel had a say on who enters Gaza, even Gazans, and who leaves Gaza. They decide with the Egyptians when to open, when to close the border crossing. Israel has been occupying our sea. Because they say that in 2005 Israel left Gaza and Hamas was -- no, this is a big lie. Gaza remained under siege. Now, why hasn't I been able in my life to sail in my sea? And why haven't other people been able to sail into our sea and see us in Gaza? Is this not a Gaza Sea? And the sky, we haven't -- we have -- I'm 32 years old, and I mentioned this in one of my poems, I've never seen an airliner in the sky over Gaza. 32 years, I've never seen an airliner. Not to say that we also don't have an airport in Gaza, but I've never seen an airliner. The only kinds of planes that I saw were F-16s, F-35s, helicopters, drones. I've never seen any airliners in my world. I mean, how does the world expect us to be? Why hasn't anyone come to us and talked to us about our lives? How many officials from the west came to Gaza after October 7th? Fifteen months -- not a single official came to Gaza to talk to people and ask and meet with just with the doctors, with the nurses, with the university professors, with the poets, talk to families, intense, ask them, oh, what can we do?

We see it show up on the phones of people around murdered dissidents, journalists. It's been linked to hundreds of acts of violence around the world. But what I've been tracking in recent years of my reporting is that in one western democracy after another, countries that supposedly have protections against these kinds of intrusions in their bodies of law, we're also seeing scandals in which this kind of surveillance technology is overused. We've seen it happen in Poland, in Greece, in Spain, and a lot of this documentary, \"Surveilled,\" is actually set in Spain, where we document one of the largest clusters on record of peaceful civil society members and opposition politicians being hacked in this way. And I can tell you, Michelle, from my own experience being followed around, surveilled in various ways, including sometimes high-tech ways where someone was following me, tracking my GPS data, it is not just information gathering, it is intimidation. And it shrinks the space for opposition expression of all kinds. So, it's something we should all just be really concerned about.

It seems like it hasn't been deployed operationally yet. But in my latest story, I talk about how they have -- despite some efforts under the Biden administration to limit the government's ability to purchase foreign spyware, they've gone ahead and purchased more. Under the Biden administration, the Department of Homeland Security just purchased another really potent form of Israeli spyware technology, a software called Graphite built by a firm called Paragon. That contract is currently being reviewed. But you're going to have a situation where the new administration comes into power in this country with this kind of tech at its fingertips, and this is a new administration that has threatened to go after journalists, to go after opposition members.

You know, this is a highly innovative tech setting in general with a really strong pool of talent, but it's also specifically a place where people come out of mandatory military service, they come out of the intelligence units in the Israeli military, and they have a skill set pretty early in their career after they serve, that they then apply starting these companies and working for these companies. So, that's one reason why you have Israel at the forefront of this kind of private tech, and there's a really close relationship with the Israeli government and these private spyware makers. For example, the NSO Group has been reported to be deploying its technology on behalf of the Israeli government in its current conflict in the Palestinian territories to try to find hostages. And by the way, on the other hand, we talked to Palestinian politicians in this film who say, look, it's not just in this current conflict, for years, Israel has been using the Palestinian population as a lab that they surveil activists in that space.",

In The New Yorker article, you detail how ICE, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, acquired Paragon spyware technology under the Biden administration with indications that it could be used more aggressively in the incoming Trump administration. For the record, you spoke to Nathaniel Fick, the Biden administration's ambassador at large for cyberspace and digital policy. And he defended, quote, \"legitimate law enforcement and national security uses of these technologies.\" But let's -- you know, we are a couple of weeks away from the Trump administration returning to office. They've made it very clear that they expect to have a very aggressive deportation policy. How might this technology be used in the surface of that?",

One is even for people who are caught up in the immigration issues at play here, people whoare here in a completely permissible way and they're awaiting immigration proceedings of some kind, people who are here illegally, I think that there is also a good argument from human rights advocates that the private communications of those people shouldn't be up for grabs without a specific law enforcement warrant that is about more than just their status. And what I've heard from these privacy law experts again and again is technology purchased by the Department of Homeland Security specifically, that's often the institution that gets the technology that is legally questionable, because they have a clear national security rationale that shields them from scrutiny of it. And once it's in the hands of DHS, what I've been told again and again is, you can't guarantee that it's just being used by ICE. We don't know the answer to that, because there hasn't been transparency on that. So, I think it's pivotal that individuals demand Congress demands, going forward, that there is more transparency about who's using this technology and when. So, this is really going to be a protection that has to come through checks and balances, through an outside counterbalance in the form of Congress. You know, this is a largely unregulated space that I think the history that you just described shows us desperately needs regulation as the technology becomes more pervasive and more intrusive.",

There are the people who see all of the scandals that have emerged around NSO Group, and their responseis, well, we're going to keep selling to the bad guys, and we're going to be more secretive about it. And then, there are the players who see the lucrative market for selling to the American government and other big western governments. And they realize that those governments are going to be averse to association with scandal. And so, they try to present themselves as a cleaner alternative. Paragon is one of those companies. Part of their pitch is, well, we're going to police more expertly whether our technology is abused. You know, we're going to be a little cleaner about which client states we deal with. We're not going to deal with the real bad guys. That was also the pitch that NSO Group made. Whether Paragon succeeds in that, we don't know, but that is what they say. They say, look, we're trying to limit ourselves to countries that aren't going to abuse this. And a source at that company told me that the vetting process that led to the Department of Homeland Security purchasing their technology included them demonstrating over and over again that they had robust mechanisms for preventing their other client states from spying on Americans. But pivotally, and there's no guardrails on DHS itself, spying on Americans. Those guardrails have to come from within.\\",
