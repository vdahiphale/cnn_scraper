Nor did Carlson focus on the fact that the mom nearly broke into the House Chamber where members and staffers were barricaded, or that rioters shouting \"Hang Mike Pence\" came within just a few dozen feet and a couple of seconds of actually finding him, or that then Minority Leader McCarthy was so rattled by rioters breaking into his office as he called the former president demanding he call off the mob, only to be told in so many words to pound sand. This reality is what Tucker Carlson downplayed last night by suggesting that the existence of less violent looking video meant the violence was no big deal. In short, conning people. Here is what some Republican senators who were there say about Carlson's portrayal of what they actually experienced firsthand. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. THOM TILLIS (R-NC): I think it's bullshit. I was here. I was down there. And I saw maybe a few tourists, a few people who got caught up in things, but when you see police barricades breached, when you see police officers assaulted. All of that -- SEN. MIKE ROUNDS (R-SD): I thought it was an insurrection at that time, I still think it was an insurrection today. SEN. JOHN THUNE (R-SD): I don't know how you want to describe it, but it was -- it was an attack on the Capitol. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He is apparently livid at the handling of this.As for Speaker Kevin McCarthy, he spoke tonight to reporters including CNN's Manu Raju. He said he has no regrets about his decision to give Carlson the footage arguing he did it in the name of transparency, which is similar to his justification last week when he said, \"I think sunshine lets everybody make their own judgment.\" That's what he said then. But this was really never about sunshine, it was about appealing to the former President and his most extreme supporters in Congress, the ones who helped him become Speaker. And if that meant sowing doubts about the bravery of Capitol Police and DC Police that day and downplaying an attempt to overthrow a democratic and fair election, so be it. Kevin McCarthy was scared on January 6, and with good reason. The sad thing is how scared he still appears to be today, not just to the former President and his supporters who roamed the Capitol Halls that day, but of some of the members in his own party, the ones he serves with and is so beholden to today. Joining us now is CNN law enforcement analyst, Michael Fanone, who was tasered several times in the neck, beaten and suffered a heart attack as a result of his effort defending the Capitol as a member of the DC Metro Police Department. I appreciate you being with us. Last night, Carlson called people who breached the Capitol \"sightseers,\" instead of insurrectionists. You were there. What do you make of what Carlson has done?

We need to have greater coordination, greater transparency, greater availability of data, and to be able to analyze and get data in real time. So you're asking me, are we prepared? The answer is in some respects, we are but we certainly can do better.
