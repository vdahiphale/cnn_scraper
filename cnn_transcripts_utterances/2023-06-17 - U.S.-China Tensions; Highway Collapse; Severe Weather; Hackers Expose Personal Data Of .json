Good evening.We start this hour with the escalating tensions between Washington and Beijing as secretary of State, Antony Blinken arrives in China in just a few hours from now for his high-stakes visit. President Biden says he hopes to meet again with Chinese leader, Xi Jinping. The relationship between the US and China has become increasingly strained after recent incidents. Last month, the US accused a Chinese jet of conducting an unnecessarily aggressive maneuver while intercepting an American spy plane over the South China Sea. And of course back in February, we all remember when the US shot down a Chinese surveillance balloon off of the coast of South Carolina after it had floated across the country, but President Biden says he believes these tensions can be ironed out.

Since then, relations have declined. The series of dangerous encounters between two of the most powerful militaries on Earth ratcheting up the tensions. In late May, a Chinese fighter jet sliced in front of a US reconnaissance aircraft in international airspace over the South China Sea according to the US, forcing the larger, heavier US plane to fly through the wake turbulence of the Chinese jet. Days later in the Taiwan Strait, a Chinese navy ship cut 150 yards in front of a US destroyer in what the US called an unsafe and unprofessional maneuver. China said the US was there for provocation.

So again, I believe that communicating, especially for two big powerslike the United States and China is essential, and then we need to focus on what are the messages that are being delivered? And what are the messages being delivered by the United States? And what are the messages being delivered by our allies, partners and friends around the world? Because in our interconnected world, none of us live on an island and we are going to have to find a way to live with the Chinese, but we need to be honest about many of the really unacceptable things the Chinese government is doing, but we need to keep lines of communication open so things don't get worse.",

The regiment whose color or regimental flag was being trooped this year. Cheers from the crowds who gathered on the Mall also for the Royals that followed, close behind Prince William now the Prince of Wales also in Welsh Guard uniform as he is the Regiment's Colonel now, a position he inherited from his father. He was joined by Princess Anne and the Duke of Edinburgh in their respective Regimental uniforms. And then behind, in a carriage, Queen Camilla, the Princess of Wales with the ultimate crowd pleasing trio of Princes George and Louie and Princess Charlotte. Unlike the coronation, this military ceremony focuses on the household division of the British Army, the five Regiments of the Foot Guards take turn to troop their color each year, with the two Household Cavalry Regiments performing the King's Escort. The national anthem played as the King received his final salute, marking the end of the ceremony, and the return of His Majesty to Buckingham Palace. Gun sounded across London before the King and other members of the Royal family made it out onto Buckingham Palace's iconic balcony to watch a fly pass. Seventy aircrafts took part to the delight of many, particularly Prince Louis, who's expressions were as expected. It all culminated with a fly pass from the Red Arrows, plumes of red white and blue smoke, a British flag emblazoned across the sky to mark King Charles's official birthday.

And CNN has uncovered evidence that Russia's Wagner mercenary group is complicit continuing to support Sudan's rapid support force - paramilitary group known as the RSF throughout the months of fighting, despite calls by the U.S. and others for - support to cease.About 2 million people in Sudan have been displaced since mid-April as the country's humanitarian crisis grows more dire. The RSF denies links to Wagner or any involvement in mass rape. But CNN verified incidents of rape perpetrated by the RSF including, one captured on video in the face of those repeated denials. We feel it's important to broadcast part of that video and we warn you that it is graphic and disturbing. CNN's Nima Elbagir has this exclusive report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIMA ELBAGIR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT (voice over): The fighting on the streets of Sudan is relentless. Cease-fire after a cease-fire has not helped. Forces previously accused of genocide returning to a well-worn playbook: terrorize, expel, and ethnically cleanse. The paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, RSF, are currently engaged in a fight for dominance with Sudan's army. But years before that rivalry spilled blood in Sudan's streets, they were implicated in atrocities in Darfur. Now once again Darfur to the west of the country is stopped by the specter of genocide. The damage brought by these forces so extensive you can see it from satellite images. This is El Geneina, West Darfur. Hundreds killed, whole districts raised to the ground. And it's not only El Geneina that is burning. This is Andur (ph) and this Kutum (ph). (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through text translation): This is our livelihood. The market is destroyed. (END VIDEO CLIP) ELBAGIR (voice over): On the ground it looks like this. These scenes sadly familiar in Darfur. Twenty years ago, the region descended into genocide. The same RSF leadership in place as their men were killed, occupied and raped. Now, once again women's bodies are part of the field of war. We must warn you, what you're about to see is shocking. This video filmed at great personal risk will show a girl believed to be just 15 years old being raped. The RSF have threatened rape survivors and denied their testimonies, so we feel it necessary to broadcast a small portion of this horrific assault. You see here a man in light colored fatigues matching those worn by the RSF. It's too awful to show in full, but when the phone pans, you see what he's guarding, a man wearing light colored fatigues forcing himself on to the prone girl. CNN verified and geolocated the area where this happened. We're not revealing the exact location in Khartoum to protect our sources and the young girl. This is not an isolated incident. We received and reviewed dozens of cases where women say they were raped by RSF soldiers. Identifying them by their light-colored fatigues and the insignia on their right soldiers. So who is complicit in this pain? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
