Grand Jury handed up the sprawling indictment on Monday night at the Fulton County Courthouse.That is not where the defendants will surrender though. The sheriff says they will all be booked down the road at the Fulton County Jail. This includes Trump himself. One of those co-defendants is Trump's post-election lawyer Rudy Giuliani. He says he'll surrender next week. And others, Trump's former Chief of Staff Mark Meadows. He is trying to get the case moved to a federal court. CNN's Alayna Treene is here.

This town is a very close-knit community that just had complete devastation.You know, I think where we're at right now is the priority is to still find everybody that's unaccounted for. Whether that is going through the burned areas or reconnecting with people that are staying with friends and family somewhere else. So important that we continue to do that process, which is why we're sending in additional teams and additional dogs to help facilitate this process as we continue to work through the town of Lahaina. We're also you know, working with the governor's team to start to talk about what does the long-term rebuild look like and how do we do it in a way that's going to make this community more resilient. There'll be many phases to this recovery. Those are the bookends of it. We have a lot of work to do in the interim, and we're going to begin continuing to send in resources to support everything that the governor needs as he goes through this.",

And I got to tell you that the outpouring of donations and assistance and volunteers that have come to help is really remarkable and really incredible. There are a lot of resources on the island, but we understand that we have to be able to get out into the community and help get that message out there.You know, when I was at one of the shelters the other day, you know, I saw the shelter manager and the teams there that they are putting care packages together. And so, as host families are coming by the shelter to pick up goods you know they're just giving them a whole care package of items. Now that the bypass road has also opened, we're going to be able to get our teams into the community to help go door to door, better find people that may have not registered for assistance yet or do need additional support and we can get those resources to them. We're going to continue to partner with the county in the state of Hawaii to get all of the resources into that community. They are there. We just need to continue to work to make sure that we're reaching everybody.",

Firefighters did a tremendous effort of trying to make sure that they could do everything they could to get people out of harm's way, while at the same time knowing that many of them, their residences, were also going to be lost in this fire.We're going to have plenty of time to look through and if needed support, trying to identify you know kind of the evolution of the events. But right now, we really do need to stay focused on helping those people that have been displaced, and how do we get them the needed assistance that they need today.",
