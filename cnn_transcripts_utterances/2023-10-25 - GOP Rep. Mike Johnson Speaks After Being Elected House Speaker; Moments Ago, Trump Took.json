DAVID CHALIAN, CNN POLITICAL DIRECTOR: No doubt about that, Wolf. You heard in his remarks, he said that they've learned something through these last few weeks of turmoil. He was trying to tell the world that the United States, this body, the House of Representatives, has learned something. And that now they are back in business. And I think the proof will be in the pudding on that. We have to wait to see what was learned. I remember Kevin McCarthy said we went through this. Now we've learned how to govern together. And he was out of a job a few months later. So the challenge before Mike Johnson is enormous.

      "sentences": "Yes, Wolf, so this is taking the stand. Not as someone to testify but in response to that gag order that was issued by this judge earlier in this trial.Let me back up to explain what happened. During one of the breaks, the former president went into the hall room, as he usually does, and made some comments. What he said in those comments was he called the judge partisan and he said the person sitting next to him is very partisan. Now, keep in mind that gag order, when it was put in place by this judge, said that Trump could not speak ill about anyone on his staff. Well, everyone was brought back into the courtroom. There were a few side bars. And the judge asked Trump who he was talking about. His lawyers responded and Trump said -- his lawyer said Trump was talking about the judge and the person sitting next to him, who was Michael Cohen, who was testifying at the time. I need the back up a little to explain what it looks like in the courtroom. In this courtroom, the judge is in the middle. To his right is his court clerk. To his left is the person testifying. So the judge took it that Trump was talking about his court clerk, which would have been a violation of this gag order. There was a break in the courtroom. And then once lunch, had come back, the judge made Trump take the stand and, under oath, say who he was talking about. The former president took the stand and again said he was talking about the judge and Michael Cohen in his comments. Well, the moment Trump left the stand, the judge said this. \"As a trier of fact, I find that the witness is not credible and he was referring to my law clerk.\" He fined the president $10,000. Now, again, the former president, $10,000. This is the second time that he has received a fine based off this gag order and violating it. Trump's attorneys at this point are fighting back, essentially saying that he can't say he was lying. He just took the oath. And they also were complaining about the fact that this law clerk is seated right next to the judge, calling it unusual when law clerks are sitting usually in front of a judge in the courtroom. So there is a big back and forth about this law clerk. Trump's attorneys arguing that they're getting this tried by two judges because of the position where this law clerk is sitting. The judge said that he has reconsidered this fine and he's keeping with it, $10,000 fine against the former president for those comments that he made earlier today. So a lot of drama happening in regard to the gag order. This is in addition to the drama that has been unfolding all day with Michael Cohen, the former personal attorney of Donald Trump on the stand. That's what we're hearing from the courtroom about a $10,000 fine, again, against the president in regard to the gag order -- Wolf?",

He was asked questions about, who were you referring to, the clerk, which would violate the gag order, or Michael Cohen, which would not violate the gag order. Trump said I meant Cohen and the judge didn't believe him. So there is a question as to whether Donald Trump can appeal this. The answer is, technically yes, he can try to appeal. He has a very low likelihood of success. What this trial judge has done is make a credibility finding. Those kinds of findings are usually uniquely in the province of the trial judge. The trial judge will say I was the one in the courtroom. I was the one able to assess his demeanor, to watch him answer. In my judgment, this judge has said I do not believe Donald Trump.

I'm sure it's happened in U.S. history but never in recent history, where a person has violated a gag order or restriction on what they can say outside of a courtroom two different time. And the judge -- and not just this judge but all the judges in the Trump cases will have to grapple with this difficult question: How do I enforce this? Financial penalties are only so much of a deterrent when it comes to Donald Trump. They do technically have the option of ordering him locked up.

In a very extreme and very rare scenario, a judge has the ability to either impose bail restrictions, though this is not a criminal case so we won't see that here. But you can technically lock someone up. The judge warned Donald Trump. He said, if it comes to it, I do have the power to imprison you if you continue to violate this gag order.
