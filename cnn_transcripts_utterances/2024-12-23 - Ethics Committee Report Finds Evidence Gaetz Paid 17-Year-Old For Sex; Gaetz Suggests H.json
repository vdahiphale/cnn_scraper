Just some of the facts that they were able to find, not only through documented evidence, but also interviews with more than half a dozen witnesses, including the victim, the girl or the woman who was 17 years old heading into her senior year of high school at the time.She told the Committee, under with testimony, that she had sex with Matt Gaetz, then a sitting member of Congress twice during a party in July of 2017, including at least once in the presence of other party attendees. She recalled receiving $400 in cash from Matt Gaetz, which she understood to be payment for sex, and she had just completed her junior year of high school. The Committee also looked at several other relationships that Gaetz had with women -- not underage women, women who were adults at the time, but many of them told the Committee that they did have an understanding that Gaetz was reimbursing them in some way for sex. So that led the Committee to find that the Congressman, while he was in Congress, was engaged in commercial sex, that would be prostitution, giving money to women, also statutory rape that is the allegations related to the underage girl and then also illicit drug use. The way the Committee phrases it at the top of this report is that they determined there is substantial evidence that represented Gaetz violated House rules and other standards of conduct prohibiting prostitution, statutory rape, illicit drug use, impermissible gifts, special favors or privileges, and obstruction of Congress. This report is now out publicly. Matt Gaetz had run to the court system this morning to try and block the release of the report, but the House has posted it online as well as some of the evidence they've gathered. And he, both in court and then also on X, has been saying repeatedly that these allegations are false and reminding people he has not been charged with any crime.",

If you're not, it can it can be a little bit different. But if you are, you look at Hunter Biden. And when you saw Republicans, referring to that pardon, we're talking about that pardon, they often pointed to it, what was going to do the next time some MAGA Republican was in trouble. They could say that there's one justice system for his family. There should be -- what are we to pretend there's a different justice system for us? And so, yes, it's not a problem for a lot of supporters of the president when they see somebody accused of behavior and not adjudicated. Even if it is run through corporate, if it's not adjudicated, they see the hand of the deep state invisible, whether it exists or not. And that's why this is not -- now does everyone else who wants those jobs in Florida appreciate this information coming out, and think that they have a better chance of winning they did yesterday? They do. But they've also been through scenarios where people accused of grievous things who are tied to Donald Trump. If he puts the hand on them and says that it's OK, a lot of Republican voters say, yes. That's right. I don't believe the allegations. I don't trust the FBI. I don't trust the DOJ.

He was at least a member of the House.I mean, I think first of all, the story that this report tells us incredibly sad for these women. Yes. A lot of them say that they consented to it, but afterwards, they had feelings of regret, feeling like they've been misled, the small amount of payments, being potentially drugged and other things like that. It's incredibly sad. But I was talking to somebody close to Trump and they said this is the reason why he picked Matt Gaetz for the role. Because he believes that the system has been -- he, as in Trump, believes that the system has been weaponized against him and wanted somebody who felt the same way and that would tear down the systems that he felt were being used against him. But the reality is that the DOJ did not bring this case. And in fact, according to the report, they actually didn't even work with the Committee to corroborate or to give details of the things that they learned in this report. So it's actually not the DOJ in this case that is weaponizing it. And so I think that that is a clear distinction. But I think Dave is right. If Trump reads through this or doesn't read through it, but decides that these things are OK, then he's going to bless them. I was talking to somebody else yesterday who said, you know, maybe it's not that he runs for Rubio's seat, but maybe it's that he gets a role that doesn't need to be confirmed within the administration.",

They will spend the rest of their lives in prison, but no longer face execution. Now, Biden had already halted executions on the federal level, a move that President-elect Trump plans to reverse.This morning, Biden said in a statement, quote, \"I am more convinced than ever that we must stop the use of the death penalty at the federal level. In good conscience, I cannot stand back and let a new administration resume the executions that I halted.\" Now, to be clear, this applies only to the federal death row. Most executions in America are carried out by individual states. Our great reporters are back with me now. And Jasmine, I want to start with you because this was something that in the 2020 race, during the primary and in the general election, the president got a lot of pressure on when he was a candidate. What's fascinating to me is if you look at kind of where the American public is on the death penalty, I want to bring up a Gallup poll kind of charting from 1994, 80 percent support for the death penalty; 2014, 63 percent; 2024, 53 percent. Now track back to that first date, 1994. And this was then Senator Biden's statement. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And I think it's so interesting, because so much of what he has done as president, specifically on criminal justice, can be seen in the wake of his role in the crime bill, in all of the strife that he suffered in 2020 with advocates and people saying that they didn't want to vote for him because of how involved he was within that crime bill and him kind of trying to atone for that.I know I talked to a lot of clemency advocates after he pardoned his son, Hunter Biden, and they said, you know, actually, we don't really care about Hunter Biden, but what we do care about is the low amount of clemencies that he so far passed and him not living up to his promise in 2020 that he would change the way that the death penalty functions, at least federally, in this country. And so I think that this is a reaction to that pressure from activists, but certainly, I mean, not just the person, Joe Biden, the difference between that clip and what we see now, but also what he has done on crime, on criminal justice. And that's going to be a huge part, I think, of his legacy going forward. MATTINGLY: A legacy that it seems like the pendulum is swinging completely away from because you have the man who will replace him in the Oval Office saying things repeatedly like this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND CURRENT PRESIDENTIAL- ELECT: And I'm hereby calling for the death penalty for any migrant that kills an American citizen or a law enforcement officer.

When you -- and just Trump sort of it on this, when you talk to Republicans, especially Democrats on why Trump won, yes, it was inflation, yes it was immigration, but crime was always a subset of immigration. And Donald Trump wants to be seen as being tough on crime.So internally, I'm sure yours is checks chains were blowing up as well. It was from Democrats this morning for me being like, you know, we've lost a couple of news cycles on this. This is -- we're learning the wrong lessons with lessons we should have learned from 2024 is to be tough on crime, tough on immigration and have an answer on some of the cultural issues. This isn't that. With all clemency and with all commutations and any sort of pardons, they're always big 24, 48 hour stories. They don't necessarily stick. And unless anyone here wants to re litigate the Marc Rich pardon that Bill Clinton did in the waning days of his presidency, they tend not to stick that much.

We're hearing that preemptive pardons for those who are under threat by Donald Trump could be coming. So I don't think that this is done. And I also wanted to point out one thing about the dates that we were talking about. In the 2000s, we started seeing more forensic evidence that undermined some of the convictions for the death sentence.
