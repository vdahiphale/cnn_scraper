They renamed a crime unit called the Viper Unit, but continued doing the same things. The city itself looked into some of the practices of the police department targeting African Americans, and nothing changed after doing that.Here's Attorney General Merrick Garland describing some of the findings.

Paula Reid, thanks so much.With me to discuss, CNN Political Commentator Bakari Sellers, a former democratic elected official, and former Trump White House Communications Director Alyssa Farah Griffin. Bakari, here are some of the quotes from Tucker Carlson revealed in the filings. Tucker said, quote, \"We are very close to being able to ignore Trump most nights. I truly can't wait. I hate him passionately. I blew up at former White House official Peter Navarro today in frustration. I actually like Peter, but I can't handle much more of this. That's the last four years. We're all pretending we've got a lot to show for it because admitting what a disaster it's been is too tough to digest. But come on, there isn't really an upside to Trump.\" Now, hold on one second, Bakari, because I'm going to say something that you might be surprised. This really isn't relevant to whether or not Fox lied about the elections. Dominion is not suing Fox for lying about Trump and pretending they like Donald Trump. Dominion is suing Fox for lying about the elections and platforming liars about the elections. You're a lawyer. Does this not boost the Fox argument that Dominion is, in many of these findings, just trying to embarrass them?",

And let me just kind of reframe your statement just because it's not just proving that Fox News lied about the 2020 elections, but they willfully lied about those 2020 elections.And I think that some of these comments, some of these text messages, some of the things that are coming out, show that not only did they know it was false, not only did they despise this man, but they did it anyway. When you look -- when you combine these things with some context, in Rupert Murdoch's context, this was all about green. This was all about money. When you look at this just from a viewer's perspective, though, it shows you that there's no difference really, than between, you know, Tucker Carlson and, say, Hulk Hogan or a professional wrestler. It looks like it's all entertainment. It looks like it's all done for show. And regardless of those journalistic ethics or truth, it does not matter to certain hosts at Fox News. And the problem is that there are good people at Fox News and good journalists at Fox News, but Tucker just doesn't want to be considered one of those.",

Murdoch was asked by Dominion lawyers, \"Do you believe that Dominion was engaged in a massive and coordinated effort to steal the 2020 presidential election?\" Murdoch replied, \"No\". \"Have you ever seen any credible evidence to suggest that Dominion was engaged in a massive and coordinated effort to steal the 2020 election?\" \"No\", Murdoch replied.

But you look at this evidence as it comes out. You look at reaching that high bar. It's still a very high bar to reach. But these comments by Rupert Murdoch, and I agree with Alyssa, this is the most damning piece of evidence that comes out. This is the CEO of this Fox News conglomerate knowing that the information that they are putting out is false and willingly just or acquiescing to it being disseminated. That is a huge problem for their lawyers to overcome. I can only see their lawyers saying, look, we need to get out of this some way. We need to find an off ramp. What does that number?

Take a listen to how Republicans are responding on the Hill, to how Fox portrayed this. REP. DAN NEWHOUSE (R), WASHINGTON: It's a revisionist thing that I think is unfair to the American people. SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: It wasn't a stroll through the Capitol. It was an attack on our Capitol. SEN. MITT ROMNEY (R), UTAH: It was an outrageous act. A lot of people were injured.

We don't need government to come in and be the ultimate Big Brother to make these decisions when we have groups that quite honestly are doing this quite well on their own. So there's not a problem out there that exists. It really is a problem that we're creating. And really, you're putting kids at risk, kids who already have higher numbers of suicide attempts and mental health issues because of the bullying they get in schools.

And here you've got Washington coming in saying there's a problem that does not exist, and that's the problem. We should be addressing costs for the American people.
