Spending splurge, the U.S. presidential candidates on an advertising blitz in the battleground states with just two weeks now to go. Inflation cessation. The IMF says the global inflation fight is, quote, \"largely won.\" But geopolitical risks and trade tensions loom large. And doctor's dictation the startup using A.I. to decode health jargon, save physicians time and help patients understand what's wrong. That conversation and plenty more coming up. But first, a power move from Russian President Vladimir Putin, who's playing host to more than a dozen world leaders at the BRICS Summit of Emerging Market Nations in the City of Kazan. Chinese President Xi Jinping, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as well as the heads of Turkey, Iran, and Indonesia, helping show Putin is far from isolated on the world stage, despite the ongoing war in Ukraine. This is the first meeting since the group expanded earlier this year to include nations like Egypt, the UAE, Ethiopia, and Iran. And they're now the so-called BRICS Plus. Stephen Sestanovich joins U.S. now. He's a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations for Russian and Eurasian Studies. Stephen, great to have you with us.

Now, two weeks until the U.S. presidential election, both candidatesand their high-profile backers are laser focused, as we've been discussing, on the battleground states. Kamala Harris is off the campaign trail. However, today, she has a CNN town hall Wednesday in Philadelphia, while her running mate, Tim Walz, and Former President Barack Obama, appeared at a rally in Wisconsin. For the Republicans, Donald Trump has a campaign event in Greensboro, North Carolina. Veep pick -- his veep pick, J. D. Vance, is in Arizona. And both sides, as we've mentioned, engaging in a multimillion-dollar advertising blitz. Democrats set to outspend the Republicans in five of the seven main swing states. Republicans have the edge in North Carolina and Pennsylvania, where they're spending around $45 million on advertising compared to the Democrats, $42 million. Meanwhile in Michigan, Democrats have a $3 million edge, dropping a total of $26 million on ads. In Michigan, both the Trump and Harris campaigns are working to win over autoworkers, among others. John King asked union members who they're going to vote for. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOHN KING, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over):  Signs of the season, Macomb County, Michigan.

Among the major ones, geopolitical tensions, whether it's the Middle East and potential increases in energy and commodity prices, or the general rise in protectionism and protectionist policies, we've seen an explosion number of trade restrictive measures around the world. This is not just the U.S. story, there are many, many trade measures are taken by many countries around the world. And when we look at that and the uncertainty this introduces in investment decisions by corporations or consumers, then the result is that it weighs down on global activity. It could weigh down up to 0.5 percent of output, global output by 2026. So, this is quite significant. Then on top of that, we also have risks that are coming from potential tightening of financial conditions. We got a little bit of a taste of that in August. Didn't last very long, but we have to be vigilant. And that levels that remain very elevated in some countries could be a problem going forward. So, yes, the picture is not all good.

Is that based on the stimulus that's already been announced or are you hoping to see more and particularly on the consumer side, the domestic consumer side? Because again, part of the conversation that we see elsewhere in the world is that China's exporting a great deal of products and therefore, subsidizing industry and that's hurting others. I guess one could argue that there has to be a consumer on the other side in order to buy those exports. It's not such a simple argument. Would you like to see more, however, from China?",

Thisis a slight downgrade from our July forecast, and we're expecting 4.5 percent in 2025. Now, these numbers already include some of the policy changes that were announced by the Chinese authorities at the end of September, especially the ones from the People's Bank of China. They do not include yet the ones that have been announced since then by the Ministry of Finance. The fiscal measures. We're still assessing what our expensive dues will be and how they will impact the economy. So, they are not part of our forecast projection. So, you might say from that perspective, there is maybe a little bit of upside risk for the Chinese economy. If these measures are significant, but this is in a context in which the latest numbers for the Chinese economy have been disappointing. So, I would say this is the overall tension here. Now, turning to the second part of your question. You know, the important thing to keep in mind here is that some of the trade surpluses we're seeing coming from China, these excessive exports over their imports, it's really coming from the weak macroeconomic environment, much more so in our assessment than it comes from direct policies directed at specific sectors to try to stimulate production and exports in, let's say, electric vehicles or batteries, et cetera. The issue is much broader. It's much more a macroeconomic issue than a sectoral issue. And it's really related to the weakness of the Chinese economy overall.",

So, we have another 24 hours of rainfall to go. Officially, the name is Trami. But in the Philippines, they call it Christine. Here's the storm itself at a half a meter of rainfall in more than one place. Storm still well offshore, but going to move onshore later on tonight into tomorrow morning. It isn't going to be a wind maker. It is going to be a rain event. The highest gusts will likely be 100 kilometers per hour, not knocking things down. But when you pick up the potential for a one-meter rainfall on top of a hill in the island of Luzon, you absolutely have the potential to have significant flooding here with more rainfall to come. This is on top of what places have already received. And there you see some spots at a half a meter, not that far from Bakio. So, there's the rainfall moving off toward the west, moving off toward Haikou, but we're not going to see even the storm strengthened that much. This is going to be a signal one or two wind event where this is going to be a flash flood for sure. Now, the Westpac never really shuts off. We talk about the Atlantic kind of the hurricane season being over November 30th. The Westpac is warm enough pretty much all year long to stay active. And certainly, the Indian Ocean.

It's also an enormous issue for doctors who spend hours writing out patient records when they could be treating more people. It's one of the key causes behind doctor burnout, according to the U.S. surgeon general. Well, now tech firm Abridge is aiming to use A.I. to help automate note taking. Their system works by recording visits with an app, then summarizing them in both patient and doctor friendly versions. Their clients include major U.S. hospitals, such as the Mayo Clinic, and NVIDIA is a major collaborator. We're joined now by Abridge co-founder and CEO Dr. Shiv Rao. Dr. Rao, fantastic to have you on the show. I have to be honest, I've done a bit of a spot check with doctors that I know that are using the system. And I have to admit, I've got rave reviews. Explain the vision behind this and how widely it's now being utilized. DR. SHIV RAO, CO-FOUNDER AND CEO, ABRIDGE:  Thank you so much. It's such a privilege to have this time with you. You know, everything that we're building is really focused on unburdening clinicians from clerical work so that they can focus more fully on caring for their patients. And it's really this idea that healthcare delivery is about people. Professionals on one side of the room, patients on the other. And you think about it, what are they doing? They're having conversations. Dialogues drive so much in care delivery. Their upstream of clinical documentation that we have to do, for example. And you already mentioned, it's documentation that can help patients better understand and follow through as much as it is about unburdening clinicians from clerical work that's important not just for communication with other doctors, but also, you know billing systems, for example, revenue cycle.",

As I mentioned in the introduction, walk awaythinking what exactly was I told there and what do I have to do? And I wish I'd taken notes. I know the system right now, and you can correct me if I'm wrong, supports 14 languages as well, which is incredible. How does it interact with hospital systems? I think Epic is the system that U.S. hospitals use, for example, because it's got to be integrated into that surely to be able to make it sort of multifunctional and easy for doctors to use wherever they are. DR. RAO:  Yes, you're absolutely right. We could actually support well over 30 languages at this point in time. In fact, today in California, there will probably be thousands of conversations using Abridge in Vietnamese, Mandarin, and Spanish. Today, in Boston, there's folks speaking in Haitian, Creole, and Brazilian, Portuguese. Today, in Indiana, there's doctors speaking in Punjabi, to their truck driver patient population. And we can meet the patient where they are. We can help the clinician, whether they have an interpreter in the room or not, we're going to be able to create that note. And to your point, we're going to do all of that inside the medical record. You mentioned Epic. We have an incredible privilege of being a co- development partner with Epic. They call it their Workshop Program. And that's where we're at, whiteboards, together, figuring out how we can push the boundaries for what's possible with responsible A.I. in healthcare.

And another way that's frankly much more exciting for us is at an enterprise level. At an enterprise level, you think about all the doctors across all the different specialties and all the different settings, inpatient, urgent care, emergency departments, and of course, outpatient clinics, telemedicine, it's more of a model where we want to make sure that we're not getting in the way of clinicians being able to benefit. And that's where -- you mentioned NVIDIA, that's where we can get really creative. We can start to sort of predict, you know, how much compute we're going to need. How many GPUs we're going to need to be able to run these models that we've been able to fine tune all these bespoke models, for example, that help us audit the technology to minimize those issues that you brought up before. It helps us sort of predict things. And obviously, we make that -- we make this technology more approachable for these large health systems that way as well.",

I guess that's the big question. And the other one for me would be data privacy. How do you protect data when it's on an app? Someone's using their phone. That for me is probably a big risk surrounding this product. How do you mitigate that? DR. RAO:  Yes, from an accessibility perspective, in terms of, like, the technology and cost, this is technology that is for everyone. And we've been able to scale across the country over the last couple of years. This is something that really, we think, should be baked into the infrastructure, should be just turned on inside -- you know, inside the medical record. And so, that I think is a very, very key aspect of this. So, the technology also, just to give you a sense of how it scales, you know, when you think about these large health systems and where the details become very important is that they've got any number of different specialties, be cardiologists like me, gastroenterologist, internist, or surgeons, and they could be in different settings, like we mentioned before, different spoken languages. And then, there's all the different ways they need to get this information back into the medical record. And part of the challenge that we've demonstrated that we're up to is that we can kind of integrate. We can integrate into all those different discrete fields in a way that makes sense because this really needs to feel seamless for the clinician who is using it.",
