The reports include the attack on the Abbey Gate at Kabul Airport where 13 U.S. service members were killed during the evacuation. CNN national security reporter Natasha Bertrand joins us now from the Pentagon. Natasha, what are you learning?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Fred, so we're getting a lot of information here from U.S. officials who say that this report essentially is going to lay out everything that the U.S. has learned about specifically that withdrawal from Afghanistan back in 2021.And what we are learning is really that the administration feels that it conducted a good evacuation. All things considered the fact that they were able to get over 100,000 people out of the country as it collapsed, as the Taliban took over. They feel is a success. And they are emphasizing here that they still believe that the administration was severely constrained by the decisions that were made by the Trump administration, namely that deal that former president Trump made with the Taliban that required all U.S. troops to be out of the country by May of 2021. So, the administration saying that they are working -- that they were working, essentially with the conditions that they entered into the administration under. And they're also, however, acknowledging that there are certain things that they could have done better in that very specific instance. For example, they are now saying they're going to prioritize evacuations in a way that is faster. So basically, when security situations deteriorate in these kinds of environments, they're going to advise Americans and other people to leave the country sooner than they did, of course, with Americans in Afghanistan. Now the reason that they did not advise those evacuations to happen sooner is because they did not want to undermine confidence in the Afghan government at the time. They did not want the Afghan government to collapse, and they did not foresee the Taliban taking over as fast as they did. But they said that moving forward they are not going to make that mistake again, essentially, and saying that they are going to communicate the risks to Americans much more aggressively than they did in the incidence of Afghanistan. And they're also going to move faster to get people out -- Fred.",

But pretty quickly there's been pushed back very significantly from that person's boss at the president's office and other officials, saying, no, there is no sense from Ukrainians and the Ukrainian leadership that they are willing to talk about any territory within Ukraine that can be part of negotiations with Russia. That is consistent with what we've heard over months and months. And also, of course, this conversation is theoretical because they are required to take a great deal of territory before they can get to the borders of Crimea -- Fred.",

And she says that even though she and her contemporaries are athletes that the sport wields tremendous power, and that that should be used to reinforce the fact that players are against this war.Wimbledon banned players from the two countries last year after the invasion. That was very significant, as that was the first time the player were excluded on the grounds of nationality since the World War II era. But they lifted that ban last month, and players are now competing on the tours and at other grand slams under the heading of, quote, unquote, neutral athletes. And what Swiatek is describing here is a locker room atmosphere at these events that's pretty tense. But she did underscore that this is a complicated situation for some of these athletes. These Russian and Belarusian athletes who could face consequences for not being complicit or for speaking publicly about the war in Ukraine if they do in fact protest. But she said that all players can make an impact and that any decisions that are made by the federation's should really be done so while keeping Russia's aggression top of mind in her opinion -- Fredricka.",

It's that they disrupted the proceedings of the of the floor and violated state rules -- State House rules which I don't think anyone really disputes. It's just a question about whether they should truly be punished this way given that the last person to be punished this way, I think is somebody who had allegedly sexually groped 22 women or something like that.

What was it?DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, well, he's had skin cancer in the past. So, I think he was getting checked and saw something that looks suspicious and had it removed and sounds like got the all-clear there. So that's good news. He talked about the fact that some of the sun damage from 25 years ago which is really important. I mean, you know the sun damage can accumulate over time. Fredricka, this is one of those things where we all know the importance of taking care of our skin. But very few of us actually do it. About 5.5 million cases of these types of skin cancers every year in the United States. Eight out of 10 of them are what are known as basal cell cancer. That's the type that Hugh Jackman was talking about. They're not commonly fatal, but they can spread and they can lead to the need for extensive procedures. Let me just show you quickly here if we can. We have this graphic. You're the outer layer of your skin called the epidermis. Most people know that. It's about the thickness of a credit card. In that layer is where all these cells lie, basil cells, squamous cells and even melanocytes. Which can lead to melanoma. Any of those cells when they get mutated because of UV light could potentially turn into cancer. And again, that can accumulate over time. That's why sunscreen and all that is so important.",

If you have a lesion or a mole or something, is it asymmetric? Different one side to the other.Are the borders? Changing or becoming jagged? Is the color changing? Or is the diameter -- the size of it changing? Is it evolving in some way? If it is that's a flag and you should get it checked out.
