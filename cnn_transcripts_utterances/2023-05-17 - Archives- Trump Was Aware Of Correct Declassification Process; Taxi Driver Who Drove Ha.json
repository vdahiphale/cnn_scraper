      "sentences": "Thank you, Anderson.Good evening. I'm Sara Sidner. Tonight, multiple sources, tell CNN, the National Archives has hard evidence that shows Donald Trump, and his top advisers, knew of the correct declassification process, while Donald Trump was President, which flies in the face of what Trump has claimed, in the past. Tonight, the documents could be in the hands of the Special Counsel, as we speak, in a criminal probe. Now, in just a moment, we will try to get some answers, from Trump's lawyer, who will be joining me live. But first, a look at the brand-new information, gathered by our CNN team. Their sources say there are 16 records that the National Archives is handing over to Jack Smith. The records apparently indicate Trump, and his top advisers, were made aware, of the correct process, to declassify material, while Trump was President, undercutting claims, like this one. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I took what I took. And it gets declassified. They become automatically declassified, when I took them. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "We're told the Archives informed Trump, about its discovery, yesterday, in a letter. CNN has obtained a copy.It says, and I'm quoting here, \"The 16 records in question all reflect communications involving close presidential advisers, some of them directed to you personally, concerning whether, why, and how you should declassify certain classified records.\" And more ominously, \"It is likely that the 16 records contain evidence that would be important to the grand jury's investigation.\" Why would it be important? Because they could provide insight into Trump's possible intent, whether he willfully disregarded what he knew, to be clearly established protocols, when he took those documents, and held on to them, after leaving the White House. Meanwhile, Trump has lost a key member, of his defense team, in this case. Timothy Parlatore testified, before the grand jury, in December. His exit comes, at a critical time, when the Special Counsel, may be nearing the final stretch, in the criminal probe. We do have one of the members, who is still on Donald Trump's team. His name is Jim Trusty. And he joins us now. Jim Trusty, thank you for being here. Let's get right into it. As President of the United States, did Donald Trump know how the declassification process worked? Or did he just ignore it? JIM TRUSTY, FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP'S ATTORNEY, TRUMP'S ATTORNEY IN DOCS CASE: Well, President Trump was exactly right, in your Town Hall, the other day. He is aware, of a bureaucratic process that can be used. He used that bureaucratic process, in the middle of his presidency, to declassify the Crossfire Hurricane matters that are the subject of that 316-page report we saw, this week. But at the end of his presidency, he relied on the constitutional authority, as Commander-in-Chief, which is to take documents, and take them to Mar-a-Lago, while still President, as he was at the time, and to effectively declassify and personalize them. He talked about declassifying them, but he didn't need to. And if you look at the Constitution, you look at the Presidential Records Act, there is absolutely no basis, for saying that bureaucracy rules, and that a President doesn't have the authority, entrusted in him, by the voters, to possess, and to declassify, and to hold on to documents.",

It says \"The United States shall reserve and retain complete ownership, possession, and control of Presidential records.\" And under federal law, willfully removing any record or document carries the possibility of a three-year prison sentence.We went. We looked it up, as journalists do. And nowhere does it say that you can mentally just think about it, and that they are declassified. So, you haven't heard this from any other president, at any other time. So, what gives Donald Trump, the right, to use mental gymnastics, to try and figure this out, and try to put out there that this was all perfectly legal?",

PRA says that Presidents and Archivists have to try to work together, to resolve the universe of documents that are held onto, by the former President, or turned over to the Archivist. The universe there is literally personal, or presidential. And the case law has shown, in every case, but President Trump's that NARA and the DOJ, completely deferred, to the former President's decisions, as to which documents he's going to hold on to, or which ones he's not. Bill Clinton had audio tapes, of hours and hours and hours, of recordings, from the Oval Office. When NARA was sued? And by the way, that's the remedy, under the Presidential Records Act, is civil litigation. When NARA was sued, DOJ stood there, in open court, and said, \"Judge, none of us may like it, but the President gets to make that determination. If NARA doesn't like his determination, they can sue.\" Sock drawer, Bill Clinton, his tapes were fine. Obama, 2018, there's a letter, from the Obama Foundation, acknowledging millions of documents, in a former furniture store, in Illinois, including classified documents. And their remedy, to any situation there, in that totally unsecure setting is to say, \"You know what? We're going to give you $3.3 million, NARA, to help transport these documents, whenever we digitize the library.\" Now, it's been five years. There's no hint of a digital library yet. But none of this is criminal. None of it has historically ever been subject to criminal tools, such as subpoenas, or search warrants. But, for Donald Trump, there's an exception that this DOJ, and this FBI, are pursuing, to mislead the American public, to misuse statutes that are not criminal, and to have an \"Ends justify the means\" mentality, when it comes to one President only.",

And at first were told that they didn't have them, and then they just wouldn't turn them over. And that is the difference between those people, who had some of the documents, and Donald Trump.

There was a whole bunch of people that worked, at the White House that helped at the White House that packed up materials, and sent them, to Mar-a-Lago, while he was still President. So, we're not going to sit here and pretend that President Trump personally looked at every single box. He knows the general nature, that there are golf shirts, and there are golf scoring cards, and that there are pictures of Celine Dion. He knows from the unprecedented and unwarranted and unconstitutional search of Mar-a-Lago, that they took things, like passports, that had nothing to do with anything, tax records, medical records. This was a fishing expedition, by prosecutors, who were engaged, in persecution, not following evidence, but criminalizing a non-criminal dispute. And if we let this genie out of the bottle, it's going to come back, to haunt, generations, where we don't have Executive privilege, we don't have attorney-client privilege, where we create new rules for Donald Trump, because people in power, and people in federal law enforcement, want to go after him.",

Harry's spokesman says that, after leaving an award ceremony, for Meghan, with Markle's mom, they tried to make their way, to a private residence, but were hounded by paparazzi, for more than two hours, were swarming them, and endangering the couple, and the public, at large. They say, the couple switched vehicles more than once ending up, at a Police station, before they could reached their final destination. Harry's team said it could have been fatal. But a taxi driver, who had them, for just one part of that journey, tells us his part of the story. And it's a little different. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SUNNY SINGH, TAXI DRIVER: I was just crossing on 67, going across town, and I see a security guy, asked me if he wants -- if I want a fare. And I said, \"Of course.\" And then, next, he go, pull over. And next minute, you know, they were jumping in back into my cab. They were kind of nervous, getting in, you know, and stuff like that. I think they've been chasing all day long, right? And then, they were just about to give me the address, where they were going. We were just making left turns, and right turns, and that's it. They were not being that aggressive while they were driving behind us. He was looking around, so he was, you know, nobody's acting suspicious. And after they quitting -- after the -- after paparazzi were in front of the car, they were not moving. So, he got out of the car, and he said, \"Hey, listen, move, move, move.\" (END VIDEO CLIP)",
