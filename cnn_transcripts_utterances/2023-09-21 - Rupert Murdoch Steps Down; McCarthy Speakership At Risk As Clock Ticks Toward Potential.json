The inside story of Rupert Murdoch's exit from the network he created. You heard of it? It's called Fox News. And it comes in the wake of Fox pushing election lies that led to two massive defamation lawsuits, not to mention the loss of their primetime star, Tucker Carlson. So, what will Murdoch's departure mean for the future of Fox News? Former Fox News host Geraldo Rivera is here to talk all about it. Plus, will Kevin McCarthy have a job for very long? One big fail, they think, after another and no deal in sight with a government shutdown looming next week. Is there anything the speaker can do to stop this runaway train? And the bestselling authors who say open AI is illegally using their copyrighted work, and look, they're suing. Today, I'll talk to one of them. I want to begin with Rupert Murdoch's retirement from Fox News just as the race for the White House is heating on up with his company tangled up in litigation over peddling the former president's election lies the last time around. The whole story, something out of succession. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He discovered that. He created this empire to serve that population. It has served him well.He got jammed up in all that Dominion stuff. But he has always been nice to me, kind to me, generous. When they cut my salary in half, when they had a big cutback before the pandemic, I went up to see -- I said, hey, boss, this is not right. I went to combat for you and this and that. And, you know, he called downstairs and he said, okay, restore part of that cut. So, I see him as a good boss, a vibrant and charismatic guy, still full of verve and energy at 92 years old.

Look, I go by my own professional experience in a lot of different worlds and sectors, and I've always wondered, so what was it like working for him? Was he actually involved in the day-to-day? His deposition testimony talks about being able to or maybe he could have told people to stop what they were doing and did not. But I never got a sense clearly. What his role was day to day?

How much he was involved, I can't tell you on a day-to-day basis.But every time I saw him, every time I saw him in action, whether it was watching the results of the 2004 presidential election with him in a small room, whenever I saw him in an intimate setting, there was no space between the private and public Rupert Murdoch, in my view. I don't know about succession. I didn't watch it. When I did, it was to see Lake Como and some of those beautiful sets and scenery. (LAUGHTER) I don't know if it was that kind of intrigue in the family between Lachlan and James and Elizabeth and so forth. All I know is that he was a pretty straightforward guy, at least, in dealing with me. He seemed to have his finger on the pulse. As I said, he was extremely skeptical of liberal politics, of the mainstream media. He saw the tremendous opportunity that the fact that half the people felt frustrated and underserved or unserved by media. He saw that opportunity, drove a truck through it, and he ended up having a fortune of over $17 billion and owning properties like the \"Times\" in London and \"The Wall Street Journal\" here in the States and all these other wonderful, wonderful properties, you know. So, he had something going that I think it does a disservice to think that it was all, you know, sleazy kind of opportunism because I don't believe that he believed that. I believe that he was sincerely motivated. He could have, for example, when Fox News was being created, gone the way of other frocks syndicated programs like \"A Current Affair\" and gone tabloid and celebrities and all that TMZ kind of stuff. Instead, he went to serve a conservative audience. And while I disagree with almost everything in all of their positions, the majority of talent at Fox News, I appreciate the fact that half the people believe, for example, that abortion is a moral wrong, or that gun rights are absolute, or that immigration is bad, or that the climate is not changing. They're very skeptical about that. So, you know, those are people who deserve to have their media.",

And, of course, both things can be true, that there is a recognized need and also a way to exploit or capitalize on that very idea.But I also wonder him stepping down and the why now at this age and what it really means logistically. Is he really going to be hands-off now? Is his role going to be completely sorts of laissez-faire given, of course, as you talked about the discovery you speak of, of trying to seize upon a demographic that wanted to be heard or recognized in a different way, certainly, it was a very lucrative proposition and one that is credited of getting Donald Trump elected, perhaps single- handedly, and now we're a little more than a year from another election?

Seems quite clear, it's the American people.But look, you are one of the youngest members of Congress.

And so, I wanted to make sure that we could introduce it in the House for two reasons.Obviously, we want to pass the bill, but I also understand that in a republican Congress right now, that can be difficult. And so, sometimes, when you're in the minority, you have to be creative. And we thought, let's put in this bill, let's amp up the pressure with our allies, and let's see if the administration can do it. And we just heard tomorrow the president will be making the announcement that he will create a federal office of gun violence prevention. And for folks who don't know, we don't have a federal office that coordinates all this at the federal level. We believe that a daily problem, when we're losing 100 lives a day due to gun violence, requires a daily solution. And so, we are ecstatic about this office being created. This is an issue that the leading cause of death for children now is a bullet, and I think it's the failure of government. President Biden and the administration are really stepping up and showing us that this is an issue they care about. And it's also about a full generation, all right? I'm the first Gen Z member of Congress. Something that defines my generation, unfortunately, is mass shootings and gun violence and that trauma. And the president understands that and that's why he's starting this office. So, we're really excited about the future of ending gun violence. This is a great step in a struggle that we have here.",

Now, they're alleging that the company's technology is illegally using their copyrighted work to train ChatGPT.The CEO of the Authors Guild warning in a statement Wednesday -- quote -- \"It is imperative that we stop this theft in its tracks or we will destroy our incredible literary culture, which feeds many other creative industries in the U.S. To preserve our literature, authors must have the ability to control if and how their works are used by generative AI.\" Joining me now is Michael Connelly. You know him, he's one of the bestselling authors involved in this suit. And I should mention, his brand-new book, \"Resurrection Walk,\" is out November 7th. I know many of you cannot wait for that to happen as well. Michael, thank you for joining us today. You know, you're one of several very prominent authors like George R.R. Martin, Jodi Picoult, who are joining this lawsuit. Tell me, why was it so important for you specifically to be a part of this? MICHAEL CONNELLY, AUTHOR:  I think it was because, like these other authors you just mentioned, we were kind of blindsided by this. You know, we're all members of the Authors Guild and, you know, they reached out to me and said, did you know that, uh, that their system, the AI system has basically digested all your work? And, you know, our legal team did some research and through prompting of like about the chat and so forth. This system was offering to write sequels to books that I haven't written yet. You know, I haven't written sequels and this artificial intelligence was willing to do that for, you know, any taker. And that, of course, is pretty shocking because I've worked more than three decades on my career as an author. I'm very careful about what I write, what I choose to write sequels about. And it's, in a matter of minutes, it can be taken away from me. So, of course, I raised my hand and said, yeah, I want to be involved in any kind of effort to try to control this.",

They're training. They're using it to train their AI on yours and others' work. Does that make a difference and should it to you or the public that it's a training mechanism?",
