The evil angry the gunman's father is now describing, as we learn more about what led to yet another unnecessary mass shooting in America, and more holes in our laws that continue to allow this to happen. And Mike Pence ready for a fight with the Justice Department. How the former VP reportedly plans to push back on a subpoena about the January 6th insurrection, even though he wrote about it in detail in his recent book. Plus, why do NFL teams' owners keep skipping over the highly successful Kansas City Chiefs' offensive coordinator despite his impressive Super Bowl-winning resume? Could the fact that he's not white have anything to do with it? Bob Costas is here to discuss. (MUSIC)",

Kids were really holed up in their dorm rooms, in apartments. We were making sure kids were together, they had someone else to be with.

I mean, it's -- they're starting to come out, but it is particularly because it wasn't just a shooting, it was also a manhunt on campus. It was sort of a double trauma in a way.

He was like, constitutionally as vice president, I was president in the Senate and courts have construed this broadly to apply not only to the elected senators and representatives but also to staffers and aides. So I think it will apply to Pence. But part two is, will his testimony touch on legitimate legislative activity?

But Eric Bieniemy having said that, Eric Bieniemy has interviewed 15 times with 14 different teams, the Jets twice over the last few years for a head coaching spot. Now, all 32 positions have been filled. There are four black head coaches in the National Football League and two, Robert Saleh with the Jets, and Ron Rivera in Washington, who are minority coaches, four Black head coaches.In 2018, the season began with seven. So instead of continued process, it seems like there is a lurch forward and fall back in this ongoing effort to reach some kind of fairness. It doesn't have to be exact equity. It doesn't have to match up to the number of black players within the league. But clearly, something is wrong here systemically. Now, when it comes to Bieniemy, this is what you hear that, sure, he's a good coach, but he's the offensive coordinator under Andy Reid. Andy Reid designs the offense and, in fact, he calls the plays. Even Reid himself who has endorsed Bieniemy as an excellent head coaching candidate has said, maybe he's got to go someplace else to be the offensive coordinator with full authority to prove himself. And, in fact, the Baltimore Ravens have offered him that possibility and I think the Washington Commanders, as well. But having said that, Doug Pederson who won a Super Bowl, as you well know with the Eagles, and now is in Jacksonville, had exactly the same position under Andy Reid.",

He didn't last two seasons, didn't do so well. Went back to New England, now he's getting a second chance as a head coach with the raiders. My point there is, look, Bieniemy and Josh McDaniels pretty much line up. They were with Hall of Fame coaches and Hall of Fame quarterbacks, soon to be, Brady and Mahomes.
