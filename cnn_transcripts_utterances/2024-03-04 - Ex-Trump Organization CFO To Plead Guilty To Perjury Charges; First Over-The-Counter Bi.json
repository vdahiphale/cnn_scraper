She and her family eventually returned to Spain where she currently lives in Catalonia.She posted on X today, with the help of her daughter, quoting a Spanish bishop. She said, \"Old age is a kind of sacrament. You lose your hearing but you hear more because you hear life, not noises.\" How beautiful is that? All right. In Alaska, speaking of beauty, the mushers are off for the official start of what is billed as the last great race, the Iditarod. The famous dog-sledding competition will cover 998 miles starting in Anchorage, Alaska, and ending in Nome. Five-time Iditarod champion Dallas Seavey is on the trail again this year in hopes of breaking the record for the most wins. Also, U.S. stock futures flat going into the work week as big action in the Asia markets overnight. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index surpasses 40,000 for the very first time today.

We caught him on video as he walked in this morning. And he is expected to plead guilty today, according to sources. Now, Weisselberg has been under investigation for testimony he had given in the New York attorney general's civil fraud investigation into the Trump Organization and into Donald Trump himself. He testified during their investigation, which has been ongoing for several years, and he also testified at the trial last year and some of the testimony that people have raised questions about the accuracy involved. And we know that prosecutors have been looking at -- involved his -- what he said about his dealings with an insurance agent and also about what he said about the size of the Trump triplex apartment at Trump Tower. That was one of the issues in the case. So he is expected to plead guilty today. He has been in talks for several weeks to do so. And this is a blow for him, but this is not a blow for Donald Trump. He is not expected to cooperate in Donald Trump's criminal investigation involving the repayment and reimbursement of hush money payments that he is facing trial on later this month. So, Weisselberg was at the center of these financial transactions but he is not cooperating against Donald Trump as a result of this guilty plea. So it will not change the dynamic for Trump as he is heading into trial. Weisselberg is not expected to be called as a witness by the Manhattan district attorney's office or by Donald Trump. Of course, now this will be the second time he has pleaded guilty to criminal charges -- in this case, perjury charges. So it would make him a difficult witness. Even if someone were to change their mind and decide to call him it would put some taint on that. But, Weisselberg here. He's expected to plead guilty later this morning, then we will learn more details about the specific crimes that he's pleading guilty to. But they are perjury charges related to the New York attorney general's civil fraud investigation -- Kate.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. I mean, there are some great anecdotes in this story, John, but it all stems from really -- you know, Donald Trump is gearing up for a very costly general election campaign against Joe Biden while also facing the enormous legal costs of all of the legal problems that he is facing. And because of that his campaign is really trying to rein in spending.Now, we have one anecdote about how staff on the campaign often refer to Susie Wiles, one of the campaign managers, as a miser -- something that she agrees with. We have one story about how a staffer had been telling others -- to make sure to tell others, I should say, that he was only taking UberX, one of the more less costly Ubers. Because if he didn't, Susie would, quote, \"Kill me.\" Now, we also know that Chris LaCivita -- he is another campaign manager for the Trump operation -- he has privately grumbled on multiple occasions about how expensive Donald Trump's rallies are. And he's made a very concerted effort to try and host these large rallies at smaller venues to try and save some money. We also have some great color about how in the Trump headquarters across the country they've been pulling furniture from yard sales. They -- it's all mismatched, as one senior adviser described it. They don't have mahogany desks and if they do, they're falling apart. That just gives you an example of, really, how they look at this. Now, I do want to share with you a quote from LaCivita, who remarked on some of this. He said, quote, \"Any organization that is concerned or at least puts that level of concern at the forefront, you're gonna get better bids for business.\" He added, \"If you're not spending the majority of your money on touching voters and pushing your candidate, then you're not running a good campaign.\" Now, John, I can tell you that this frugal approach is something that many of Donald Trump's top staff and aides do take pride in. But it also has been a point of frustration for many as -- you know, you look at past campaigns. They were able to spend a lot more money. They were a little bit more free with their expenses. This time around they're very much keeping a tight leash on it.",

      "sentences": "It's a huge part of it. And the way that I have heard from my conversations with Donald Trump's campaign about this is they look at it as two-fold.One is about they recognize that in 2020 when Donald Trump was still the incumbent and money was supposed to be one of the big assets of his campaign, they actually spent and burned through hundreds of millions of dollars in just a matter of months. And that left them in a really dire financial situation in the lead-up to the 2020 election. And so that's something that his top advisers very much fear. But you're right. One of the bigger and I think driving concerns of this frugal approach is the legal bills and they recognize that that's been putting them at a disadvantage. We know that the Biden campaign has fundraised far more than them. They have way more money in the bank than Donald Trump does. And there's a few ways they look at paying for this. So, one is the Trump campaign is still planning to rely on Save America, his main leadership PAC, to underwrite his legal bills except they had actually spent $50 million -- or more than $50 million last year. And so, they are in their own dire financial situation. But one way that -- and this is new reporting, John -- that they're also planning to pay for this is Donald Trump, himself, has been putting forth his own money to underwrite his own legal bills. And this is from a man that we know has long loathed paying lawyers. He's stiffed his lawyers in the past. And so, this is a departure for the former president.",

It will be available online.And what we know about Opill, it's a mini pill. It contains progestin only to help prevent pregnancy. And if it's taken as instruction -- so about the same time every day -- it can be up to 98 percent effective. And as for the cost, we know that it has the manufacturer's suggested retail price of $19.99 for a one-month supply; $49.99 for a three- month pack, and $89.99 for a six-month pack. But, Kate, as you said, at a time when there's been a lot of debates and concern, really, around women's access to reproductive health services, this rollout of the nation's first-ever over-the-counter birth control pill to stores -- it's a major milestone, Kate.",

They determined that even if it was a crack that it would be tightened by reentry by the heat and that it did not pose a real threat. So they were confident enough to go ahead with the launch. But that was right down to takeoff.Takeoff, really beautiful. Picture-perfect there. Burning about 700 gallons of fuel a second as they took off and got up into orbit and started chasing down the International Space Station to catch up with it tomorrow and dock there. They're going to do a lot of important work while they're there -- about 200 different experiments. Many of them are aimed, really, at sustainability in space. About how people deal with things like the impact of microgravity and UV radiation, stem cell study, and test pressure cuffs. In this case, they're looking at circulation that might be happening in the legs and the arms of the astronauts when they're up there. Three astronauts -- NASA astronauts, one cosmonaut from Roscosmos. So -- and three of them flying for the very first time. Only one has been up there before and that is the pilot. In any event, one of the real reasons there's so much focus on human health and radiation and all of this is all becoming more and more a precursor for this return to the moon and a potential trip to Mars maybe in the 2030s, 2040s -- depending on when that might happen -- when human sustainability in that environment is really going to matter. And one of the nicest things that happened yesterday was they have an anti-gravity or a zero-gravity indicator that each crew takes along, which is basically something to just float around and show they've reached zero-gravity. What they took this time was a small stuffed toy. In this case, a little dog. You can see it just there to the left. He's sort of playing with it and bouncing it around. That was chosen by one of the astronaut's children to represent the sacrifice of families and kids when people have to go away to their work, whether they're astronauts or anybody else.

But still, a consequential and very impactful storm. And one of the major reasons is not just the amount of snow. Yes, we've accumulated more than Shaquille O'Neal's height. He's seven- foot-one. We have 7 1/2-foot totals, so far. And just look at this. One hundred forty-five mile-per-hour winds. You don't even need that much snow on the ground to lift it up into the air, reducing the visibility, and all of a sudden it becomes extremely difficult whiteout conditions.
