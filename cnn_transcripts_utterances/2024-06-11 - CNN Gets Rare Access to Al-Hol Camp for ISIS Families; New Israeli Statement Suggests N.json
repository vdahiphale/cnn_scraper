Five years after the terror group's defeat, 50,000 prisoners and their families are being held in 27 prisons and camps across northern Syria. CNN's Clarissa Ward gained extraordinary access to some of those facilities, including the notorious Panorama prison. Now most of those held are children, stateless and now coming of age. I want to bring you into Clarissa's exclusive report. And I do want to warn you as you watch here, some of these images may be disturbing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CLARISSA WARD, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Cell phone videos of ISIS' brutal justice that the world hoped it would never see again. Shared for the first time with CNN, these images weren't captured in Raqqa or Mosul in 2016. They were taken in 2022 in the Al-Hol camp in northern Syria, a sprawling dumping ground for the women and children captured after ISIS was defeated. Five years after the fall of the caliphate, ISIS' ideology lives on here. Security officials warn it is a ticking time bomb, ungovernable and hostile to the outside world.",

The defense resting on Monday and following closing arguments, of course, the jury began deliberating -- deliberated for about an hour on Monday afternoon. Hunter Biden declining to take the stand. In those closing arguments prosecutors tried to convince the jury Biden had illegally purchased a gun in 2018 while addicted to drugs. For their part, Hunter Biden's defense team argued prosecutors are trying to inflate the evidence to win convictions based on suspicion and conjecture alone. Important to note as well, among a number of firsts that we have been talking about, this is the first criminal trial ever for the child of a sitting U.S. president. CNN's Evan Perez, is live outside the courthouse in Wilmington, Delaware. As we are on effectively on a jury watch here, Evan, bring us up to speed in terms of what we heard in those closing arguments tomorrow. And if there is any indication at this hour on when we can expect a verdict. EVAN PEREZ, CNN SR. JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT:  Yes. Look, we're about 3.5 hours into this jury deliberation. Really, it's up to them to decide whether the prosecution has proved its case, right? The case here is really pretty simple. There's overwhelming evidence that Hunter Biden was using drugs during this period, 2015 to 2019. There was text messages, videos. There's photos of him with drug paraphernalia. It's his own words also in his memoir, where he talks about his struggle with addiction and it's also no doubt that he bought the firearm. The question is -- and this is what the defense was focusing on in their closing argument yesterday that took about 90 minutes, was whether he had the presence of mind. Did he know, did he believe he was addicted to drugs at the time he filled out the federal form that is required for you to buy a firearm? And so that's what the jury has faced in deciding these three counts. He faces up to 25 years possibly, this as being a first offender if he is convicted. It's probably unlikely that he would he would serve anything like that. But the danger is -- the risk for Hunter Biden is absolute, that he could face prison time if he is found guilty in this case. And the last things that we heard from prosecutors yesterday was an answer to some of the accusations from the defense. The defense said they have proved their case. There is no indication Hunter Biden was using drugs in October of 2018 when he bought the firearm. They also said that they accused the prosecutors of rehearsing with witnesses and are being cruel to Naomi Biden, Hunter Biden's daughter, who testified here last week. In response prosecutors really were very tough in their last words before the jury left the room. They said anyone who puts a crack pipe to their mouth every 15 minutes knows that they're an addict. And those are the words that jurors were left with as they today exited yesterday. Erica.",

But of course, as we've come out of the pandemic, the number of crimes, the rate has started to drop as well. Let's look at some of those figures just released by the FBI. You can see it's moving certainly in a positive direction. Murders down 26 percent; reported rapes down nearly 26 percent; aggravated assaults, robberies are also down. Looking at property crime, we've seen a drop in burglaries as well as things like even vehicle theft. And this impacts all regions across the country. We've seen these numbers. And so certainly any crime is bad, obviously, for officials in the U.S. as they try to grapple with this problem. But you look at these stunning numbers that are certainly moving in a positive direction.",

A new Alzheimer's drug is now one step closer to approval in the U.S. That's after a panel of independent advisers to the FDA, the U.S. drug authority, voted to endorse Eli Lilly's drug. It's called donanemab. The drug itself has been shown to slow the progression of the disease in its early stages. Deemed safe and effective, Lilly telling the panel that its data from clinical research showed patients who took donanemab actually had a 37 percent lower risk of progression of the disease over a 1.5 year period. Compared with those patients who received the placebo. It's important to note here this is one step but that drug of course, must still get final approval from the FDA. We are continuing to follow developments on this Gaza ceasefire proposal. Could Israel actually be ready to sign on to the plan? We will discuss.

In commentstoday, Antony Blinken saying it is up to Hamas here to create concrete actions toward a truce. This comes on the heels of the U.N. Security Council's approval of a U.S. backed plan to end the war. And in a statement released a short time ago, Israel indicating prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu appears poised to formally accept that plan, which he, of course, has avoided doing in the past. So that again begs the question of whether Hamas will accept that plan. \"The Wall Street Journal\" reporting that Hamas' military leader is pleased with the progress of the war, saying Hamas has the upper hand in his view and that the civilian casualties seen in Gaza, tens of thousands of them, are, quote, \"necessary sacrifices.\" Gregg Carlstrom reports on the Middle East for the economy and is joining us from Dubai. Greg, it's good to have you with me. I just want to start off with where we stand at this hour. So we know there have been more conversations; Antony Blinken, of course, I believe he's in Jordan at the moment. This new statement from Israel a little bit more public in terms of where the government could go. Do you believe that changes anything? GREGG CARLSTROM, MIDDLE EAST CORRESPONDENT, \"THE ECONOMIST\":  A little bit more public but I think there are still a couple of big questions. One of them is, if Hamas does agree to this, if the leadership inside of Gaza does agreed to this deal, will the Israeli cabinet then vote in favor of this? Bibi Netanyahu has to bring it before his right-wing coalition partners and get the cabinet on board. But before it gets to that point, I think we have the same question that we've had for months now in these ceasefire talks, which is this issue of whether or not Hamas will go for a deal that may not turn into a permanent ceasefire. U.N. Security Council in its resolution last night, sort of trying to fudge that issue. The ceasefire agreement itself also fudges that issue and that is still holding up these talks, I think as it has for the better part of this year now.",

And we don't know the extent to which these comments are accurate or true or to what extent they're sort of retroactively trying to distance themselves from some of the things that took place on October 7th. But I think on the part of Sinwar, it speaks to maybe a broader miscalculation that he has been making for a while now, not just with what was going to happen on October 7th but also what the reaction was going to be. \"The Journal\" reported and I've heard as well from people in Hamas that they were surprised after October 7th that they didn't receive more support from Hezbollah in Lebanon, from Iran and other Iranian proxies in the region. They thought there was going to be sort of full-throated support from the other members of the so-called axis of resistance. And they didn't receive that. So I think there were a lot of miscalculations, a lot of erroneous thinking that went on in the days both before and after October 7th.",

And he didn't succeed in pushing Netanyahu to talk about any of those things. And that's why he went ahead and left the war cabinet. But by doing that, he deprives Netanyahu of sort of a centrist fig leaf, which is something that Netanyahu has always liked having in his governments. He has to contend with politicians who are on his Right and he always likes having someone to his Left, someone from the center, to balance his far-right coalition partners. That's been true over the past eight months. That's been true of many of his governments over the past 15 years. He doesn't have that balance anymore. And so when Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich and the far-right members of his coalition, when they push him not to accept the ceasefire deal, when they push him to continue the war. When they push him perhaps for more action in the north on the border with Lebanon, he doesn't have centrist figures anymore in the war cabinet to use as a foil to try to push back on those demands from the Right.",

Tesla's chief Elon Musk saying in a post on Monday, he would actually ban Apple devices at various companies -- at his various companies if it, quote, \"integrates OpenAI at the operating system level.\" My colleague Becky Anderson sat down with the minister for AI in the United Arab Emirates just today, asking him how he feels about this and whether he'd be happy to have devices with OpenAI in the operating system in his ministry.
