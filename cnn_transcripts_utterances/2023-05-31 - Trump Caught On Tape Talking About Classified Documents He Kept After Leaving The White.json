The former president on tape acknowledging he held on to a classified Pentagon document about a potential attack on Iran and prosecutors have the tape. Also, the vote that nearly did not happen expected anytime now on the debt ceiling deal just hours after it barely squeaked onto the House floor. And rattling Russia, a closer look at the shadowy effort that is getting high profile results bringing the war in Ukraine onto Russian soil. We begin tonight with exclusive new reporting. The prosecutors investigating the former president's handling of classified material have in their possession a recording from the summer of 2021, in which the former president is telling people around him in a meeting at his golf resort in Bedminster that he has held on to a classified Pentagon document about a potential attack on Iran. As CNN is reporting, this undercuts his argument that he declassified everything and on the tape as he spoke, it sounds like he was waving a piece of paper around raising the question, was he holding the classified document in question? Which goes what CNN's Kaitlan Collins asked him at CNN's townhall earlier this month. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, Meadows was not at this meeting, but during this time, Trump had a habit of asking his aides to record conversations with journalists, writers, anyone working on a book. So this is not a secret recording. What we are told on this recording, Trump can be heard disclosing that he had in his possession a classified Pentagon document discussing a possible attack on Iran. And as you noted, on the tape, you can hear him -- it sounds like rustling paper, maybe he is waving something, but it's unclear if he's waving the document itself, or something else just for theatrical effect. But most significantly for investigators, Trump suggests that he would like to share this document, but there are limits he acknowledges on his ability to declassify materials now that he is out of office.",

And he and his attorneys, they've put out these various at times contradicting explanations for how he did not intentionally withhold classified documents.They have argued that he had a standing declassified orders, so anything that left the Oval Office automatically declassified. He said that he could declassify things with his mind. Then his attorneys sent a letter to Congress suggesting that the only reason he had any classified materials in his possession is because at the end of his administration, it was so chaotic, things were inadvertently put in boxes. But Anderson, what he says on this recording completely undercuts all of those claims. Also significant here, so far, the focus in terms of classified material has been on what was discovered down in Florida, especially at Mar-a-Lago. But now, this recording suggests that there may have been potential mishandling of classified materials at another location at Bedminster, which is of course in New Jersey.",

Now, we are told that he did not produce this document. Also significant we have learned that Mark Milley has spoken with investigators in the special counsel's probe, and Anderson, that is significant. He is the highest ranking national security official to be interviewed that we know of, but that's the key.

We've seen incredible developments out of this investigation over the last few months and I am sure they have much more than we're aware of. But this evidence is -- it could be really impactful. And as Paula stated, it obliterates many of the defenses that he has launched over the last few months. It conclusively establishes not only that he took classified information, because he admits that, but also that he knew he had classified information, he admits that as well, and that he knew it was still classified, and he was limited in how he could handle it or distribute it. Those are really key elements of proof, and it is him speaking, supposedly, in his own voice, a recording that I'm sure will be played before the jury. That is very powerful evidence of wrongdoing.",

So the mere fact that this might have been revealing or containing military information or troop movements, that itself makes it a crime. So, we've got to get out of this framing of talking about classification versus declassification, because it really for most of the crimes that could be investigated here, based on information that we have, don't really have anything to do with classification at all. And to back up Andrew's point, what he has said here on at least -- assuming this recording says what it says it says, is his acknowledgement that he admitted that he possessed the documents and knew that they were in his possession, and knew that they were sensitive. And that is -- you know, there's no such thing as a smoking gun in the real world, but it is incredibly valuable evidence because it speaks to intent, it speaks to knowledge, it speaks to what he knew that he had.

You subpoena them to trial, they come in and testify and tell you about how they did it and what they did with that recording afterwards. Elliot can walk you through that in great detail, I'm sure.But the interesting thing to me here is there are other witnesses. You know, potentially, you can imagine a trial scenario in which every person in that room testifies at some point. For instance, the authors of Mark Meadows' memoir who were listening to this display, will be able to say what was in his hand at the moment that he was saying this. You hear this noise in the background, it sounds like somebody is moving a piece of paper. Did you see the president doing something at that point? What did you assume that he meant by waving a piece of paper? What did you think -- was that the report that he was talking about? So there are all kinds of additional corroborative detail that you could add to this very rich picture of the misuse of classified information in front of a bunch of people who don't have any official access to classified information.",

Okay, so you know, who did he hand it to? Where were you sitting? Who saw it? Who else saw it? What did he say at the time? And it sort of, you know, showing one piece of evidence may be not that persuasive to your jury, but six or seven witnesses saying largely the same thing, and something that let's be clear, has been recorded on audio. You know, when we're talking about eyewitness testimony, it is far less reliable. Recordings are pretty reliable, right, and if you have someone who authenticate the recording, it is really good evidence. And Anderson, you know, you and I talk about this when I'm on a lot, it is rare that I say something is actually really good evidence, but this is quite persuasive if it is -- you know, look, I haven't heard it, but if it is, as described, that can be devastating in a courtroom, and I've seen it before where recordings come in, they can just be devastating. COOPER: And General Hertling, according to the reporting, the former president at that time was upset about, I believe, it was an article I think, was in the 'New Yorker\" that it had come out or reporting about things Mark Milley may have said that the former -- you know that there -- or may have said to people at The Pentagon about concerns in the final days that the former president might do something and saying that he wanted word if any orders were given that sounded extreme, and the former president was upset by that. If that's the case, and the reason he is having this conversation with these people at Bedminster and with the biographers for Mark Meadows for a book I don't think anybody actually read or bought, does that -- you said that actually adds to this if that's his motivation?",

And you know, most of the focus on these classified documents has been at Mar-a-Lago. Now we're talking about classified documents at another location with proof. It just is an indicator of a lack of care of our nation's secrets.So to me, it makes a world of difference, and I tell you, having been a court martial convening authority, if any soldier were to do something like that, there would be an immediate filing of a court martial on those individuals.",

We see them bringing witnesses into a grand jury who are out at the absolute kind of upper echelons of those folks who you would want to talk to.They have concluded many fights of fighting back claims of privilege and dragged those people into the grand jury reluctantly. It appears to me that some of the witnesses that they've been talking to recently look like kind of mop up operations, you know, the sorts of things that you do to lineup specific details that you think you might need in your indictment. So I think there's a lot of clues out there that they're probably getting to the end of their presentation. There have been some reporting recently, they haven't even been in front of the grand jury since the beginning of May. So I think it's probably imminent, at least the point at which they will make a decision whether or not to indict. And quite frankly, having already crossed the hurdle of piercing the attorney-client privilege between former President Trump and his attorney, Evan Corcoran months ago, it's almost unthinkable that they will not go forward and seek an indictment.

No, they should be going after Trump explaining why he is reckless. Heabsconded with classified material. He possessed it. And apparently, he disclosed it to people without security clearances.

Of course, for months, there was a standoff between the House Republicans and the White House. The White House refused to negotiate at all, said that the debt ceiling, $31.4 trillion borrowing limit must be raised without any conditions. That was a position rejected by Speaker McCarthy.Kevin McCarthy ultimately forced the White House to the negotiating table just days ago and those fraught negotiations took place, they broke down, they happened again, ultimately cutting a deal on Saturday that included a range of concessions, as well as some spending limits over the next two fiscal years, that all part of a deal to raise the debt ceiling up until January of 2025. We do expect this to pass. And the question now is how many Republicans and Democrats vote to push this over the finish line tonight. The big thing to watch when the vote happens here in just a matter of moments is whether or not Kevin McCarthy is able to get a majority of the House Republican conference. That is the goal. That is what the Speaker has been pushing for. He told me earlier today that he does expect a majority of the conference. That's what his top negotiator Patrick McHenry just told me moments ago. That is the hope. One big reason why is that, if he gets a lesser number, a fewer Republicans, minority Republicans supporting this, he could face even more backlash from some elements of the right wing of his conference who are already upset at the deal he cut with the White House.

And what that means generally is that you have a number of votes, a healthy majority coming from the center, Democrats and Republicans, and you have people on the left and people on the right who are upset because the party gave away things that those on either side of the aisle, these sort of extremes on both sides, didn't want. The question now is in the short-term, the political question for Kevin McCarthy, because he has such a small majority of Republicans, is whether or not the ability that Republicans have, anybody really has, to vacate the chair, meaning oust him from the speakership, whether they're going to use it. It's not really clear. I will tell you that I was getting a text from a conservative Republican, a fiscally conservative Republican who supported McCarthy, who said that the calls he's getting to his office are now more about Kevin McCarthy than about the bill itself. And that if people are hearing that in these ruby red districts back home this weekend, that may change the dynamic when it comes to McCarthy.",

And time and again, he has really I think over-performed expectation. People have expected him to stumble and he keeps doing a good job. So, what he has done here is he has brought together a broad governing coalition of the middle of the Republicans and I guess, it sounds like the middle of the Democrats to do something responsible, which is raise the debt limit. We have divided government, which means the far right of his party cannot do what they want to do, which is do massive spending cuts and massive changes to fiscal policy. They ought not be mad at Kevin McCarthy. The reason they're upset is because they lost the White House and they lost the Senate and it's not Kevin McCarthy they ought to be mad about, it's Donald Trump that they ought be upset with on that front.

The Republican bill that originally passed the House tied to the debt ceiling hike would have decimated some of the things that he had passed last year through the Inflation Reduction Act, including that big climate package. None of that happened. He -- so, I think he came out well in this. But I agree with everything that has been said. This is what a good faith compromise looks like in divided government, and this is what you can expect. What you can expect in this vote is that there will be a lot of folks to take a free vote to express themselves, particularly to their constituents that they fought this thing, knowing the votes are there to pass the bill and not tank the economy through default. And that's really what has happened here. No one in November of 2024, Anderson, are going to be thinking about this particular vote. But they would be if it went down and if the country went into default and the economy went spiraling. So, I think Biden did well to get to this point.",
