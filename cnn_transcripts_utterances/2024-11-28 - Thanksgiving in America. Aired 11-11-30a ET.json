They're just starting to make his way moving again there, making his way down the street here in New York City as part of the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade. We're celebrating Thanksgiving, though, all across the city. Here in New York, parade goers, the spirits are very high, even if the rest of the day is very, very wet. There you see him, Santa, the man in Houston, exciting stuff. Santa's making appearances pretty much every parade, or I'm told maybe that is Detroit. Are we moving on to Detroit? Oh, look, there we are. On to Detroit, we have seen so many great folks on the streets of Detroit. There are a lot of excitement for the Lions in the crowd there. You may see a lot of blue. Our own our own Nick Valencia met a dog dressed as a lion in honor of the team, looking fabulous earlier today, a little dog named Cash. Lots of great folks coming out in all of these cities to celebrate the holiday, to celebrate each one of their individual cities here. Looking at live pictures out of Chicago, where there are also a number of performances throughout the morning in the parade. They're really celebrating the diversity of the Windy City. A fantastic hour still to come for you here of Thanksgiving festivities on CNN. Ahead, not just the praise. We also have our good friend, superstar chef Bobby Flay, who's going to join us again this morning from the Food Network Kitchen, showing us how to take your Thanksgiving feast and played it like a professional. Also, what better way to kick off the holiday season than with a performance by the one and only Temptations, the group celebrating the 60th anniversary of My Girl. And just a little bit later in the show, they're actually going to join us to perform a popular Christmas classic. So, lots to look forward to. Let's get you straight though to Houston, where my good friend, Rosa Flores, is standing by. And as I understand it, oh, I think I have a clue as to who may be headed your way in a matter of moments, as I see you've done another costume change. ROSA FLORES, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  That's right, Erica. Santa Claus is in Houston, and, of course, you're having a special guest right now, Mrs. Claus. Santa Claus gave me the naughty and nice list. I hope you can hear me because I can't hear myself speaking right now because of the band that's behind me. But I'm going to put this naughty and nice list down for just a second because I want to get to business here. I have Patrick and Leonard here from True Barbecue. And when we talk about Texas, we got to talk about barbecue. You're from True Barbecue.",

So, in Chicago, a lot happening there, as we've been showing you throughout the morning, I believe the Wu Zhi Lin Performing Arts Association. We see it right here. They have a float, which features performers wearing traditional Chinese attire, also performing folk dances. It's just another reminder of the diversity of the parade in Chicago, and so much of that is meant to celebrate the diversity of the city of Chicago as well. So, really a great time there on the streets of the Windy City. I mentioned the big papier-mache heads in Detroit. In Detroit it is the largest collection of papier-mache heads. They're actually known as big heads and this is -- it is the 17th appearance here for them in the parade. Very cool as you go to look at that. Live from our friends there at WDIV in Detroit. We also have some special guests who know a thing or two about being a big, happy family. The hosts of Inside the NBA on TNT, you know them too, Shaquille O'Neal, Charles Barkley, Kenny Smith, Ernie Johnson Jr., they're joining us now with a special Thanksgiving message and a little bit about what they're thankful for this year. ERNIE JOHNSON JR., HOST, INSIDE THE NBA:  Hey, it's the Inside the NBA crew. So, let's go right down the line. Shaq, Thanksgiving, what are you thankful for? SHAQUILLE O'NEIL, HOST, INSIDE THE NBA:  Well, I'm thankful for you guys, thankful for family, thankful for children, thankful to just still be working and just still be relevant somehow and just happy. If it was up to me, I would like to see homeless people have a great day today. You know, it really hurts my heart to see people not have somewhere to go on a nightly basis. So, if I was in control, I would make sure everybody at least can have a meal on that day.",

We don't do that as much as we should. But for some reason, everybody gets together on Thanksgiving. And that's what I'm thankful for. And I hope -- and then to piggyback on Shaq's point. Man, there's so many great people around the country, these homeless shelters and people who have events where people who can't afford Thanksgiving dinner get to go. It's always special to see that on television.",
