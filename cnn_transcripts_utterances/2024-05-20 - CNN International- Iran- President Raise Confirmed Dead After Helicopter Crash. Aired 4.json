      "sentences": "Well, hello, and welcome to our viewers joining us from around the world. I'm Becky Anderson. It is Monday, May the 20th, 9 a.m. here in London. It is 11.30 a.m. in Iran, where the government is expressing condolences over the deaths of President Ebrahim Raisi, the country's president, and the foreign minister, and seven others in a helicopter crash. Rescuers are transferring the bodies of those killed from the crash site in Iran's east Azerbaijan province to the city of Tabriz. Iranian officials say the helicopter ran into trouble amid heavy fog on Sunday afternoon.At the time of the crash, there were low-hanging clouds and cool temperatures across the region with fog settling in as the sun set. Well, images of the crash site show the remote mountainous area where the aircraft went down. The president and other officials have been attending an inauguration ceremony of a new dam near the border with Azerbaijan. Ivan Watson following reaction from around the region. First, let's bring in Paula Hancocks with more from Abu Dhabi, and we are just hearing from the spokesperson of the Iranian Guardians Council with a response to this news. Paula, what's being said?",

      "sentences": "Well, Becky, the Guardian Council has said that they want to share their condolences, saying it is a great loss for the Iranian nation, also saying that what has happened is a tragedy. But really saying what we have been hearing consistently from Iranian officials, that this will not be disruptive.Now, it's something that we heard earlier from the supreme leader himself. This was before the confirmation that the president, the foreign minister and seven others had been killed in that helicopter crash, saying that there would be no disruption. It really is a message of stability that the Iranian government wants to project at this point. We also heard from the Iranian government expressing their condolences over the death, saying that President Raisi was hardworking and tireless. Now, we know that this all happened around about 1:30 in the afternoon on Sunday. That is when we received the first reports that there was a missing helicopter. Now, the president and foreign minister were in a convoy of three helicopters. Two of the helicopters landed safely, but theirs did not. What we understand now, it did crash into the side of a mountain in an area which is really very inhospitable. It is a very difficult terrain, which has been evidenced by the fact that it took rescue teams some 16 hours to be able to find the area where this helicopter went down. Now, we also know of the conditions, as you mentioned there during this helicopter flight, that there was low hanging cloud, that fog made visibility very challenging. In fact, as soon as rescue teams started their operations, they said that they were unable to put a helicopter up to try and find the location of the crash because it was simply too dangerous. So, of course, that will be raising some questions as to why the president was in the air at this point as well. There has been an urgent cabinet meeting in Iran. We saw the seat where President Raisi usually sits, had a black sash across it in mourning. We're seeing television presenters wearing black. There are in between all the news bulletins that we are seeing Islamic prayers being broadcast. We've also heard that there will be timing and details of the mourning procession announced in the very near future. There really is a sense of the mourning already beginning in Iran -- Becky.",

      "sentences": "Well, I mean, there is a transition that Paula has been mentioning, but part of this is because Iran has been through a bumpy number of years. It's been facing economic challenges, environmental issues with reports of water shortages. It's had an uprising in the last two years that was violently crushed with reports of hundreds of protesters being killed, not to mention arrests and executions as well.And the ongoing tension with Iran's archenemy, Israel, which resulted in exchange of direct fire between these two governments just last month, breaking precedent in the tense and oftentimes deadly history between those two regional rivals. So the Iranian government has come out with the statement from the supreme leader on Sunday, Ali Khamenei, saying, hey, we're going to move forward as I want you to pray for the missing president. That was before confirmation that all the passengers aboard the helicopter had died. And now with statements that, yes, there will be continuity, there will not be instability, that there is a system in place to set up for now the vice president taking over and then for a transition period to another round of elections. The regional reaction, Becky, has been of an outpouring of condolences for Ibrahim Raisi, for Iran's foreign minister, as well as the rest of their entourage, particularly from Iran's allies. So you have the Houthis of Yemen who've come out with condolences. You have the Palestinian militant group Hamas, of course, entrenched in this grinding and very deadly conflict in Gaza that has come out and expressed sympathies and condolence. And Hezbollah in Lebanon, which is currently engaged in ongoing battles across the border with Israel, has come out with its own statement calling Raisi, his eminence, the martyr president, calling him a big brother, a strong supporter and a staunch defender of Hezbollah's issues and the nation's issues, most notably Jerusalem and Palestine, and a protector of the resistance movements. And the prime minister of Lebanon has come out declaring three days of mourning in that country as well. The Russian foreign ministry minister expressing mourning. And then Iran's neighbor to the West, Turkey, which, you know, isn't always lockstep in allegiance, in alliance with Iran, has expressed sympathy and even lent a drone for that frantic recovery research, sorry, rescue effort, when for some 16 hours the Iranian government could not find their own president after his helicopter went down in this crash.",

Thank you.Well, let's pick up where Ivan left off with Ali Vaez, who is the International Crisis Group's Iran Project Director joining us via Skype from Doha, Qatar today. Ali, good to have you. Let's just pick up there. You heard the response regionally from a number of key players, as it were, to the news of the death of the Iranian president and indeed the foreign minister. What do you make of what we are hearing?",

      "sentences": "Well, Vice President Mokhber, who is very close to the Supreme Leader and the Revolutionary Guards, will take over as of today and is in charge, along with the head of the judiciary and the parliament, to organize an election in the next 50 days. That means candidates would have to announce that they're running. Disqualification or vetting process would have to happen through the Guardian Council, which is in charge of this.An election has to be organized, which at this moment that the regime is suffering from a crisis of legitimacy at home, it's a very risky thing for them to do. Mass mobilization, by definition, is going to be quite a concern for the Islamic Republic at this moment in time. And then once a president is in office, he has to put together his cabinet and start running the country. All of that means in the next few weeks, Iran will be very much internally focused.",

      "sentences": "The national security file and indeed the ideological direction of the Islamic Republic not set by the president. So the impact for decision makers in Washington, in Tel Aviv, in Jerusalem, in London and capitals around the world will not be as significant, perhaps, as surely the passing of, for example, the Supreme Leader, who, of course, is 85 years old. There is a succession behind the scenes at present as to, you know, what happens next with regard to that very important leadership position.Ali, what do we know?",

      "sentences": "Well, this is exactly, Vicky, right, you're putting your finger on the most important uncertainty that Raisi's passing is going to create. Now, I'm not privy to the conversations, and I think most people who speculate are not, of whether Raisi was indeed the candidate that the system was grooming for succeeding the 85-year-old Supreme Leader. But that was a widespread belief.And his sudden removal from the stage basically creates a vacuum and creates a jockeying for that position. And in 1981, in fact, the current Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, became president when his predecessor was killed in a bombing in the capital city of Tehran. And so, you know, it is quite possible that the system would want someone with the profile of Raisi, who was very loyal to the Supreme Leader and extremely subservient to him as well, to be elected so that he could potentially also be the successor to the current Supreme Leader. But it's also possible that the successor would not be a cleric. And in that case, the system would have elsewhere for a successor. But at the end of the day, you know, it's not difficult to find people in that system who fit that profile of basically being a yes man to the current Supreme Leader so that he can make sure that he could preserve his legacy and his vision for the future of the Islamic Republic.",

      "sentences": "And of course, his son, Mojtaba Khamenei, is certainly one of the names thrown in as a potential for that succession going forward. Although a hereditary succession, of course, was at the heart of Khamenei's problem. One of the problems that he had with the rule of the Shah beforehand.Ali, I think it's important then that while we have underscored how the demise, the death of the president and foreign minister will not be hugely impactful on national security, on foreign policy, and consequently, Iran's influence on the region and around the world, where do things stand at present? Obviously, incredibly complex, complicated and worrying period of instability in the region. And as yet, no clear direction with regard to the Iran nuclear file. So where do things stand?",

Seven other people were on board. Search and rescue teams say they found no survivors at this crash site. And the bodies of those killed in the crash, they say will be transported to the city of Tabriz. The aircraft came down early Sunday afternoon as it was flying over Iran's East Azerbaijan province.Well joining me now is CNN senior White House reporter Kevin Liptack. He's been traveling with U.S. President Joe Biden in Michigan. And the delegation there will have been aware since local time Sunday afternoon that of the reports of what was described as a heavy landing for the helicopter in which the president and foreign minister were traveling. It was only early Monday morning in the cold light of day, as it were, that the deaths of those two men were confirmed. And what, if anything, have we heard from the president or his administration?",
