And the reason why we know this is because when our parents were in the process of creating us -- I mean, it's the birds and the bees stories but cleaned up for all audiences -- we were one of over 400 million options, and God chose us.And so, if we don't know anything, we have to know that we were born on purpose and therefore, we have a purpose. That purpose, once it uncovers itself -- when it reveals itself to us, we get the opportunity to say it's time. You know, for me, of course, I've been waiting to figure out why. And they say if you can find the why you can live in the how. And, of course, all throughout the journey I knew that my faith was guiding me and was helping me. In fact, I was hanging on to the rope that God extends to all of us, and that's what literally allowed me to jump over barriers -- leaps and bounds -- figure out ways forward. Really, in many ways, I think I call it resuscitating my own life. That life that was altered. That was -- that was interrupted. Arrested development if you will. I wasn't supposed to be able to come out unscathed. I mean, we still have indelible scars, of course. But at the same time, those scars allow me to be able to peer into the darkness. To understand where those pain points are for our people and say you know what, I've been so close to the pain, we have to have a seat at the table.

Again, I assume that will come. But really, where the difference lies, Victor, is that this app has the same content moderation and safety rules that you get on Instagram. You also can import your same following and followers list from Instagram, which automatically gives you a little bit of a community to start.
