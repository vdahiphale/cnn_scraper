On day one of his fraud trial in New York City, Donald Trump is said to be incensed of allegations he lied about his net worth. Thanks for joining us here on CNN. For more than a year and a half, U.S. and European support for Ukraine has been almost unshakable for what could be the beginning of the smallest of cracks in that united front. The uncertainty is in Europe coming from a pro-Russian politician Robert Fico winning parliamentary elections in Slovakia, a NATO member. And in Washington, Congress stripped future money from Ukraine from a bill to fund government and averted shutdown. But President Joe Biden says he remains confident that support for Ukraine will be restored. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Germany, Poland and Ukraine signed an agreement in April to set up a hub in Poland to repair Leopard 2 battle tanks used in Ukraine to fight against the Russians.Ukrainian forces say weapons from the United States and other western countries are vital to their success. Without that support, they will lose. CNN's Fred Pleitgen visited the front lines for a close up look. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): Ukraine's 80th Airborne Assault Brigade storming Russian positions on the eastern front using U.S. made weapons to try and dislodge Vladimir Putin's troops, gains that would probably be impossible if Washington cut military assistance. This soldier, whom we can only name as, Vassil (ph), tells me. I don't know what to say that would be tough, he says. The troops say U.S. supplied weapons, like this Browning heavy machine gun, are helping them turn the tide because they're more accurate, more reliable, and more robust than what the Russians have. (on camera): You can see just how important military aid for Ukraine is for that country to stay in the fight. It's everything from rifles to surface to air missile systems to help Ukraine push Russia back. (voice-over): The U.S. has sent more than $45 billion worth of security assistance to Ukraine since Russia's full on invasion. Many weapons viewed as game changers by Kyiv, like the HIMARS multiple rocket launching systems and Bradley infantry fighting vehicles, which Kyiv says have already saved the lives of many Ukrainian soldiers. Losing U.S assistance would be catastrophic, Ukraine admits. But the national security advisor tells CNN he doesn't believe it will be cut. We are more than confident that this will not happen, he says. If the United States is a country responsible for the democratic world and has assumed this responsibility, it would be a great joy for Putin and all autocratic regimes if the U.S. withdrew the assistance it provides us. [01:05:09] But the Kremlin believes sooner or later Washington will buckle. Fatigue from the absurd sponsorship of the Kyiv regime will increase in various countries, including the United States, the spokesman says. And this fatigue will lead to a fragmentation of the political establishment and a rise infighting. The soldiers from the 80th Airborne say they badly need U.S. weapons to continue pushing the Russians back in the east, but will keep on fighting with or without American support. We don't have a choice, he says. We have to do it. Our brigade's motto is nobody but us. Fred Pleitgen, CNN, in eastern Ukraine. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "OK. So, on the one hand, no country has given more military or financial assistance than pure dollar amounts to Ukraine, more than the United States. The Pentagon's budget for next year is about $890 billion, just shy, and has spent a bit more than $43 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since the war began in February of 2022. So, in terms of a percentage of GDP, though, Estonia tops that list, spending the equivalent of 1.26 percent of its annual GDP. The U.S. comes in at number 12, about a point, about third of 1 percent. So you can slice and dice these numbers and serve them any way you want, but if you just put aside the whole ethical and moral reasons, and, you know, putting aside defense of liberty and rules of a, you know, global based world order, what has been the return on investment for U.S. taxpayers here and simply, you know, degrading Russia's military capability? And how long can the U.S. sustain this level of funding for Ukraine just from an economic sense?O'HANLON: Well, thank you. And first of all, on the return of investment, it's too soon to say. I mean, it's like asking whether the construction of the first iPhone was a good idea halfway through that process. I mean, we are in potentially early days in this war. We don't know where it's going. It could still escalate, it could still expand, or it could result in the overthrow of Vladimir Putin. So depending on which outcome we get, it's going to look a lot different when we assess the numbers. I think that so far, this has been a remarkable effort by the west, collectively defined, including Europe, Canada, the United States and Japan and a few other countries to show a lot of commitment to the idea of protecting or helping protect a sovereign country that's under attack from a ruthless dictator. We have devoted more than $200 billion collectively over the last two years between Europe, United States, Canada, and Japan. That is a remarkable and huge amount of money. It is greater than the Marshall Plan, all of the Marshall Plan. It is comparable to the Lend-Lease program of World War II, where the United States helped Britain and the Soviet Union with weaponry before it even got involved, and then thereafter. So the overall effort should make us all, if you're supporting and rooting for Ukraine, make us all feel proud and make us all feel impressed with our unity so far.",

There are signs of disunity, and that we may not sustain this fight indefinitely on behalf of our Ukrainian friends. We may not give them the support they're hoping for indefinitely. But I will say two things. One, it's Russia's fault this war is happening. And secondly, we're not going to collectively desert Ukraine to the point of letting them be overtaken by Russia. I think a plausible worst case scenario is we stop providing them weapons to take back more territory. But I'm confident, even with the Trump phenomenon in the United States, we will provide Ukraine enough help, we and our European, Canadian, Japanese allies, and Koreans and others, to make sure they can hold on to the 82 percent of their country they currently hold.

Day one of his New York trial on fraud charges, the former president was outraged when he was outside the court, inside he just simply scowled. More on that in a moment. Also ahead, scathing criticism of Trump from former chief of staff John Kelly. Hear what he is saying now about his former boss. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)",

The attorney general is seeking a quarter of a billion dollars in financial penalties, and a ban preventing Trump and his two sons from doing business in New York state.

When it was the defense's turn to bring its opening statements, they talked about how Trump made billions off of just good business deals in real estate, essentially saying that he did everything by the book and pointing out the fact that no fraud was committed. And that there were really no victims in this case. In some, they say, there was no illegality, there was no fraud, and there are no victims. Now as far as what was happening inside that courtroom, Letitia James was there inside sitting, as well as Eric Trump and Donald Trump proceeded with his defense attorneys. Now Donald Trump did not acknowledge Letitia James several times as he walked past her except for, maybe one time. Eric Trump actually walked over to Letitia James at shook her head twice throughout the duration of the day. But Trump did take the time outside of the courtroom to lash out, not only at Letitia James but about this trial in general and about the judge who will be deciding, really the balls and strikes of this entire case. So it will be interesting to see, if he shows up later on Tuesday for court, but as of now, it is unclear if he will show up.

No more sonic boom, more like a a thump. NASA Engineers are building the jet they call X-59. It's supersonic, meaning it will break the sound barrier, but it won't come with that great big boom. Scientists say (INAUDIBLE) much quieter than similar jets. This one will produce what NASA calls a sonic thump instead of a loud boom. It is a research jet meant to test the possibility of new technology and show us how fast we could actually travel on a commercial airline sometime in the future.

Glad to talk with you. VAUSE: So the X-59 QueSST, the QueSST part is short for Quiet Super Sonic Technology.

We have three phases at the X-59 test program. The first phase is the envelope expansion, make sure the airplane flies and do its mission, it's safe to fly, fly supersonically. And then phase two is all about documenting and demonstrating that the performance in terms of sonic boom, is actually what we expected to be. That's phase two.
