And another busy hour ahead,including Johannesburg horror, more than 70 people have lost their lives after fire tore through a building where migrants lived. We've got a live report from the scene as the rescue and recovery efforts continue. Plus, the Idalia's fury the remnants of the powerful category three hurricane still reeking havoc in the Southeastern United States. Officials saying some harder hit areas may never look the same amid monster storm surges and dangerous flooding. And factory fumble; manufacturing activity in China contracting for a fifth straight month the numbers actually not as bad as feared but new signs too that the property sector weakness is also weighing on consumer sentiment and that data certainly hitting Chinese investor sentiment overnight. Stocks closing lower on Thursday Japan posting a nice gain however, though all the major Asian stock markets ending August in the red, the HANG SENG tumbling more than 8 percent as you can see there on the month that Shanghai down some 5 percent plus too. Now, it's U.S. data on tap. The Fed's preferred measure of inflation the core PCE Index rising a modest and expected two tenths of a percent last month that comes out to around a 4.2 percent annual rate of inflation just remember that still twice as high as the Federal Reserve's target. The market response to you well, U.S. stocks do remain on target for a mostly higher open as you can see the DOW the outperformer green arrows in Europe on the screen as well. The major U.S. averages in fact paring a large portion of that August losses this week, I mean new data showing the U.S. jobs market is easing, with most market participants now predicting that the Federal Reserve will hold rates steady at its September meeting that's a sigh of relief for stock market investors certainly. Plenty to come as always, but we do begin with the tragedy in Johannesburg. Firefighters and rescue crews searching through charred remains after a fire in the city's central business district claimed the lives of at least 73 people. Fire broke out in what's described as a hijacked building one that's been taken over by people who couldn't afford to live elsewhere. It appears many of the occupants were asleep when the fire started. No clear statement yet on what may have caused the fire but officials don't believe it was started deliberately. David McKenzie joins us now on this. David just a terrible tragedy there in Johannesburg and of course, difficult I guess to get a sense of who also might be lost and injured in this given the people that were staying there. What are the authorities saying at this stage and what the survivors are telling you too?",

And because it's basically illegal, it means that it flies under the radar, at least one opposition figure blaming local leaders for being involved in this. There is no direct evidence that I have seen, but it has been talked about and the problem has, at times tried to -- they tried to solve it. But this is a poor country with people needing places to live and not affording it. And just a few miles down the road is one of the richest parts of Africa. So it's very jarring.

The U.S. intelligence officials at that point saying that they believe that there had been some kind of deal done and there have been some weapons sold to the Russian mercenary group Wagner at that point against something North Korea had denied.

A Country Garden has nearly $200 billion in total liabilities and is facing mounting pressure to pay off its debts. It said it was caught off guard by the depth and persistence of China's property slump, especially in smaller Chinese cities. For the past two years, China has been mired in a historic property slowdown resulting in uncompleted homes and unpaid suppliers and creditors. And the slump has been deepening, with new home sales falling more than 34 percent year on year in July. Chinese officials have introduced measures to shore up the market. On Wednesday, the Chinese mega city Guangzhou relaxed mortgage rules for homebuyers, and let's say such measures have not been enough. Consumers are reluctant to buy new homes because of falling home prices and rising unemployment.

There was so much opposition on this point, right from when acquisition was first announced. I remember protesters outside both headquarters, essentially, it means that I think about one in three people in Switzerland will be banking with this group so clearly a drop off in terms of competition but also even going into these results. A few weeks ago, UBS announced that they would no longer need that $100 billion plus government backed loan. They don't want taxpayers on the hook for this, they don't need a guarantee.
