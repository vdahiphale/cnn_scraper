Vladimir Putin remains in power, but his grip on the Russian government appears weaker than ever. Plus, is Russia's nuclear arsenal still secure? We'll ask a member of the House Intelligence Committee next. And Donald Trump cast himself as a crusader who engineered a dramatic nationwide shift on abortion, but what he won't say might be just as important. But up first for us, Vladimir Putin stares down a mortal threat and strikes a deal to save his skin. The American Secretary of State, right here on CNN, reacted to a whirlwind weekend in Russia and a rebellion aimed directly at the heart of Moscow. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Mercenary gone rogue, Yevgeny Prigozhin told his fighters to stand down and he is headed for exile. His soldiers for hire are marching back to the frontlines in Ukraine.We still know very little about that Belarus brokered deal to end the armed takeover of the Russian state. And we still haven't seen or heard from Mr. Putin. But we start our coverage with CNN's Fred Pleitgen who is in Berlin. So, Fred, an extraordinary last 36 hours in Russia. What comes next?",

You're absolutely right, we haven't heard or seen Vladimir Putin since he made that speech yesterday.We have heard that he's been working in the Kremlin, but certainly so far, we haven't seen any evidence of that just yet. And then also there's, you have Yevgeny Prigozhin, the man who was behind this rebellion. And he's also someone we haven't heard or seen from -- who haven't heard from or seen in the past hours since he decided to pull back his forces there. It's also interesting because I was checking out his social media channels as well. And there's absolutely nothing on that since last night. So it's unclear whether or not he actually made it to Belarus. One of the things, of course, that we do know is that his forces are indeed pulling back, but what's going to happen to his private military company, to the Wagner private military company, again, absolutely unclear. What we know from the Russians is that they say that the people who are part of the Wagner private military company, they can sign up for the Russian military because of their battlefield achievements so far. So that's something that could be integrated. But, of course, all of this is much larger than that. Yevgeny Prigozhin also has massive media and propaganda assets. He's, of course, accused of meddling in the 2016 presidential election in the United States. And he also has massive assets in places like Syria, exploiting oil in places like Africa with a golden diamond trade there, training African forces. So this is something that is huge, and there really aren't any answers so far. And just another thing, Abby, one of the -- or two of the people that we haven't heard from yet either is the Russian defense minister against whom this rebellion by Prigozhin actually happened or the chief of staff, Valery Gerasimov, both of them completely AWOL over the past few days, Abby.",

For what reason? We do not know. Allegedly, he's going to Belarus, whether he'll actually show up there. We don't know. What we have learned, Abby, is that in the days leading up to this, there was intelligence that Prigozhin was going to carry out something like this. U.S. and in Western intelligence had seen assets being gathered, a buildup of weapons, a buildup of men. Remember, Wagner had pulled back from Bakhmut in Ukraine. There was movement towards Rostov. So there was a sense within the intelligence community that this was actually going to happen. The only question I'm really told is when exactly this was going to happen. [11:10:00] But there was still widespread surprise that Prigozhin actually went ahead and did this. Of course, you could say that this was building up for quite some time. He'd expressed his anger, not at Putin, but towards the military leadership for quite some time. But -- so the U.S. and the White House, the administration, they did expect something like this to happen.

The Wagner Group is notorious for committing atrocities all across the world, and it's been involved in some bloody conflicts, not just in Ukraine, but also in the Middle East and in Africa as well.And on top of all of that, Prigozhin is also the man behind the Internet Research Agency, and he was indicted by Special counsel Robert Mueller for meddling in the 2016 election.

They thought Blackwater was an arm of the U.S. government that allowed the U.S. government to do things with plausible deniability, which is something Putin has long been obsessed with. So, through this catering business, the Kremlin funneled hundreds of millions of dollars, if not billions of dollars, to fund this mercenary company to do things that the Kremlin didn't want to be seen doing. For example, being involved in the Central African Republic in Libya, in Mozambique, in Syria, in Eastern Ukraine, which is where they first cut their teeth in 2014, and that, you know, the first limited invasion of Ukraine.

And his fighters were some of the most effective fighters in Ukraine now in this full-scale invasion of Ukraine. But unfortunately, precisely because of that, Prigozhin got a little too big for his bridges.",

      "sentences": "Well, I think, Abby, we could start with what wasn't his motivation. So the idea that Prigozhin is sort of a fatherly figure over this Wagner group of boys that he's recruited out of the prisons is not the case.Julie's right, he is part of the Russian system, and therefore his primary concern is power. And his own power is paramount in that. So, I mean, one theory is that as the Wagner forces were marching, you know, north towards Moscow, it's possible that he could have told them, look, just go to the Ministry of Defense and demand Shoigu's head on a stick or something like that. And then everything would have been resolved because of these supposed disagreements between the Russian Ministry of Defense and this paramilitary organization, the Wagner Group. I don't think that's actually what would have happened. I think that had he decided to go all the way to Moscow, I don't think he would have stopped at the Ministry of Defense. I don't think there would have been any reason for him not to go for the whole enchilada if he had thought that he could actually pull off a successful coup. The main question that I have that I think is still unresolved it'll be fascinating to see if it comes out over the coming weeks and months, is why did he stop? He seemed to have everything on his side. He was marching through Rostov. He was marching through all of these places, and he was being clapped and applauded. So why stop halfway there? That's the interesting question for me.",

It's how did Prigozhin go from his response to Putin's speech, which was to say, basically, screw you. I'm the guy who knows what real Russia is, what the real interests are, and said, we'd have a new president soon.But then later in the afternoon, Wagner started walking it back and started putting out messages on telegram saying that, actually, no, we don't want to change the president of the Russian Federation. We don't even want to change the government. We just want to have control of the Defense Ministry, which is still quite a big ask, but you saw them start walking it back during the day. So again, why did Prigozhin stop? And to Steve's point, part of -- part of Prigozhin's power came from the fact that he did inspire tremendous loyalty from these tens of thousands of men below him, including the convicts who felt like he gave him a second chance at life, a way to get out and get some kind of freedom and pardon the pun of fighting chance. And so the fact that he could just tell 25,000 people in a, you know, authoritarian, close to totalitarian regime and say, let's go march on Moscow, and they readily did it, and they were far more loyal to him than to Putin is part of his power. The question is, he got 125 miles within Moscow, within striking distance of Moscow, and he suddenly stopped. What happened? I don't think we'll know for a little while.",

There is a greater threat against him. He's shown weaknesses that we simply haven't seen before. That said, I'm not sure that the primary threat comes from the Wagner guys. So the first stop for the Wagner guys is the local Ministry of Defense office to sign the contract they are now going to be asked to sign, which will make them formally part of the Russian military, which in one sense, sort of disbands or at least significantly weakens the Wagner group.But -- so that's good for Putin because at least nominally, he's got some more control over them than he had before. However, I think the biggest threat for Putin is for those that are very close to him, these siloviki guys, these guys who are the head of the security services, intelligence services, his closest advisors, who continue to see not only increased weakness in Putin, but misjudgment. You know, I think what happened here is you got two guys, Prigozhin and Putin, who all of a sudden found themselves in a situation where both were saying, well, how do we get out of this? Prigozhin was saying, I might have to fight through, you know, Kadyrov's Chechen crazies to get to Moscow. And Putin saying, I got potentially 25,000 guys headed my way, headed to Red Square. What are we going to do? They clearly worked something out, but how they did it is fascinating.",

He's thinking about that right now and avoiding answering this question.And what's happening here is that he's facing two competing pressures, right? Everything that's happened since Dobbs says that he should not commit to an abortion ban because the intensity has profoundly shifted in this country of politics on abortion for 50 years, pro-life movement had the intensity. Now, everything that we see in the polling shows that we're at the high watermark for support for abortion rights. And this is pretty uniform, especially when it comes to suburban women. At the same time, now he's in a primary, and he's being outflanked by candidates like Pence, like DeSantis, who are willing to commit to a federal abortion ban, and even in DeSantis's case, a six-week heartbeat ban bill. So that is the problem, is that Trump is thinking, I'm going to be pushed to the right to commit to this nationwide ban that then, in a general election is going to be really toxic.",

And then the last thing, Abby, I wanted to say is that the one thing I think that we're not really thinking about, about why this is going to remain so fresh in the minds of women, is that since Roe fell, there's been 26,000 women who've been unable to get an abortion. Those are not the women who have means, who've flown from Kentucky or Tennessee, from Tennessee or Missouri into Illinois to get their abortions, maybe had high risk complications. They are the poor women, and we don't know yet, we haven't heard those stories yet about what's happening to those women with their health care because they're in the states that have the strictest bans, but also the worst record when it comes to maternal health and access to health care.",
