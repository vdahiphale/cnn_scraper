And none of those rangers who were at Pointe du Hoc are still alive today. Very sad indeed. Christiane, how will the us allies view this speech by the President, and how do you think some of the adversaries potentially, let's say, China, Russia, other nations, how do you think they will view and understand what the President of the United States was saying today?",

      "sentences": "Well, I think first the allies will be incredibly grateful because he recommitted America, the only remaining superpower and the leader of the NATO alliance, to committing to protect that alliance and Europe. This is crucial. And it's an incredibly differentiating point between him and the way Donald Trump talks about NATO and the commitment to the alliance. So it's very differentiating.Of course, allies are incredibly worried about what might happen on November 5th or whenever the election is. They're very concerned about what happens in terms of the survival of the alliance and the survival of Europe, frankly, when they're faced right now with a great threat to the survival of Europe in Putin's invasion of Ukraine. So I think that's on that part. And then on the other side, I would say that, you know, it was a very full throated speech. It wasn't very long, but it was very, very, you know, strong in terms of its words and its commitments. And if anybody in Russia or China thinks that America is going to retreat, then President Biden said that that is not going to be the case, not on his watch. And I also think that really important is the context, because, as you know, right now, there is a sort of anti-American alliance or axis of anti-Americanism, anti-Westernism that China, Russia, Iran, North Korea have been very successfully building. And they are really watching for moments of weaknesses, chinks in the armor, chinks in the commitment to continue chipping away at Americas and the Wests. You know, dominance is the right word to say. At the same time, America is being tested in other ways, not just by other militaries. But there are many, many parts of the world who don't necessarily buy America's narrative. Let's say the global south, which everybody talks about and lumps in one great big thing, the global south. But it's, half the world does not actually buy the western narrative over Russia and Ukraine and sees some hypocrisy in that. But nonetheless, these are the issues and challenges that I guess, history, you know, brings up. But the President, at least for now and as long as he remains in power, has quite clearly put his stake in the ground to defend democracy, which is how he started his presidency. His inauguration speech was all about that. His first trips abroad, you know, more than two years ago were all about that. And he's reiterating that. But most importantly, it was directed to the American people as well, saying, I challenge you to think today that these Rangers who did what they did 80 years ago would allow us to do anything less in defense of our freedom and our democracy and our way of life.

This whole project of what formed as a world order following World War II and how critical that is in Joe Biden's mind to America's future is a through line of what he's going to sell to the American people throughout the next five months of this campaign. And this is a huge set piece of that.Now, you and I know the American people vote on a whole host of issues, not just foreign policy or big thematics like democracy, the economy, immigration, all of this will be part of the equation. But this is a key central component to Biden's presidency and his ask for renewal of a four-year contract from the American people.",

      "sentences": "Well, I think the Biden administration officials who are here were very pleased with how the speech went down. Of course, it is an iconic setting, incredibly poignant. It's hard to imagine a more powerful backdrop than this. A few things stood out to me in the President's speech, specifically how he rewarded some familiar language that we've heard in speeches of the past to make it clear that this speech was about a domestic audience. He kept using the pronoun our.He said that he wants to make sure that people know that the veterans or the Rangers who fought here, that they would want us to care for others in our country more than ourselves. He talked about the soul of our nation and the solemn vow to never let them down. He's talked often about the need to stand up to dictators, to autocrats, to fascists. For the average American who might think that terms like that feel like they're ripped from a history textbook today, President Biden distilled it into its perhaps simplest term. He said that hateful ideologies are what the U.S. is standing up to. And that essentially casts an extremely wide net. It doesn't necessarily mean that is just Vladimir Putin on the doorstep of Europe or just the isolationist, populist, protectionist policies that he is combating in his opponent back at home. So that was perhaps what was most interesting to me here. It's also notable that while Reagan's speech 40 years ago became most known for the line where he addressed the boys of Pointe du Hoc, he had 62 of those boys on hand in the audience to specifically reference during this speech. And today President Biden said the ghosts of Pointe du Hoc. That is, I think, what the Biden team wants this speech to become. They want it to be iconic. And if there's one thing where President Reagan's oratory skills certainly set a high bar, there's one thing that President Biden has in this moment that he did not, and that is high definition. It's not a grainy picture. It's not muted colors. When the President did a flyover in Marine One, there was music playing that sounded like a John Williams score. You can expect that the White House and the campaign are going to be able to use this imagery and cut it in a way that will continue speaking to the American people well beyond today. Wolf?",

      "sentences": "Well, the very fact that it happened 40 years after another iconic moment at Pointe du Hoc, allows us to see the differences between 1984 and 2024. In 1984, Ronald Reagan was trying to reassert the moral character of the American commitment to the world. That was a time when some in our country were arguing that there was a moral equivalence between the Soviet Union and the United States. And so Ronald Reagan used that iconic place and the fact that he was standing in front of 62 heroes who had scaled Pointe du Hoc 40 years earlier to make a point about the fact that when the United States came to Europe, it came as -- Americans came as liberators, not as conquerors, thus contrasting the United States with what the Soviets had done in their empire. Ronald Reagan had a second objective in 1984, 1983 had been a very tense year in the Cold War. Indeed, it was known as the beginning of the Second Cold War. And in 1984, Ronald Reagan actually wanted to send a signal to the Soviets. We Americans don't want war. We fight them when we have to, but we don't want war. And Ronald Reagan made a point in the speech at Pointe du Hoc to talk about the 20 million Soviets who had died in World War II.Forty years later, the president of the United States uses that same sacred ground to make a point about us and our character. This speech was a lot about character, the character of Americans at their best. He talked about the sole survivor of D-Day who was in front of him, and talked about the importance for that hero, of his band of brothers, of those that he was fighting for his country, of course, but he was also fighting for those around him and for those whom he had lost. And the President made a very, very poignant point. We mustn't forget the fact that we are part of a community, that we should care about each other, that we should care about others more than ourselves, and that that is being American. Now, he didn't mention Donald Trump's name. He didn't have to. But it gave a sense that he is in some way framing the choice not between his character and Donald Trump's character, but between Donald Trump's character and the character of America at its best. And that character is personified, or was personified by those 225 Rangers who scaled Pointe du Hoc 80 years ago. So that shows you two things. One, the difference in the campaigns 40 years apart, but also the difference in the challenge the country faces and the use by two presidents of a sacred moment in our history and of sacred ground to make the case to the American people about the importance of morality in our times.",

There was certainly a lot of focus on Ronald Reagan's speech on that very spot 40 years ago during the 40th anniversary of the D-Day invasion.

      "sentences": "I think it had to live up to the legacy. And it's not just about is this kind of broader legacy of Ronald Reagan, but it's also, I think, a soft launch for the second stage of Joe Biden's presidential campaign. We know that the first stage of the campaign was the battle for the soul of America. But one of the things that the Biden administration has realized is that same argument is not hitting in the same way with American or global audiences.So I think what we're seeing here now is a two-fold attack. One, this idea of democracy abroad and democracy at home, connecting this idea of the international and the creeping idea, hearkening back to this two ideas that Ronald Reagan talked about, but the idea of Russia, the power of Russia, the increasing aggression of Russia, but also hearkening to ideas of China, right? So just defining, these very different ideas of what our allied powers, what are axis powers, so, again, reassuring, I think, allied powers. But also it is doing the work of reminding people at home that there is a connected community of what democracy means. One of the things that we know is that democracy within the United States, also globally, but democracy within the United States is in crisis as people, as the rest of the panel has already mentioned, Donald Trump didn't need to be mentioned because he was evoked in the ideas that Joe Biden talked about. So this is an attempt, I think, not just to remind people about what does democracy mean, how democracy is something that has to be fought for, remade over and over again, but also to speak ideas of democracy that were incredibly popular on both sides of the aisle. So he's bringing up this legacy of Ronald Reagan, and I think it's an important launching part for the next phase of the campaign.",

We know right now that China, one of our greatest adversaries, is really attempting to usurp the United States, lead around the world, attempt to showcase that the U.S. is still that beacon of hope for other democracies, particularly young democracies that are still trying to figure out their way.
