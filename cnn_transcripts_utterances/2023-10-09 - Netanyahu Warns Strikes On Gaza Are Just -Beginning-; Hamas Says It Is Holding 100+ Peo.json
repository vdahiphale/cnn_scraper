How imminent is a potential Israeli invasion of Gaza and just how deadly could that be?Plus, the tragic toll. Former U.S. Ambassador Marc Ginsberg, a frequent guest on this program, just revealing his nephew was killed by militants as he was trying to rescue hostages. He's my guest this hour. And caught in the crosshairs. I'll talk to an American doctor who is right now stuck in Gaza, the deafening sounds of explosions now surround her. What is the U.S. doing to get her out? Let's go OUTFRONT. Good evening and welcome to the special edition of OUTFRONT. I'm Wolf Blitzer in Washington, in for Erin Burnett, who is on assignment right now on her way to Israel where at this hour, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is promising massive retaliation after Palestinian terrorists lost a surprise innovation, killing at least 900 Israelis and holding dozens more, possibly more than 100 people, more than 100 people hostage, taken to Gaza. Prime Minister Netanyahu warning the Israelis are just getting started. Listen.

Eleven of the 900 killed so far are confirmed to be U.S. citizens according to President Biden.Take a look at this. These are live pictures from Gaza where it's now 2:00 a.m. Earlier, you could see if smoke and flames in the background after Israel's defense minister ordered a, quote, complete siege of Gaza. No electricity, no food or fuel allowed in. Hundreds of continuous Israeli airstrikes also targeting what Israel calls strategic centers that house Hamas terrorists. Parts of Gaza flatten. One strike tearing through a marketplace. The Palestinian health ministry says nearly 700 Palestinians have been killed, 3,700 injured. And tonight, Hamas is leveling what is a chilling ultimatum, threatening to execute its hostages if Israel targets people and Gaza without warning. Israeli authorities have not said how many people were kidnapped, but Hamas claims it's over 100, which includes many children and the elderly. And President Biden now saying it's likely Americans may be among those being held by Hamas in Gaza right now.

When they came face to face with at least three or four pickup trucks in which she said there were about 20 Hamas terrorists in each of those vehicles.

I went to the right because I saw in the distance, I saw a tank of the army and thought maybe that would be the safest place to go to. They were throwing a grenade and in that time, we couldn't see anything. They were taken. Some people were taken. I lied under the tag because they surrounded us from every direction. They saw the people on the tank, and the more of us there were it, was getting worse, because a large group that could just shoot at us. Those of us who could go underneath it and I did. And I thought I will survive their, but this is where I got shot in the leg, and I didn't even know where it was from because everybody had blood on them and I was covered with blood.

I was there in 2009 when the Israelis made a massive incursion into Gaza. They basically cut the strip in three parts, but they avoided the most heavily populated areas.Now, the assumption is if they're going to go in and try to for instance rescue the captives, the assumption is that Hamas is keeping them in areas that are heavily populated, for instance, like the Shati refugee camp, the beach camp, which is one of the most densely populated of Gaza's eight refugee camps. That refugee camp is composed of streets that are extremely narrow, so it's going to be difficult for armor to get in. And, of course, it's so full of people. It is inevitable that civilians will be killed. And, of course, everyone knows there are no bomb shelters for civilians in Gaza. So, this is going to be a very difficult, very violent operation. And, of course, Hamas as we have seen, this operation, this attack that they launched on Saturday was very well-prepared. They clearly studied this operation long in advance, and taking captives was clearly one of the essential parts of that operation. Their assumption is probably that they have planned for the Israeli counterattack, the Israeli invasion inside of Gaza. So we have seen their capabilities are much greater than they have been in the past speaking of Hamas. And therefore, the Israelis are probably going to be facing perhaps the most difficult ground operation they have done at least since their incursion into South Lebanon in 2006 -- Wolf.",

Instead, this is an offer of assistance of ISR, Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance. It is a critical effort by both Israel and the United States, as well as perhaps others around the world to try and figure at how many hostages there are and where these hostages have come from. The U.S. has said they are working literally every hour to try and learn more about the hostages and the question what to do, how to get them out is that even possible? So, U.S. trying to offer Israel its assistance in the planning part of this, and that assistance comes both from the U.S. Central Command as well as special operations command and joint special operations command. So you are seeing all of this effort to try to get Israel the help it needs. And, Wolf, this comes on top of the U.S. assets headed into the region, a carrier strike group, that was announced by DOD over the weekend, and more fighter squadrons, those aren't planning on taking part in any is really operation, but it is a message of deterrence to Iran as the U.S. carefully watching whether the fighting in Israel spreads beyond the borders of the country.",

Their objective is one objective, which is to destroy the state of Israel. Their objective is to pull the rest of the region into this.

We've already seen the tanks being moved close to Gaza. Armored personnel carriers because they're going to need to bring in soldiers into Gaza, backed by -- they've got F-15s and F-16s and Apaches. So, this will be -- they've used bulldozers in these operations. I've seen them in action in several of the refugee camps including in the West Bank. So, I think this is going to be a brutal ground assault into -- into Gaza right now. And I think the hope for the Israelis is it doesn't spread much into the West Bank, and then, obviously, up north to Lebanon and then Syria. That's a worry.",

If I'm the Israeli commander, the question in the front of my mind is what is my objective, what am I supposed to accomplish not just going in there to, as we say, to mow the grass.

And it actually, kind of, was enough to prevent any further escalation, meaning Israel gave its response. And we were able to ensure that it didn't result in any further war. So, Israel could respond with some kind of strike, but then the Iranians and the Israelis would understand, okay, we don't want an all-out war. But it's a very, very dangerous situation. I have to say, it's highly conceivable that the Iranians were involved in training Hamas. Clearly they support them.
