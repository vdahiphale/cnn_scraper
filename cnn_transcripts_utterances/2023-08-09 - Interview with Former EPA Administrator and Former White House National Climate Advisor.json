But Hari discusses Beijing's growing sphere of political influence, and whatits Taiwan end game looks like with Toshi Yoshihara at Georgetown University. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. And we begin with the precarious state of the earth's vital cooling system. Rainforest help prevent our planet from overheating and deliver the oxygen we need to breathe, by absorbing huge amounts of carbon from the atmosphere, they're also home to have the earth's animal and plant life. But they're under attack at an alarming rate, despite splashy global pledges to end deforestation by 2030, an area of tropical forests the size of Switzerland was completely lost last year, and to put that into context, that's the equivalent of losing 11 soccer fields of forest every 60 seconds. This week, eight South American presidents have been meeting in Brazil, where they all agreed to stop the rainforest destruction before the point of no return. But deciding on a destination is one thing, agreeing on how to get there is something else. And without much detail in the plan, the question now is how to turn talk into action. Gina McCarthy was EPA administrator under President Obama, which safeguards people and the environment from health risks, and enforces environmental regulations. She was also President Biden's top climate adviser until last year, and she helped spearhead a landmark climate bill to slash America's carbon emissions. Now, the president has just told the \"Weather Channel\" that climate change is the number one issue facing humanity. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Obviously, you know, President Biden's climate envoy, John Kerry, has gone back and forth to China, to India, to all these places, trying to get as much agreement as possible. His last trip to China proved unsuccessful. The former U.K. prime minister, Tony Blair, has basically said, we can't solve climate change without China. And so has a governor Chris Christie, who's a presidential candidate for the Republicans, this is what he told me about it yesterday on this program. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FORMER GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE (R-NJ), U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  No matter what we do here in the U.S., we're not going to make this better unless we get everyone involved, and that's going to be an agenda item for me with the Chinese when I become president. We need to work all together to try to deal with this issue, and we're not doing that right now because the Chinese aren't going the exact opposite direction that a good amount of the rest of the world is going.

What China is now realizing is their decision to start building coal again, their decision to not participate as an active player in the climate effort internationally has not benefited their economy at all. In fact, just the opposite. So, hopefully, they'll begin to do what really countries across the world have done in the developing world. Look, as soon as the IRA got pushed out, it ended up being a race to the top. We had the E.U. put out their green deal industrial policy. You had France put out a new climate framework. You had Canada adjusting their budget to make investments in new minerals and E.V. -- for E.V. components and other things. Germany then stepped in for self-production and other efforts. So, we are seeing the developed world step up. What China needs to do is look at whether this has benefited them from being against the rest of the world or whether or not they have an opportunity to succeed by collaboration again, coordination with the U.S. We had strong relationships a few years ago, those need to be reinvigorated. And frankly, without China, we can't win. But frankly, without the rest of the developing world, neither can China.",

You know, I've been working for 44 years in this arena, the environmental arena on climate, you know, you learn a lot. But what you also learn in Washington is how to move things forward. This president has gotten more bills over the finish line than anyone before them, not just small ones, but really big change is happening because of this work. So, I don't think that age can be a factor in determining whether somebody is capable and active and engaged. You know, I am more excited about today than I've ever been. I know more in this little brain of mine than most people do about climate. I am not going to sit in the shadows and contemplate my grandchildren all day long. I love them dearly. I hang around with them, but me, I'm in the game and everybody has to be.

But actually, what is happening is decisive action, both in terms of long-term exploitation of many countries, extracting wealth, and then erecting borders and making it so that people from those countries can't travel.

The first primary reason is that China is a global trading power, and thatmeans that China needs to have an independent capability to defend the sea lanes that transport their goods and services that are so essential to China's growing economy. And so, this is consistent with the familiar adage that the flag follows the trade. A big oceangoing navy also has the capacity to engage in humanitarian missions, to protect Chinese nationals living overseas who might be stuck in unstable regions of the world in times of crisis, an oceangoing navy also essentially allows China to flex its muscles, to show the flag, to show that it has arrived on the world stage. A powerful navy also appeals to Chinese nationalism, which is, of course, a critical pillar of the Chinese hardest party's regime legitimacy. But I think, ultimately, the most important aspect of a powerful navy is that it is a critical tool for fighting and winning a nation's wars. And, of course, China has many territorial disputes in the maritime domain that require China to have this standing naval force to fight and win its wars. And, of course, among those flash points, we have Taiwan, territorial disputes with Japan and the East China Sea, and territorial disputes with the Southeast Asian neighbors in the South China Sea. All of these are intensely maritime in character. And therefore, China needs this large navy to resolve those territorial disputes in its favor.",

In fact, it isso important to China that it is, in fact, willing to go to war over it. Now, there are many reasons for why China values Taiwan to such an extent. The first is that Taiwan's strategic terrain. It is simply geostrategically very well located in the Western Pacific. It sits at the midpoint of the so-called First island chain that runs from the Japanese islands through Taiwan down to the Philippines. And of course, if you look at that island chain, the United States has former ally relations with Japan, in the Philippines, it is a close friend of Taiwan. The United States has forward bases located in Japan. And so, from China's perspective, getting Taiwan back would essentially break that first island chain in half because it sits at the midpoint of that island chain. Taiwan, of course, is also a reminder to the Chinese communist party that the Chinese people and democracy are not fundamentally incompatible. And of course, that's a daily rebuke, essentially, to the Chinese communist party's claim that somehow Chinese society and democratic values are fundamentally incompatible. Taiwan, of course, as you've mentioned, is a major economic asset. And of course, that would also, of course, add to China's economic power, if it were to return to China. And so, for all of these reasons, Taiwan is a vital strategic asset for China, and conversely, it is also a very important terrain, if you will, for the United States and its allies in the Western Pacific. As for the role of the Chinese navy with the regards to Taiwan in a potential crisis or war, because, of course, Taiwan is an island, China will need to use naval assets to achieve its operational aims, to achieve its war aims should war break out. China will need to have a significant amphibious capability to land forces on Taiwan in a major invasion scenario. China will also need to use its submarines and its ships to keep out third-party interventions, including the United States and its allies. And so, naval power is going to be one of many components of China's strategy if it were to conduct an invasion against Taiwan.",

I think there are those in the United States who have argued that because Russia has done so poorly up to this point in its war against Ukraine that we could draw a similar parallel to China. That China might also not perform as well against Taiwan in a conflict. In my view, I think that perspective is overly sanguine. It seems to me that China will study the war in Ukraine very closely and try to improve its chances of success. In fact, the war in Ukraine has likely convinced Beijing that it needs to double down on its current strategy. It's military strategy, for example, focuses on the overwhelming application of force. And so, when they look at the Russian example by using token forces, for example, during the initial phases of the war, I think the Chinese leadership is convinced that that is not the way to go. The way to go is to apply overwhelming force as has been laid out in Chinese military doctrine. I think Beijing may have also learned some potentially troubling lessons with regard to Putin's nuclear saber-rattling against NATO and the United States. Now, while Putin's nuclear threats did not deter the United States and NATO from helping Ukraine, it certainly and still a greater degree of caution on the part of the West. And so, it is likely that Beijing may have learned that in a crisis over Taiwan, that Beijing should rattle its nuclear sabers early on in a crisis or in a conflict to get the United States and its allies to back down. I think another really interesting lesson is the role of Zelenskyy. He, of course, played a very important role in galvanizing international support. China would have an interest in ensuring that a Zelenskyy like leader does not emerge in Taiwan during a crisis or a conflict. And therefore, Beijing might be convinced that it needs to double down on a decapitation strategy to assassinate or kill by other means Taiwan's political and military leadership at the outset of a crisis or of a conflict to prevent the emergence of charismatic leader on the island. So, it seems to me that many of the lessons that emerged from Ukraine will likely convince China to double down on its existing strategies and capabilities.",
