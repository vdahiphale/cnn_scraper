Today, Republican presidential contender, Nikki Haley, is trying to clear up or is it clean up comments that she made on the campaign trail yesterday? During a stop in New Hampshire, a voter called Haley out for not mentioning slavery when she was asked about the cause of the Civil War. Watch this exchange. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think the cause of the Civil War was basically how government was going to run, the freedoms and what people could and couldn't do. I mean I think it always comes down to the role of government and what the rights of the people are. And we - I will always stand by the fact that I think government was intended to secure the rights and freedoms of the people. It was never meant to be all things to all people. Government doesn't need to tell you how to live your life. They don't need to tell you what you can and can't do. They don't need to be a part of your life. They need to make sure that you have freedom. We need to have capitalism. We need to have economic freedom. We need to make sure that we do all things so that individuals have the liberties, so that they can have freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom to do or be anything they want to be without government getting in the way. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you. And then in the year 2023 it's astonishing to me that you answer that question without mentioning the word slavery.",

We have to keep having the Supreme Court make a decision. But that's what it's going to come down to and I have no idea which way they're going to go.

I think if she'd have come out and said something like that, it would be a little more understandable.But I think the real question, look, I have no doubt that Nikki Haley knows that the Civil War was over slavery. The question here is did she simply not say it because she thought it was a given, which is kind of what she's implying or was it a real attempt to say, man, I might take off part of the Republican base. That's my concern is that she held back straight condemning slavery and saying that it was what it was and the Civil War was what it was because she's afraid of losing some votes in the critical state of South Carolina, for instance. And only she knows in her heart the truth on that, but this was a very, very bad thing for her to say and I'm certain it's going to have an impact. And I think she needs to do a better job cleaning it up than just like, oh, of course, that was a Democratic plan or it could have been a Democratic plan.

And if you look behind me, you can see that there are no migrants behind me. And so you might be thinking, wait, is that an actual crisis or not? Well, the federal government has gotten really good at something called decompression. They move migrants from an area that is saturated to an area that has processing space. That's what we're seeing. And as you mentioned, yesterday there was about 7,000 migrant apprehensions on the U.S. southern border. About 2,000 of them were here in the Del Rio sector, which includes Eagle Pass, where I am. And if you just think about those numbers, about 2,000 here just in this area. And you still don't see any migrants behind me, again, because this is the federal government moving these migrants to areas to process them as quickly as possible.

That's something that the federal government has to get out of the way for the people that are here and want a traditional path to a better life that so many people in generations past came to America seeking. That would be the first step. The other step is an assistance in providing permanent housing for them. We have people living in bus terminals at O'Hare airport right now. We had 8,000 people living in the lobbies of police. We have tents which won't work, by the way for a climate like Chicago, if you lived your whole life in Venezuela, you're in for a shock if you think you can live in a tent in January in Chicago.

And some of the federal money we are getting are the form of state pass-through grants. But I thought it was notable that in this recent effort, our mayor of Chicago joined with the mayor of Denver and the mayor of New York, of course, home to Ellis Island for all those years. It bears mentioning right now where you have these municipal government leaders, one from the state of New York, talking about the fact that migration has never been a municipal responsibility. All those years that Ellis Island operated, 60 years, 20 million immigrants came through and passed the Statue of Liberty, not a single one of them got here and said, all right, I need help from the local municipal city.
