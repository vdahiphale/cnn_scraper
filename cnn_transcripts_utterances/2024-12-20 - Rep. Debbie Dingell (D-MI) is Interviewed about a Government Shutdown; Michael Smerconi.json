MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA): Very disappointing to us that all but two Democrats voted against aid to farmers and ranchers, against disaster relief, against all these bipartisan measures. SEN. J.D. VANCE (R-OH), VICE PRESIDENT-ELECT:  The Democrats just voted to shut down the government, even though we had a clean CR, because they didn't want to give the president negotiating leverage during his first term - or during the first year of his new term. And, number two, because they would rather shut down the government and fight for global censorship bull (EXPLETIVE DELETED).

Raise the debt ceiling. For what purpose? The only thing, and I'm not expert in these matters - the only thing that I can imagine is because they want to ease the ability for a tax cut on his watch, and they need the debt ceiling gone in order to make that a reality.

Mangione facing a slew of new federal charges. If found guilty, he could face the death penalty. Malaysia has agreed in principle to restart its search for the wreckage of Flight MH370.
