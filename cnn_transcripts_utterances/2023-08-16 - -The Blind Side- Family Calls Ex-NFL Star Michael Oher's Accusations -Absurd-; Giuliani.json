Should Mr. Oher wish to terminate the conservatorship, either now or at any time in the future, the Tuohys will never oppose it in any way.\"It answers a little bit but also leaves some questions. How far did that conservatorship go, right? We know that it's possible they could have still been making money off of Michael Oher. So those are some, still, questions we're still bringing to the attorneys and not quite getting responses just yet. A different side of this -- tough. If you can believe it, the actors are receiving backlash from \"The Blind Side\" and this whole controversy playing out in real life. And the actor Quinton Aaron, who played Michael Oher, talked to the New York Post and was having to not only respond to these allegations, saying he's devastated by them, but also defend Sandra Bullock who won an Academy Award for her role playing Leigh Anne Tuohy.

Namely, he appears to be out of cash. Now, he hasn't been able to share exact details in court. He's trying to not do that because he says it would embarrass him and draw attention to his misfortunes. But we were able to pick through some court filings that do outline in lawsuits that he's facing related to his work for Donald Trump after the 2020 election just how much his bills have piled up right now. So, right now, he has $181,000 in current bills. That includes a judgment from a court last week saying he had to pay a phone bill for his company from 2020. That he has to pay legal fees for two Georgia election workers who are suing him. That's what the sanction would be -- an $89,000 sanction. So that's not even what happens if he were to lose that case. And then on top of that, he has a lot of bills for just keeping ahold of the records that he had in his various cell phones and other electronic equipment. He has that all in a company. And it costs money to do searches for those records every time he's getting sued. And also, it costs money just to hold them with that company so that he has access to his electronic records. It's a lot of legal bills. But on top of that, he has debts, and one of the debts that has become public in these court proceedings is that he had a $320,000 debt to his company that was hosting his electronic records. Donald Trump's PAC, Save America, has paid that off. We learned that from the court filings.

The Kansas Bureau of Investigations is now leading that probe into last Friday's raid of the Marion County Record. Police searched both the home and the office of the newspaper's owner, and they seized computers and phones, and servers of reporters and editors. And authorities claim the raid stemmed from an investigation into identity theft. A coffee shop owner had accused the paper of illegally obtaining documents about a DUI she received about 15 years ago. But the paper says they got those from a source. They were then trying to verify the information and that they only published it after she started accusing them publicly. We should note the coffee shop owner previously barred the paper from covering a public event with a Republican member of Congress. Marion County Record publisher and editor Eric Meyer says that his 98- year-old mother Joann, who was a co-owner of the paper, by the way, collapsed and died on Saturday -- the day after police raided her home. According to the paper, Meyer had been, quote, \"stressed beyond her limits and overwhelmed by hours of shock and grief after the illegal police raids.\" And Eric joins us now. Good morning, Eric. We are all deeply -- ERIC MEYER, PUBLISHER AND OWNER, MARION COUNTY RECORD (via Webex by Cisco):  Good morning.",
