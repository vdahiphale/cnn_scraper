She had a little bit of that at the convention, a lot of that at the convention. But if your normal voter who doesn't tune into those sort of political events tunes into the debates, they really want to know what she stands for, perhaps if they have heard that she had taken other positions before in 2019, why she's in a different place now, and perhaps maybe why she might be breaking with the Biden administration if she ends up doing that. So there are a lot of questions that I think your average voter has about Vice President Harris that could be answered tonight.",

I think after this race is over and Donald Trump wins on November 6, a little projection here, I think the Harris campaign will go back and lament the fact that they weren't out doing more interviews, that the current vice president wasn't out talking to people like Jackie and Jim yourself and others and informing everybody what she stands for. Because, otherwise, we're left to divine what she stands for from pieces like our own Andrew Kaczynski KFILE interview with Erin Burnett the other night where he goes through her ACLU report. There are all these other positions from 2019. We're left to divine what she stands for, rather than hear what she stands for. And I think her being a holed up for all these days has not done her campaign any good whatsoever. So people don't know who she is. They're left to go back and listen to what she said in her past campaigns. (CROSSTALK)",

She blocked evidence that would have freed an innocent man from death row until the courts forced her to do so. (CHEERING) (APPLAUSE) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (D) AND U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I did the work of significantly reforming the criminal justice system of a state of 40 million people, which became a national model for the work that needs to be done.

This is just sort of emblematic of the things that are happening in the U.S. airspace system right now. It is a crowded system right now. You can see all of the airplanes there. There's such a fever for people to travel right now, and the airlines and the aviation system are really bursting at the seams. The good news is, this did not take place on a runway. That is the problem that we have seen over and over again in 2023, continued to be a problem in 2024. Those are called runway incursions. This so happens to be more of an equivalent of a fender-bender. But when these are really extreme then the FAA really looks into this. Of course, the FAA will look into this incident to try and figure out exactly what went wrong here.
