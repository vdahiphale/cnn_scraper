I'm Anna Coren.Ahead on CNN Newsroom, mission complete, the Polaris Dawn crew will splash down the Gulf of Mexico just minutes from now after a history- making spacewalk. Doubling down on fear and conspiracy, Donald Trump speaks of an immigrant takeover after spreading falsehoods about migrants eating pets. And a missile launched from Yemen lands in Central Israel, setting off air raid sirens and sending residents running for shelter. We are just minutes away and counting down to splashdown of the historic Polaris Dawn mission. SpaceX has just provided video of the crew and the spaceship as it heads down to Earth. And we're looking at live pictures with the astronauts in their seats and the nose cone closing. The civilian crew of the SpaceX rocket lifted off on Tuesday looking to a new era in commercial space travel and exploration. They've been farther from the Earth than any human since the Apollo astronauts more than 50 years ago. They've become the first commercial crew to walk in space. A little while ago they started their de-orbit engine burn and, as we say, have closed the nose cone. A recovery ship is waiting in the Gulf of Mexico for their arrival. Well, CNN's Brian Abel has more on this historic mission and what it means for the future of space exploration.",

You have to come in at just the right angle and trajectory. But the most amazing thing is that by the time those parachutes deploy and it is actually splashing down in the ocean, that spacecraft has gone from traveling thousands of miles an hour to only going about 20 miles an hour. And then it's up to the folks who go out there and get that capsule. But I think for this particular crew, most of the risk is over. They are just now calculating everything to perfection to re-enter the Earth's atmosphere. It's been an incredible mission to watch by this all-civilian crew.",

And yet, as you saw, they are 30 minutes exactly to returning. Miles, explain to me what the crew the four crew members, two men, two women, would be experiencing right now.O'BRIEN:  Well, they're going to be experiencing something they haven't felt for about five days, slowly but surely, the effects of gravity, as they were in orbit. The world microgravity is a different place as you kind of float around in a free fall, essentially. But as that speed dissipates from about 28,000 kilometers per hour to about 20 in a short period of time, they're going to start feeling some additional forces. We call them G forces as they come in. And G forces are just a multiple of actual gravity, so two, three times the force of gravity as they start feeling the effects coming down. So, it'll be a little bit of awakening after they've had that the blissful five days of floating around. But mostly what they do at this point on the Dragon capsule is monitor systems. It's an automated aircraft or spacecraft in almost every way.",

You know, what business did they have being up in space considering, you know, they were not professional astronauts? Does this mission and its success perhaps silence the critics and the doubters? O'BRIEN:  Well, I'm sure it will. But if you look at their resumes, Anna, these are not people who just kind of walked in randomly off the street and strapped themselves into a rocket. Jared Isaacman, the billionaire who wrote the check to make this all happen, and you got to hand it to Elon Musk for finding a way not to have to pay a commander, instead it's the opposite. He writes a big check to him for the privilege. But he's got 7,000 hours of aviation experience. He owns a small armada of fighter jets that he flies in tight formation, with the pilot beside him, who is Kidd Poteet, a former Thunderbirds pilot for the Air Force. And the other, the two women are senior engineers at SpaceX involved in crew training and design of spacecraft. So, these are people who are very much enmeshed in the world of aviation and space and have a tremendous amount of experience. And I think when we say that they're, you know, quote unquote, civilian, it makes it sound like they're dilettantes and tourists, but these are very accomplished individuals who happen to be there on a private dime as opposed to NASA.",

More than 200 soldiers on both sides are back home after the latest prisoner swap between Russia and Ukraine. Kyiv says, more than a hundred Ukrainians released on Saturday had been held captive since the early months of the war. Among them soldiers who fought in the brutal three-month battle for the city of Mariupol more than two years ago. They were exchanged for the same number of Russians who were captured in Ukraine's recent incursion to the Kursk region. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is crediting that operation for bringing the Ukrainian troops home. The U.S. and Britain are keeping their cards close to the vest over Ukraine's request to use western-supplied missiles for strikes deeper inside Russia. President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Keir Starmer didn't make any announcements about the issue after their talks in Washington on Friday, but as CNN's Kevin Liptak reports, the discussions are far from over.",

When you talk to American officials, they do say they still have some concerns about taking this step. Some of the concerns are practical. You heard this from the defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, who said that a number of high value Russian targets have already been moved out of range of these missiles. You also hear concerns about escalation, and certainly that has been at the front of President Biden's mind every time a new capability comes on the table when it comes to Ukraine. And certainly, we have heard the Russian president, Vladimir Putin ratcheting up his rhetoric, saying that if President Biden takes this step, it would mean that Russia is directly at war with NATO. In his meeting with Keir Starmer, President Biden reacted to those comments. Listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Those four parachutes came out, I'm sure for the astronauts, that must have just been extraordinary, you know, moments away from splashing down. O'BRIEN:  Well, Jared Isaacman, when he was doing his spacewalk, talked about the perfect world beneath him. But I have a feeling looking up at those parachutes, the four perfect parachutes probably were his second favorite side of this mission because that when you see those, you know your home. And what beautiful thermal imagery we've gotten from the Dry Tortugas at the Gulf of Mexico. Watching that ever so hot capsule, as you can see, because it's bright white and those billowing parachutes doing their job, bringing this crew of four home, a successful mission and a real milestone in the history of commercial space activity, which, after years of talk, and, you know, many years of development, really has taken off in the past few years. And we're entering a new era here, which portends the possibility of many more people having access to space, Anna. And that's an exciting prospect.",

They have been on a mission to make sure that everything worked as perfectly. They trained diligently.And, you know, it was really impressive for Jared to see that. I want to say that Sarah, who has trained many of the astronauts that have flown on the Dragon capsule before, should also experience what she's actually training those astronauts for. So, again, another incredible kind of like story they're all going to have to tell. I can't wait to kind of see them egress from their capsule and see the smiles as they are back here on Earth. But something to remember, that it was December of 1903 when the Wright brothers actually kind of conquered human space flight and powered flight for the first time. So, here we are almost 121 years later, and we're seeing another new development in flight and aerospace. And that's just amazing, because even the suits they're wearing, SpaceX took the last 2.5 years to develop. And, again, these suits could one day, or some iteration thereof, be the ones that humans will be walking about on Mars in. And so, again, for all of the science that they did, all of the medical testing, everything that -- all the data they're going to bring back, again, well done all. Bravo and brava.

It's not quite like they used to do it back in the Apollo days. So, they're going to sit there and test their ability to handle motion sickness after what they've just been through. It looks like a pretty calm sea, which is, of course, very specifically forecast and what they were looking for in this case. And then they'll get on helicopters, make their way to land and be reunited with loved ones. And I know that'll be a special moment for all of them.",

So, I'm sure their inner ear -- it's weird. In microgravity, we can't tell what is up or down. And so, again, that part of our cochlea helps us kind of orient and create -- that creates equilibrium for us. The part of that is probably just their brain reprocessing all of the things that are part of being in a one G environment.

They the first thing they did was they flew to this very high altitude. And part of the reason they did that was to put themselves what are known as the Van Allen belts, which are an area of particularly high radiation environment. And if you're ever going to send humans to Mars, we're going to have to spend a lot -- understanding exactly that environment and how you might shield them against it to keep them safe is an important piece of this, which hasn't been really fully solved as we think about long duration space flights to Mars with the current chemical rockets we have. But in addition to that, they have all kinds of medical experiments going on them, including in the case of Kidd Poteet, he has an implant to help them further understand what's been happening to him physiologically. Now, five days is, you know, not a particularly long mission by today's standards. We have astronauts who've gone well past a year. We've been talking a lot about that crew, you know, quote/unquote, stranded on the International Space Station and how they will spend a year there. What we find with astronauts who spend a long time in the absence of gravity is you lose a lot of calcium in your bones. Your bones become more brittle and weak. Your cardiovascular system degrades quite a bit. You end up, believe it or not, Anna, I don't fully understand it, except it has something to do with the way fluids are distributed in our systems. But some astronauts experience long- term vision loss, believe it or not. All these things NASA has been working on throughout the course of the International Space Station. But each time you answer a question, there's another question that comes up. And so this crew was a part of pushing that even further forward. So, they will be spending a lot of time downloading data for their bodies, if you will, to compare it to what they were like before, what happened during and what happened after to get some good science,",
