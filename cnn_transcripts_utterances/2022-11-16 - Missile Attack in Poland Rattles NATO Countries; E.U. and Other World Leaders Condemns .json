And I'm Rosemary Church.We are following two major stories this hour. A Russian made missile has killed two people in Poland in what could be a significant turning point in the war in Ukraine. Russia denies it fired the projectile but the incident has prompted an emergency meeting of world leaders at the G20 summit in Indonesia. Plus, Donald Trump wants another term in the White House. He says Joe Biden and the Democrats have ruined the country and only his America first policies can get the U.S. back on track. Well, first to the deadly missile explosion in Poland. An investigation into the incident which left two Polish citizens dead is already underway. Officials say the missile was Russian made, but who fired it and where it was fired from is still unclear. Poland is considering invoking NATO's article four, which would trigger talks with the alliances decision making body. The missile fell in a village near Poland's border with Ukraine and set off a storm of diplomatic activity. In the coming hours NATO will hold an emergency meeting in Brussels before leaving the G20 summit in Indonesia. U.S. President Joe Biden also participated in an emergency meeting with G7 and NATO leaders. Mr. Biden struck a cautious tone while speaking with reporters. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Many feel that his announcement will not help the candidacy of Herschel Walker in Georgia. That the runoff would become much more about Donald Trump and that, so that's a big problem.But the other issue, I think Donald Trump is trying to condition the field for 2024 by jumping in now, he's essentially issuing a challenge to his would-be challengers, Mike Pence, Ron DeSantis, Chris Christie, Governor Hogan, and others who might jump, jump in, say, you know, come on, jump in. And frankly, I think Donald Trump would prefer if more of them jumped into the race because with a larger field that would likely help Donald Trump gain a plurality in the nomination process. So, right now, I think Trump has just thrown down the gauntlet. He wants in even though he is a diminished figure, his star is setting not rising and he is certainly taking a lot of the blame for Republican underperformance in the last week's election as he should be, given the fact that he made the election about himself and unhelpfully intervened in so many of the primaries, nominating -- helping to nominate candidates who are unfit and really added to significant Republican losses. So, he's in, and we'll see how these others react, but I think some mem -- some of his would-be challengers won't jump into the race as long as Trump is in there as a viable figure because of his strong base of support.",

Well, the truth is, these midterm elections are always about the party in power and the president or the party in power. It's really not so much about the agenda of the party out of powder -- power. And so, I think some of the folks who are challenging McConnell right now are trying to deflect blame from themselves because they were too close to the, you know, to the election denial movement, you know, just too close to too much of the excesses of Donald Trump. And frankly, too supportive of too many of these candidates who the American people rejected because they were seen as too extreme. Republicans lost the election not because of Mitch McConnell, but because of the Dobbs decision. Donald Trump's unhelpful interventions into these primary contests that nominated these unfit candidates. And, also, again, the election denial -- election denialism and the looking back at 2020. So, it's a bunch of reasons why Republicans lost. I would say those are the biggest reasons and probably most especially the Dobbs decision on abortion.",

But what you'll also see is Kevin McCarthy having to capitulate to the extremists in his party, the Freedom Caucus and others, simply because he has so little leeway, because he won't have much of a majority and he also has to pitch to the center. He has to keep everyone happy. That is an impossible job. and it is one that he may not hold in January because he actually needs to garner 218 -- sorry, yes, 218 votes not the 188 he has now. Once they get back in session, he needs everyone together and that means something along the lines of what he's already done, which has gone with his, you know, head and his hat and his hand, and going and apologizing to folks who he was critical of post-January 6th.

The New York attorney general has a $250 million lawsuit against Trump, his three eldest children and others tied to the Trump Organization accusing them of extensive financial fraud. The Manhattan district attorney is steaming through a criminal trial against the Trump Organization, alleging a series of illegal tax dodges with former chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg testifying. Trump has consistently denied all of the claims in these cases. And then there is Mar-a-Lago and those papers seized by the FBI amid suspicions Trump may have illegally taken sensitive documents from the White House to his Florida home. Just this week, Trump's team said in a new filing that all the material was personal, because allegedly Trump said so while president. The Justice Department says, nonsense. Allowing a president that kind of power would nullify the whole purpose of the law protecting presidential records for the public. And then there is the big bear January 6th. The congressional select committee says the deadline passed. Trump failed to comply with their subpoena for documents and testimony about his actions around the January 6th insurrection. His legal team has argued the committee has no right to such things, but that claim could face a much stiffer test if the Department of Justice probe into January 6th produces as some think it might charge against Trump.

Like during the 60s and 70s, it was all about the Apollo program and those men that stepped foot on the surface of the Moon. But this is a new generation. It's the beginning of the Artemis generation, which in Greek mythology Artemis is Apollo's twin sister.And so, this program is about two things really. First, it's about landing the first woman and the first person of color on the Moon. It's about setting a staging ground for someday going on to Mars. But the other big difference between Artemis and Apollo, Rosemary, is this time NASA wants to leave behind a lot more than just flags and footprints on the surface of the moon. They want to build a base. They want to build something to stay a permanent human presence on the Moon. And tonight's launch, is really the beginning of that. Rosemary?",

If all goes according to plan, they are hoping to have Artemis two, the first crude mission sometime in 2024, that would just take astronauts around the Moon. And then Artemis three would be the first mission where you actually have astronaut boots on the surface of the Moon. That would likely happen sometime in 2025.But one other little bit of exciting news that we learned tonight from NASA administrator, Bill Nelson, or I should say, wait, it's this morning. So, this would be last night. I had to give my time straight here, Rosemary. But NASA administrator Bill Nelson said last night, that if this mission Artemis One is a success, that they would then announce likely the first crew, the Artemis two crews, sometime within the next few months. So that's something obviously that every astronaut here, really anxious and looking forward to learning about.",
