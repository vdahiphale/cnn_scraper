And I remember seeing the cameras pan over to her during Austin's acceptance speech for best actor for playing her father. And I thought to myself that something seemed off. I didn't have a good point of reference to what gauge it to. And then, hearing Stephanie Elam and you hear \"Entertainment Tonight's\" Nischelle Turner speaking to CNN last night, saying that, when Nischelle interviewed her, something seemed a little off. But we can't correlate the two things together because it was 48 hours later. But look, we do know that she had been in rehab several times before. She had a lot of grief. She lost her son, Benjamin, one of her four children, to suicide in 2020. Opened up about that in a really emotional essay this summer, saying, \"I've never recovered from this. And my heart and soul went with you that day.\" That, as a parent, for anyone who lost someone they love -- I remember writing about it this summer and hard to write. So emotional.

      "sentences": "So the medical questions, is this something potentially that could have happened suddenly or is it a culmination, as Chloe mentioned, of challenges over years?DR. TARA NARULA, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: It's so hard when we see these cardiac arrests happen. As a cardiologist, we see this far too often. And in this country, over 300,000 cardiac arrests occur annually. And we know that cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death for men and women. Many times, it happens just like this. Someone can be fine, and the next day they're not. The issue is why is this happening. It's an electrical abnormality in the heart. The heart goes into an abnormal rhythm. It is unable to pump the blood throughout the rest of the body. And then organs start to fail. You're unable to get blood to the brain. And you essentially die within minutes if you don't get resuscitated appropriately. And there's potential underlying causes for cardiac arrest, which is what everyone is wondering, what could have caused this. If we look a little bit deeper, many times, it is coronary heart disease. So blockages in the coronary arteries. About 70 percent of the time it is related to that. But 10 percent of the time it's another structural abnormality with the heart muscle. Somebody may have had heart failure that may have been diagnosed of known, or some scar tissue in the heart muscle. And the last kind of big bucket are these electrical abnormalities. Some people are born with congenital or genetic diseases of the electrical system that may be silent until the day they have an arrhythmic event. And the last kind of categories are recreational drug use or certain medications. And other congenital diseases that people may have. There's a lot that could be going on under the surface that we are unaware of until the day that someone has an event.",
