I think it is more important for China to focus on protecting those at risk for hospitalization by putting effective vaccines into them, getting drugs like Paxlovid available, and making sure they have the capacity, rather than this unsustainable approach that can never end based on what this virus is.

There's not that many high-risk people who are vaccinated. So I do think that we would see a surge in hospitalizations and deaths among the high-risk. Whether we can handle that capacity, that is a question that only they could answer because they have been able to build hospitals very quickly. The point is, they are going to have to do this at some point. They have had two and a half years to use mRNA vaccines in the population, but they have refused them. So to me, it is not a situation, of their complete doing.

JIM O'BRIEN, HEAD OF U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT'S OFFICE OF SANCTIONS COORDINATION: Before I arrived, the main sanctions program was put in place. I think it has been very effective at what it was designed to do. (CROSSTALK) O'BRIEN: Intended to keep Russia, to deny Russia the resources it needs to carry out the war that it wanted. So this imperial project, quickly taking over Ukraine, and then being able to assert itself more broadly. MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT;  Right, but it has not forced the Kremlin, has it, to change its policies, to change its behavior? O'BRIEN: I think you do see a real difference. Most of the credit goes to the Ukrainians. Their courage and ingenuity on the battlefield, it has been remarkable. But you see the Kremlin keep changing what it said its stated aims are, right? It began with a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, an effort to take the capital. It shifted to a sort of incremental improvement on the land that it had taken before the war. Now it's giving that territory back. So these are real changes in Russian behavior. It is related partly to the sanctions, partly to export controls. So they cannot buy the kind of input that they need for their military to function.",

We were out and about this entire weekend, going to various shopping malls, shopping centers here in this country, and they are absolutely packed. They had Black Friday sales. There were customers were everywhere. Clearly, people still have money to spend, still are going out. Quite frankly, if you are in the city and you did not know that there was this war going on, you would have absolutely no clue that Russia, right now, is in a serious economic crisis. In fact, they are in recession. But of course, several caveats to this. On the one hand, Moscow is not the rest of Russia. There certainly are some areas that are suffering more than others. And there are a lot of people, indeed, who have lost their jobs. There's a lot of people whose spending power, quite frankly, has significantly decreased as well. As I mentioned, Russia is officially in a recession. But I do think that Jim O'Brien has a point when he says that the export controls, especially some of the sanctions that are now affecting the Russian defense sector, those certainly do seem to be making a difference. Making it more difficult for Russia to replenish its arsenal, and especially to manufacture higher-grade weapons, for instance, these things like microchips. We've seen the effects of some of that on the battlefield with the Russians, for instance, trying to acquire more of those Iranian-made drones.

There's talks of poor housing, in some cases, no housing, poor food. And then people, who are not fully trained, apparently, already being sent to the battlefield as well. This petition that came out over the weekend is a big one. There have been videos on telegram, by mothers and mothers organizations, that have called all of this out, called on Vladimir Putin to take action. Apparently, in some cases, it has already made a difference. For instance, some groups were calling for some students to be sent back, to be allowed to continue their studies. Apparently, this has happened in some cases. I think Vladimir Putin takes this very seriously. And that meeting that we saw last Friday, with those mothers, even though it was criticized by some as only having mothers in it, it certainly showed that the Kremlin takes this very seriously. It was played on Russian state media throughout that entire day, and the entire weekend. We can see some of that on our screen now. Becky, one of the things that Vladimir Putin made clear in that meeting, he definitely respects the sacrifices the mothers are making. He also made it very clear that he will not be deterred from this course. And of course, that course is to continue with what the Russians call that Special Military Operations -- Becky?",

But at the same time, it is so significant hearing someone inside Iran speaking out the way that she did in this taped message that was very courageous, considering how the regime has been dealing with the dissent of those who have been speaking out. What we understand, according to human rights activists, she was arrested on Wednesday to serve a 15-year sentence for what had been an ongoing case for several months. A couple of days after her arrest, her brother released this video, a seven-minute video in which she slams the Iranian regime, as well as the international community and the United Nations, Becky. She is criticizing what she says is this lack of support for the brave Iranian's, as she put it, describing the sanctions by the international community as laughable, saying more should be done. They shouldn't be watching what is happening in the country, to see a repeat of 2019, that crackdown where hundreds of people were killed in a number of days. She called on the free people of the world, she said, to push their governments to cut ties with the regime, that, as you mentioned, she described as a murderous, child killing regime.
