Just ahead, waiting on a knife's edge as the Middle East braces for Iran to launch a retaliatory strike on Israel, a mass cast doubt on whether it will participate in this week's Gaza ceasefire talks.U.S. President Joe Biden offers new insights into why he decided to drop out of the 2024 campaign and pass the torch to his vice president, Kamala Harris. And Paris says au revoir to the Olympics, closing out two weeks of record-breaking athleticism in the City of Light. Good to have you with us. A barrage of rockets fired by Hezbollah into northern Israel is heightening tensions in the Middle East as Israel braces for possible retaliation from Iran and its proxies over the assassination of a top Hamas leader. The Israel Defense Forces says about 30 rockets were launched from Lebanon Sunday night, with some falling into open areas. No injuries were reported. This coming as Israeli forces remain on high alert. CNN political and foreign policy analyst Barak Ravid reports that according to a source, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin that Iranian military preparations suggest Iran is preparing for a large-scale attack. Austin has now ordered a guided-missile submarine to the Middle East, with the announcement seen as a message of deterrence to Iran and its proxies. The U.S. is also accelerating the arrival of a carrier strike group. And as concerns over a wider conflict grow, Gaza ceasefire talks are due to take place later this week. CNN's Paula Hancocks is following developments for us. She joins me now live from London. Good morning to you, Paula. So, what preparations are underway in the region for a potential retaliatory strike from Iran and its allies on Israel, and what is expected?",

      "sentences": "Well, Rosemary, we have been seeing some movements from the U.S. side as you mentioned there. Some fairly significant movement, the fact that they have decided through the Pentagon to move the USS Georgia, which is a guided missile submarine to the Middle East. Now, this a nuclear-powered submarine. It's armed with cruise missiles. It had been just off the coast of Italy carrying out some training in recent days and it is now being moved into the waters of the Middle East.Now, what's significant about this is the fact that it has been highlighted, it has been front. This is out of the ordinary. It is very rare for the Pentagon to announce movements of its nuclear- powered submarine. It is almost a complete secrecy surrounding the movement of this kind of military assets, which goes to show that this is a very clear sign to Iran, a sign of deterrence that this is what they have in the region. So, we're really seeing this deterrence being beefed up by the United States. We're hearing from the Israeli side, the IDF, saying that they are on a high state of readiness at this point. And we have been hearing from Iran itself saying that they will be carrying out this retaliation. It's separate from ceasefire talks when it comes to Gaza, but this is something that they have to do because Israel, in killing Ismail Haniyeh, the Hamas political leader on Iranian soil, violated its sovereignty. So it is something they have to respond to. Now we did see, because of course it's Iran's proxies we're looking at as well, for any potential retaliation. We saw overnight on Sunday night about 30 rockets being fired from Hezbollah into northern Israel. The IDF says there were no injuries for that particular barrage of rockets. Rosemary?",

And she was up by identical margins of 50 to 46 in all three.There is a long way to go. But what I took out of those polls that was significant was there was not an intrinsic pullback from her as a mixed-race woman among older and blue-collar white voters as compared to the support that Biden was winning. And what that says to me, it's not that those voters are guaranteed to be with her all the way to the end, but the Republicans are going to have to dislodge them. They were not inherently running for the exits. And the fact that she was running better than Biden did in '20 among working class white voters in all three states, I think is a striking result and one that underscores the challenge ahead for the Trump campaign.",

Suddenly he's the candidate who seems older.You know, that press conference the other day, a lot of his answers kind of hard to figure out where he was going.

Vance wants to accuse anyone, Tim Walz, of dodging military service when Donald Trump got out of Vietnam with a diagnosis of bone spurs in his feet that is still disputed and later said that his equivalent of Vietnam was avoiding sexually transmitted diseases while dating models in Manhattan in the '80s and '90s. You know, you got to kind of look in the mirror. I mean, there are vulnerabilities that Harris will have between now and the finish line, as I said, largely around issues of strength and ideology and who can keep people safe.

I mean, he has said repeatedly through his presidency that he views Trump as an existential threat to American democracy as we have known it. And there were -- there are a lot of reasons to agree with that judgment.And so for Biden to then say, well, you know, I may be diminished, but I should get the right to go on no matter what, he was violating the kind of standard that he set out himself.

And there is now -- getting in the minutia. There is now time-stamped video footage that the USA gymnastics has sent to the court of arbitration for sport that shows the U.S. appeal was within the one- minute 47 seconds. So they did get that appeal in time. My sense is that they will win their argument and cast and I'm surprised, frankly, Rosemary, that the International Olympic Committee let it get this far and didn't just say, hey, you both get bronze medals and let's not have this ruin the last day of a fabulous Olympics. There's precedent he figure skaters and 2002 and Salt Lake City double gold medal for the Canadians and the Russians in that famous French judge judging scandal.

This includes the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, the poliovirus vaccine, hepatitis A, hepatitis B vaccines among others. And the researchers looked specifically at children born between 1994 and 2023.And the researchers found that routine childhood vaccinations will have prevented more than 500 million cases of illness, about 32 million hospital and more than 1 million deaths. This is all within a child's lifetime and the researchers say that results in a direct cost savings of more than $500 billion for the country. When we think about the medical costs and the researchers say that this results in an indirect cost savings of about $2.7 trillion. Now, in this new report, it is noted that during the COVID-19 pandemic, we did see delays in some childhood vaccinations. This is because some pediatricians' appointments were delayed, canceled, or missed due to the pandemic, but also this is partly due to the spread of misinformation leading to some families becoming more vaccine hesitant. But the researchers emphasize that now is the time to make sure your child is up to date on their routine vaccinations. We're currently in the back to school season. So remember to talk to your pediatrician about what's needed for you and for your family as you head back to school, and as you think about your routine vaccines. Back to you. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
