That's who we're actually running against. We cannot have President Kamala Harris at the tip of the spear. Let me tell you, it's a pretty scary thing when you think of Joe Biden handling our national security. But it's more scary to think about Kamala Harris.

I was the first woman to be elected District Attorney. I was the first woman to be elected Attorney General in the State of California, and I'm the first woman to be Vice President.

And she could just say Joe Biden is too old if that's what she wants to say. But instead she thought it was a way to play. But she needs to be really careful because the same people who would get riled up about not wanting to see the first black female president might not also want to see the first black Indian woman President. And so the folks, if she's playing to a group that is prejudice and racist, they don't want her either. So she needs to say what she means and means what she means what she says. And I think it's a cheap way to try and get the Republican nomination that is not going to work and will backfire on her for the same reason she's using it against Kamala Harris.",

This is the same party that is poised to turn against Nikki Haley, as well.PETER WEHNER, FORMER ADVISER, PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH: Yeah, I think that's right. I mean, you know, the Republican Party, whatever problems people had pre-Trump, it's become sort of a deranged party now. And the appeals to racism are not coded. They're explicit. So, it's an ugly form of politics. And it's not simply that. It's not only sensibilities, but he's using fascistic rhetoric. And he's a man of sociopathic tendencies. He's at the top of the ticket. And given all of that, he has a vice grip on the Republican Party. That's the astonishing thing. All of these people who are falling into line to support him, they know better. But it's the base of the party that reveres Donald Trump. And they're afraid, a lot of people are afraid. They know better in terms of what Trump is, what he's done, the moral depravity that he embodies, his lawlessness, his corruption. And it doesn't matter to them. So, this is, and I say this as somebody who's been a lifelong Republican prior to Donald Trump, but it's a diseased and dangerous party and it's got to be defeated.",

And so, it is part of getting Donald Trump to lose, but it's also part -- this is why it was so frustrating when Ron DeSantis wanted to strip black history out of schools because if you don't start teaching the true history of what happened in this country. And when you don't have candidates who will actually acknowledge racism, then you think people as an angry, white male Republican, you feel like something is being taken away from you when you know that's not the truth.

And as you said, when his candidates have been on tickets, they've lost.I think the way to understand this, and I say this from having talked to a lot of Trump supporters, is really through the prism of psychology. There is an attachment that he has, some kind of visceral response that he gets from his supporters and the Republican Party that's unlike anything we've seen in American politics, at least in our lifetime. So, I think the usual rules don't really apply. That bond is extraordinary. Just think about this. It's a guy that every time he's indicted, 91 counts, his approval rating goes up. He's found liable of rape, of sexual assault, and his approval rating goes up. He tries to overthrow the government and his approval rating goes up in the Republican Party. He led an insurrection against the Capitol. Nothing has shaken. It's not only that it hasn't shaken -- their trust in him and their reverence for him, it's actually deepened.",
