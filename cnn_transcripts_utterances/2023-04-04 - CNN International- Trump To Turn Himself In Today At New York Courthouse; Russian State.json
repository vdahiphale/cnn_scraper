He said he would allow five still cameras, just regular photographers to come in and capture the moment when the former president is sitting behind the defense table.He said that they will be allowed to take a couple of photos until the court staff ushers them out. But he's not allowing the public to watch this live. And he did say in his order that while the populace rightly hungers for the most accurate and current information available to suggest otherwise would be disingenuous, but he said he had to balance this with the rights of the defendant. Of course, former President Trump and his attorneys oppose any broadcasting of this thing. It would only add to the circuit -- circus like atmosphere, and they were concerned that it would harm his presumption of innocence if this case were to go to trial, and they will try to select a jury here in New York to hear this case. You know, we're waiting for the former president's arrival. He's expected to show up a couple hours from now. We're starting to see some security really increase around here and preparations for his arrival. A couple of the side streets around the courthouse have been closed. The media presence has certainly grown and we're seeing more barricades in place and more visible police presence are gearing up for the former president's arrival. Just about 1:00 p.m., he's expected to leave Trump Tower Eastern Time here in New York, and then make his way downtown here. He will go into the courthouse. He'll be processed, that means being fingerprinted, and then he will walk into a hallway just like other defendants, drug dealers and even, you know, his former chief strategist, Steve Bannon, was also arraigned in this courthouse before this same judge, then Trump will go inside, then the arraignment takes place. That's where the judge will ask him if he wants to read the indictment. That's usually waived. And then Trump will be asked to enter a plea. His lawyer say he will plead not guilty to these charges. At that point, we expect the indictment to be unsealed. And then we will all get a chance to see exactly what these charges are. Our sources tell us that this will be more than 30 charges, criminal counts felonies, and will then hear more from the president tonight when he returns and speaks at Mar-a-Lago. Max?",

Meanwhile, new video captures the moments before that blast ripping through St. Petersburg Cafe on Sunday, after blogger Vladlen Tatarsky was handed a small statue possibly packed with explosives. A short time earlier, there was this interaction between Tatarsky and Trepova. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VLADLEN TATARSKY, RUSSIAN PRO-WAR MILITARY BLOGGER (through translator): Nastya, Nastya, come here.

So some, including her husband and other supporters and allies, say that they believe this could be politically motivated.They feel she may have been framed. That video released of her being questioned in custody, they feel may have been done under duress. And, of course, this, we're talking about a very prominent pro-Russian military blogger as well. So clearly, we have to look at this in the context of this is going on and it's the war in Ukraine. Tensions are very high and any sign of criticism within Russia of the war in Ukraine over the invasion has been dealt with by the Russian authorities with a very heavy hand.",

But a source familiar with the matter says the intelligence community is not overly concerned about the information the balloon was able to gather. The Chinese foreign ministry reiterated on Tuesday that the balloon flights was a, quote, unintended, unexpected, an isolated event. Let's bring in CNN's Natasha Bertrand.

      "sentences": "Yes. So the FBI is still investigating this balloon. But as of right now, what they've learned is that the balloon was able to capture some imagery, as well as collect some signals intelligence from sensitive military installations across the United States.Now, the U.S. intelligence community as well as U.S. officials more broadly are telling us that they are not overly concerned about this, because they don't believe that the images and the signals that this balloon was able to collect or anything more sensitive or sophisticated than what a regular Chinese satellite would be able to capture, which of course orbit over these sites every single day. But there is a caveat to that, which is that the U.S. government still doesn't know whether Beijing was able to erase some of the data on the balloon before the U.S. government was able to get its hands on it, of course, after shooting it down off the coast of South Carolina in February. So there is a scenario in which the Chinese government could have wiped the balloon before the U.S. was able to examine it. And therefore, the U.S. really doesn't know if it has a complete picture of what the Chinese government was able to collect here. But we are told that the FBI is continuing to investigate the balloon. They have learned interesting things about the algorithms that power the balloon software, as well as how it was able to maneuver. And we are told that in addition to the fact that the FBI and U.S. officials believe that this balloon was really maneuverable by the Chinese government, it was also able to collect these images and these signals in real time. And so, all of this raises questions about when of course the U.S. is going to have a complete picture of what the Chinese government was able to collect as of right now. Again, they aren't overly concerned they don't necessarily think that it is a major national security threat, Max.",

And that gives Disney a certain level of autonomy, a certain level of control over how it wants to govern both its resort in Florida but also the land that it sits on. But Florida's Republican Governor Ron DeSantis, wanted to strip back some of that power. He called it leveling the playing field. Disney, however, saying, wait a minute, the timing of this seems really curious. This actually feels a bit more like retaliation, because this only became a thing essentially, after we made those critical comments about that Florida education bill that critics have called Don't Say Gay.

The Florida Legislature and Governor DeSantis has worked to put Disney on an even playing field and Disney got caught attempting to undermine Florida's duly-enacted legislation in the 11th hour.\"Max, what he's referring to there, the 11th hour is this recent discovery from the governor's office that essentially a board of this special district, a board that was essentially appointed and picked by Disney had given Disney much of its power back in perpetuity. And so, the governor's office realize that that's what it's calling out Disney for saying, look, you at the 11th hour tried to undermine our authority here in Florida for the state legislators. So what happens now, Max? Well, that is the big question. I mean, I can tell you that Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, you ain't seen nothing yet essentially that more is to come. He is calling for a state investigation into these actions of the Disney board of the board that had been picked by Disney also calling perhaps for a court proceeding. So all this to say, stay tuned.

They saw what was happening in Ukraine, remembering just not long before Russia invaded Ukraine. The sense was in Finland, among the public that they didn't need to join NATO.And that had been a position held for many decades in Finland, but the invasion changed that almost overnight. The public mood shifted in Finland, the political mood, a dispensation shifted with that too. And the request came very quickly, which has been recognized very quickly. But that 800 miles of border, we were along that border this time, last year. A lot of it is forest, a lot of it is very remote in the winter. You can imagine it's now covered, it's a border, that until now hasn't had a great deal of protection along it. There's been a bit of motion detectors, but there are tracks in the forest where you can get very close to the border with Russia, and quite literally walk across a field, swing your leg over the low fence and walk into Russia. That's going to change. Finland is spending $150 million to build a long fence along that border. So a lot is changing here, physically on the ground, no word of additional NATO troops. Again, that, as you were saying, Max, that's what would anger the Russians. But think about it this way too, Russia stretched militarily in Ukraine, an 800- mile border where they would have to beef up forces, as they say they would, would become a drain for them too.
