But it is as you look farther out that it is just gut- wrenching and so chilling what you see. If you can see off in the distance, Kate, you see sheets of metal wrapped around trees. And then if you can see that car flipped over and crushed like a soda can. It is so alarming out here. And, Kate, this is what it looks like at dawn. As the light comes up this morning, surely this will look even more horrible. And, Kate, what we know right now is that 38 people in this county have been injured. This storm system put 45 million people from Texas to western Pennsylvania under the threat of severe storms and tornadoes. These were super cells that just ripped across areas, again, from Texas to Pennsylvania, putting thousands of people without power, here in Indiana, 5,000 people at least without power, 20,000 people without power in Ohio. This scene, again, is just so gut-wrenching. And when you listen to what people saw, it really hits home, Kate. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

John, you know, we're still about a half hour until we see first light, but just giving an overall estimation of what we're seeing from Whitney's live shot just a moment ago, some of that damage is consistent with an EF-2 tornado or greater. So, that's winds roughly of 111 to 135 miles per hour. That's terrifying. It's made twice as terrifying, especially when it strikes at night. Remember, tornadoes are twice as deadly at nighttime because, generally, people are sleeping.Look at how lightning illuminates this funnel cloud coming out of Winchester, Indiana. That is exactly where our Whitney Wild is on the ground. And I want you to see that there were two separate rounds of tornadic super cells that moved through the region last night. First, notice the tornado popping up right near the Ohio River between Indiana, Kentucky, and Ohio. But then the secondary line of storms that caused the damage across Central Indiana and into Eastern Ohio were later at night. And here's a look at the daytime footage from one tornado in Carrollton, Kentucky. I mean, look at that large tornado clearly on the ground. This is the resulting damage, not necessarily from that tornado, but from one of the many tornadoes that popped up across the region. This is near the Ohio River. And Milton, Kentucky, seeing buildings flatten, taken completely off of their foundations, and lives changed forever. Eight confirmed tornadoes so far. That number likely to go up, and you can see over 300 reports of severe weather. Now, this line of storms is still marching across the Deep South, and there's right now a severe thunderstorm watch across central portions of Alabama. This is the area we're highlighting as more of an immediate threat, even though this is moving into a more stable environment. We've noticed a couple of tornado warnings popping up here within the past 20 minutes. This is out of Jackson County in Alabama. So, heads up, Birmingham, you're about to be rocked by some stronger storms, lots of lightning associated with this, and even another threat, flash flooding across southern portions of Arkansas ongoing right now. So, a dynamic storm system evolving this morning, to say the least. John?",

And previous orders from Judge Scott McAfee have tended to come out in the morning.And so, in the meantime, though, we wait. A big question mark still is timing for this monumental decision. Will Fani Willis be allowed to continue on with the case that she's investigated for the last three years? You know, it all started January 2, 2021, with that infamous phone call from the former president to Georgia's secretary of state to ask him to find more votes, and now it's gotten us here to this point, 19 indictments by the Fulton County District Attorney's Office, four guilty pleas. But a big question mark, remains, will Fani Willis be able to continue and prosecute this case, or will she be thrown off throwing this case into uncertainty? Judge Scott McAfee has granted more interviews in the last week than he has since he took on this case late last year. And it was yesterday that WSB, our affiliate here in Atlanta, caught up with McAfee at the Rotary Club. He was there at an event speaking, and this is what he had to say to one of the local news reporters here. On the decision, he says, should be out tomorrow. I made a promise to everybody. These kinds of orders take time to write. I need to make sure I say exactly what I want to and plan to stick to the timeline I gave everyone. The message I always want to convey is that no ruling of mine is ever going to be based on politics. I'm going to be following the law as best I understand it. You know, we ran into him earlier this week and asked him about timeline, and he doubled down, saying that the decision would come out by the end of the week, and here we are. But he also gave an interview late last week to a radio station here, and he talked about how this case has personally affected him, saying that he has two young children, ages five and three, and that he looks forward to the day that he could look them in their eye and tell them that he played this straight and did the best he could.

Four hours, five hours in court yesterday of oral arguments where Donald Trump's team is trying to convince Judge Aileen Cannon to throw out his charges, these 30-some classified document mishandling charges as well as an obstruction conspiracy set of counts.In that argument, Judge Aileen Cannon was pretty skeptical about what the Trump team was putting forward. They had tried to make arguments to her that these papers that he took from the White House at the end of the presidency about national defense, weapons, U.S. military plans, that those were his personal papers because when he was president, he decided he wanted them as his personal papers and he could do that. She was skeptical of that. And then very quickly on his other argument that the law was so vague around national security secrets or national defense material that he couldn't have known he was breaking the law as the president. She very quickly decided that she was going to reject that claim. But there is a lot of options here that she has to look at what Trump is asking for. There are nine different ways by my count that Trump and his co-defendants have asked her to dismiss this case. We just heard the arguments on two of them. And so there's a lot of work to do. We're still expecting a decision from the judge on what to do with Trump's personal records claim, that presidential records claim argument that they made yesterday. And then, of course, Kate, the other thing we're waiting for, a trial date. We still don't have it. We've been in Florida with other hours of arguments before this judge about when this trial should take place and still nothing on the calendar. And we don't know when the next hearing will be either to work through more of the arguments that Donald Trump's team is trying to make here.
