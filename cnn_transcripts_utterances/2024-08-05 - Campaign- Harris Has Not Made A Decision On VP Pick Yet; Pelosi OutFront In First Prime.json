Harris said to be focusing on two candidates in the final hours before her major announcement, as sources insist she still hasn't made up her mind. Plus, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is my guest live here tonight, her first primetime interview since Kamala Harris became her party's nominee. She has a new book out where she spills some serious tea about private conversations with Donald Trump. And J.D. Vance's wife is coming to his defense. Why the Trump team is eager for Usha Vance to speak out. Let's go OUTFRONT. Good evening. I'm Dana Bash, in for Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, Pelosi live and in-person in her first primetime interview since President Biden stepped aside and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will speak out. And tonight, Vice President Kamala Harris is on the cusp of making one of the biggest decisions of her career that is her running mate, which could be announced at any moment. You're looking at new pictures of Harris returning to the vice president's residence moments ago as CNN is told, she still has not decided on, which man it will be. We are learning that Harris is focused though on to of the contenders. You see them there, Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota. Harris is preparing to hold a rally with her new pick in less than 24 hours, and major fears tonight, in addition to that, about a looming global recession, a threat would undoubtedly weigh down Harris's campaign in the crucial months before the election. Today, the U.S. stock markets saw its biggest drop in nearly two years. The Dow down over 1,000 points because of concerns about a slowing U.S. economy. The economy, of course, is issue number one in this election. I'm going to talk to former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi about all of this in just a moment. But, first, I want to go to Philadelphia. MJ Lee is OUTFRONT there. That is where Kamala Harris is going to be holding her first rally with whomever she picks as her running mate tomorrow. MJ, you've been talking to sources all day. What are you learning?",

      "sentences": "Well, Dana, we are absolutely in the final -- final stages of this process. As of this late afternoon, that campaign was saying that the vice president had not yet made a decision, but it is a decision that we are going to learn about in the coming hours.Now, we have, of course, been discussing three names in particular as being the final contenders -- Tim Walz, Josh Shapiro, and Mark Kelly. We did learn earlier tonight that in the final hours of the selection process, the vice president has been training her focus on two of those names in particular, that is Shapiro and Walz. Now, to be clear, based on our conversations earlier, Mark Kelly had not been exactly taken off the table. He was according to our sources, still one of the final three finalists and all three of them, of course, had met in person with the vice president over the weekend in Washington, D.C. Now, this waiting process may feel long for some of us tracking this very closely, but it is worth noting that all of this has actually moved at extraordinary speed. It was only 15 days ago that President Biden dropped out of the race, forcing Kamala Harris to make this decision in just a matter of days. And some of the biggest questions, Dana, as you know very well that she has been weighing include questions like who is going to be a strong governing partner who can help her win? Who does she have the strongest chemistry with? That, of course, is one factor that only the vice president, of course, can weigh in on answer that question to. We know that she of course, has also been presented with a ton of data. A lot of polling and other information about each of the contenders. But again, if everything goes according to plan, we should find out very shortly before that Philadelphia joint rally tomorrow night, who exactly Kamala Harris has chosen, of course, one of the most consequential political decisions that she has made.",

Nobody votes for number two, but, but he might be able to pull over enough folks. I think so without -- without Pennsylvania, she's done. And I think this is a simple choice. It's an obvious choice.
