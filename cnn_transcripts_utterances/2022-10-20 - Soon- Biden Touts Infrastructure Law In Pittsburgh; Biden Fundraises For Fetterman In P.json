Donald Trump's legal team is considering, offering the FBI a chance to search Mar-a-Lago again. Plus, a judge handling a separate case, says the former president signed a court document with bogus election fraud claims, after his lawyer made clear it would not be truthful.We begin the hour though with the president of the United States back on the road. He is again headed to Pennsylvania, first of Pittsburgh to highlight how his infrastructure law is helping the country build back. Then to Philadelphia for a closed-door fundraiser with the Democratic Senate nominee John Fetterman. This trip highlights the president's midterm challenge. Another trip to Pennsylvania is a reminder, the president is simply not welcomed by many Democrats in tough races across the country. And the president is skipping traditional campaign rallies, choosing instead to mostly holds more low-key events focused on administration policy with. Asked why he's not out on the campaign trail nor the president of the system this morning, he is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, John, you will recall that it was back in January that the president was supposed to visit Pittsburgh, and literally hours before he left Washington, a bridge collapse right here behind me where I'm standing because it was in poor condition. But fortunately, nobody was killed at the time.But the timing of the collapse was really incredibly coincidental. Because the purpose of that visit back in January was for the president to talk about the state of the nation's infrastructure and talk about how he wanted to use the money from the infrastructure, bipartisan infrastructure law to rebuild precisely things like bridges. Now, officials say that the bridge that is being rebuilt behind me should be completed around December. And that while it isn't funding that comes directly from that law that went into this bridge, it's money that went to this state that ended up aid being able to sort of expedite that process. So, what we should expect to see today is the president using this as the backdrop to talk about one of his biggest accomplishments, and of course, I should note he is going to be joined by some local elected officials. And one person that we're keeping a close eye on, of course, is Lieutenant Governor John Fetterman. The president will be participating in another event with him later today in Philadelphia. And I think this day just really captures how the White House has been deploying the president as we get closer to the midterms. As you noted, he's not necessarily doing these big rallies, specifically with candidates, but he's doing more events where he is talking about the Democratic agenda. And even though there are some Democratic candidates who are not necessarily wanting to appear physically alongside him, we are seeing them also running on his agenda. So that's precisely what we're going to be seeing today.",

Donald Trump, his first midterm in October 2018, 26 campaign rallies, Biden, no big rallies.Let me be a contrarian for a second, Michael. Obama lost 63 seats. I think it was in that first midterm.

He comes off as awkward and a little stodgy. I think what he has done is he started to use his office in a way the Democrats were asking for a year, what is the message out of the White House? What are the Democrats about?You've seen big executive actions on marijuana, pushing for a rescheduling of marijuana, he's on student loan announcement, he repeated announcements about releasing the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. So, he's trying to almost every day have a message that he cares. He's doing something the problem he has is the biggest problem in the country right now is inflation. And that's a problem for the Federal Reserve, not for him. And he can't really do much about it right now. He can talk and say he's working on drug prices and working on bridges and working on, you know, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, but he can't really solve the underlying problem.",

They say they're going to turn out their voters. So, they're going to surprise us in the midterm year. Let's leave our minds open to that. We live in an age of volatility, we'll see. But if you look at the fundamentals, Laura. In recent days, the campaign, the polling data and other data is settled in a way that does make it look like a more traditional midterm, where the party in power gets whacked by the voters.If you look, this the new CNBC poll out today. Inflation, Republicans have a 15-point advantage. On taxes, Republicans have an 11-point advantage. On jobs, Republicans have an 11-point advantage. Healthcare, the Democrats have a big edge there. That's the issue they wrote back in 2018 and again in 2020. But the challenge for the president is those numbers, they have settled. And a lot of Democrats are saying you see the essentially gravity taking hold, and it looks to them all of a sudden, like a more normal midterm. LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, PBS NEWSHOUR: It does. I mean, the House look very much looks like it's going to be in Republican hands. The Senate, though, still is a toss-up. I mean, the races are narrowing, which is what tends to happen, the closer you get to election day, but it doesn't mean that those Democrats are out of it yet. I mean, some of them are still leading in quite a few of those races. I mean, we could very well end up with another 50-50 Senate, you know, or 51-50. I mean, it's going to be tight. One thing about the president, though, is that he's really trying to, as you mentioned, focus on quite a bit of what he's doing in a way that I think he thinks his President Obama did not do, which is that, you know, the Biden administration has constantly argued. President Obama didn't - we didn't sell ACA the way we should have. So, I'm trying to go out there and actually talk about what I've done, talk about the inflation Reduction Act, even though they haven't been hit on the fact that it isn't necessarily helping people's pocketbooks in the immediate term. It has more effects coming next year and the year after that. So, that's something that the president is clearly trying to be out there more on. On abortion, I just think we don't know how big of an impact is going to potentially have. So many people voter registration is up, voter registration among young voters is up. And based on, you know, studies and polling it would seem that they would vote more for pro-abortion rights then against it.",

And if you look at even President Biden's approval rating and you map it against gas prices, he bottomed out in mid-June in terms of his national approval rating. That's when gas prices peaked, all through the late summer.There was sort of this rosy moment appearing for Democrats that did very well in the New York special election. Gas prices were going down, and then you've seen that reverse, and there's just not much you can do about it.",

We'll see what after the midterms, but this is critical, actually, in the sense that you need to turn out every piece of your coalition.

No, I think that's right. But we don't know if they're going to go back to sort of the pre-2018 numbers, so we'll see. Bernie Sanders is out there. Barack Obama also will be out there.

      "sentences": "John, it seems like Liz Truss's term as prime minister was doomed to fail right from the get- go. When she announced a series of economic measures in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis that included tax breaks for corporations and some of the wealthiest people in this country, that did not go over well with her parliamentary colleagues, didn't go well overwhelmed with the market, and most importantly, wasn't exactly embraced by the British public just struggling to get by.And no matter how much she tried to scrape and claw to get out of the hole that she had dug for herself. Nothing was good enough, not rolling back part of those plans, not firing or chancellor, not ultimately rolling back, almost all of those plans nothing it seemed was going to work. And so yesterday, John, or today, I should say, Liz Truss was obviously reading the political tea leaves and realizing that, even if she could survive a challenge from within her own party to her leadership, it didn't look like she was going to be able to govern very effectively, given the fact that her personal popularity and also her party's popularity were in the tank. If an election were to be held today, Labour the opposition party would wipe the floor with the conservatives. And that is why Labour is calling for a general election, saying that the conservatives no longer have a mandate to govern. What we do know for certain is that the conservatives will choose a new leader by the end of next week. The question now is who might that be? Someone like Penny Mordaunt or Rishi Sunak, who came third and second, respectively in the race or perhaps even Boris Johnson. Some of his close allies, say that suspect that he may, and I emphasize may also be throwing his hat in the ring, which would be remarkable considering he was booted from office by pressure of his own colleagues some six weeks ago.

Early in person voting starting this morning in North Carolina. In battleground Georgia, record turnout so far. Also today, some new developments that raise the specter of voter intimidation and interference.In Texas, early voting starts next week. And there's new tension today between the Republican state government and the Democrats who oversee the state's most populous county. The secretary of state announcing last night, it is sending inspectors to Harris County to conduct random election checks. Harris County officials see it as another example of Republicans searching for a problem that they say simply doesn't exist. And it stirs doubts. They say Republicans are stirring doubts about election integrity, absent any facts. And in Arizona, a report of intimidation. One voter their reports being followed, while trying to deposit their vote at an early voting drop box in Maricopa County. Our reporters are back at the table to discuss. Number one, there are - remember, one of the reasons this Texas development stir so many questions is because a number of states did pass new election laws to add restrictions, to make it less easy or reduce the options available to you to vote this year than we're available in 2020, which has a lot of Democrats voting rights advocate, saying what are you trying to do here? So, when the Texas secretary of state says, we're sending election monitors to Harris County to watch, it says what?

In terms of Harris County is a very diverse county in Texas, with a number of people of color that are voters. And so, again, it may send a chilling signal to the county, which is that we're being watched the same way, you know, Fulton County has been filling that in Georgia, which is a predominantly black county, that they're being watched as they try to make sure that as many people who are eligible to vote, vote. You know, this is also happening as a number of Trump allies are going around the country and candidates that are running, saying that, you know, if they get put into power, that they get to control this entire election system apparatus, and they can ensure that Trump wins again. You know, one thing that's also stunning about election offices right now that extremist experts have been saying, and that I spoke to recently is that a number of election offices, because they're so concerned about the lies that have been spread about the election system, that they are now, you know, going through active shooter trainings that they are now, you know, equipping their offices with bulletproof glass because of what happened last year.",
