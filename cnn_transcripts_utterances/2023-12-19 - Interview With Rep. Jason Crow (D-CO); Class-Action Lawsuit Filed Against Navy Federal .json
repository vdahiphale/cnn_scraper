And Prime Minister Netanyahu, which I think is a really important distinction to draw here.I do not have confidence that BiBi Netanyahu is doing the right thing by Israelis. I think he failed Israelis on October 7th. Listen, just earlier this year, 20 percent of Israelis, a fifth of the country of Israel, was out in the streets protesting the Netanyahu government and some of its more extreme policies. Then you have what is potentially their greatest intelligence failure in a generation, a military failure in a generation, on October 7th. So I don't think he has served the Israeli people well. That is why we have been very clear that we don't think his military strategy and his approach is one that is tenable for the United States and for Israel. That is why we want drastic change.",

We saw that during our 20 years in Iraq and Afghanistan. Public support and sentiment is essential. That is one of the reasonswhy we expressed these concerns. Because those on the letter are members of the Intelligence Committee, the Foreign Affairs Committee. We speak frequently with ambassadors, with heads of state all over the world. And we are concerned that there is a reduction in support for Israel because of the conduct of their campaign in Gaza. So we want to make sure that we are shoring up that support both within the United States and internationally. That is why we expressed concerns about the manner in which the operation is being conducted. Both it's fueling extremism in the region, we think. It is unacceptable that we are seeing the level of civilian casualties we are seeing in Gaza. Of course, in public sentiment we think is turning as well, both in the United States and internationally. These are all reasons why we felt compelled to write this letter.",

Here are some of the other headlines we are watching this hour.Investigators are trying to figure out what caused this house to go up in flames in New Jersey. Crews struggled to battle the fire this morning after a powerful storm caused severe flooding in the area. Officials say, fortunately, the house was not occupied so no injuries were reported. But that same storm system has killed at least four people across the northeast, causing widespread power outages, too. The NFL has suspended -- another story now, the NFL has suspended Pittsburgh Steelers Safety Demonte Casey without pay for the remainder of the regular season for repeated regulations or rules meant to protect the health and safety of players. In a game this weekend, Casey launched himself at the head of another player who was trying to make a diving catch. He was ejected right after that play. Casey can appeal the suspension under the collective bargaining agreement. We'll see where it goes. In the meantime, nearly nine million borrowers missed their first student loan payment after the pandemic-related pause ended this fall. That's according to the Department of Education. That adds up to roughly 40 percent of the 22 million borrowers who had bills due in October. The borrowers, though, still have a grace period. Those who missed payments through September 2024 are set to not face significant penalties. So the nation's largest credit union, Navy Federal, is now facing a class-action lawsuit over its mortgage lending practices. This is after a CNN investigation found it had the widest racial disparity in mortgage lending approval rates of any major lender.",

I will point out here, in Washington D.C., this has caught the attention of people on Capitol Hill.

      "sentences": "Boris and Brianna, we are expecting more than 150 people to be identified when these documents are unsealed. These are associates of Jeffrey Epstein as well as some alleged victims.This is all stemming from a court case that one of his victims, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, brought against Ghislaine Maxwell. That's Epstein's former girlfriend and longtime associate. She was convicted of helping Epstein groom and recruit women that Epstein had sexually abused. So this has been a long-running lawsuit. And now some of these documents are going to be unsealed. And it is a trove of documents. So these are -- it's not going to be a list of names that we will see when the unsealing happens, but it will be a lot of documents and a lot of names referenced in them. So the judge, in making this order yesterday, noted that many of those in this case, both John Does and Jane Does, do not object to their names coming out. Others' names have been in the public domain for years, either through media reports because they gave media interviews, or their names came out at the criminal trials. So some of these people, it's not a surprise we will see their names. Other people's names are being unsealed because, as the judge put it, they are not salacious details around them. But there will be a number of victims whose names will not be unsealed because there were minors at the time of this alleged assault. So while some of these names have been in public for a while, what will be interesting to see when this unsealing happens is just how they are referenced in these documents and what documents there are that exist and the context for this. Because a lot of Jeffrey Epstein's associates have publicly said they had nothing to do with the sexual assault and abuse. So we will be looking there to see exactly how these names are included in the documents and what it says about them. So the judge is giving all of the Does about 14 days to decide if they are going to appeal the ruling. If not, we could see these names being unsealed in all these documents by the end of the very beginning of next year - Boris, Brianna?",
