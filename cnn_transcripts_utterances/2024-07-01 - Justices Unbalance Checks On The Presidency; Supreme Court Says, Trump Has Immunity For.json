Just hours ago, the president of the United States charged American voters with doing what he said the justices wouldn't, stop Donald Trump from doing whatever he wants. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: Today's decision almost certainly means that there are virtually no limits on what a president can do. The power of the office will no longer be constrained by the law, even including the Supreme Court of the United States. The only limits will be self-imposed by the president alone.

Back in 1977, when Richard Nixon said, if a president does it, it means it's not illegal, he was wrong. Now, if he said that this morning, after the court's ruling, he would likely be right. The court, in a 6-3 ruling, dramatically expanded what a president can do without fear of legal consequence.The immunity is not absolute, but it gets pretty close. Writing for the majority, Chief Justice John Roberts said, with respect to the president's exercise of his core constitutional powers, this immunity must be absolute. As for the remaining official actions, he is also entitled to immunity. But the definition of what is official and thus immune from judicial scrutiny, is a Grand Canyon. Any discussions between the President and his Justice Department, like the ones that Trump had with Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, well, that counts as official, quote, readily characterized in light of the nature of the president's official relationship to that office, and even when those discussions concern a criminal conspiracy to undo the will of the voters. Now, Roberts foresaw how this decision would land, especially on the other side of the political aisle like an anchor (INAUDIBLE) the ocean floor. So, he cautioned against the dissents that, quote, strike a tone of chilling doom that is wholly disproportionate to what the court actually does today. Doom pretty accurately describes the forecast from Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor. She painted a picture of presidents entirely unbridled by virtue of these liberties to free to essentially act like Vladimir Putin, Hugo Chavez, goons of yesteryear posing as leaders. She wrote, orders the Navy SEALs Team 6 to assassinate a political rival? Immune. Organizes a military coup to hold onto power? Immune. Takes a bribe in exchange for a pardon? Immune, immune, immune, immune. Breaking tonight, Donald Trump wants his felony convictions in New York tossed. And he says the Supreme Court's ruling means that he was immune from prosecution when he conspired to silence Stormy Daniels. Also tonight, Joe Biden is working to restore Democrats' shaken confidence in him by putting a familiar message at the center of his campaign democracy. In a teleprompter speech that bore none of the miscues of that 50-plus million Americans saw on that CNN debate stage last week, Biden pleaded with voters to think of November as a choice, not between two old guys, but a choice between one who would put democracy first and one who would bring democracy to its knees.

But, by the way, the court has to decide what's unofficial acts, which means every time a court makes a decision now, particularly in Jack Smith's case that X, Y, and Z was not an official act, in theory, then Donald Trump can petition that all the way up to the Supreme Court again, because the Supreme Court left the definition open, which ultimately they're going to have to answer anyway.And so what you got out of this was, frankly, more questions than answers, but the answers we got were that a president of the United States can do whatever he wants and somebody like a Richard Nixon shouldn't have resigned because what he did by definition was legal even if he was breaking into the DNC headquarters.",

Probably the Supreme Court.I mean, I think it makes sense to say if the president is doing something on behalf of the entire country, like executing a war or like, you know, whatever those examples are, there is immunity with that. There has to be. But when he's personally himself trying to seize power from the American people, not on behalf of all the American people, but on behalf of a political party or his own ego, how could that be immune?

There's a presumption of immunity. However, prosecutors can step up and say, here's why that was outside of the scope. And I think the most important part of that decision by Chief Justice Roberts is when he said, this is not about former President Donald Trump. They have to look at the construction of the Constitution and say, we have to protect the power of the president. We can't be outcome determinative, which is what I think Justice Sotomayor is saying, this person is dangerous, but you can't formulate a decision in the Supreme Court trying to stop one single person, because that's going to last a long time.",

The Supreme Court is supposed to come up with a blanket decision that governs what happens to former presidents, whether they can be prosecuted for criminal offenses. And what this decision does is it leaves open, well, you can impeach a president for high crimes and misdemeanors. But now, there's immunity.And there's two kinds of immunity. There's absolute immunity for acts that are done when a president is engaging in his constitutional duties. That's reasonable. And I'm with you on that, Robert. But where I'm not with you is the second part of this decision, which gives presumptive immunity for official acts. This is a perfect storm for somebody like Donald Trump and who is the first and only president to be accused of these types of crimes. And so this is a case of first impression for the Supreme Court. But the court is now saying you have presumptive immunity. You can be presumed immune from criminal acts as long as you're engaging in your official capacity. So, what can Donald Trump do now with his January 6th charges? He can say what he's been saying from the beginning, although it's been a little bit subtle.

He says, it clears the stent from the Biden trials and hoaxes. He also says the Supreme Court totally dismantled most of the charges against me. Joe Biden should now call off his dogs.MATT WELCH, EDITOR-AT-LARGE, REASON: Yes, it didn't totally dismantle, but we're not going to Donald Trump for nuance. We're hopefully going to CNN and other kind of adult conversation for nuance. And part of that is that it was a mixed ruling, right. As a civil libertarian, when I hear more immunity for a president, I get hives. Of course you do. But also they did send a bunch of this back down to the lower courts. There are different categories of behavior that are explicitly covered and not covered with this decision. It doesn't have anything to do with Donald Trump's conviction in the case, no matter what he's saying tonight about who he's going to try to challenge it. It's not going to go anywhere. It's possible that of the January 6th related cases, there's going to be one that will be thrown out because of this, but the other ones might proceed. They'll just go a little bit slower. Part of the thing that I'm worried about here always is I don't really love Joe Biden's speech tonight, his teleprompter read tonight talking about sort of the courts writ large as being something to run against. Yes. you can always rally your base saying this, Republicans did this for years about the burger court and about the Warren court and everybody else. And the Democrats have been doing this for the last 10 or 15 years as well. But we want some civic institutions in this country. We don't want everyone to act like Donald Trump.
