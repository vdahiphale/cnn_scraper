      "sentences": "The nation has just moved one step closer to a government shutdown. House Republicans are expected to meet here in the next hour after their leader just suffered his latest defeat on the House floor. Speaker Kevin McCarthy's short-term spending bill voted down. He did not get enough Republican support.There is now less than 34 hours for a - for Congress to approve new funding. And while the Senate's short-term option is a bipartisan deal, it too is not likely to pass before the Saturday night deadline. A shutdown would freeze the pay for about 3.5 million federal workers and it would also impact air travel. It would impact tax return processing, food and workplace inspections, some child care and a whole lot more. We have CNN's Manu Raju on Capitol Hill for us. All right. Manu, you had been sort of bugging the Speaker about what his plan was after this 30-day short-term funding bill failed and it sounds like maybe you have some answers now. What's going on? MANU RAJU, CNN CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, he is indicating that he may give more information to his conference behind closed doors when they are poised to meet at 4 PM, Eastern, just in a matter - just within an hour or so. The speaker will - I asked him, \"Are you going to reveal your next steps today?\" He said, \"Well,\" and he said - he laughingly said, \"No, I'm going to keep it a secret.\" So suggesting that perhaps we will finally get a sense on what he plans to do. There have been a lot of ideas thrown up in the air, but it's pretty clear from talking to even his closest allies, they are in the dark about what the Speaker plans to do next. Now, this is all very significant, because depending on how the Speaker moves and where he - well, how he decides to go, it could either lead to a government shutdown, perhaps there could be an 11th hour deal to avert a government shutdown or perhaps there could be a challenge to his own speakership. This just happening moments after the Speaker still pushed ahead to try to get a Republican-only plan through the House to keep the government open for about a month, but that failed. I mean, the opposition from 21 House Republicans, mostly on the far right, who believed it didn't go far enough and cut spending. Democrats, on the other hand, voted against it because they believed it went too far in cutting spending and adding border security measures as well. Now that that is put to the side, what happens next means is the big question. The Senate is moving on its own track, though they are still slowly moving through the procedural hurdles to get to a final process, a final deal, potentially by Monday after the shutdown deadline. The Speaker has already said he opposes that Senate bill because it has - doesn't include issues like border security, also doesn't cut spending the way he wants and includes $6 billion in aid to Ukraine. So those are major issues they have to reconcile with the Senate, let alone figure out what he wants to do with the House. Now, if the speaker does move forward on a bipartisan deal, perhaps the only way out of this to get a bill out of the Senate through the House and signed into law by the president, if he goes that route, then he could face a challenge from the far right members who are threatening to oust him if he were to actually cut a deal with Democrats because one member could call for a vote seeking his ouster and that threat remains over the speaker, even as he has brushed that aside. So much riding on the Speaker's next move here. We'll see what he decides to tell his own members when they meet behind closed doors in an hour, Brianna?",

And it's a critical time, Brianna, because this is when they're - they've got a few four, maybe six, eight weeks left of good weather before the counteroffensive is going to be much harder for them to fight. This is a critical time for them to have that funding and those capabilities. So how long it's going to depend on what obviously Speaker McCarthy is able to do here. But any additional funding for Ukraine is going to be welcome. It's going to be used and we're going to appropriately apply it to getting them the capabilities that they need. But if we don't get it, one thing is sure that they won't be able to get the kind of capabilities they need to fight this counteroffensive and it comes at a critical time and it could really result in leaving Ukrainian forces high and dry as they're trying to reclaim, reclaim territory from Russian forces all throughout the east and south.",

And one of the things that they've done in California is to try and alter the way delegates get allocated there so that if somebody gets more than 50 percent of the vote, they win all the delegates. That's a savvy move. It has caused the DeSantis operation maybe to pump the brakes on going that far down the map.
