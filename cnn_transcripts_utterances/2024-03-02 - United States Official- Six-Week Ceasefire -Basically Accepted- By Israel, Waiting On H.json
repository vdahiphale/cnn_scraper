The U.S. has begun airdropping desperately needed humanitarian aid into Gaza. Three cargo planes dropped a total of 66 bundles today. They included mainly food but no water or medical supplies. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is in Washington. Paula Hancocks is in Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates, which is also been air dropping aid into Gaza. But Priscilla, I want to start with you, because we're getting some news around the possibility of a ceasefire. What are you hearing?",

We're hearing from senior administration officials here in the last hour, who share that Israel has, \"basically accepted\" the framework of a hostage deal that would include a six-week ceasefire. This would do two thingsNow, of course, this is all very sensitive. There are ongoing diplomatic talks that are happening today. But the resounding message from the senior administration officials was that the ball will here really is in Hamas's court. They are waiting to see if they can commit to the elements of this framework and how exactly it would be executed. Again, the idea here is to have a six-week ceasefire to get aid in hostages out. And then over the course of that says ceasefire, continue the talks for a more enduring plan. That's how one senior Administration official describe this. So, clearly, there is some movement in these talks that have been ongoing. We know that earlier in the week, President Biden spoke with leaders of Qatar and Egypt. And those talks will continue this weekend. But we are, at least again, seeing some type of movement here with Israel for basically accepting the framework, which is the way it was framed by senior administration officials. Omar.",

They, being the civilian. So, that factors into the White House seeing these airdrops as successful. Now, I will share some details that we have learned. It was 66 bundles that were dropped. This was done with the Jordanian air force. So, in total, this was about 38,000 meals, meals critical here. There was no food or -- I'm sorry, there was no water or medical supplies that were part of this airdrops. And again, they are monitoring the location of these air drops, and have seen civilians get those meals since they have been dropped. I will also note, senior administration officials say this is part of an effort to flood the zone as get food in there through these air drops and potentially maritime operations in the future.

      "sentences": "Well, it's interesting, Omar, because what we're hearing from humanitarian aid groups, at least some of them is a fairly damning idea of what it will achieve.Now, clearly any aid getting into Gaza at this point is important when you have the United Nations warning of famine, certainly in parts of north Gaza that could happen if humanitarian aid does not get there quickly. [13:05:08] But what they're saying is that this is really a drop in the ocean. One called it a band aid measure, a two word to relieve the guilty conscience of some countries. So, really what they want to see is the U.S. putting more pressure on Israel to open up more crossings between Israel and Gaza, to allow more to go through by land across these crossings. The aid is there, it is waiting. We know it is woefully inadequate the actual amount that is allowed into Gaza. And we've also been hearing from U.N. agencies on the ground, and other humanitarian groups that they do not have the ability to move this aid around. They are restricted by the Israeli military. We also heard from one U.N. group saying that they were fired upon by the Israeli military. So, while air drops are one element of this, and we have seen in many cases in the past, they usually a last resort effort to try and get this any kind of aid into the area. It's certainly, not the ideal way we're hearing from these groups, especially when it comes to the distribution. We saw what happened last Thursday, when thousands of desperate hungry people were flooding, humanitarian aid trucks, desperately trying to get some kind of food that ended after Israeli fire as well with more than 100 people being killed. So, what's this humanitarian groups want is to see the distribution being monitored as well, which you simply can't do when it comes to airdrops, but the U.N. and many groups are calling for more access, they are calling for more cooperation from the Israeli military to be able to get to where they need to go to.

Priscilla Alvarez, thank you both.I want to dive a little deeper into this, because even as the U.S. becomes the latest country to airdrop aid into Gaza, there are growing questions over how Israel controls the overall flow of aid into Gaza. Our chief and international investigative correspondent Nima Elbagir has this exclusive report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIMA ELBAGIR, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Pallets of food aid with messages of love, air dropped into Gaza for a desperate population. This is a Jordanian flight with more countries looking to join the aid effort, among them, the U.S. But this isn't a good news story. On the ground, a glimpse of how much more is needed to keep starving Gazans from falling into famine. Air drops are inefficient and expensive. You just can't drop enough food for a starving population. To stave off famine, you need thousands of trucks filled with food flooding into Gaza. But that's not happening. We were granted rare access to this warehouse in Jordan, one of the key waypoints for aid, now a chokepoint.",

It's for Israel to open up the crossing, use the Kerem Shalom crossing at its full capacity. A thousand trucks could go through there a day, and 500 were prior to October 7th. And yet, we have hundreds and hundreds of trucks lined up in Egypt, waiting to cross into Gaza, with the food and supplies, which still are nowhere near enough to meet Gaza's growing needs.

And after they fired at him twice, then they tased him while he was on the ground. And if that wasn't enough excessive force, instead of rendering any care and treatment and aid immediately, they handcuffed him behind his back. You'll see that the third officer appears to kick Isaac. This is not reasonable treatment for anybody, let alone law enforcement. And so losing a family member, losing a son, losing a brother is hard enough. To have it done at the hands of those that take an oath to serve and protect and then handle him with such disregard after they shoot him in the heart is devastating.

Fail to answer the family's questions as to why they were even in his apartment without his consent. Why they shot an unarmed man.
