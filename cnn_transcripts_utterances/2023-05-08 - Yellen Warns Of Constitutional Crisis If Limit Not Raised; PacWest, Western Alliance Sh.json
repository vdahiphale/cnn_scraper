As you can see the Dow Jones sitting just down 0.1 percent. Those are the markets and these are the main events: The US Treasury Secretary warns of catastrophe if Congress fails to raise the debt ceiling by the end of the month. The EU proposes an 11th round of sanctions against Russia. And US proposes new rules requiring compensation for flight delays and cancellations. Live from Dubai. It is Monday, the 8th of May, I'm Eleni Giokos. I am in for Richard Quest, and this QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. A very good evening. And tonight, the U.S. Treasury secretary says Congress could trigger a constitutional crisis if it fails to raise the debt limit. Janet Yellen says the US government could run out of money as early as June 1st. It is also running out of time to fix the problem. President Biden is set to meet Tuesday with congressional leaders from both parties, 43 Senate Republicans have vowed to block any deal without spending cuts. In an interview on ABC's \"This Week,\" Yellen said there are no good options if Congress can't reach an agreement. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JANET YELLEN, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY: There is no way to protect our financial system and our economy, other than Congress doing its job and raising the debt ceiling and enabling us to pay our bills and we should not get to the point where we need to consider whether the president can go on issuing debt. This would be a constitutional crisis. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And both parties, the Democrats andRepublicans have stood firm in their positions and just weeks away from that June 1st date, they are still digging in. Just a couple of weeks ago, we saw President Biden issue a veto threat for the House Republican proposed debt ceiling legislation. So, that already gave us an indicator that the administration was not budging on this. In fact, the White House position has been that there should not be any caveats or adds to this debt ceiling, they should pass a clean debt ceiling bill. But as you noted earlier, just ahead of this meeting, we saw now that 43 Republican senators have vowed to oppose raising the debt ceiling with without \"substantive spending and budget reform.\" So that is sort of the mood going into this meeting tomorrow with these four congressional leaders as both sides who look at this differently; Republicans saying that they need to make changes and Democrats saying we need to pass a clean debt ceiling bill. Now as to what is on the line, well, that includes seven million jobs, recession and economic contraction and a spike in interest rates impacting credit cards, among other consequences. So this is top of mind for the White House here this week and going into tomorrow, just as it is on the Hill. But this is really reaching a fever pitch as we're just weeks away from a date where the Treasury may need to consider what bills it can even pay.",

I just don't see that happening. You know, in the absence of a really bad economic scenario, perhaps, you know, something related to the debt ceiling, or more likely, if we were to see some really serious fallout from the tightening in credit conditions that has followed the banking turmoil over the last couple of months, you know, perhaps worst case economic scenario would bring the Fed to swing in the other direction.

So for PacWest for example, as you pointed out, it's the dividend, right? The bank announced that it was cutting its dividend. Typically investors don't like to hear that from a company, but in this example, it seemed more so as an example of financial responsibility as the bank sort of tries to shore up and hold on to capital. But take a look, not all of the regionals are taking part in what appears to be a rally. PacWest is up, Western Alliance is up. Comerica is up. New York Community Bank, not up. But if you look at the larger banks, the big, big banks, those are all up as well. Part of the reason why is perhaps the selloff was overdone. I mean, JP Morgan is up about half a percent, let's call it. Wells Fargo, almost two percent, and Citigroup let's call it one-third of a percent. So part of the concern here was that maybe it was overdone. Maybe the selloff was overdone, and things weren't actually as bad as expected. We've also gotten some analyst notes, including the one that I'm holding here from JPMorgan, which actually upgraded its outlook on the sector from neutral to -- from negative rather, a more bearish to neutral saying that, look, for some of these regional banks, deposit balances have stabilized and that for some, they actually had a pretty decent quarter. So maybe it wasn't as bad as many were expecting.

And so I think there is a certain level of humility in the market now in terms of further contagion, but I think you make an excellent point, which is the concerns in terms of lending, right. I mean, we've already seen some of the banks start to raise their lending standards as they hold on to more capital as they perhaps not lend so freely. It was already restricted to begin with, but as they start to pull back, and that certainly has implications in terms of profitability, but it has enormous implications, Eleni, in terms of the consumer, right? You have to imagine, for example, if a small business wants to take out a loan to expand its business, to increase its hiring, to expand, right, sort of the American Dream. Well, suddenly if that becomes harder, if they can't get a loan, all the sort of ripple effects that has on economic growth. And so there are certainly considerations to keep in mind in terms of the banks and their bottom lines and profitability, but it also has enormous implications for the US economy and consumers at large.",

But tomorrow, marks May the 9th, Victory in Europe Day effectively, the victory over Nazis, which is in the Soviet era, was a celebration right across the Soviet sphere. That is no longer going to be a celebration, it is not here in Ukraine, according to President Zelenskyy. He is actually going to rename it Europe Day and make today, a day upon which all veterans are remembered. But there are big parades scheduled for Russia tomorrow and I think that would be intended to try to boost Russian morale, that is not great. It's not good on the frontlines. There are a lot of fractious activity on the internet, on social media, a lot of criticism coming from the likes of Prigozhin, the leader of the Wagner mercenary group, of the Ministry of Defense in the Kremlin, the Russian Ministry of Defense and their prosecution of this whole war. So in that context there, I think the Russians have been digging in though they have been preparing defenses, they know or they think they know that this much vaunted Ukrainian offensive may come anytime in the summer as soon as the ground dries out, for example, as soon as the weather makes it easier for heavy armor to move.

So, this is kind of a U.S. copy of what's happening in Europe, but doesn't appear to be as strong.",

The first quarter earningscame out and among major U.S. airlines only American Airlines had a profit and it was a tiny profit. You know, a lot of people think airlines are out there making billions of dollars. They're not. U.S. airlines tell me they can't really afford to pay compensation on the one hand. And on the other, you know, they will say, look, a lot of these delays and cancellations. They're not our fault. The United States doesn't have enough air traffic controllers, you have a lot of issues with bad weather. And sometimes it's just not even clear. Is it the airline's fault or is it air traffic controller's fault?",

Willairlines find a loophole to sort of decipher and define what a controllable cancellation is? That comes to question as well. And generally, you know, the definitions, the rules around this are going to be fascinating. And I'm also assuming that they would probably pass on the cost if it becomes a lot more expensive.",

And the interesting thing is the Department of Transportation actually had a press release this morning in which theysaid for the first time, they will define what a controllable cancellation is. And just for the viewers, this is kind of what it sounds like. It's something in the airlines control. So, weather or air traffic control, not in the airline's control and not controllable. But sometimes, you know, it'd be 9:00 at night and maybe a plane was delayed because of weather at 6:00 that morning. And the question becomes, you know, whose fault does it become 13 hours later if the plane has been late all day? These are very difficult things to answer.",

And I just couldn't believe the way the airlines responded. What does this mean for consumers down the line? I mean, this -- I guess it is a step in the right direction. And as Biden said, there's a correlation between, you know, compensation, and airlines taking accountability for delays versus the amount of delays that you see.",

Butthe Biden administration also said something else interesting this morning. They said when they took over in Washington, none of the major U.S. airlines guarantee travelers that they would provide them a hotel when there was a controllable cancellation. So sometimes, if there was a mechanical delay, you'd get a hotel, sometimes you wouldn't. There was no official policy. But now, the Biden administration has leaned on airlines and said you should do this. It's still voluntary. But the Biden administration said this morning, that of the major U.S. airlines only one, Frontier Airlines won't provide a hotel for a controllable cancellation. So, it is a step in the right direction, even here in the United States.",
