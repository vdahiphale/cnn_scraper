In Texas, the state's attorney general is facing an impeachment vote. Ken Paxton is accused of bribery and abuse of power. The conservative Republican says the impeachment is illegal and being pushed by corrupt politicians, he says. In Washington, meantime, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy says progress is being made in talks to avoid the nation's first-ever debt default. A short time ago, a source familiar with the intense discussions says it is now down to one final sticking point between the White House and Republican leaders. The issue -- at issue at this hour is work requirements for social safety net programs. Let's begin our coverage of the debt talks. CNN's Manu Raju is up on Capitol Hill for us. Manu, just being told that it's down to one issue is cold comfort. I mean that one issue might be the one thing that just drags this thing out. What are you learning about the state of the negotiations at this hour?",

On Thursday a unanimous vote from a GOP-led committee adopted 20 articles of impeachment against Paxton including bribery and abuse of public trust. But in floor debate this afternoon, impeachment opponents are pushing back hard. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN T.

They were asking questions like will we be able to have access to the actual evidence that the committee obtained? Will they have access to witnesses? Will they be able to ask witnesses questions? Will they actually be able to see the evidence and analyze it for themselves? Now, the answer so far that we heard from the House Speaker is no and also from the chair of the House Investigating Committee. The answer is no. And that House Committee members also did not have access to those witnesses. In essence, the process that they explained is that this House Committee hired individuals, lawyers, to conduct this investigation and then they received the results. Those results were presented in that committee hearing that you described this past week and then the articles of impeachment, excuse me, were adopted by this committee. Now there's a lot of politics flying around. There are different factions of the Republican Party in the state of Texas and we're seeing some of that on display. Take a listen.

Impeachment opponents are attacking the process. It sounds like some of these Republican House members are trying to sort of maybe carve out a path for them to resist this impeachment of the attorney general. What are you picking up on? What's your sense of things right now? SCOTT BRADDOCK, EDITOR, \"QUORUM REPORT\": well, first of all, I would not expect Rosa to get a response from the office of the attorney general. They have been pretty tight-lipped with the media, unless they're calling us all liberals or calling Republicans who are going after them liberals. In the floor proceedings this afternoon, you're hearing something that we had reported over last 48 hours at QuorumReport.com which is that the attorney general has been personally calling some of the members of the House and trying to get them to vote no on the impeachment articles today. I don't know that that's going to be successful. Based on everything I'm hearing, Jim, I would expect a super majority, that 100 members of the Texas House, out of 150, to support this when they do vote on it here.

I would expect that the speaker will probably have maybe a half of the Republican caucus, which would put this over 100 votes, maybe as much as 120 votes or something like that. I would say this too. For some of the arguments that are being made against the impeachment today, when comparing this to a grand jury that would be making an indictment, of course, you've been covering the multiple legal problems of former President Trump and his experience with grand juries. I'm not an expert on grand juries in other states but in Texas, anybody who's indicted, they almost never get invited to speak to the grand jury that indicts them.

What is new is that that boy might finally have some accountability coming his way and it's coming in the form of people in his own party saying this guy is corrupt and he needs to go. Now, I do think he's going to be impeached in the House this afternoon, or this evening, depending on when they vote. What's going to happen in the Texas Senate -- that's a whole another question. But it is interesting that Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick who presides over the Senate, Texas is unique in that respect, the lieutenant governor is the presiding officer of the Senate.

Number two, he's not doing well in the polls. Right, if you want to beat the champ, you have to put the champ on his back.

And he has written a couple of books about it. So I think we have to take him at his word and see his actions in Florida, which you know, has really become a laboratory of right-wing policies in a way that it just was not before. His Republican predecessors were not comfortable not only pursuing policies that could be seen through such an ideological lens, but also pushing the boundaries of what a governor could constitutionally do.

      "sentences": "Yes, that's right. I am told by two sources familiar with the matter that President Biden and Kevin McCarthy, the speaker of the House, are expected to speak in the next hour.Why is this significant? Because it comes at a critical time in these negotiations. The president and the speaker have left most of the negotiations to their negotiating teams respectively and they have carried out most of the talks. The president and the speaker have had some conversations but they have not had many. This could be a pivotal one because at the moment we have known that there have been some key sticking points they have tried to resolve. It's unclear whether they have been finally resolved. But there is a furious push to try to get this deal locked down tonight in order to release the text of this bill to raise the national debt limit. It includes a range of conditions that have been demanded by Republicans to unveil that bill as soon as tonight in order to get it on the House floor as early as Tuesday and try to get it through the United States Senate over a matter of days in order to avoid the first ever debt default by June 5th. So this phone call, according to two sources familiar with the matter, Kevin McCarthy and Joe Biden, could determine whether or not there is a deal tonight. Or they have more work to do as the two sides are trying to lock this down and avoid that default and then try to get the votes on Capitol Hill to get this enacted -- Jim?",

Priscilla, what is the White House saying about whether or not we might have a deal and the significance of this conversation that they're expected to have in the next hour? One thing that's on my mind, and Manu has been talking about this, and you have as well, there's been a lot of focus on what the House Republicans are going to do. If the president gives away too much -- and I'm not saying he is -- but Democrats may balk at this, I suppose. We don't have a strong indication of that but that's one of the uncertainties at this point. What can you tell us?",
