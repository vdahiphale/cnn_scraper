Those are the markets and these are the main events. President Biden unveils a new plan to curb the cost of key prescription drugs. We'll hear from the CEO of pharma giant, Nova Nordisk. Spain's government is piling on the pressure on the disgraced head of its football federation to step down. And news outlets like CNN and \"The New York Times\" are cutting off ChatGPT from accessing its content. Live from Atlanta, it's Tuesday, August 29th. I'm Lynda Kincade in for Richard Quest and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. Tonight, US president, Joe Biden says he is going after pharmaceutical giants with a plan to make them lower the price of prescription drugs. These are live pictures coming into us just now. He spoke in the last hour at the White House, and earlier today his administration released a list of the 10 drugs whose prices will be subjected to negotiation. Medicare, the US government-run health care program had previously been barred from negotiating drug prices. The list of drugs include popular blood thinners and diabetes medications and this change aims to save Medicare  $25 billion a year by 2031. Mr. Biden said Americans are overpaying the drug companies. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Germany, the next highest spender pays over $300.00 less per person. Much of the cost there is covered by insurance, so government health programs. People in the US have the highest out-of-pocket expenses. Our correspondent, Jeremy Diamond joins us now from the White House. And Jeremy, it is no secret that Americans pay more for prescription drugs than most other wealthy countries, on average, twice as much.

It's about reducing those out-of-pocket costs that patients pay, including $3.4billion in out-of-pocket costs for just these 10 drugs that are now going into this drug-price negotiation program over the last year. That's how much Medicare recipients have spent on those drugs. But it is also of course, about savings for taxpayers more broadly, and bringing down the deficit, which this program will deliver $98.5 billion in savings over the next 10 years of its implementation. And so we have a list of 10 drugs that treat common conditions from heart disease, cancer, diabetes, autoimmune disease that are all the first batch of these drugs that are going to be negotiated by Medicare. These negotiations are going to take place over the next year, but these new prices won't actually take effect until 2026. In the meantime, though, every year, 15 more drugs will be added the next two years, and then 20 more drugs in subsequent years. And so obviously, significant for those seniors who have struggled to pay their prescription drug cost. The president framed it as such today, but there is no question that there are still some possible questions that lie ahead about the viability of this program amid challenges.",

FIFA has suspended him temporarily for 90 days while this is being resolved, and now of course, the prosecutor here in Spain has opened a criminal investigation into allegations of sexual assault. But we haven't heard anything from Rubiales since Friday when he refused to resign very defiantly. We've asked the Federation for a response. We've tried to get in touch with him but we have had no response from him on that. And meanwhile, the demands for him to go keep on going. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SHUBERT (voice over): Winning the World Cup wasn't just a victory for Spain, but a celebration of how far women's rights had come, all undermined by the boorish behavior of Spain's football chief, Luis Rubiales grabbing his crotch in victory next to the Spanish Queen and her 16-year-old daughter, and the forceful unwanted kiss he planted afterwards on player, Jenni Hermoso. Rubiales said he made a mistake, but called the kiss consensual; Hermoso said it was not and felt violated. In places of power, protesters and officials say Spain still has deep pockets of chauvinism. In Madrid, hundreds heeded the knee to rallying cry of Spain, \"Se Acabo\" meaning, it is over, enough with the crotch grabs, the unwanted kisses and the chauvinism as Spain's Deputy Prime Minister Yolanda Diaz told CNN, the country has moved on. (YOLANDA DIAZ speaking in foreign language.) SHUBERT (voice over): \"The structural sexism and the violence that they have had with a player like Jenni Hermoso is intolerable in a democracy,\" she said. \"We are dealing with a person who is a victim of sexual assault and far from having protected her, what they have done is to continue to violate her rights. And yet, Rubiales refuses to resign. (LUIS RUBIALES speaking in foreign language.) SHUBERT (voice over): He argues that Spanish football has profited under him. Since he became president, he has increased the federation's budget nearly fourfold to more than 400 million euros. And what would have been his crowning achievement, Spain's bid for the 2030 World Cup along with Portugal is now in jeopardy, sports official say. Even before this year's World Cup, the Spanish women's team had complained about the team culture. Late last year, 15 team members resigned in protest over the way the team was run by their coach, who was supported by Rubiales. Only three returned to play in the World Cup. Their complaints might have been swiftly forgotten had it not been for Rubiales' own behavior. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Even though a lot of these sites have articles that are in front of the paywall and visible to the free public, you can't really pull massive amounts of data by hand, you need to set up a tech infrastructure tool to be able to scrape them consistently. Now, this isn't totally new. In the search era, when we first started to develop Internet search engines, we developed similar scraping tools to be able to search all the web's contents for you know, basic platforms like Yahoo and Google. A similar thing is happening here, but the difference is, in the search era, publishers had something to gain from this. They had traffic that they could be gained, if they showed up high in search engines, and they could monetize that traffic with ads. The challenge with the artificial intelligence era is that there is not an equal quid pro quo. That's what publishers are fighting for now. Essentially, they're blocking these companies from being able to access their data, because they want to be able to leverage that access for money or for something in return.",

Now, it's also worth remembering that outside of news organizations, including Axios and \"The New York Times,\" et cetera, you have large tech platforms that are also trying to shield themselves from the likes of OpenAI and Google's Bard.

But of course, you mentioned the risk. If a journalist like myself has their data consistently scraped. One, you post copyright risk. But then the other is that you pose the risk of these ChatGPT platforms being able to mimic your writing style, being able to write in your tone and voice, that is my IP or journalist IP or media companies' IP that's valuable that then anyone could access. So it does pose a pretty serious business threat.

The other thing that they're trying to do is get ahead of it by making sure that they create standards within their newsrooms, about how they can be using these platforms. So for example, the AP, which is sort of a worldwide leader in leveraging artificial intelligence and news gathering, put out a lengthy list of standards just a few days ago explaining where they can and can't be using these types of platforms.

We're not allowed into the cemetery, but there are all of these security guards actually members of the National Guard, and there are these armed sort of snipers outside the various perimeter points as well.

I just want to show you the closest we can get though, to the grave site, because if you come a bit over here, you can look through the branches over there into the middle of this quite small cemetery and you can see a Russian flag, you can see some flowers there that are have been arranged and there is a very simple wooden cross, which you may not be able to see now, but that's Yevgeny Prigozhin's gravesite. It is actually right next door to where his father was buried as well and that's obviously one of the reasons why this cemetery was picked.
