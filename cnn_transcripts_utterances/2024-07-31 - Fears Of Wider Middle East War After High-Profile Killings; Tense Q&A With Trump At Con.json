Because it sends a very strong signal to Iran who they say, and Prime Minister Netanyahu made that very clear when he was speaking here in Congress just over a week ago that Iran was behind it, behind all the proxies, the Houthis, Hamas, Hezbollah, et cetera. So this sends a very clear signal to Iran the day that its new president was inaugurated.

In fact, as we've reported, the co-chairwoman of the NABJ Conference stepped down from her role after they had extended this invitation to Donald Trump and Donald Trump had accepted, though it was very clear to everyone there at the conference and to Donald Trump and his team that this is going to be a controversial kind of panel. Now of course, the big question is why he decided to do it in the first place, and one of the things I was told by the campaign was because he wanted to reach out to minority voters. There has then a big push from Donald Trump to try and reach Black voters, particularly Black men voters, as well as Latino men voters, and this was part of it, but the other thing to keep in mind here, Richard, is that Donald Trump has really been out of the spotlight for about a week-and-a- half and there is some mentality around Trump that no publicity is bad publicity. And I can tell you that Kamala Harris' now rival has been seizing the media narrative. Now, there is going to be a term because there is a lot of fixation on what he said. He made some White out-there comments talking about her ethnicity, questioning her ethnicity, attacking an ABC reporter who was asking legitimate questions. So what this actually looks like moving forward, of course, we will wait to see, but I spoke to one senior adviser before this event who told me this of anything Donald Trump has done in the last several months has the most potential to go sideways, and I think it was very clear from what happened, objectively that it went sideways and pretty quickly.",

And I will tell you that there were many on Donald Trump's campaign and allies of his, who actually were angry about Republicans bringing that up immediately, saying those comments about a DEI hire because they thought that they wanted to keep that out of the narrative around Kamala Harris. They were hoping to tie it just to Biden's administration policies. Donald Trump dove right in. Again, he had an opportunity they to say, no, I don't think that, and instead, not only did he not say that, he went on to say that she turned Black. She is the first Black vice president of the United States of America, who is running for president.

EL-ERIAN: It could and today, we got a number out of Europe that showed inflation went up from 2.5 to 2.6 percent. It could, but you know, Richard, it is a balance of risk right now, and I think the bigger risk and more and more people are agreeing on this is that the economy will weaken unnecessarily if they do not cut.

EL-ERIAN: Yes, and I would put that risk at about 35 percent, so yes, the risk is there. Look, what you want to avoid is what you're hearing from the companies, whether its PepsiCo, whether its Starbucks, whether its McDonald's, they're all giving you the same message that the consumer is weakening, the low-income households in particular are under significant pressure.

I think that is a real phenomenon; two is that the US exceptionalism will continue. That's why you've seen the rotation. That's why you've seen the Russell do so well, best month of the year at a time when the NASDAQ was having the worst month of the year, so that's been quite a rotation.

EL-ERIAN: So I think the biggest difference between the two, Richard, is what they are talking about on tariffs. Tariffs on trade: President Trump has a much more aggressive stance than Vice President Harris on that. So that I think is where the major differences. Against that, there is a view that Trump would be better for deregulation.

It isabsolutely anticipated by the way that there will also be some kind of strong response or retaliation, not just from Iran, but also from Hezbollah along that northern border. And he is trying, Netanyahu that is, to frame this conversation along different lines. Not about what's going on in Gaza, not about the hostages, but as a war against the so-called axis of resistance which is Iran and its various proxies and militias that are fighting, not just Israel, but also the U.S. in various countries around the region. So whether that's out of a desire to keep this war going and ensure his political survival, whether that's out of a genuine belief that this is the bigger threat that needs to be dealt with, that this can provide some kind of an effective deterrent, we really just don't know at this stage, Richard.

I think that's why you're seeing this stock pop after this report. Here are some of the highlights that I noted in that vein. We saw daily active people on Meta's apps growing 7 percent year over year. Average price per ad, which is really key indicator for this business growing 10 percent year over year. And then Meta did also show better than expected revenue guidance for this current quarter. So we're seeing this core business performing and, you know, perhaps being able to account for and accommodate for all of these investments that the company is making in artificial intelligence because we are seeing at the end of this quarter many analysts are asking big questions of all of the big tech companies. When are we going to start to see returns from the tens of billions of dollars that you're investing in AI.
