      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to all our viewers watching around the world. I'm Anna Coren live from Hong Kong.Ahead on CNN Newsroom, six months since the October 7th Hamas attack on Israel. Now we wait to see if Israel will allow aid to enter Gaza via the Erez Crossing to help ease the humanitarian crisis there. Another grim milestone, Rwanda marks 30 years since the genocide that led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Tutsis. How the date is being remembered. And one of our top military experts we frequently speak to has just spent the week in Ukraine. We'll get his assessment of the war as Kyiv urges its allies to step up their support. Hamas says it's sending a delegation to Cairo today for ceasefire and hostage talks. Sources tell CNN that the directors of the CIA and Israel's intelligence services will also be there. Sunday is a milestone in this conflict, six months since the Hamas attack on Israel that led to the war in Gaza. Well, Israel could allow aid to go through the Erez Border Crossing in the coming hours where you can see the Erez Crossing in Northern Gaza on this map. Israel has also said it will allow more aid to flow through the Kerem Shalom Crossing. So far, most aid to Gaza has gone through the crossing at Rafah. Well CNN, Senior International Correspondent Ben Wedeman joins us now live from Beirut. And, Ben, any sign that this desperately needed aid is in fact going through.",

      "sentences": "No sign yet as far as we can tell here from Beirut, Anna. But yesterday, the Israeli cabinet did approve the supply of humanitarian aid through the Erez Crossing and also first through the port of Ashdod nearby.Now, it's one thing to approve it, it's another thing to actually make it happen. And we know that as a result of intense Israeli bombardment of the northern part of Gaza, particularly the area around the Erez Crossing, that many of the roads have been severely damaged or are completely impassable at this point. So, it's one thing to approve it, it's another thing to actually make it happen. Now, we've heard from the U.N. that the Israelis have said they will allow the reopening of 20 bakeries in the northern part of Gaza and are also reopening water supply lines that have been cut since the 7th of October. The question is, of course, for instance, with water, the pipe system in Northern Gaza has probably been severely damaged as well. And if you reopen bakeries, if you can't resupply them, what good can they actually be? So, I think the coming days are going to show how, in reality, the humanitarian situation can be improved in Gaza. And also keep in mind, Northern Gaza is the most severely hit. The southern part of Gaza near the Rafah crossing is somewhat better supplies. And I stress the somewhat part of that. But northern Gaza, the situation, by all accounts, is desperate and that aid needs to get in as quickly as possible. Now, according to some reports, we're seeing, the Israelis have agreed to double the amount of trucks carrying humanitarian aid from Jordan from 25 to 50. But there as well, those trucks are headed to the southern part of Gaza, not to the north. Anna?",

And it's important to underscore that this is against the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. It's not against the war. The majority of Israelis, a large majority of Israelis, according to all the opinion polls, continue to support the war in Gaza. Many feel that the Israelis have not been strong enough in pursuing Hamas and, in general, conducting the war in Gaza, but it's against the prime minister himself.Now, what we saw as a result in some of these demonstrations is that there were arrests and, in fact, there was an incident where a 71- year-old man in Tel Aviv rammed into a group of demonstrators leaving at least three injured. So, these demonstrations definitely underscore the vulnerability of Prime Minister Netanyahu. They underscore the desire of many Israelis to see a change in leadership. However, they do not indicate any desire at this point to end the war in Gaza. Anna?",

But the U.S. and Israeli officials are staying in close touch and preparing around the clock for this potential attack that U.S. official described as, quote, inevitable. Now, it could unfold in multiple different ways, and it's unclear when exactly would happen. Officials anticipate that it would target U.S. or Israeli assets in the Middle East. Now, President Biden and Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu talked about this in their the phone call was a major point of discussion, and, of course, the top concern for the administration is that if there is a direct strike on Israel by Iran, that it could rapidly escalate an already tense region, and the White House has been trying to avoid a broader regional conflict.
