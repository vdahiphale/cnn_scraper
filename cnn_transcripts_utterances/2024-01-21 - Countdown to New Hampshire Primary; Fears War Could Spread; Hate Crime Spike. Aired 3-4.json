I'm Paula Newton.Ahead here on CNN Newsroom, two days until the New Hampshire primary and the Republican candidates are making their pitches as we near the finish line. Fears that the Israel-Hamas War could spread in the region. Iran now saying it will punish Israel for a missile strike in Syria. And an alarming rise of hate crime in Canada. Both Muslims and Jews fearing they could be targets because of their religion. And thanks for joining us. We do begin here in the United States as the presidential race becomes increasingly bitter with just two days to go before the New Hampshire Republican primary. Now, former President Donald Trump remains the front runner overall, but his lead in the state has shrunk. According to a recent CNN poll conducted by SSRS, former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley has surged in recent months and has cut Trump's lead to single digits. On Saturday, both ramped up attacks against each other as they made their final push to the voters. Haley questioned Trump's mental fitness after he appeared to confuse her with former U.S. House Speaker and Democrat Nancy Pelosi. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT:  By the way, they never report the crowd on January 6th. You know, Nikki Haley, Nikki Haley, Nikki Haley, did you know they destroyed all of the information, all of the evidence, everything? Nikki Haley is in charge of security. We offered her 10,000 people, soldiers, National Guards, whatever they want. They turned it down.",

She is hitting former President Trump in a more distinct way than we have seen her do previously, questioning his mental fitness after he had a gap at a campaign rally where he confused her and former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and also going after him for the ads that he has put on the T.V.s here in New Hampshire, saying that they're full of lies, trying to correct the record when it comes to what her positions are on gas tax and Social Security.But former President Trump is campaigning with Tim Scott, senator of South Carolina and the governor of South Carolina, also this weekend. And, of course, that isn't a great thing for Nikki Haley. She is from South Carolina. Her campaign, for their part, says that they are not focused on racking up endorsements that they claim don't matter. They're focused on a strong showing in New Hampshire. They're not defining exactly what that means. They're also focused on beginning to compete in South Carolina, announcing that they will be investing $4 million in a media ad buy in South Carolina starting just next week.

And this year, we went from quite a crowded field at the beginning of the campaign season to basically two candidates left, Nikki Haley and Donald Trump.It's also the case that Trump remained sort of outside the regular campaign. He didn't do any of the debates that the Republicans had this year. The other thing that's interesting is that Trump came to New Hampshire. He didn't do that in 2016, except for some sort of airport visits, big hangars where his fancy plane pulled in and there would be rallies. And he didn't need to come here in 2020, but he started coming a few times this summer and he's been here in the winter cold several times. And that feels different as well. It seems as if his campaign has two things in mind. First of all, let's put this away early so that he can get on to positioning himself vis-a-vis Biden.

Coverage begins right here on CNN at 1And to the Middle East now as the U.N. secretary general says opposition to a two-state solution is quote unacceptable. Antonio Guterres tweeted Saturday that the right of the Palestinian people to build their own state must be recognized by all. His comments come after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu again poured cold water on any notion of a Palestinian state. He posted this on social media Saturday, quote, I will not compromise on full Israeli security control over all of the territory west of Jordan, and this is contrary to a Palestinian state. Now, as CNN reported earlier this week, U.S. President Joe Biden came away from a phone call with the Israeli leader saying, quote, there are a number of types of two-state solutions possible. Now, there are fears, meantime, that the Israel-Hamas War could be spilling over to the rest of the region. Iran is vowing to punish Israel for this missile strike in Syria that killed five members of its Islamic Revolutionary Guard who were on a military advisory mission in Damascus. Iran's president is calling the strike cowardly. Israel is suspected of being behind the attack but Israeli officials are not commenting. In Iraq, meantime, Iranian-backed militias have claimed responsibility for an attack that injured Americans on the Al-Asad Airbase. It's not clear how many Americans were hurt.

Now, we heard from the U.S. side, from Central Command, that they did have injuries. They haven't given us a number at this point, or specified exactly how serious those injuries were.

So, they put their differences aside to focus on the war effort.So, it's not surprising that there are some differences of opinion within that war cabinet. And, of course, as far as Israeli society goes, poll after poll has shown that if there were elections held tomorrow, Prime Minister Netanyahu and his Likud Party would be out on his ear. So, those are some of the divisions internally going on. But, of course, we did hear from Prime Minister Netanyahu last week, so, as you say, an uncompromising tone, reiterating really his long-held stance, which is that there can be no two-state solution in this instance, saying that this is because Israel must retain security control effectively from the river to the sea. Now, that prompted a number of responses. We had the E.U.'s top foreign policy chief saying that perhaps a two-state solution might need to be imposed on the parties because they're unable to agree to one by themselves. Then we had this phone conversation between a private phone call between President Biden, they hadn't spoken in weeks, and Prime Minister Netanyahu. And CNN reported that as part of that conversation, Biden saying that Netanyahu didn't preclude the possibility of a Palestinian state in some shape or form. But in response to that, the prime minister's office coming out and saying, well, actually, Israel is going to have to maintain security control again from the river to the sea. And then we've had those comments from the U.N. secretary general posting on X saying that the refusal to accept the two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians and the demand of the right to statehood for the Palestinian people are unacceptable. And it's worth noting as well that, of course, there are divisions in that war cabinet and indeed we heard from Gadi Eisenkot, who technically is an observer of the war cabinet, but he's taking part in all these meetings, and, in fact, lost his son who was fighting for the IDF in the Gaza Strip, saying not only is defeating Hamas not going to be possible, which is Prime Minister Netanyahu's main priority, and Netanyahu says that is possible, but he also says that fresh elections need to be called, Paula.

      "sentences": "President Biden's phone conversation with Prime Minister Netanyahu on Friday was the first time that the two men had spoken in nearly a month, and it did occur against the backdrop of these growing divisions between Biden and Netanyahu. They had been lingering for some time, but certainly are becoming more pronounced over this issue of what will happen in Gaza once the war there ends.And President Biden is certainly a staunch supporter of an eventual Palestinian state, the two-state solution that has long underpinned American policy in the region. But a day ahead of the phone call, Prime Minister Netanyahu had become increasingly public in his rejection of that idea, saying that the imperative for Israeli security contradicts the eventuality of Palestinian sovereignty. And so this phone call was an important moment for the two men to discuss this issue. And we are told by people familiar with the matter that it was a serious conversation and a detailed conversation. And in fact, President Biden emerged afterwards to say that he thought it was still possible for an eventual Palestinian state to emerge, even with Prime Minister Netanyahu still in office. And he raised the idea of a demilitarized Palestinian state, a state without a military. This is an idea that's been discussed for decades. And, certainly, President Biden sounded intrigued by this as a possibility, so certainly still optimistic on that front. But then on Saturday, we did hear from Prime Minister Netanyahu's office, who said that in his conversation with Biden, he reiterated his policy that after Hamas is destroyed, Israel must retain security control over Gaza. And they say that that's a requirement that contradicts the demand for Palestinian sovereignty. So, certainly, the divides between these two men, certainly very apparent and ongoing. I can tell you that President Biden and many of his aides inside the White House are growing frustrated that Netanyahu appears to be more public in his rejections of American proposals and American ideas as he comes under increased political pressure inside Israel to secure the release of hostages and to be more clear about the strategy in Gaza. So, certainly, it does appear as if this will be an ongoing question between the two men as this conflict proceeds. Kevin Liptak, CNN, traveling with the president in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware.",

The winter weather alerts are in effect from Florida to Montana and from the Pacific Northwest to the Northeast.As for the snow, high pressure has driven out most of it for the bulk of the country. That's with the exception of some lingering snow along the Great Lakes. But what's already on the ground will stick around for a bit longer. Now, there's word out of Iceland right now that the latest volcanic eruption there has ended. But that assessment is doing little to calm the nerves of people who flood their homes in the nation, often referred to as the land of fire and ice. Michael Holmes has our report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MICHAEL HOLMES, CNN ANCHOR (voice over):  Days after the latest in a series of volcanic eruptions threatened the Icelandic fishing town of Grindavik, residents are still being kept away. Last weekend's red hot lava flow reached the outskirts of the 4,000-person town, setting three homes ablaze. Fortunately, no one was harmed since residents had already evacuated for the second time since November. It's the fifth eruption on the Peninsula of Reykjanes since 2021.",
