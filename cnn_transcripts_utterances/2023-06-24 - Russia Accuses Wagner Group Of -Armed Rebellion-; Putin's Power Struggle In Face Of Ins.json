I'm Michael Smerconish in Philadelphia.President Vladimir Putin accusing the Wagner mercenary group of an armed rebellion and warns that those involved will be punished. This after Yevgeny Prigozhin, Wagner's leader, vowed retaliation against Russia's military for what he says was an attack on a Wagner camp and killing a, quote, \"huge amount of his men.\" Prigozhin, a longtime ally of the Kremlin claimed that his troops have taken control of military facilities in the Russian cities of Voronezh and Rostov-on-Don without firing a shot. One Russian general, Vladimir Alekseev, went so far as to call it a coup d'etat, but Prigozhin denies carrying out a military coup. The FSB, Russia's Internal Security Agency announced a criminal investigation of Prigozhin and urged the Wagner fighters to, quote, \"stop the columns and detain their leader.\" In an address to the nation Putin said this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRES. VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIA (through translator): I repeat, any internal turmoil is a mortal threat to our stated to us as a nation. This is a blow to Russia, to our people. And so our actions to defend the fatherland against such a threat will be severe. All those who deliberately chose the path of treachery, who prepared an armed mutiny, who chose the path of blackmail and terrorist methods who will face inevitable punishment. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Remember, he was the key impeachment witness who'd been on President Trump's call with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and then raise the alarm that Trump appeared to make us aid contingent on an investigation of Joe Biden and his son Hunter. He's also the author of the best-selling memoir \"Here, Right Matters.\"Colonel, many are still getting up to speed. So let's go over the basics. Who is Prigozhin? LT. COL. ALEXANDER VINDMAN (RET.), FORMER EUROPEAN AFFAIRS DIRECTOR, NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL: Prigozhin is a convicted criminal, and frankly, a closer associate of Vladimir Putin. He is somebody that's basically made his fortune catering to the armed forces of Ukraine, oppression, catering to the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, as well as running a private military company for more than a decade. He also runs a probably the most kind of well known and prominent disinformation platform that was used to interfere in U.S. elections. He's a longtime, kind of a partisan for Putin, and quite effective with regards to this kind of, you know, disinformation and coups because he's been very instrumental in some of the unrest in Central Africa.",

They had some autonomy, but they relied heavily on Russian support, Russian munitions, Russian, you know, kind of transportation, assets, logistics. So they were at arm's length, but they were kind of integrated.Over the course of this -- over the course of probably, you know, several different confrontations, they've distanced themselves and frankly, been ostracized by the Ministry of Defense as Prigozhin has been increasingly critical of Ministry of Defense Shoigu, of the Chief of the General Staff Gerasimov and other senior leaders. So, it's -- to me, I've always perceived there can be just kind of distant extensions of the state, but certainly clearly over the course of months. And this war, they've become increasingly difficult relations and they've separated, they've done their own different ways. And Prigozhin and Wagner have become increasingly radicalized.",

      "sentences": "So, my initial thought is that he's likely -- he was likely looking to replace the Minister of Defense Shoigu and the Chief of General Staff Gerasimov for incompetence and effectively running the war. Still serving Putin's interest, still, you know, basically being the good lieutenant, going after those people in Putin's inner circle that have failed him, the folks that have been providing false reports. That to me -- there's a precedent for, you know, lieutenants going after folks that have failed the king, in this case, that being Putin. But something else something has been evolving.I think the fact is that that Prigozhin has felt a sense of impunity with his actions. He's been given an enormous amount of rope, I think Putin felt there was some utility in Prigozhin attacking Shoigu and Gerasimov for not doing enough. But with that rope, Prigozhin became increasingly emboldened? I think that the objectives are shifting. Now, it's clear that Putin is targeting Prigozhin directly. He's saying he's saying that Prigozhin is going to face consequences, the Wagner or folks that follow them are going to face consequences. It has now become an existential threat for Wagner to extract major concessions from the Putin regime in order to survive. So this is now transitioning from, you know, what I defined as an insurrection for the first roughly 24 hours to a coup, where Prigozhin is going to be fighting for his survival, and he's no longer going to be serving as a good lieutenant to Vladimir Putin. Potentially, he's looking -- he might be looking to seize power. It is early days, it is shocking what's occurred. To me, this is a huge surprise, I was not surprised at all by Russia's war against Ukraine. I thought this is -- this black swan event kind of fringe possibility that something like this could happen, most likely from Prigozhin, but it's happened and things are unfolding extremely quickly. One thing I can say is the biggest beneficiary of all this is Ukraine. Ukraine is going to have enormous opportunities. It's going to have -- it's going to be facing a completely incoherent Russian response. From the strategic standpoint, Russia has distracted with defending its own territory. It's shocking, you know, in -- Russia is losing a war and opening up a second front on its own territory, not a very, very effective strategy for winning the war in Ukraine. So, Ukraine is likely to make huge gains, probably fight unopposed. There's some early reporting that Ukraine is going to be -- is already making big games based on the absence of a coherent response from Russia. We'll see how this unfolds, but Ukraine is going to be a huge beneficiary for the unrest.",

It says, \"We are monitoring the situation and we'll be consulting with allies and partners on these developments.\" Now, as you mentioned, the White House is actively watching what is unfolding in Russia. We know as of last night that President Biden had been briefed on the situation.But the administration is being careful and cautious as to when to weigh in here as this is a rapidly evolving situation. Now we also know that as of earlier this year, American officials had determined that there had been a power struggle between the mercenary Wagner group and the Russian government. And they believed at the time that those tensions would mount. Now, over the course of the last few months, they have collected intelligence and I've been assessing that. And so, now we are seeing this power struggle play out in real time. But it indicated already that this was on the radar for the White House, and something that could have ramifications for the war in Ukraine. Now, of course, a key part of that statement I just read to you is the discussions with allies and partners. And we just received a statement from the State Department that said that Secretary of State Antony Blinken has discussed the situation in a call with G7 allies and E.U. counterparts. And in that call based off the statement, the Secretary reiterated the U.S. support for Ukraine saying that will remain unchanged. So clearly there are talks that are happening behind the scenes as this situation is unfolding. Now as far as the White House, we have asked for any additional information on what conversations the President may be having, we have not heard anything yet. But you can imagine that this president which has been in touch with allies over the course of the war in Ukraine would likely want to talk to those partners in the region as this historic power struggle unfolds.",
