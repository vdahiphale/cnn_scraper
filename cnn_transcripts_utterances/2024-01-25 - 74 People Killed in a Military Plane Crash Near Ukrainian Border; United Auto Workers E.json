Moscow is accusing Kyiv of downing the military plane in the Belgorod region, calling it a terrorist act. Russia claims 74 people were on board, including 65 Ukrainian soldiers being transported for a prisoner swap, and all of them were killed in that crash and you can see the plane hurtling toward the ground before it erupts in a ball of fire behind some buildings.Two Russian officials claim the aircraft changed course to quote, avert danger to civilians in a nearby village. Russian state media released this video of the crash site showing debris scattered across a snowy field. Ukraine says it regards any Russian military aircraft approaching Belgorod as a legitimate target but he's not confirming that it shot down the plane. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): It is obvious that the Russians are playing with the lives of Ukrainian prisoners, with the feelings of their relatives and the emotions of our society. It is necessary to establish clear facts as much as possible, given that the plane crash happened on Russian territory that is beyond our control. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This is the moment the Russian military transporter plunged from the skies. And I witness gasps as a huge orange fireball billows from the ground. Russia says the aircraft was shot down and while Ukraine hasn't confirmed it, this Russian border region is an active war zone. I was clearing the snow when suddenly there was a loud bang, says this Russian eyewitness on local TV. There was an explosion in the sky, he says, and I got scared. Across the frozen crash site near the Russian city of Belgorod, twisted metal debris is strewn across a wide area, along with human remains. Ukraine says the plane had a cargo of missiles heading to the front lines. But Russia insists. The aircraft was carrying 65 captive Ukrainian soldiers en route to a prisoner exchange. CNN can't independently verify either claim. I feel pity for everyone, says this Russian woman who saw the plane go down. My own grandson is fighting in our special military operation, she says. And all of those on board probably had people waiting for them too. In recent weeks, Ukraine has been stepping up attacks across the Russian frontier, hitting an oil terminal near St. Petersburg with a drone strike last week. They are taking out a strategic Russian long- range radar detection aircraft flying near the border. In the Russian-controlled city of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, local officials say at least 25 people were killed last weekend in a Ukrainian bombardment. Meanwhile, on Russian state television, commentators have condemned the latest shoot down, saying it was Ukrainians killing their own. [03:05:06] This was yet another premeditated criminal act, which does not surprise us, says this former Russian general. It's now routine behavior, he says, by the Kyiv regime. But Kyiv says if Ukrainian prisoners of war were on board ahead of an exchange, as Moscow claims they were not informed that Russia may have deliberately put their lives in danger.

It says the strike may have been Hamas' fire. (VIDEO PLAYING) Israel has intensified its military offensive in and around Khan Younis, the second biggest city in Gaza. Palestinian health officials and paramedics report Israeli tanks and drones firing at people trying to flee the area around two besieged hospitals. Many of those forced from their homes have fled to Rafah, which the U.N. now says is crowded with 1.3 million displaced people. U.S. military officials say Houthi rebels in Yemen fired three ballistic missiles at commercial ships operating around the Red Sea on Wednesday. U.S. Central Command says a nearby Navy ship shot down two of them and the third missile landed in the water. They say the missiles were aimed at a US flagged, owned and operated container ship in the Gulf of Aden. No one was injured and the ship was not damaged. But the Iran-backed Houthis say they engaged with a number of U.S. warships and claimed to inflict a direct hit on a commercial vessel.

These are some ministers that sit in the wider cabinet. They are not involved in military decisions and their statements should be dismissed because they are made for internal political purposes.Now, the war cabinet itself, after about 110 days, is getting to the point where it realizes that the two goals that were set for this war, the first was to destroy Hamas militarily, and the second was to bring the hostages home, are no longer compatible. In other words, by pressing Hamas, we are not creating an incentive for them to release the hostages, and therefore Israel's in a dilemma. And it has to decide, do we want the hostages as the top priority, or do we want the war as the top priority? And this is splitting not just Israeli society, it's splitting the war cabinet.

And then because of these internal divisions, and especially if we cannot return the hostages home, you will probably see Gantz's party leaving the war cabinet.This will leave Netanyahu with a razor-thin majority that is based on the more extremist and fanatical parties in the Israeli government.

Once the military operation is successful, and that's an if, somebody has to step into the vacuum. If not, Hamas will come back.Netanyahu does not want the Palestinian Authority to step into this vacuum. After all, for many, many years he has weakened the Palestinian Authority and actually strengthened Hamas because that helped him move any talk of a two-state solution away. The United States definitely wants the two-state solution on the table, and this is an issue that is splitting Israeli society down the middle, although, as I said, Netanyahu opposes this. And, he will probably use this for internal political reasons. He can campaign in Israel as he is the only one capable of stopping a Palestinian state from being established. And this puts him at further odds with the United States as the U.S. heads towards an election. And although an election in Israel is years away, if the government's majority begins to collapse, we could have an election here quite soon, maybe at about the same time as the United States. The other question you asked about humanitarian issues, let's remember, and we really have to always put this war into context. It began by the butchering of 1,500 Israeli civilians. The Israeli military does not target civilians. We are doing the best we can. But Hamas is a terrorist organization embedded in the civilian population, and therefore we will do the best that we can, but you cannot do everything when their goal is to have you hit their own civilians so they can whip up more support against Israel.",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MICHAEL FAKHRI, U.N. SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR ON THE RIGHT TO FOOD: Every single person in Gaza is hungry. One quarter of the population is starving, and famine is imminent. We've never seen a population go hungry so quickly and so completely. And the reason is, first of all, humanitarian aid is being blocked. It's not reaching people in Gaza quickly enough and to an adequate amount. It's just trickling in. Second, to follow up on your point, the food system is being destroyed. What we know is that Israel has destroyed 22 percent of agricultural land in northern Gaza, and as Israeli forces move south, they're destroying more and more agricultural land, greenhouses and orchards. 70 percent of fisher boats have been destroyed, so people don't have access to the sea. And this is a longstanding problem. This is -- there was a sixteen-year blockade sold dozens were experiencing food insecurity before the war so is already a precarious situation and civic infrastructure has been destroyed. People don't have the necessities of life, their homes are destroyed, hospitals are destroyed, all civil infrastructure is being destroyed. And you combine all of this and this is why we have this profound risk of famine in a way that we haven't seen before. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

On Wednesday, French lawmakers discussed a bill that would enshrine a woman's right to an abortion in France's constitution. The measure is backed by President Emmanuel Macron, who recently promised that, quote, women's freedom to have an abortion will be irreversible. CNN's Melissa Bell is in Paris with more on France's abortion debate. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MELISSA BELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A heartfelt cry on the streets of France.

SARAH DUROCHER, PLANNING FAMILIAL (through translator): With what happened in the U.S., there was a strong reaction in France by politicians. Several laws were proposed and the Prime Minister came to see us here at family planning to tell us how worried she was about the right to abortion. BELL (voice-over): A right as hard won in France as it was elsewhere. The procedure only legalized in 1975 after a battle led by the lawmaker and then health minister Simone Veil, a woman speaking to a parliament of men. SIMONE VEIL, THEN-FRENCH HEALTH MINISTER (through translator): This is an injustice that must be stopped. BELL (voice-over): Now France is looking to go further, making abortion a constitutional right. EMMANUEL MACRON, FRENCH PRESIDENT (through translator): This will enshrine the freedom of women to choose abortion and to be a solemn guarantee that nothing will ever limit or abolish this right because it will have become irreversible. BELL (voice-over): Among those supporting the move, the singer Barbara Pravi. Her own experience of abortion at 17, so traumatic that she wrote a song about it.",
