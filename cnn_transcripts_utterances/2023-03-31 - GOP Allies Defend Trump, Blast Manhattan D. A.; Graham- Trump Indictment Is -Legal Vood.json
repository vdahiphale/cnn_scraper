Jim Jordan calling this outrageous, Jim Jordan calling it a witch hunt, Elise Stefanik saying this is unprecedented election interference, in her words.But that is not what all the members have been saying, including Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell has not said anything so far. Neither has Senator John Thune, the number two Republican in the Senate. Both of them have been quiet on Donald Trump as they have been eager to move past the Trump era, and they do not want to be pulled into the fray on this at the moment. But House Republican leaders, on the other hand, view Donald Trump very differently. Kevin McCarthy has credited Donald Trump for winning the speakership on the 15th ballot and others are making clear that they will go even to New York City to defend Donald Trump. One of Donald Trump's closest allies in the House Republican Conference tweeted this morning that she is actually going to go up to New York to protest. That's Marjorie Taylor Greene saying, \"I am going to New York on Tuesday. We must protest the unconstitutional witch hunt.\" And the Republican leadership has been eager to try to say that they are supporting peaceful protests, not any other any protests that could become violent. They, of course, had to say that in the aftermath of the Donald Trump himself suggesting there could be death and destruction in the wake of any criminal prosecution. So they are contending with Donald Trump's rhetoric here. Some aligning themselves with Trump and others staying quiet. Abby?",
