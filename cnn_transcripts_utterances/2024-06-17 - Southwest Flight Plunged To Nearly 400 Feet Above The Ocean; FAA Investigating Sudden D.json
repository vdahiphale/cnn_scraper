Pilots simply outclassed by the busy problem unfolding ahead of them in the cockpit.

That was a single fatality, a freak incident, when a fan blade came off of an engine on a Southwest Airlines flight and killed the passenger sitting next to it. There has not been a fatal crash of a commercial airliner in the U.S. since 2009. The Colgan air crash that caused major reforms across aviation, changed the way the pilots were trained, changed the experience requirements for them. There's been really, really significant change here in aviation, and no real significant issues that have followed. The big thing here is to separate these incidents out into a few different buckets. The Southwest door plug blow out back on January 5, that was a Boeing quality control issue. So many of these other issues really are simply pilot error issues, and they come to light, in part, because we report on them, because that is why we are here, we're the fourth estate, but also because there're just simply more people paying attention to these things.",

Also, happening this, Israel's Prime Minister disbanding the war cabinet on the heels of Benny Gantz's resignation and the Military announced a tactical pause along southern Gaza, while continuing that Rafah offensive. Firefighters are struggling to contain wildfires in northern Los Angeles just the latest in a month of extreme weather across the world. And the U.S. Surgeon General calling for warning labels on social media platforms as a social media fueled mental health crisis grows amongst teens. Well, stock markets in New York will open about 30 minutes from now, and taking a look at the futures markets, if there are any indication, this will be a relatively mixed open today. Well, just hours ago, Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu disbanded Israel's six-member war cabinet according to an Israeli official. The cabinet was formed just days after the October 7 terror attacks by a mass. Now, this comes as the Prime Minister expressed frustration over a new IDF policy of a daily tactical pause to allow more aid into Gaza. The Israeli military spokesperson has just given CNN a direct explanation about that new plan, saying, it was introduced to allow the movement of aid, but that the fighting never stopped. Also, today, U.S. envoy, Amos Hochstein, has arrived in Israel to try to defuse tensions along the border with Lebanon, and UN issues a new warning about the prospects of a wider conflict. Right. Let's start with the logistics of that. Tactical pause, Paula Hancocks reports from the Israeli side of the Kerem Shalom border crossing where she spoke to the IDF spokesperson. Have a listen.

They also said, there's more than 1,000 trucks on the other side, just inside Gaza, that is waiting to be distributed. Now, the IDF has announced this tactical route, which will be from 8 AM to 7 PM. And, it will be a safe road from the Kerem Shalom crossing, they say, and up the Salah al-Din Road, which is the north south artery in Gaza. Now, we have spoken to international aid groups to the UN within Gaza about this. And they have said that they have used this route before, they're not sure what's new about this passageway. But, their concern is the lack of police, the lack of law and order within Gaza itself. So, it is very dangerous for them to be able to come and pick this aid up. It's something I asked the IDF spokesperson about. Are you going to escort these trucks, the military will escort them?",

The issue is, from -- from these international aid organizations point of view, is that, it has become extremely dangerous within Gaza, the fact that the lawlessness is one of the issues, of course, the fighting as well. So, they can take the fighting away from that one particular route. But then you still have the issue of trying to keep the humanitarian aid groups safe, being able to protect that aid, going in. And that's really the crux of it at this point. Now, we've had heard from the Gaza media office saying that as far as they're concerned, there is no tactical pause, they can still see the fighting, they call it, quote, Israeli lies. But, the IDF was quite clear that the fighting would continue in tandem with this. So, there will still be the fighting in Rafah, which is very close to where we were today and very close to where this -- the aid is supposed to be getting to. And what we did see was the Israeli Military was really putting the onus on the UN, the onus on the international groups to be able to distribute this aid, despite the fact that there is this -- this lawlessness within the Gaza Strip at this point, saying that they will work together to come up with solutions. But of course, eight months in, those solutions presumably should have been talked about a little earlier. Becky?",

So, it's effectively a two-person war cabinet now. So, it's not unexpected that, that would be disbanded. Of course, the question now is, who makes the decisions on the day-to-day running of the military strategy in Gaza, for example. Now, an official within the Prime Minister's office said, that, that will be done within the security cabinet. So, a wider cabinet now, rather than the war cabinet, and he will -- the Prime Minister will convene smaller groups, if necessary. Now, the assessment from some is that this was to try and prevent the far right elements of his coalition from -- from filling the void, if you like, filling the vacuum in that war cabinet, which would have been a difficult situation, and not very popular with certainly the international community and the Biden Administration.

And that is an important message to send to people like Marjorie Taylor Greene, who just, a couple of weeks ago, tried to oust speaker Mike Johnson. She too is close with former President Donald Trump, cares deeply about what his views are, cares deeply about staying in the fold with former President Trump. So, this sends a signal to some of those conservatives and his ranks, that, he is still aligned with the President, that the President has his backing. It is also clear, though, that, they want to make sure that they are all on the same page ahead of the election, because so much of the future of what former President Trump is going to be able to do, if he wins in November, is going to hinge on whether or not Republicans keep the House of Representatives and whether or not they take back the United States Senate. Without those two chambers in Congress, it really would significantly limit what Trump could do, even if he's able to win. So, they want to make sure that they have a unifying message going into November. They want to make sure that everyone's on the same page. And they want to try to get rid of any message that's out there that the Republican Party is in disarray, or not unified, going into November. Becky?",

That is because the U.S. Surgeon General is calling for urgent action to help protect young people against harm from social media use. In the New York Times op-ed on Monday, Vivek Murthy demanded Congress put warning labels on social media apps just like there are for alcohol and chocolate. For example, let me let me say that again, alcohol and cigarettes, of course, there are not warning labels on chocolate bars. He called the mental health crisis among young people an emergency, and said, social media is a major contributor. Speaking on NBC, Murthy said, labels would help remind parents and adolescents that social media has not been proven safe. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VIVEK MURTHY, U.S. SURGEON GENERAL: Not only have companies not demonstrated that their platforms are safe for kids, but there's growing evidence of harm, but warning label would help parents to understand these risks.

We haven't yet seen legislation introduced along these lines. So, we're going to have to see how Congress reacts to this call. But, the Surgeon General this morning, citing data, showing that as of last summer anyway, according to Gallup, kids were spending almost five hours per day on average, using social media. He also cited, a study from the journal JAMA Psychiatry that showed that kids who use at least -- social media for at least three hours a day, have double the risk of mental health problems, like, internalizing problems and showing symptoms of anxiety and depression. He also noticed almost half of kids, say that, social media makes them feel worse about their bodies. And so, in this op-ed this morning, he says, it's time to require a Surgeon General's warning label on social media platforms stating that social media is associated with significant mental health harms for adolescents. Now, he says, this would be something that at least would let parents know that this could be a risk for their kids. He said, the data are imperfect right now. But, it's an emergency and he thinks action is warranted. And this really harkens back to 1965 when we saw that warning label go on cigarettes.",
