      "sentences": "Hello, again, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me this Sunday. I'm Fredricka Whitfield.And we begin with this breaking news. Moments ago, the US Senate in a key vote moved one step closer to passing a bill that would provide tens of billions of dollars in assistance and military aid not just for Israel, but also Ukraine and Taiwan. Also today, President Biden held a call with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and it comes as Israel says it is preparing to move into the Gazan city of Rafah where more than a million Palestinians fled for safety. There are fresh concerns of bloodshed and a deepening humanitarian crisis if Israeli forces move in. And for the second day in a row, US forces strike Iran-backed Houthi targets as it tries to keep ships safe in the crucial Red Sea corridor. We've got a team of reporters tracking all of these breaking news stories here at home and abroad. CNN's Jeremy Diamond is live for us in Tel Aviv with the latest on Israel's looming ground offensive and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza; and also at the White House, let's begin with CNN White House reporter, Priscilla Alvarez. Priscilla, President Biden held a call with Netanyahu today, and what did they talk about?",

      "sentences": "That's right, Fredricka. We are actually learning new details about that call over the last hour.Senior administration official saying that call lasted about 45 minutes. Two-thirds of it was focused specifically on the release of hostages. They have been working around the clock to hammer out a framework that works for all of those involved to release hostages, but also includes a humanitarian pause. Now, the senior administration official said that while there has been progress, there are still \"significant gaps.\" They would not go into what those gaps are, but clearly, while they're trying to signal progress, there is still a long way to go and as the senior administration official said, they're trying to capitalize on where officials are. Of course, senior US officials have been deploying to the region to work on this deal, but nothing is done until the very last minute. These of course are very sensitive and delicate. But the other big part of this phone call between the two leaders was also what you were just describing there, that ground offensive, in Rafah. It was very clear in this call with senior administration official that there are real concerns here at the White House about any type of offensive that goes into that region where millions have been displaced and have been holding there with nowhere to really go as there has been destruction in Gaza. So those were two key areas of concern and focus in this 45-minute call between President Biden and the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. This official was also asked whether the two discussed that over-the- top comment from President Biden last week when he was describing the ground operation in Gaza, they did not specifically address that according to this official, but they also stressed that the two are going to remain in close contact moving forward.",

This is what he said though, listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I mean, you're hearing it not only from countries in the region that don't have formal diplomatic relations with Israel, like Saudi Arabia for example, which said there would be serious ramifications for Israel, serious repercussions for Israel conducting such a military operation, but also from its allies in the region.The United Arab Emirates, Egypt, as well expressing serious concerns, and of course, and the United States as well saying that it would be a disaster for Israel to carry out this military operation without serious consideration to the civilian population in Rafah. And so that is why it is also so significant to see the Israeli prime minister, yes, on the one hand acknowledging there will need to be something done about the civilian population before that military operation can be carried out, but really doubling down on the need and importance in his view of carrying out this operation in Rafah, effectively saying that if that operation is not carried out, that that would mean handing Hamas a stalemate or a victory in this four- month war now in Gaza. But we do know that in the background of all of this, of course, there are those ongoing negotiations over a potential ceasefire. Hamas delegation was in Cairo late last week meeting over this and we expect that on Tuesday, there will be another major meeting in Cairo. So those talks progress and perhaps that could be the only thing that would forestall this imminent ground offensive in Rafah, which could be very, very disastrous for so many civilians there. WHITFIELD: And Priscilla, back here in the US, there has been a lot of backlash against the Biden administration's continued support of Israel. The vice president's team has been trying to reach out to members of the Arab-American community, but then they're facing major obstacles. In fact, a meeting that was supposed to take place tomorrow was abruptly postponed, so what now?",

This is a listening session that was planned to move forward. It was one in which there have been a prep session last week with staff members and participants to make this happen, and it fell apart at the last minute, all of which speaks again to what the White House is having to navigate here, which is pressure at home as they try to support Israel and also get that assistance into Gaza.",

And now, the former president faces a deadline tomorrow to file a request with the US Supreme Court to put the case on hold. He would then have 90 days to ask the court to reconsider the appellate court's decision. Joining me right now is former White House counsel for President Nixon, John Dean.

And I also just want to point out, Fred, the context of these remarks. It comes as many Republicans in Congress are pushing against more aid to Ukraine and also as many European leaders are warning about Russia's increased aggression on the continent.

You know, you can't get enough of that artist and then you see them everywhere and it's so great.Okay, so you also had a chance to talk to some of the other performers during super bowl. Reba McEntire is going to be singing the national anthem. Post Malone will be singing \"America, the Beautiful.\" Andra Day is going to be singing the Black national anthem, \"Lift Every Voice and Sing.\" So, what did they tell you about any butterflies they have or how excited they are to be a part of all of this? ALEXIS: I think for all three of them, they are just feeling very excited and honored to be delivering the songs. I talked to Andra Day about the fact that the Black national anthem is something that people who look like me have been singing since we were little kids, but there are still so many people who have never heard that song. She pointed out that you know, it originated as a hymn, so it's a very powerful and important moment and she feels very lucky to be, I think, only the fourth person to ever get to perform it.

PHIL SIEGEL, CO-FOUNDER, CENTER FOR ADVANCED PREPAREDNESS AND THREAT RESPONSE SIMULATION: Yes. As the video showed, we are in uncharted territory. It is complicated even more not just by what you can do with this technology, but by the laws we have and the protections of the First Amendment. Satire is protected. People can claim they are just illustrating points when they put different types of advertisements out there. And so, by the time any of these things can be tracked down and so forth, they have already traveled and had their impact. And so, it is going to be a very difficult time.
