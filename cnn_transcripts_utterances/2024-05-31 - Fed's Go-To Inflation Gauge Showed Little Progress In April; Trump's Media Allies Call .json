      "sentences": "Well, Boris and Brianna, inflation still seems to be sort of stuck, not as bad as that nightmare from two years ago, but not back to normal yet either.Now, today's report is the PCE inflation data. And there was a lot of different indicators out there. We follow this one closely because it's the one that the Fed uses to determine whether to lower or increase interest rates. And it found that, month over month, prices were up by 0.3 percent. No improvement there. The big number is year over year, 2.7 percent. Again, no improvement from the month before. And when you look at the trend, which is really important, you can see that two things really stand out, right? One, inflation has gotten a lot better than the middle of that chart. That was 2022. The other thing, though, that stands out is that this progress of late has really stalled out. And 2.7 percent inflation, where we are now, that is well above the 2 percent that the Fed is targeting. Now the good news from this report is that, when you zoom in, core inflation, which excludes food and energy, that did improve on a monthly basis ever so slightly. But we need to see more of that improvement. Because look, we know Americans are fed up with the cost of living. The fact that life just costs so much more than it did two and three and four years ago. And look, the Federal Reserve is trying really hard to coax inflation back down, right? They've lifted interest rates. We've got 7 percent mortgage rates. Credit card rates are near record highs. But sort of like a stubborn toddler -- and I'm not going to name any names, you know who you are -- but sort of like a stubborn toddler -- (LAUGHTER)",

I mean, you had a moderate governor of -- a former governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who's running for the Senate in Maryland, a really blue state. And the real possibility that he can turn a blue seat, red, and maybe give the Republicans control of the Senate, a pretty important thing.

We saw then, the rhetoric can actually turn into action. And action can turn into violence. So when you hear people talking about going after top Democratic officials, when you hear them talking about not complying with the rule of law, I think it has a different meaning, a different resonance, and a different fear factor, if you will, than it did three years ago.",

And one of the concerns, I think, is that is that Donald Trump 2.0 isn't going to go, as he did in the beginning of his first term, for the respectable, the Rex Tillersons, the Jim Mattises, the H.R. McMasters. He's going to pick people -- because he knows how the system works now, he's going to pick people who will tow his line and follow his orders. And under those circumstances, I think the question of guardrails becomes much more in doubt. SANCHEZ: And to your point about how much things have changed in a relatively short amount of time, somebody that didn't toe the line, Mike Pence, who certified the results of the 2020 election, today came out and basically said that this was a corrupt proceeding.
