This is a decision that the Kremlin warns, quote, \"Throws oil on the fire\". And it's one that the U.S. resisted for months, fearing that it could further escalate the conflict.A U.S. official says the weapons are intended to be used primarily in Russia's southern Kursk region where thousands of North Korean troops have joined Moscow's offensive to push Kyiv out. The authorization coming as Russia unleashed a second missile attack here in two days on the Ukrainian city of Odessa. CNN Chief International Security Correspondent Nick Paton Walsh is in London with the latest on this. Nick, talk to us a little bit about this decision because it has been a long time coming.",

And so instead we've seen an increase in what intelligence officials have been calling the asymmetric response of Russia. There have been suggestions that Russian intelligence may have been behind some courier packages that have detonated or almost detonated around Europe. And it may indeed be that in time, future we see some suggestions that these internet cables on the bottom of the sea may have been tampered with by somebody.

So it has a range of about 180 to 190 miles, 13ft in length, first used in the Gulf War. And basically it's been in service since that time until the present day. So when you look at it and, you know, it is here seen in flight, this is basically a short to intermediate range artillery piece. And what it can do is it can do all kinds of things that really affect this area right in here. So we're looking at the border between Russia and Ukraine and you can see what it can actually reach right here. So these are one of the key things to note here. In addition to Kursk, which is the area that the Ukrainians have occupied or at least part of right there, you can also see the area of Belgorod.
