I'm Jim Sciutto.Right now, investigators searching for a motive in the deadly nightclub shooting in Colorado Springs that killed five and injured more than a dozen others. This morning the suspect, Anderson Lee Aldrich, remains hospitalized as court documents show he faces both murder and bias-motivated charges. We're also learning new details about the victims. Derrick Rump was a bartender at Club Q. His sister says he loved the community there. Daniel Aston was a bar supervisor. A co-worker said he was the best supervisor anyone could have asked for. Ashley Paugh's family said she had a huge heart and was big on family. Kelly Loving's sister says she was a wonderful person, caring and sweet. And friends of Raymond Green Vance said he would go out of his way to help anyone. The father of Raymond's girlfriend was at the club that night and helped to take down the gunman. Richard Fierro spoke with CNN about those terrifying moments. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And, for me, that was like, there's a handle, I'm getting it.So, I ran across the room, grabbed the handle, pulled him down and then started to -- well, actually, I think I went for his gun with him.

And then, with the AR, he - we -- I told him, push the AR, get the AR away from him. The kid pushed the AR. I don't know what his name was.

And I just started -- I found a crease in his -- between his armor and his head and I just started wailing away with his gun. And then I told the kid in front of me, kick him. Keep kicking him.

There were all kinds of challenges to how you describe them and what things qualify a weapon in the assault weapons ban. But, nevertheless, it had the effect of limiting the number of high-capacity semiautomatic weapons, shoulder-fired weapons that were in circulation.

So we really don't know how decisions were made around that.The Colorado red flag law is -- it works when a family member or a cohabitant or a police officer proactively file the requisite paperwork and go before a judge and make the argument that someone should not have a -- access to a weapon. There's nothing that I'm aware of that requires a red flag law kind of inquiry anytime someone is brought in, you know - it's not clear to me from this situation whether that guy was subjected to a temporary restraining order or any sort of mental health evaluation. Even if he was, it's not clear that there's a requirement of a red flag consideration when there is a TRO or a mental health evaluation. So, it's entirely voluntary.

This is the first court hearing since his appointment and he is not going to be here in-person today but he is personally approved all of the arguments that prosecutors are going to make today before this appeals court as they try to remove what has been a significant obstacle in their investigation, and that is the requirement that a third party review all of the documents that were seized from former President Trump's Mar-a-Lago home back in August.Now, former President Trump requested this review because he argued that privileged material may have been caught up in that search. Now, a lower court agreed and appointed a so-called special master to review 22,000 documents, but they are continuing to push back on this. As you noted, it's been a while. It's been a long appeals process. But the key issue here, Jim, is we know that the former president uses delay as a very successful litigation tactic. And there are concerns about how long this investigation will go into the 2024 presidential cycle. You may remember on Friday when Smith's appointment was announced the attorney general said, look, this is not going to slow things down. I talked to sources who know Smith. They say this is a guy who's not going to dawdle, who's not going to sit on things. He'll move as quickly as he can. But if they can remove this special master, that will help them move a lot faster. Now, some good news for the prosecutors is the fact that this court has already granted them an exception, a carveout to that requirement, allowing them to at least investigate classified materials. And so this is a big test for this new special counsel who just inherited two of the most politically high profile cases in the country.",

So, listen, it shows that these threats were real if he had to be moved to an undisclosed location. What kinds of threats, who do they come from, and why did they take them so seriously? MAEVE RESTON, CNN NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER: Well, what we've learned so far was basically that it was a very specific threat on social media that led the sheriff to put him under their protection. It was just for that one night of Election Day. But, I mean, what it says in Arizona, which has been ground zero for all of the election denialism and misinformation that he's pushed back against so much, is that is very much still alive and well here. And the spokesman also told our Kyung Lah that so many of the threats against election workers, there's been an uptick this time. And so we're still really dealing with this at a granular level, even though so many election deniers were defeated this time. And in Arizona, you know, Katie Hobbs, who is the governor-elect, has talked about the threats that she got, the death threats, and her opponent, Kari Lake, still has not conceded. Also, the secretary of state candidate there, Mark Finchem, has not conceded. And they continue to raise doubts about this election.
