Still, sources tell CNN Trump has made it clear Gaetz is the most important member of his incoming administration and that his confirmation should be a priority for the Senate GOP. Trump is calling senators directly, two sources familiar with his outreach tell CNN. Still, some senators are calling on the House to release the ethics report on Gaetz, which was set to be released shortly after Trump announced the pick. Gaetz, of course, promptly resigned.

But I think the Senate like I said, a different game. And he's going to have a very different partner in the Senate in someone like a John Thune. And he's realizing it, not only with these appointments with Gaetz and some of the pushback on that with Republicans but also on recess appointments. We know that the former president is certainly pushing to get those recess appointments through. But no indication they will.

What are you talking about? I don't know what you mean, wasn't there, have no clue. Not you saw someone and you didn't, you know, think it was your duty to call 911, et cetera.

So when you're speaking to your wife and confronted with an issue, you certainly had every ability to give a narrative that was not what he gave. And so that was certainly. Number two, I think the issue with his cell phone data, which puts his cell phone next to her cell phone again, putting him there as the call with his wife put him there. That was certainly damning. Number three, when you have a person who is on the trail who said another jogger that morning who saw someone who was wearing specifically what it is that he was wearing in terms of the jacket, the gloves, et cetera, who was looking down and certainly looking suspicious, that seems to give the indication that he was there. All these things showing that you were there, you match that up with again, something else that's powerful and that is the injuries he had on him in terms of the scratches. We know the DNA is underneath the fingernails. We see the phone activity there. Technology, wow, so important. So conclusive. Because you don't only have to rely upon a witness saying you saw him on the trail or the wife's call or the, you know, you just look at this, right? The cell phone data, which limits him to the actual specific place and location where she was. And so that's important. And so you go back to the scratches that I was talking about in the DNA underneath the fingernails, and it all spells someone who clearly appears to look like he committed the murder of Laken Riley.",

I think that they just have a summary witness to give all the indications that he was there, what he was wearing, what the DNA shows, what the evidence amounts to.And then it looks like they wrap up their case and thereafter the defense appears to have subpoenaed the two brothers of Mr. Ibarra with testimony they'll give will certainly be for positive for the defense. How credible they are remains another story and then the case will wrap up. So there's not much left here. We know it's a bench trial. A judge will make the assessment of guilt or lack thereof.
