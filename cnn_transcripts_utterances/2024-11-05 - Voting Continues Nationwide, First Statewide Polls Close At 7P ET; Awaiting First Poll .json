Voters there and across the United States continuing to cast ballots in this presidential election with high stakes and stark choices.If you are just joining us, I'm Jake Tapper. This is CNN's live coverage on election night in America. And we're about to get an early read of who is voting and why in this historic faceoff between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. Stand by for our very first exit poll information. That's coming up just minutes from now. Also ahead, the very first votes of the 2024 presidential race will be reported after 6:00 p.m. Eastern in areas with the earliest poll closings. The race to 270 electoral votes is underway with a total of 60 electoral votes on the line in six states where all voting ends at 7:00 p.m. Eastern. Those states are Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, South Carolina, Vermont and the Commonwealth of Virginia. Georgia is the first major presidential battleground up for grabs. This evening, Democrats are hoping to hold onto the state that they narrowly flipped to blue four years ago, Republicans fighting to take it back. CNN teams are keeping tabs on the final hours of voting in all of the crucial swing states that will decide who ultimately wins the White House. And our campaign correspondents are at the candidates headquarters. Let's go now to Abby Phillip who's at Harris HQ here in Washington, D.C. And Abby, what's the Harris camp's take on the battleground states right now?",

One source familiar with the ongoing voting situation in Philadelphia in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania says that they are happy with the turnout that they have been seeing so far, particularly in the northwest wards of that city, that heavily Democratic city. This source says that some of the polls even requested additional ballot paper to meet the demand of voters. So if you are the Harris campaign today, that is a very good sign. You need that plus in order to win the state or the commonwealth, excuse me, of Pennsylvania.And they are looking very carefully to make sure that in Philadelphia, especially where there is a strong black vote, where they need to really drive up those margins, that they can get there before the end of voting today, Jake.",

What I am hearing is that he will make an appearance where I am at the convention center. This is where we are expecting several thousands of Trump's supporters and donors to come and gather here behind us for one of two parties that is happening here in Southern Florida tonight, the other being at Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club, where he's going to be surrounded by friends, family, major donors and surrogates like Elon Musk and whatnot. But, Jake, I am hearing that Donald Trump is expected to show up here tonight to speak to his supporters.He said earlier he hasn't written a speech yet, and it's not completely clear that he will be here, but I've heard from sources that say they are planning for him to come. They can quickly whip up what his remarks are going to be. One thing, Jake, that Trump has been privately expressing frustration about is that a winner may not be announced tonight. And his own campaign aides have cautioned that is normal, that is likely expected, and that they don't think they'll know the victor of this race tonight. Obviously, that doesn't mean anything is wrong. It takes time to count the votes. But Trump has been frustrated about that because he says he wants an outcome tonight. Of course, Jake, the question is whether or not there are influences around him, encouraging him to declare victory like he did last time in 2020, falsely.",

These numbers will shift as the night goes on and more and more interviews come in. The second thing everyone should be aware of, this exit poll encompasses every kind of voter.Whether you voted pre-election day, on Election Day, by mail, early in person, before Election Day, we have incorporated polls of all kinds of voters that are incorporated into this exit poll. With that being said, let's look at the numbers on the mood of the country. It's a pretty dour mood in terms of the way people feel things are going in the United States. Nationally, only 7 percent of voters say they're enthusiastic, 19 percent say they're satisfied. Look at these numbers, 43 percent dissatisfied, 29 percent angry, 72 percent of the electorate in nationally say they're dissatisfied or angry. What about America's best days, we ask, are they in the future or are they in the past? Sixty-one percent of voters in this election across the country say America's best days are ahead of the country. Six in 10 say so, 34 percent say the best days are in the past. And finally, President Joe Biden's approval rating, it's at 41 percent in these early preliminary exit poll findings, 58 percent of voters in this election across the country nationally disapprove of the way that the incumbent Democratic president is doing his job, Jake.",

There are 31 percent of voters saying that's their most important issue. Then a little bit lower, abortion at only 14 percent saying it's the most important issue. And immigration below that at 11 percent. Foreign policy way down in single digits. I also want to show this by each candidate's supporters. It sort of explains a bit of their coalition. Among Harris voters in these preliminary exit polls, 56 percent of Harris voters say democracy is the number one issue. So, it's the Harris coalition that's driving democracy to the top of the pack. And the issue set, 21 percent say abortion among Harris voters, then the economy, foreign policy, and immigration. You imagine it's quite different if you look at the Trump voters. So among those supporting President Trump, a majority, 51 percent majority, say the economy is their top issue, followed by 20 percent of Trump supporters who say immigration is their top issue, then democracy, then abortion, and then foreign policy, Anderson.",

Only 29 percent of Harris voters say that they're out there casting their ballot to oppose Trump. Now, those numbers are even bigger in this direction for Donald Trump supporters. Among his supporters, 80 percent of them say they're out there casting their ballot for Donald Trump.Seventeen percent say they're showing up to cast a ballot against Harris. We also asked about certain qualities that each coalition was looking for. So Among Harris voters, 35 percent of them say they were looking for a candidate that has good judgment. That was the quality that mattered most to them. Twenty-eight percent of Harris supporters say they were looking for somebody who cares about people like me. Twenty-one percent say has ability to lead. And only 13 percent of Harris supporters said they were looking for someone to bring about needed change. It's a complete reversal when you look at the Trump coalition here. Forty-one percent of Trump supporters said the most important quality was looking for somebody who had the ability to lead. Right up there, almost tied, 39 percent looking for a candidate who can bring needed change. And then everything else was in single digits.

So went a little deeper, is democracy in the U.S. secure or threatened? Seventy- three percent of voters nationally in this election, according to these preliminary exit poll results, say U.S. Democracy is threatened. Only 25 percent think it's secure.A -- are you confident that elections are being conducted fairly and accurately in the United States? Well, two-thirds of voters in this election, 68 percent say they are confident, 31 percent of voters say they're not confident that elections are being conducted fairly and accurately today. We also wanted to look at that by coalition of support here. So among Harris voters in this election nationally, Jake, 88 percent, nearly nine out of 10 Harris voters are confident that elections are being conducted fairly inaccurately. Only 11 percent are not confident. As I'm sure you could imagine after the last four years, Donald Trump supporters, it's a totally different story. It's a split decision. Only 47 percent of Trump voters in this election say they're confident that the election is conducted fairly inaccurately, 52 percent, a slim majority of Trump voters are not confident, Jake. We also asked, are you concerned about violence as a result of the election? And overall, 71 percent of voters across the country according to these early exit polls say yes, they are concerned about violence, 20 -- 27 percent, Jake, say no, they're not.",
