Vance then backed up that stance when he appeared on the Sunday talk shows saying that Donald Trump would veto an attempt at a national abortion ban.

That said, he also has talked about how Republicans need to win elections and that this issue is something that gets in the way of that project for him.

At the same time, he has also eagerly listed as one of his major accomplishments of his one term in office that he nominated multiple Supreme Court judges that helped overturn Roe V. Wade.Now, his explanation is that he -- this was really a victory because it threw the question of abortion and abortion acts back to the states. Critics -- Democrats often say though that this really gives a license for states to push an effective national abortion ban or restrictions that as early as four weeks or five weeks are basically a ban in itself. And so, the president is very eager now to just let that be the end of the discussion. And I -- it doesn't surprise me that Vance was asked that and say he -- saying he would not support a ban and when pushed, finally says not supporting that would mean a veto.

Mychael, let me start with you on this because one of the things that we've learned in the course of our -- Bobby Kennedy's bid here is kind of a wide variety of -- maybe they were once just family stories but now they are part of our national narrative. There was the bear -- the baby bear in Central Park -- that he took a photograph with his hand in his mouth. And then recently we've learned about Kennedy -- his daughter telling us that he once cut the head off of a dead whale on the beach and then bungee-corded it to the roof of the family minivan for the five-hour haul back to Mount Kisco, New York. She said, \"Every time we accelerated out on the highway, whale juice would pour into the windows of the car, and it was the rankest thing on the planet. We all had plastic bags over our heads with mouth holes cut out, and people on the highway were giving us the finger, but that was just normal day-to-day stuff for us.\" I mean, I raise this just because he is clearly -- he has developed some sort of constituency here, right? There have been -- you know, polling had picked up. There, in particular, was a time kind of when Biden was still in the race where he seemed to potentially be a big factor. Obviously, the Kennedy name is a very famous one for the Democratic Party. What ultimate impact do you think him throwing his support behind Trump has here?",

I mean, the star slugger hitting home runs number 50 and 51 against the Rockies on Sunday, which puts him on pace to break his own American League record. Judge hitting 62 back in 2022. Recently, he has made this look so easy going yard (PH) seven times in New York's last six games. Number 50 came in the first inning. Number 51 in the seventh. And it was actually sandwiched between home runs from his teammates Juan Soto and Giancarlo Stanton. So the Yankees offense on fire right now. They win easy, 10-3. A very scary moment though in the bottom of the fifth. Major League umpire Nick Mahrley hit in the head by a broken bat and taken off the field in a stretcher. It was Stanton's bat that splintered just above his hands, and Mahrley collapsed to one knee. He was tended to immediately. He seemed alert and conscious as he was carted off the field. And the league tells CNN that he sustained a concussion and will be undergoing more tests over the next several days. Elsewhere this morning, Megan Rapinoe's NWSL jersey officially in the proverbial rafters. The Seattle Reign framing it -- number 15 -- honoring the two-time World Cup winner and Olympic gold medalist. Rapinoe called it a very special day. And the club capped off the festivities with a big win in the 97th minute. This is a goal from 18-year-old Emeri Adames. A perfect salute to her hero, Megan Rapinoe, at the end of a great day. The iconic pose there. A lot of fun. And the WNBA thriller in Chicago. The Sky trailing by three points in the final seconds of this game until Chennedy Carter hit a huge three from way downtown to tie the game. She led the Sky with 25 points. But there was just enough time for Aces' star A'ja Wilson to do what she does best, have the last word. A decisive layup to edge it for Vegas, 77-75. Wilson finished up with a double-double, 20 points, 18 boards, saving her team who looked as though they were going to blow a 13-point fourth-quarter lead. And lastly for you this morning, a big congratulations to the team from Lake Mary, Florida, winning the state's first-ever Little League World Series. Just the third time the championship had gone to extra innings. Tied in the bottom of the eighth, Hunter Alexander laying down a perfect bunt here to advance a runner, but no one from Chinese- Taipei covers first. And then you had Lathan Norton who was so sick he couldn't play in the U.S. Championship on Saturday, coming -- racing around from second base to score. So how about that? You can't even play because you're not feeling well. You come back and save the day with the winning run, doing it for the state of Florida. Great stuff all around, Kasie, from the Little League World Series. This is always just a really fun moment, period, but a great game, too.",
