So when they beat incumbent Mayor Lori Lightfoot, he and Vallas, Lightfoot took a lot of the Black neighborhoods in Chicago. Congressman Jesus Chuy Garcia took a lot of the Latino neighborhoods on the southwest side of the city, and so coming into this runoff, there was a lot of significant vote out there for these two candidates to try and win over. In this case, it seems it may have been the difference for Brandon Johnson. But now he has the tough task of actually leading Chicago, including folks in the police union who voted for Vallas.
