We've got -- ERICA HILL, HOST, \"CNN NEWSROOM\": Hello, and welcome to our viewers around the world. I'm Erica Hill in New York. This is CNN Newsroom. Just ahead this hour, the IDF's newly released report blames a case of mistaken identity for the strike that killed seven World Central Kitchen aid workers. The fallout from that investigation, more on its findings. Plus, two legal setbacks for Donald Trump, as the former President pushes to have multiple criminal cases thrown out. And two days after Taiwan's strongest earthquake in decades, the frantic search for the missing continues. We'll have the latest from the quake zone. First up here, Israel's military just releasing its report on the deadly strikes that killed seven World Central Kitchen aid workers in Gaza on Monday. According to the IDF's internal investigation, Israeli forces believed they were targeting Hamas operatives in the vehicles of that aid convoy. Israel says two military personnel have been fired. World Central Kitchen says that report shows the IDF deployed deadly force without regard to its own protocols, and is calling for systemic change. The organization, of course, has also been calling for an independent investigation. The report comes after a tense phone call between the U.S. President and the Israeli Prime Minister on Thursday. The White House says Mr. Biden demanded specific, concrete, measurable steps to protect civilians and aid workers in Gaza, and threatened consequences if Israel fails to act. Hours later, Israel announced it would reopen the Erez border crossing between Israel and northern Gaza to allow for aid shipments, and the security cabinet agreed to use the Israeli port of Ashdod to help transfer more aid into Gaza.

      "sentences": "Well, Erica, President Biden made quite clear to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Israel would face consequences if they don't alter their plans and operations in Gaza, specifically when it comes to protecting civilians there as well as humanitarian aid workers. Now, officials, we're told right now, are still combing through these -- this initial report that was released by the Israelis this morning. A White House spokesperson, John Kirby, said earlier today that they're reserving judgment on the report until they have the chance to actually go through and assess for themselves of what the Israelis have said caused and led to this devastating strike on that convoy which has killed seven humanitarian aid workers.Now, earlier today, Secretary of State Antony Blinken's call, you had a bit of new language as he called for an independent and fully publicized investigation into the matter. He said that they want to ensure that there is accountability for what happened. So, we'll be watching closely to see what the White House has to say in reaction to this report. But really, this call between Biden and Netanyahu could prove to be one of the most consequential calls between the two leaders that's been held so far amid this conflict. The President laid out in very stark terms what he wants to see from the Israelis. That includes ensuring protection for humanitarian aid workers who are working there. The two leaders, a senior administration official said, agreed that there needs to be a better job done about transmitting information about the -- where these aid workers are stationed. The President also pressed for more humanitarian aid to get into Gaza. And in the hours after that call with President Biden, there were some results. Israel approved the opening of the Erez Crossing in northern Gaza, as well as the opening of other ports to get aid in. But, as you heard Blinken there note the tests will be and how this is implemented. They will be watching to see how many trucks go into Gaza. How that humanitarian assistance is spread throughout the enclave. But, really this call between Biden and Netanyahu was quite significant, because he basically said there will be consequences if Israel does not change course. It comes as the President has already faced some domestic pressure here at home, and some have called for the conditioning of aid that goes to Israel. So, we will see whether the President might go as far as doing that. He did not exactly outline what changes in policy could look like. But, he did put Netanyahu on notice, saying that changes do need to be made.",

Israel now bracing for a potential attack by Iran after this week's airstrike on its embassy complex in Syria. Funerals for those killed took place in just the past few hours. The seven victims included a top commander in Iran's Revolutionary Guards. The Israeli military has not admitted carrying out the attack, but a spokesman said the embassy was a military building. Both Tehran and Damascus are blaming Israel, with Iran warning of a quote \"serious response\". The IDF has now jammed GPS services in Israel, saying it wants to neutralize any potential threats.

The federal judge overseeing the classified documents case denying Donald Trump's claim that he couldn't be prosecuted because he believed he had the right to keep those documents under the Presidential Records Act. The judge did, however, leave open the possibility that she might revisit that defends claim during trial. Meantime, in Georgia, the judge in the election interference case there tossed out the former President's argument that his actions to overturn the election were protected as free speech. CNN's Katelyn Polantz is tracking all of these developments for us. Couple of denials for the former President. Let's start with this documents case.

Donald Trump's team has had the opportunity to make a lot of different arguments to try and dismiss the criminal cases against him, and he is losing those so far. In the Mar-a-Lago documents case, Judge Aileen Cannon says these attempts that Trump has made to have the case dismissed because he claims he had authority as President to take documents as personal if he wished, that is not going to fly at this stage.However, she says that this issue of presidential records, if they are personal records, the claims that Trump is trying to make, that is something she may want to revisit. It's very likely. It's something that the Special Counsel's Office, the prosecutors are going to want to try and cut out from the trial. But, Cannon is very not definitive on exactly when this is going to take place, when she is going to be giving a final word on this. There is a lot of debates and arguments to go before then, before there is a jury in the room. And she also dings the Special Counsel's Office a bit for pressuring her. She says this is just a genuine attempt in the context of the upcoming trial to better understand the party's competing positions and the questions to be submitted to the jury in this complex case is the first impression. She had asked for additional ideas from both sides, some thought experiment of what if presidential records this argument from Trump and personal records that was part of what was presented to the jury and the Special Counsel took issue with that. So, she has reserved quite a lot of weighing in on this case and this argument in particular.",

This flight went around once, aborted its landing there on Runway Four at LaGuardia.The pilot said they had a bit of a tailwind and were too fast and too high. They came back around for something called the ILS, the Instrument Landing System. That's a radio beam that beams out of the runway, gets the airplane on the glide path, and lined up with the center of the runway. And the flight got down to about 300 feet above the ground, according to data from flight radar 24. And this is the alarm that came across the radio from air traffic controllers. Listen.",

And what we understand at this point is also that from that call that happened between the U.S. President and the Israeli Prime Minister, that there was a push from the U.S. side that the Israelis need to do more in order to make this deal work. There has been a call, according to the statement of the call itself, for Israel and the Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to give his negotiating team more leeway, more power to be able to maneuver and to make the parameters less strict so that they can actually make some leeway.Now, these -- all these intelligence chiefs and the Qatari Prime Minister have met a number of times. Last month, they were in Doha. And we heard from the U.S. side that progress was made, but it was slow. And we heard from many sides that some progress had made, but the gaps still remained. So, whether or not what we have seen with this phone call between the American President and the Israeli Prime Minister, there is almost ultimatum given whether or not that sparks an interest in Israel to allow more leeway for its negotiators and to allow more progress to be made in these talks.

Now, Yellen is making two stops, Guangzhou and Beijing. And today in Guangzhou, she met with members of the business community as well as Chinese leaders, including Vice Premier He Lifeng. The visit comes days after that phone call between U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Tuesday. They had their first direct talks since November, and Xi criticized Biden's moves to quote \"suppress China's trade and tech development\".Tech and trade development have been in focus today in Guangzhou. Here is Janet Yellen. JANET YELLEN, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY: I believe addressing overcapacity, and more generally, considering market-based reforms, is in China's interest. As I've said before, China is too large to export its way to rapid growth. And if policies are oriented only at generating supply and not also at generating demand, global spillovers will result.",
