So I think at a minimum, they'd have to be very concerned about what a Trump United States would look like. On the other hand, it's also worth noting that Theresa May had an absolutely dreadful time with Donald Trump when she was the prime minister, a conservative prime minister. And Boris Johnson may have fared slightly better because of this sort of surface similarity between the two of them -- (CROSSTALKING)",

And I think that's primarily where you'd be focused short-term if you're concerned, as I think you'd have to be, about the U.S. pivoting very strongly away from support for Europe on a security standpoint and towards Asia. There's a strong argument they would be continuing defense but investing in Asia. On the sort of more day-to-day level, I mean, I think the assumption has always been that President Trump would win. And what you find here in the financial community and across Europe, the same as you do in the U.S., there's a remarkable number in the business community who seem to be quite relaxed about Trump winning and expect money to be flowing to the U.S. and want to attach themselves to the U.S.",

And again, there are some parallels there in that one of the things that Democrats were furious about in that election of 1968 was that they hadn't voted for the person who was at the top of the ticket, Hubert Humphrey, at that point.And in this case, of course, the primary voters in the Democratic Party who are the most loyal people have voted and they voted for Joe Biden. For all the people who are focusing on Biden right now -- and as you mentioned, I'm a historian of the Republican Party -- the Republican Party is in crisis and they are as well doing something unprecedented, which is trying to run for president somebody who not only has 34 criminal convictions, but also tried to overthrow the will of the people in the 2020 presidential election. So I think that -- again, right now, I think the idea that the focus is on Biden is a bit misguided, at least from my perspective, because I don't care if we elect Biden or Harris or anybody else. I care that we recognize that running currently against that ticket is somebody who is trying to destroy our country.

That's not the way this game is played. What I would say, though, is that it is a mistake to look at him and say, oh, we've got a problem and not to look at Trump and say the same thing.And then to look at their performance in that office and say, we would rather have the man who couldn't get anything done and who really just worked with other authoritarians around the world than the man who has really managed to protect American manufacturing and so on. I care deeply that the American people have an entire picture of what is at stake in this election. And where we are right now, after that debate is not giving us that picture. It is my expectation following the Supreme Court's recent decisions that that balance may be restored, but if it isn't restored from the higher reaches of our government and from the media, the American people sure better do it themselves because we have five months to make sure we get to the 250th anniversary of the American Republic.
