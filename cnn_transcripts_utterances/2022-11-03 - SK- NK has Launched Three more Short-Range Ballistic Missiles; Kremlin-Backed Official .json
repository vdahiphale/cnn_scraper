A spokesman says he was hit in the foot during what they described as an assassination attempt. Well, Khan is being treated in Lahore. Several other people were also shot and we are told that one of them has died. Police say they now have a suspect in custody. Meantime, Pro-Khan Protests have broken out across Pakistan. He's been rallying in a bid to return to power after losing a parliamentary vote no confidence in April. And we get you to Sophia Saifi who is in Islamabad, in Pakistan.

Ever since then he's been more blatantly criticizing the powerful military in this country. And just take this past week for example, there was a high level journalist and extremely popular journalist was critical of the establishment and the government who had left the country his associate says that he had to flee. He was shot dead in Kenya under mysterious circumstances. We then had the Director of the PSI Pakistan's Intelligence Agency, which who has never even been photographed, come out and do this bombastic press conference less than a week ago speaking out against Imran Khan and dispelling according to him any theories behind what Khan has said that it was the army and the U.S. that was behind his ousting? Khan had started this long march exactly a week ago. He said he's going to take all of the supporters thousands of them and they are thousands of supporters of Imran Khan. And they've been increasing in number at the rallies he's been holding for months in the lead up to what's just happened. He wanted early elections.

(BEGIN VIDEOTPAE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): For the second time this year, a rare North Korean missile alert in Japan triggered by a presumed long range ballistic missile fired from Pyongyang disappearing from radar just before reaching Japanese airspace. One of several missiles test fired by North Korea Thursday morning local time, possibly to demonstrate its tactical nuclear strike capability against South Korea, Japan and Guam. In South Korea, where North Korean nuclear threats often feel like background noise, this startling sound the first air raid sirens in six years, urging - residents to seek shelter in underground bunkers. A North Korean missile came dangerously close to the island, crossing the Northern Limit Line, a de facto maritime buffer zone between the North and the South.

For the Korean Peninsula a day of unnerving firsts the first time North Korea launched at least 23 missiles in a single day, skyrocketing tensions to levels unseen and half a decade. The first time South Korea and the U.S. responded by firing surface to air missiles near the North's territorial waters. CNN counts 30 North Korean missile launch events this year, including this week's unprecedented barrage. Japan strongly condemning the latest launches, calling the blitz utterly unacceptable violating UN Security Council resolutions at an unprecedentedly high frequency.

Marine life dies in these zones since decomposed algae consumed the oxygen in the area. More than 1100 manatees died in Florida and 2021 the most deaths in decades. About two thirds of the deaths were on Florida's east coast. Scientists largely blamed the increase of a lack of sea grass on the East Coast, much of it killed by pollution and coastal development.
