Of course, the next date on the calendar is his sentencing on July 11th, just days before the Republican National Convention.Sources tell CNN it's unclear if Trump's legal team will move to push that back later in the year. There'll be meetings about that over the next few days to figure out if they want to let that sentencing date stand and use it politically as they enter the convention or if they want to push it back a few weeks, given that his legal team will be busy with another case down in Florida through the end of June. Now after that, we expect that the Trump team will ultimately file an appeal throughout the course of this case. They have been preparing for the possibility of an appeal if there was a conviction. They have been filing motions, raising objections, trying to preserve any constitutional questions.

It may not be the smartest thing to do  and I'm sure his lawyers are not encouraging him to get in there and to lambast this judge ahead of sentencing.

It gives him a chance to talk about sort of the novel way that he was indicted. This was an unusual case. He's the only one that we know of that has been prosecuted for these specific acts, sort of tying in a what would have been a misdemeanor, much less significant charge, and make it a felony in an effort to use state law to enforce federal law. Those may be issues that we see on appeal. But he has used this case to maximize about his claims. And it's been played into his -- it played into his game a little bit. It's allowed him to maximize his client that the system has been weaponized against him. I think that's a dangerous position. I think that's an another attack. And he's known for doing that. He's attacking the foundations of, functions of American government. But that's -- he's done that successfully, frankly, over the last number of years. And so this was another one of those.

One of those would be the due process claims.And that is was he placed on sufficient notice by the prosecutor of the specific charges, of the specific allegations and elements of those charges in the indictment? Then we'll see, was the jury properly charged as to as to their function in relation to those? So specifically, we're talking about that, that key step of making this case go from a misdemeanor to a felony level. Was the jury sufficiently charged that they had to unanimously find the specific intent for a specific second crime, that one thing that makes this a felony? And that specific second crime is not well laid out in the charging documents and other -- the American constitutional law, there's a due process, right, for a defendant to be placed on proper notice of those claims for which he or she must defend themselves against. And so that will be I think an appeal and we'll also see I think a strong argument made about whether or not his proposed expert witness, this federal election expert, had his testimony so limited. And so they chose not to call him at trial. But the judge so that to making the effort to call him sort of a nullity. Those are things I -- on the question of change in the venue and all those things, it probably will pass. I don't think the court would do much. But certainly when we talk about constitutional principles, those things may catch the attention of the New York Court of Appeals or ultimately, if he's not successful in the state courts, they may catch the attention of a federal court, should his, should he be successful, get his appeal heard by a federal judge.",

It's just logistically almost impossible. And frankly, under the regular sentencing parameters, this is the lowest grade felony. He's a non-violent offender. He's a first offender. There's no likelihood of a repeat of this -- of it (INAUDIBLE) this charge. And he's the former president of the United States. He's entitled to Secret Service protection even as a convicted felon. He's entitled that protection. So that places a huge strain on how he would be protected should he be placed in some type of state facility. So hopefully that won't come to pass. But I think people are -- would be well placed to let the process work and to not heed any calls or intentions to cause any disturbance about it. This is our system and our system as it, there's a trial, there's an appellate process. There are reviews, it can happen if there has been some error of law in the case. And so that process needs to work its way through.

They could also, for instance, target Russian jets that have been bombarding the front lines in that Kharkiv area as well. However, what the Ukrainians can't do is they can't hit further into Russian territory; for instance, using ATACMS missiles to target some of those Russian air bases from which those jets take off from, that then target those Ukrainian positions. Nevertheless, Ukrainians obviously very happy about all this. The Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, he came out and he said that this is a very important first step for the Ukrainians. Even though he couldn't talk much more about what all this is going to mean, the Kremlin, of course, irate about all of this, saying that this shows the degree of the involvement of the West and the U.S. on the Ukrainian side.

He was not scheduled, there was no Ukrainian delegation that was formally attending this annual security conference here in Singapore.And what we're anticipating is, with his arrival, he will be bringing Europe's deadliest conflict right here to the heart of Asia, to an annual gathering, which is attended for the most part by defense chiefs from around Asia and dominated by the ongoing rivalry between the U.S. and China. So you've had the U.S. secretary of defense, Lloyd Austin, meeting with his Chinese counterpart here yesterday. There are clearly disagreements when it comes to the war in Ukraine, for example. This morning we heard a Chinese People's Liberation Army officer in a question-and-answer period, asserting, laying claim to the argument that Beijing has made in the past, that the war in Ukraine was caused by the expansion of the NATO military alliance. Austin responded, saying respectfully, I disagree. He argued that the war was started, in his words, when Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, launched an illegal invasion into Ukraine, whereupon the audience applauded. I've never actually seen a reaction like that at one of these annual gatherings. So this is going to be a moment for a Zelenskyy to meet face-to-face with leaders here in Asia, presumably with the U.S. defense chief and they have met before in the past but also to make a case to leaders in Asia about the ongoing conflict here. And certainly when you have some governments in the region, China in particular, which is a close ally of Russia, China we've heard calling for peace talks between Ukraine and Russia. But just yesterday, the Chinese foreign ministry, Kim, announced that it would not be participating in peace talks scheduled in Switzerland next month. Beijing responding, saying that since Russia isn't invited, that it doesn't make any sense for China to participate. I heard the Dutch ministry of defense, who attended here, saying that that was a shame and that she regretted China's position here. So what we see are some of the fault lines, the rivalries in the region. And Zelenskyy coming in person to make Ukraine's case to the assembled delegations here in Singapore -- Kim.",
