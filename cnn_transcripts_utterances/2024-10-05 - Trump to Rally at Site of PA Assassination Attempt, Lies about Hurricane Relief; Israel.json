He's expected to honor the victims of the shooting during a rally. Trump's running mate, JD Vance, and billionaire Elon Musk are also scheduled to be there. Vice President Kamala Harris and her rival hit the campaign trail on Friday, keeping the focus on battleground states. And they both plan to spend the weekend trying to persuade undecided voters.

I think it's also important to point out that the Bureau of Labor Statistics has revised multiple initial jobs reports upwards in the last 1.5 years compared to what was initially released. So there's just no concrete evidence that the Biden administration is cooking the books or trying to present misleading figures about the health of the economy. But I think that this is the problem when you have historically low trust in public institutions and particularly in government. Politicians can make assertions unsubstantiated and they're going to be taken at face value by a certain fraction of the population, especially those who buy into conspiracy theories. Distrust in institutions is low across the board. It's particularly low among GOP voters. And so I think that's what Trump is tapping into.",

And then the recent American University poll found 46 percent of women prefer Harris over Trump to handle the economy; 38 percent prefer Trump.

I think that he does have a story to tell but he's been too distracted on other things, criticisms of Kamala Harris personally.And so I think that he has to get back on message. His message needs to be one, inflation and the economy and, two, immigration and just keep saying that over and over and over.

I mean, there are just so many lies being spread on social media. Marjorie Taylor Greene even claiming that Democrats are controlling the weather to basically attack Republican voters.

I think when the assassination attempt occurred, Trump's approval was at an all-time high, when Joe Biden was still the presumptive nominee for the Democratic Party. And everyone thought that the rest of the election season would be a viewed through this lens of what happened in Butler, Pennsylvania. Then the news cycle faded after the Republican convention, after Kamala Harris became the nominee. And I think Trump is trying to retake that attention. It's no coincidence, Kim, that he's doing that in Pennsylvania, which is the swing state of all swing states, which we've talked about before, and probably the state that will determine the winner of the White House. So I think it will be a pretty emotional moment for Trump but one that he really wants to publicize.",

A U.S. State Department official says Washington hasn't received any assurances from Israel that it won't target Iran's nuclear facilities.Officials are watching for the timing of any attack. Monday marks the first anniversary of the October 7 Hamas terror attack on Israel. Meanwhile, it's just after 11:00 am in Lebanon, after a night of clashes between Hezbollah and Israeli forces. Lebanon is spiraling into a humanitarian crisis as the conflict heads into another week. The new report from a conflict monitoring group says, Israel's bombardment of Lebanon over the past three weeks is the world's most intense aerial campaign, with the exception of what's happening in Gaza, in the last two decades. The Israeli military is warning medical teams in Lebanon not to work with Hezbollah. The IDF alleged on Friday the militant group is, in its words, \"exploiting rescue vehicles\" to transport what they described as \"terrorists\" and weapons and it warned it will take, quote, \"appropriate measures\" against any vehicle it believes is being used by Hezbollah. CNN's Nada Bashir is following developments from London. So Nada, we hear there are no assurances from Israel that they won't target Iran's nuclear facilities. Take us through the reaction. NADA BASHIR, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  That's right. No assurance is no clear timeline either from Israeli officials, not at least according to the Biden administration. Again, there has been close coordination, of course, a close communication dialogue between the Israeli government and the Biden administration. But again, we are hearing again words of caution but also uncertainty from the American president himself. We did hear from Biden yesterday, urging caution. Of course, in this situation, again, no clarity on when we may expect some sort of response to retaliation from the Israeli military. There have certainly been mounting concerns around Israel targeting energy infrastructure, oil fields in Iran. Particularly concerned around what the potential follow up response then would be from the Iranian regime targeting perhaps Israeli territory and other locations as well. So significant concern. Take a listen to this message to reporters from the U.S. President just yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We've been hearing from Emily Tripp at Airwars, describing the intensity and severity of bombardment we've been seeing really unparalleled with recent conflicts. And, of course, this is having a devastating effect on civilians, in particular. Important to underscore, we are talking about a very small country, densely populated. These areas that we are seeing, these heavy bombing campaigns are all densely populated with civilians. And of course, we have been seeing that further push of the ground incursion by the Israeli military in southern Lebanon as well. Now, of course, the Israeli military claims that it is targeting Hezbollah targets, Hezbollah infrastructure. They claimed to have killed at least 250 Hezbollah militants so far. That has not yet been confirmed by Hezbollah but that is, of course, the figure that Israel is putting out since the beginning of the bombing campaign and ground incursion in Lebanon. We also, of course, in the last hour or so have received reports from Hamas-affiliated media, that Hamas' -- the leader of the al Qassam Brigade, Hamas' military wing, was killed in an Israeli airstrike in northern Lebanon near the city of Tripoli. Of course, that would be a significant development. We are still waiting to hear from the Israeli military on that. But again, just to underscore the civilian impact here, around 1 million people displaced, unprecedented death toll so far in just a short space of time. And there are fears that this is only going to get worse, that the situation is only going to grow more desperate. And these red lines that we keep hearing about in Gaza, in the West Bank and now of course, in Lebanon, they really don't seem to stand right now. So there has been a real focus on what the international reaction is going to be, whether we see a shift, whether we see more pressure put on the Israeli military to actually lead to some sort de-escalation in the region, Kim.",

Two of the few that meet those requirements are endorsed by Donald Trump. The state's school superintendent says school Bibles must contain the Pledge of Allegiance, U.S. Constitution and Declaration of Independence.Lee Greenwood's God Bless The USA Bible has those. Thousands of other editions don't. The Lee Greenwood Bible cost $60. Standard versions of the Bible are available online for less than $10. And because Trump endorsed the Greenwood Bible, he receives some of the proceeds from sales. The other Bible that meets the requirements costs $90 and it was also endorsed by Trump. (MUSIC PLAYING)",
