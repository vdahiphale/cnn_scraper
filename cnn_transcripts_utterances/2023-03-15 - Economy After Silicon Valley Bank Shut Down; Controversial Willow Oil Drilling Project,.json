      "sentences": "The classic scene from, \"It`s A Wonderful Life\" dramatizes the panic involved in a run on thebank. It happens when there`s a loss of confidence in the bank, and that leads to large withdrawals. The bank can`t pay everyone who wants their money all at once, and it fails. During the Great Depression, thousands of banks failed 9000, to be exact, taking $7 billion worth of customers assets with them. That`s why the new deal included laws to ensure deposits and boost confidence in financial institutions. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the FDIC, was created in 1933, and today covers up to $250,000 per depositor at FDIC insured banks. Actual bank failures still happen. There were a lot during the Great Financial Crisis in 2008, but in recent years, just a handful every year, and none in 2021 and 2022. That streak broke in March of 2023, Silicon Valley Bank, a prominent lender to tech startups, collapsed after questions about its liquidity started piling up. That caused customers to start withdrawing their money, essentially sparking a run on the bank. When SVB couldn`t raise enough capital to cover customer demand, regulators stepped in and took control of the bank. The danger with a bank run is that panic can spread to other banks. It`s called contagion.",

Now the largest state in the U.S., Alaska is bigger than Texas, California, and Montana combined. And up next, we`re headed to Alaska where this week the Biden administration approved a controversial oil drilling project called the ConocoPhillips Willow Project. The move is making some climate advocates angry and could set the stage for a court challenge in the future. The project is a decades long oil drilling venture in the National Petroleum Reserve on the north shore of Alaska, which is owned by the federal government. The planned site holds up to 600 million barrels of oil. The approval is considered a victory for Alaska`s government and a coalition of native tribes who feel the drilling venture is a much-needed new source of revenue and jobs for this remote region. But climate groups and some Alaska natives argue that the project will hurt the country`s climate goals and pose health and environmental risks. We`ll hear now from CNN National Correspondent Rene Marsh who has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
