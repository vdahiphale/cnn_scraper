This, you know, I know you are, but what am I, or they change the subject to something else that's deemed their strength.

Now, what's interesting about this, beyond the fact that they took out this extra Russian landing ship is, of course, the way they went about it. These are Magura sea drones that were used. They were basically powered by Jet Ski. They're Ukrainian made. And of course that's significant, Phil, because we know that Ukrainian armed forces have been trying to ramp up their production of their own weapons and using much more effectively than they had before. Drones, not only along the land, the front lines on land. But of course, in the Black Sea, we saw another big guided missile ship taken out earlier this month. Again and by these very same Ukrainian drones. They have this really long capability, about 800 kilometers, just under 500 miles, and are extremely agile at getting around and in ships. And what they did is break a hole in the side of that ship, taking it down. Now, it's also important, because what we've seen is while that front line has been so static over the course of the last few months, Ukrainian forces have really been focusing their efforts on the Black Sea with that degree of success. It's important, not only symbolically, because of course, what Crimea represents in terms of the 2014 invasion. But it's important strategically, as well. What the Ukrainians are working on is the assumption that they -- if they can cut off the Russian ability in the Black Sea to continue bringing troops to their front lines from the Crimean Peninsula that they'll have a big win strategically.

New overnight, the House voted to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas over his handling of the U.S.-Mexico border.This is the first time a cabinet secretary has been impeached in nearly 150 years. Now, the Republican-led House claims Mayorkas refused to comply with the law and breached public trust. This was the House's second attempt to impeach the secretary. They fell short by a vote last week. Now the decision on removing Mayorkas now moves to the Democratic-led Senate, which make vote to dismiss the case altogether. Joining us now is CNN national politics correspondent, Eva McKend. Eva, that's kind of where I get stuck on. I'm not totally sure what the point is, since we know the Senate's not going to vote to convict. How are House Republicans explaining why they needed to do this?",

Alejandro Mayorkas, also the first Latino to run homeland security. But Republicans achieved this only one vote, with Congressman Steve Scalise returning to the Capitol after receiving cancer treatment, to give Republicans the numbers necessary to achieve this. The resolution itself, though, non-binding. And you have three Republican congressmen actually join with Democrats: Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, Ken Buck of Colorado, Tom McClintock of California opposing the impeachment, arguing a polity -- policy dispute over immigration doesn't amount to an impeachable offense like public corruption. Because House Republicans, they're arguing that he has not done his job, that he isn't adequately enforcing immigration law. But those opposed to this say he's -- didn't abuse the power of his office for personal gain in any way. He didn't engage in corruption, and that's really what impeachment should be reserved for. But I'll let you hear for yourself how lawmakers are explaining how they voted. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MARK GREEN (R-TN): This guy essentially subverted the laws passed by this body.

Still, though, without a breakthrough. This is according to a U.S. official. The discussions include the release of imprisoned Palestinians in exchange for hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza. Israel's prime minister has dismissed Hamas's demands. Meantime, the IDF says it has new video footage. This is from October. It shows Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar inside a tunnel in Gaza in Khan Yunis with his wife, children, and also with an unidentified man. CNN has not yet been able to verify the authenticity of this video. CNN has live team coverage with Nada Bashir in Cairo, Nic Robertson in Tel Aviv. Nada, let me begin with you. To have a U.S. official described these talks in that way, is it your sense that it is different than before, when things have fallen apart or not gotten as far as was hoped?",
