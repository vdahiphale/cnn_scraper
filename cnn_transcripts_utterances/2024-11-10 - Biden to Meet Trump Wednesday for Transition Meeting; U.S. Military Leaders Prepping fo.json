I'm Jim Sciutto live in Washington where it's 11Right now the eyes of the political world are focused squarely on Florida and Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate. That is where the president-elect is seeing a stream of visitors now, including many seeking jobs in his new administration as well as those looking to influence his choices for those top spots. Trump is expected to announce several key positions in the coming days as he prepares for inauguration. A source tells CNN Trump has offered New York congresswoman and campaign surrogate Elise Stefanik the job as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. Trump is expected to bring back as well Tom Homan who served as acting director of ICE, Immigrations and Custom Enforcement, during his first administration. Sources say that Homan may serve in a czar-like role fulfilling Trump's campaign promise to carry out the largest mass deportation in U.S. history. This week Trump will travel to the White House for an Oval Office meeting with outgoing President Joe Biden. Sunlen Serfaty has details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

And, you know, Trump has hinted many times, and he has outright said at times that he does intend or that he would support the use of the U.S. Military to conduct domestic law enforcement here in the United States. So the U.S. Military officials that we have been speaking to say that they are gaming out scenarios under which that would occur and how they would respond. [23:05:03] For example, what that chain of command would look like and how they would push back or accommodate other requests made by Trump that were deemed more controversial. Another aspect of this, of course, is Schedule F, which is an executive order that Trump issued during his first term that essentially would reclassify a huge swath of apolitical government employees to make them easily -- more easily fireable. And that is something that the Pentagon is also bracing for and has been scrambling to try to address before President Trump takes office on January 20th. So the bottom line here is that given the very hostile relationship that the Pentagon had with Donald Trump during the first Trump administration and the fact that so many of Trump's former senior military officials have spoken out against him in recent weeks, months and years, with John Kelly, his former White House chief of staff and a retired general, going as far as to call him a fascist, Pentagon officials, largely at the senior level here, are bracing for a potentially similar relationship with the incoming White House.

You know what's interesting, look at the picture that we showed there during Natasha's report. You have those folks surrounding the president-elect in his first administration, Esper, Pence, Milley, none of whom supported him in this election, and some of whom had quite public and critical comments about his -- how he plans to exercise power. So I want to drill down on one of the scenarios that the Pentagon is preparing for, and that is that Trump issues potentially an unlawful order such as using troops against U.S. citizens. First of all, how seriously do you take that possibility? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Oh, Jim, I take it very seriously. And it's one of those areas where there are two different sets of laws, well, at least two different sets of laws that one can look at. One is the Posse Comitatus Act, that is an act done in the 1870s that basically prohibits the use of the military in a law enforcement capacity. Now, there's an exception to that. There's actually several exceptions, but the one most commonly cited would be the Insurrection Act. The Insurrection Act would allow the president to use the military in an emergency, say a riot situation or something like that. In fact the last time it was used was with the Los Angeles riots in 1992 when they did deploy active duty troops in that area. Turned out that the local law enforcement and the California National Guard had to actually taken care of that situation at that particular moment in time. But this is a very serious issue, and it should not be taken lightly because the way the military is set up here in the United States, it's a professional military designed to deal with outward facing threats, not inwardly perceived threats. And that's a major difference between us and many other nations.",

But in this particular case, the thing about loyalty is that it is also -- should also be the kind of loyalty that speaks truth to power. And if that is not the kind of loyalty that they're seeking, if it's blind obedience that they're seeking, there is a considerable danger in that because then you get into scenarios where there's no adult in the room, and everybody just does what one individual, in this case the future president, is actually saying and is actually ordering.So if that happens, what that does is it de-professionalizes not only the civil service, but also the military forces. And when those forces are de-professionalized, then it becomes a real problem because those forces then are considered to be the instruments of that individual and not supporting the Constitution, which in fact they are sworn to uphold, and that is the danger in that.",

There's an intelligence center in El Paso that is manned in part by the military that does help with those kinds of things.And that's the role that the military, you know, likes to have in a situation like this, one of support and not basically be the mission lead in a case like that. So when you're looking at law enforcement type actions, with the exception of the National Guard, which is a big exception to all of this, the basic rule should be that the military stays out of it because it's not the kind of threat that the military is designed to deal with.

And although inflation has come back down to earth, prices on goods are roughly 20 percent higher now than they were when Joe Biden took office. Those price rises they make a difference over time.

So they're gaining all of this tactical experience which makes their army, in the long run, more experienced, and perhaps a greater threat on the Korean Peninsula where tensions have ratcheted up to their highest level since the Korean detente that was orchestrated under the first Trump administration but that ended somewhat dramatically in Hanoi with a huge loss of face from for Kim Jong-un when President Trump and his team decided there was no deal to be had so they walked out and left the lunch table set and the food uneaten.Kim took his train back to Pyongyang fuming. Heads rolled after that happened, and Kim regrouped and has now made a pivot to Vladimir Putin where you've had high-profile meetings between Kim and Putin. You now have these thousands of North Korean troops, around 10,000 estimated right now. Some reports that there could be huge numbers of additional North Korean troops deployed to assist Russia with its war in Ukraine. And so even though President Trump has claimed that Kim Jong-un misses him, they have had a personal relationship and exchange of letters, but that relationship also, towards the end of it, Kim Jong-un's letters expressed some real frustration with President Trump at that time. And now the question is going to be, will President Trump try to reengage with the North Koreans? Would Kim Jong-un even be willing to do that? And how much leverage does the United States have towards this long stated goal of denuclearization that now, according to most observers, seems almost completely off the table.

Currently it's on the path to a 2.6 to 3.1 degree rise by 2100. So what does that mean for the goal? I mean, is the world just going to throw its hands up in the air in effect?",

I mean, folks are making a lot of money on solar panels and electric vehicles. The markets are growing. Renewable energy is growing as a source of electricity. Even a place like Texas, right, deep red Texas, I think it's about a third of its power comes from renewable sources. And that's because the economics work more today than they did in the past.Is the economic momentum strong enough to overcome the political pushback from someone like a President-elect Trump?",

I think that when it comes to subsidizing the oil and gas industry, we should expect that Trump will be full steam ahead. So he has said, for example, he wants to be a dictator on day one to drill, drill, drill. His words, not mine. So we should expect him to do that.I also think that when it comes to regulations, you know rules about how much pollution can be put into the atmosphere from power plants, he's going to work to roll those things back. The thing is that environmental groups have a very good track record of taking him to court. And even under these, you know, federal judges and the Supreme Court that have moved so far, you know, radically to the right because of Trump appointments, they're still losing those cases. The Trump administration under the first administration lost 90 percent of cases almost. And then there's the third bucket which is really funding for companies like you're talking about. You know, incentives to build manufacturing in the United States. And that's the thing that I think the Trump administration is really going to really struggle to do. Just think about the fact that you have Elon Musk, a person who has made billions of dollars in the electric future.",

Rome's famous Trevi Fountain is now under restoration. The water is out of it. While workers painstakingly clean the masterpiece, tourists will get a bird's eye view from a metal walkway installed over the fountain. CNN's Barbie Nadeau is in Rome with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BARBIE LATZA NADEAU, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The Trevi Fountain is normally gurgling with water into which millions of tourists throw coins each year. But thanks to a massive renovation project worth more than $300,000, that includes cleaning and scrubbing up of calcium, rust and dirt, this iconic fountain is dry. You know where the water should be is this metal walkway that is going to offer the tourists who come here a rare opportunity to take an intimate look at this 18th century masterpiece. (Voice-over): The walkway will also allow the city to study a proposed ticket system by tracking the ebbs and flows of the tourists through the day.",
