Burchett was one of the eight Republicans who voted to oust Kevin McCarthy from his role in that historic vote after he worked with Democrats to avoid a government shutdown.In just a few hours, the House is going to try again. They're going to hold a floor vote. Lauren Fox is on Capitol Hill. There were so many smiles around Congressman Johnson yesterday. Does that mean this is a lock?",

      "sentences": "Well, Poppy, obviously, the Republican conference is exhausted right now. This has gone on for longer than three weeks. And a lot of members are very hopeful that Mike Johnson might be the guy who can finally get the 217 votes needed on the floor of the House.A couple things to watch for. There were a couple of hold-out members who did not support Johnson in the closed-door vote last night. We're going to be watching very closely because there were three of those members. There were also some attendance issues last night. So, we'll be keeping a close eye on whether or not any of those votes or opposed to Johnson. But it's just important to note that there has been such division within the Republican Party because every time they seem to get a candidate behind closed doors, what you saw with Tom Emmer played out with Steve Scalise just a week ago where there is a candidate who gets the most votes behind closed doors, then they cannot get 217. Then a more conservative candidate emerges. In the case of Jim Jordan, he couldn't get there. But a lot of people are more optimistic about Mike Johnson. And one thing I thought was really interesting is Representative Lawler told our colleague Manu Raju that he clearly thought that ousting McCarthy was a very dumb decision for the Republican conference. But he said he did think he could support Mike Johnson. He says that it was time to move on. And I just think that that is the sentiment among so many members. Now, so many things can change in the course of just four hours before members go to the floor for a vote at noon. But I just think there is certainly momentum, there is a lot of feeling that Mike Johnson is the guy for the job. And despite the fact he doesn't have a ton of policy experience, there is an expectation that he could clinch the speakership today.",

This is what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY): Yes, I don't know Mike Johnson well. Based on his track record, he clears -- appears to be an extreme right-wing ideolog. House Democrats will push back aggressively against that. However, at the same period of time, we said from the very beginning of this Congress, and demonstrated that we are ready, willing and able to find common ground with our Republican colleagues in order to advance bipartisan solutions to solve problems for hard working American taxpayers. And all Mike Johnson will need to do is to meet us in a bipartisan way in that fashion and we'll be able to work together whenever and wherever possible. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "A lot to do in 23 days.Lauren Fox, as always, thank you. So, the big question is, for a lot of people at least, who is Mike Johnson exactly? And that's a fair question to some degree. He was elected to the House in 2016. He is a social conservative and has been that way since he was a lawyer before joining the state legislature in Louisiana and then becoming a member of the House, argued, in front, in front of the Supreme Court. Currently the vice chair of the House Republican Conference. Used to be the chairman of the very powerful and sizable Republican Study Committee. But one of the issues that I think people may not recognize is the role he played in 2020 in terms of supporting Donald Trump's efforts to overturn Joe Biden's victory. In fact, it was a critical role. He was the one who actually drafted the House Republican legal brief signed by 126 Republicans that supported the Texas lawsuit to try and overturn the electoral results of four states. Not only did he ask members to play a role in it, he actually is the name on the amicus brief that was submitted. But it wasn't just the fact that he was a lawyer and had constitutional law background that made him want to get involved in this. He was an actual lobbyist. From a personal email account of Mike Johnson sending an email to every single member to the House Republican Conference asking them to support the brief and also making very clear that Trump, quote, \"said he will be anxiously awaiting the final list of Republicans that signed on to review.\" Something that infuriated some of the moderate Republicans at the time. But it was something that was very clearly driven by the former president. Back in December 9, 2020, Trump making clear that he wanted intervention into and support of the Texas case. He also was talking to Mike Johnson. Johnson tweeting Trump called him this morning, said that they were supportive of this, that this was the big one in terms of the Texas lawsuit. Obviously, it was not. It was thrown out by the Supreme Court. Trump did not officially throw his support behind Mike Johnson, but he did say he was supportive of Johnson. Clearly not running against him, like he did with Tom Emmer. As for where Johnson stands now on these issues and where the Republican conference is, well, last night was a pretty good window.
