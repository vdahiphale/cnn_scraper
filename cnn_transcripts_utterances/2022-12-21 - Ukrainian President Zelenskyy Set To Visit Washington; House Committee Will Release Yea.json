But first, here's Phil Mattingly reporting in from the White House.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (on camera): For more than 300 days. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has not left the country of Ukraine over the course of that period of time. Obviously, Russia's invasion of Ukraine and a grinding war that continues to this moment. However, on Wednesday he will depart. He will depart and has already departed for Washington DC in what will be a historic and quite symbolic moment, a meeting face to face with President Biden, the U.S. serving as the number one ally and certainly number one when it comes to scale of defense assistance up to this point during that war. And in that meeting, which will be extensive, largely behind the scenes consultations between the presidents and their top two teams, President Biden will also make a significant announcement of his own. $1.8 billion in new security assistance that's on top of more than 20 billion the U.S. has already directed towards Ukraine since the start of the war. And inside that $1.8 billion, the most significant weapons system the U.S. has been willing to provide Ukraine up to this point. Patriot missile defense systems, which President Zelenskyy has repeatedly, over the course of the last several months, asked for, talked about, personally, pleaded with President Biden in phone calls, I'm told, for those weapons systems, particularly in the wake of the last several weeks of Russia ramping up its attacks on civilian infrastructure. Now, President Biden is willing to say yes, and start the process of sending those towards Ukraine. The expansion of the security systems, the face to face meeting, the first visit for President Zelenskyy out of his country since the invasion began, all underscoring a relationship that President Biden has said explicitly and unequivocally, over and over again will continue, quote, as long as it takes. That relationship will also carry over onto Capitol Hill where Zelenskyy is expected to deliver a primetime address to a joint session of Congress at the very moment. Lawmakers are considering another $45 billion in emergency aid to Ukraine. Critical bipartisanship behind those votes up to that point, despite some Republicans raising concerns, something President Zelenskyy will certainly be trying to ensure continues at a moment where the U.S. has made clear that support is not changing or going anywhere anytime soon.

      "sentences": "In the next Ukrainian security assistance package that we're expecting when Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visits Washington, visits the White House, we're expecting the U.S. to announce two crucial systems that fill two different roles.The first is the Patriot Air Defense system, one of the most advanced U. S. systems for aerial defense and, crucially, a long range system, that will sit it almost like a dome on top of the systems the U.S. has already provided. The medium range NASAMS system and then some of the shorter range systems such as Stingers and MANPADS that Ukraine has already used for aerial defense. That's on top of what other countries have also provided. Patriots have their challenges, though. They are large, complex systems so the training, the maintenance, the sustainment, all of that will take time to learn. And that's part of the process here. The other crucial system that we're learning about the precision bombing kits known as JDAMs, Joint Direct Attack Munitions, that allows Ukraine to turn, quote unquote, dumb bombs into precision guided bombs. We have seen them use with great effect precision guided munitions for example, the HIMARS systems. The Excalibur guided artillery systems. All of these have been critical for Ukraine's successes on the battlefield so far. This will largely fill a similar role these JDAMs. They can be used on a variety of different bombs from 500 pound bombs up to 2,000 pound bombs. They're relatively inexpensive. According to Boeing, only about $22,000 per kit, which is a fraction of the price of the GMLRS munitions that are used with HIRAMS and some of the other high-end munitions that have been provided to Ukraine. And yet they fill that role of precision bombing that can be done at range, so you don't have to get in very close. The standard JDAMs have a range of about 15 miles, and some of the extended range have a range of 40 miles or more. It's unclear exactly what the U.S. will provide at this point. Of course, these have to be air launch. They are launched from fighter jets. So Ukraine will have to figure out a way to mount these on Soviet era fighter jets that they have so that they can use them and then find a way to be able to control them from a Soviet era cockpit. But crucially, Ukraine has shown that ability already. They did it with the U.S. provided antiradar missiles, and they'll have to do it again here to make this work.

And all of this to be placed in a broader situation, which is the political and economic uncertainty due to the energy crisis and the conflict in Ukraine.

Putin awarding the acting heads of those regions state awards on Tuesday, praising their contribution to the motherland even as Russia's efforts to maintain control of those territory flounders.And as if to hammer that point home, Ukraine's President Zelenskyy held his own awards ceremony on Tuesday for soldiers, actually in one of those annexed regions, in Donetsk. Zelenskyy paid a surprise visit to the town of Bakhmut, an area currently seeing some of the most intense fighting in its war. And President Putin is clearly facing mounting pressure. A day earlier, he actually admitted that the situations in those regions was quite extremely difficult. And amid increasingly regular attacks on Russian soil, he's tightening control at home urging Russia security services to step up surveillance in what he called traitors, spies and saboteurs, and to step up control of the country's borders and strategic facilities. It heads to the end of the year with minimal gains, despite a partial mobilization, Russia's next move in the conflict is the subject of much speculation. On Wednesday Putin is set to meet with the board of his defense ministry. That will be closely watched. Clare Sebastian, CNN -- London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

More than two dozen people have already died and there are hundreds of injured after clashes between protesters and security forces. This wave of demonstrations broke out on December 7th when then president Pedro Castillo, was impeached and arrested after he announced plans to dissolve congress and install an emergency government. He was apparently trying to get ahead of congressional vote on his impeachment. Dina Boluarte, Castillo's vice president was sworn as the new president after his impeachment but she may not last long. This congresswoman says that after so many deaths, Boluarte should resign. The new president says her resignation wouldn't solve anything and cause even more problems. Tuesday night, the Peruvian congress approved the bill to hold national elections in April 2024, two years earlier than scheduled. The Peruvian Supreme Court ruled Friday that former President Castillo must remain in pretrial detention for 18 months after being charged with rebellion and conspiracy which he denies. Mexican foreign minister Marcelo Ebrard confirmed Tuesday, Castillo's family was in Mexico's embassy in Lima and had been granted asylum only hours before the Peruvian congress granted them safe passage to leave Peru. Peru's unrest has brought a vast section of the local economy to a screeching halt, and has also left many tourists stranded due to the fact that protesters have blocked roads and stormed airports.
