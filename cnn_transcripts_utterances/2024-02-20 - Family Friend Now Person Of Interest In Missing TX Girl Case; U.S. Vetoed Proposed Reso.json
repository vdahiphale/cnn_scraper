Linda Thomas-Greenfield made it clear that's one of the reasons the U.S. vetoed this resolution, even though all of the other countries except the UK, voted for it, the UK abstained in this case on this vote.Part of the U.S.'s issue is that a ceasefire right now could disrupt sensitive negotiations that are ongoing to try to secure the release of the hostages. And that's another reason the U.S. vetoed this resolution because it doesn't call for a release of the hostages as part of a call for a ceasefire. Here's what Linda Thomas-Greenfield said in explaining the U.S.'s veto here. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LINDA THOMAS-GREENFIELD, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS: And so, while we cannot support a resolution that would put sensitive negotiations in jeopardy, we look forward to engaging on a text that we believe will address so many of the concerns we all share. A text that can and should be adopted by the council so that we can have a temporary ceasefire as soon as practicable. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Because the U.S. resolution -- and it's unclear when exactly this will be put forward, does not call for an immediate ceasefire. Instead, it calls for that ceasefire, as soon as is practicable.Now, according to Linda Thomas-Greenfield and the White House, this relates to not only the negotiations themselves that are ongoing, even if they don't appear to be on the verge of reaching an agreement here for a temporary ceasefire, but the U.S. has also in its draft resolution calling for more humanitarian aid, as well as calling on Israel not to conduct a ground operation in Rafah in Southern Gaza where more than a million Palestinians have taken refuge in essentially large tent cities that have sprung up to house so many Palestinians here. So, that's part of the issue here. Again, should that ceasefire be now which the U.S. opposes as these negotiations are ongoing? That is what the U.S. is pushing for here. Progress in negotiations, as well as trying to create pressure on Israel not to carry out its ground operation in Rafah. Fred, it's also worth pointing out that the U.S. now, it seems comfortable using the words temporary ceasefire. That's something they had avoided until now.",
