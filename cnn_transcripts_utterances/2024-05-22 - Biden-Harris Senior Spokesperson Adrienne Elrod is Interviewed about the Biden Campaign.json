He says, quote, \"Trump's critics debate whether it's more effective to attack Trump as a threat to democracy, criticizes his unpopular policy ideas, paint him as corrupt or focus on Biden's positive accomplishments. The bizarre thing is that many voters may hear about the controversy and it assumes that it reveals Trump's sympathy for the Third Reich and then vote for him anyway.\" We have seen a lot of willingness from voters to hear these kinds of things that Donald Trump says or alludes to and then seem to not really care about it and vote for him anyway.

They do realize that not only would a Trump second term mean that we are living under an authoritarian regime in some respects because he's literally told us that's what he's going to do. He, of course, Kasie, as you noted, he's made it very clear that he wants to rule as a dictator on day one. He literally put that on Truth Social.You know, he has sympathized with authoritarian leaders. He has admired dictators from across the world. This is a pattern of behavior that is incredibly disturbing. And I think the American people, when they really start to realize, this is not Trump just, you know, saying things for the sake of saying things. This is really Trump saying how he is going to lead our country in a second term if he gets back into the White House. So, President Biden, of course, the contrast could not be more clear. We wanted to make sure that the American people understood what's at stake. We put out a video yesterday. Very simply, President Biden, is his own words, saying this is Nazi Germany language that Trump is lifting up. I am fighting for you, the American people. Trump is fighting to lean into dictators and to be an authoritarian. The contrast could not be more clear. And, by the way, Kasie, the more Donald Trump uses this divisive rhetoric, the more we're going to make sure that everyone in America understands what's at stake and the type of ruler that he would be if he got back into the White House.",

It's a choice between two candidates. President Biden is somebody who has a consistent record of fighting for the American people. I mean we could sit here and tick off a list of his accomplishments that he achieved in the first three-and-a-half years of his - of office. You know, low unemployment, you know, record job creation, over 15 million jobs, four major economic bills. We could go on and on.But what matters, of course, in this election, Kasie, is what President Biden will do in a second term, making sure that he's implementing that agenda, versus Donald Trump, who simply want us to seek political retribution on his enemies, who simply wants to make sure that he can gain as much power as possible by ruling like an authoritarian. Again, we've talked about how he has leaned into dictators. He has said that there will be a bloodbath if President Biden wins reelection and Donald Trump loses. The election cannot be more clear. So, now not only are we running on President Biden's strong record for the American people, but we are running at contrast campaign to make it clear that not only would a Donald Trump second term be very dangerous to the American people, but it would be even worse than his first term because, you know, he's not going to listen to, you know, some of the folks that he brought in, in the first term, he's going to bring people in who seek to implement his agenda, which is dangerous and which is divisive, which is to seek political retribution, which is not to fight for the American people, which is why Joe Biden made that very clear in the video, I care about you.

We've not seen a fatality because of turbulence since about 2021 on a commercial airliner worldwide.But turbulence is a really insidious problem. And the hard thing is that it's invisible. A lot of times a pilot cannot be able to see when it's going to come on. There are a few different causes. Can be things like wind shear, so two different layers of wind moving at different speeds, maybe some - some shear off of a mountain or some terrain nearby. But then there's also the issue of thunderstorms. And that is what investigators are really looking to in a big way here because our data, and data from those who look at meteorology around the world, is that this flight was flying in Myanmar. It's the start of the monsoon season there. The weather really changes very rapidly. And this was in an area where there were some rapidly developing thunderstorms, which have a lot of up and down drafts. It's before the thunderstorm develops. And so that cannot be seen on radar, not only on the ground, but also in the airplane. And so the flight crew could have found themselves in a situation where these thunderstorms were developing with these big changing currents of air and not be able to avoid it in a way that's really rapid to get out of it. The good news here is that airlines have really sort of changed their procedures and they know that this is such a big issue. And so airlines are really forcing their flight crews to really make it so that they have - are spring loaded to deal with turbulence.",

Hunter Biden expected in court today for a hearing in his federal tax evasion case. The president's son has pleaded not guilty to nine counts. His attorney calling the charges nothing more than a political hit job. A guilty plea from one of five Americans who allegedly brought ammunition into Turks and Caicos illegally. All of them face up to 12 years in prison and claim they carried the ammunition in their luggage inadvertently. Los Angeles police opening a criminal investigation into the source of the ketamine that led to Matthew Perry's death. And two federal agencies are assisting. The \"Friends\" star was found floating facedown in his pool last October. Today, a judge in Florida will hear motions to dismiss charges against Donald Trump and his co-defendants in the classified documents case after new photos showed defendant Walt Nauta moving boxes around Mar- a-Lago. Unsealed court documents revealed some of those classified documents were found in Trump's bedroom months after the FBI searched the resort. Molly Ball, these are - these are new pictures of this allegedly - Walt Nauta, the personal aide to Donald Trump down at Mar-a-Lago, also charged in the case, as the judge has basically put this all off until after the election. I mean what is the significance of this? Also these new notes that these boxes - there were boxes found in Trump's bedroom.",

And that's really what's at the heart of this case. It's not so much the, you know, the potentially inadvertent or potential, you know, misunderstanding of the laws around this stuff, it's that he didn't think the rules applied to him.

He was asked repeatedly to give it back before this raid occurs.But in this raid authorization, there's an authorization to use deadly force. And Trump has been also posting about this on his Truth Social page. Can you just kind of clear this up for us.

So I think, you know, he knows that this is a tough issue for him politically, a losing issue for him politically, and so he has sought to sort of triangulate it, find a middle path, reassure voters and that he doesn't want to further - further restrict things.
