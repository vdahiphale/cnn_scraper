      "sentences": "Debate. And they point to the fact that they believe that the risk of him attending the debate is actually more than him skipping the debate.And you talk about his poll numbers. It's something we know that Trump has talked about himself. This commanding lead that the former president has when it comes to the Republican primary. And they say that while there might be a breakout star, there might be a star that has a moment during this debate, they look at that lead and they don't believe that it would be enough to close that gap that Trump is leading by. They also talk about the fact that Trump himself, if he's on the stage, automatically, they believe, will become the punching bag, which they think makes it harder if he's actually not on that stage. Now, I spoke to a lot of Republican operatives who said that they hoped that he would still attend. They were holding out hope, even though there was this reporting that he was not going to attend. And even hours before he posted, we heard from the RNC chairwoman. Take a listen to what she said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And we have talked to a number of these political advisers for these campaigns who said that they were really preparing for both scenarios, Trump on stage and Trump not on stage.And as you said, Sara, a lot of this is how to seize some of the spotlight back in this race. How to try and get traction. How to differentiate themselves from the former president. It will be interesting to see how they do that. It will also be interesting to see how much Trump is still a focus of this debate, even if he is not there, Sara.",

      "sentences": "So, Sara, a brand-new poll out of Iowa. The poll considered the gold standard in polling in the first caucus state. This comes from \"The Des Moines Register.\" And it shows Donald Trump with the largest lead at this stage since the 2000 contest won by George W. Bush. You can see 42 percent say Trump is their top choice, Ron DeSantis down at 19, everyone else behind that.I'm joined now by former White House senior policy adviser Ashley Allison, and CNN political commentator S.E. Cupp. It is great to see both of you this morning. S.E., I want to start with you because when you look at that poll, what's interesting is that Trump's numbers actually got better -- actually got better after the Georgia indictment. He was at 38 percent before the indictment. He went up to 43 after. DeSantis went down after the indictment. So, if you're DeSantis or any of the others looking up at Trump this morning in Iowa, what are you thinking? S.E. CUPP, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: You're thinking it might be time to change your campaign strategy of not hitting Donald Trump. The light touches have not worked. The light criticism without naming him haven't worked. They're not differentiating themselves from one another and they're not taking on the front runner, which is how you win. So, as long as they want to keep sort of whiffing and pretending Trump isn't maybe going to go to prison at some point soon, I think they're all going to be living in the basement for the next few months.",

They asked Trump voters, who do you feel what they tell you is true? In other words, who do you trust the most when they tell you something? Trump leads with 71 percent. He's beating your friends and family who are at 63 percent, religious leaders down to 42 percent. Trump voters believe Donald Trump more than they believe mom and dad or their local minister.

I think that's really important. And both of those two figures have unique backgrounds and opportunities to differentiate themselves.All eyes will definitely be on Ron DeSantis because the hype was so high for his candidacy and he has underperformed. So, to see him answering tough questions and against other competitors will be important for his campaign. I think a turning point potentially for his campaign. And, yes, I think everyone's going to get an equal opportunity on that debate stage to make their case. But they have to do just that. And what I've been saying is, you don't even have to fully attack Donald Trump to do it. You have to say, I know you like Donald Trump. I like him, too. But he might be going to prison. Let's elect someone who won't be going to prison. That's - that's a real simple thing to say and not, you know, tick off a bunch of Trump voters in the process by just being honest and stating the obvious. I hope at least one person on that stage will do that.",

And then, obviously, go and attack Joe Biden because you actually have to beat Joe Biden to be the president of the United States. It means nothing if you're at the top of the ticket for the Republican Party but then you lose on general election day. You have fought a good fight, but you have not won the actual battle. So, you need to actually attack Donald Trump to just unseat him and his lead, but then really look at the whole pack and start to tick away folks one by one.",

Fifty-five hundred flights nationwide delayed yesterday. Largely a result of this now post-tropical cyclone.But today we are still seeing some pretty big numbers. Just checked Flight Aware, 268 delays in the U.S., 790 cancellations -- 790 delays, 286 cancellations. Those numbers are going up a little bit. The worst airplanes, and we're not really out of the woods yet, San Diego, Harry Reid in Las Vegas, Ontario in the L.A. basin, also John Wayne, Santa Ana, Bob Hope, those airports in Burbank are really getting hit hard. We've seen about 14 percent of flights canceled out of San Diego, about 23 percent of flights canceled today out of Ontario. This is why Southwest Airlines is getting hit especially hard. True to the name, they've canceled about 17 percent of their flights yesterday. We're talking about 714 flights in total. So, they will still have to play catch up today. And the airline on its website is warning of diverts, delays, cancellations as the day goes on. Also why airlines have offered these travel waivers, allowing you to change your flights free of charge, especially if your plans change because of this storm. American, United, Southwest, Alaska have all put into place these travel waivers. So, you can rechange your flights without much penalty. Although we're not totally out of the woods yet here, Sara. The FAA warning of ground stops today as the day goes on in the wake of this storm. Big winds expected in Las Vegas. Also low cloud ceilings in San Francisco.
