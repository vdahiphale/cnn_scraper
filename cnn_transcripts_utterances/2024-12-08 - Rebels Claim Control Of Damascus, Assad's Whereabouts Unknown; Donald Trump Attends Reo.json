      "sentences": "Yeah. I mean, if you sort of go back to the beginning, 1971, when Hafez Assad takes control of the country and is a brutal dictator. So when he hands off to one of his sons and by the way Bashar al-Assad wasn't the chosen son, but the sort of right, tough minded son died in a in a car crash, so Assad, who trained as an eye doctor in London and not seen as a strong character by members of the, you know, sort of ruling elite in the country anyway, took control. He was challenged as part of the Arab spring in 2011 on the streets by popular protests, wanting to remove him, and he doubled down in brutality, taking, you know, chapter and verse from what his father had done, turning guns on the on -- on the -- on the unarmed protesters, civilians putting leaders in jail and a year later, when that didn't work, turning tanks and artillery pieces on towns of civilians.Remember witnessing some of that in and around Damascus in 2012. It continued to be brutal but his -- his grip was slipping because he didn't have the majority of forces. That's when Russia came to his aid. Iran a long time ally of Assad and the Syrian government also stepped in bringing their forces their own fighters in. And both of them were investing money heavily into the -- into the country in business enterprises, but also in, in keeping Assad alive. But what really changed recently are a number of things. The rebels got better trained, they got better organized. They talked to each other. They reformed from where they had splintered in the past and they took advantage of the fact that Russia was no longer able to give Assad the full support that he needed. The military support on the ground because they were distracted with their massive war in Ukraine. And Iran through its proxy Hezbollah in Lebanon, and its also proxies inside of Syria, have been badly bruised and bloodied by challenging Israel and, you know, Israel has been involved in bombing many, many Iranian interest sites, weapons transfer depots, weapons -- weapons warehouses all across Syria. It's massively weakened that support structure for Assad. So when the rebels broke out of that enclave organized, you know, able to communicate across the whole geography of the country and direct forces that went and did a job and then were ready to move on to the next target that their leadership gave them in a coordinated way, were effective in challenging Assad's troops, who not backed up by outside help, fell by the wayside. And literally, as we saw today, overnight, 2,000 Syrian army soldiers in military trucks driving into neighboring, Iraq towing heavy weapons. I mean, this is utterly unheard of to complete that circle of thought, 53 years of brutal Assad dictatorship. I don't think anyone ever expected to see his army fold and collapse, turn tail and haul it out of the country into a neighboring country. So this, this -- this is, in essence, what brought Assad down and brought us to the point of where were at.",

And there are many people who are waking up as daylight hits there at the beginning of a new chapter for the Syrian world, a new chapter that that the country has not known for, for decades, really, at this point.I want to get your perspective to on, as you see, sort of the numbers that we have up on screen, the internally displaced over 7 million in Syria and other countries as well. But let's talk about the region, because I thought you -- I thought you put it well in regards to what happens in Syria, does not stay in Syria as far as impact goes. I wonder where you see the first the first impacts of what's happening here start hitting in the most significant ways in the days and weeks to come?",

These are in many ways two sister countries that whose fates have been intertwined. The late Samir Kassir, a political thinker in Lebanon that was assassinated by the Syrian regime, used to very famously say that there is no salvation in Lebanon without freedom in nearby Syria. So in Lebanon where Hezbollah looms large, trained and armed by Iran, now loses its strategic depth in Syria. And so, for its future influence in Lebanon, for Iranian influence and ability to project power into the Levant, this is a game changer. Certainly, Israel also where Syria shares the frontiers, Israel to Syria's south is impacted, and we're already seeing that there is movement via the Israeli military to perhaps expand a zone in southern Syria to create some kind of buffer zone, worried that some of these rebel factions might create instability across the border. But what my sources tell me is that the rebel factions have already formed special units to secure the frontiers, both with Israel and with Lebanon, not wanting any further instability at this moment but wanting to focus on consolidating power within Syria.",

Of course today seems to be when they when they've captured the city of Damascus. But of course, tomorrow and the weeks ahead of how you govern with this power is a completely separate question in itself. The last thing I want to ask you actually is, is on that portion of things because we have heard from the Syrian prime minister who says that the government stands ready to Cooperate with any leadership the people choose. I wonder how you interpret that type of statement coming from a senior government official, while the whereabouts of Assad are still unknown, when we haven't heard from Assad at this point. How do you interpret the comments of an official like that?",

It points to some kind of communication between the remnants of the regime and the rebel forces that have entered the city, and it is a positive indication of perhaps an orderly transfer of power.But I am here in Doha, Qatar, today where in fact the leaders of the various countries that have influence in Syria, the United States, Russia, the Iranian foreign minister, the Saudi foreign ministers and others have been convening and meeting to discuss how to influence that orderly transition in Syria. And there is a call for a constitutional process, a political process that would bring in the various elements of Syria, including the opposition. The challenge here, though, is that HTS continues to be the rebel, the main rebel force, continues to be a foreign designated terrorist groups for many of these nations. So it's going to be tricky business for many of these countries of historic influence in Syria, Turkey, I should have mentioned one of them, of how to deal with an organization that has historically been deemed a terrorist one, and the political -- the outside political opposition does not currently have much influence on the ground.",

Whether that was the intention of Jolani, who is the operational commander of the insurgent forces, and he intentionally wanted to transmit a message? No, but what it creates is an entirely different international situation in Syria, so that you have forces, these forces date back to the beginning of the contest of wills between Assad and the Free Syrian Army back in 2011. This was sort of an expression, if you recall, of the Arab spring, a little late, but an expression of the Arab spring.And now, you have this elim -- I can't use the term elimination. You have Assad on the move. As I read the reports, he has departed -- exited from Damascus. But it does say something about those forces, the Iranian forces, the Russians, and, of course, Hezbollah, who have consistently supported Assad as part of the strategy of those three to protect their interests. You know, that Russia has a naval base. It has an, Air Force Base in Syria. Russia was confident about its relationships with Assad. Now, all of that is put asunder. So if I were sitting in Moscow and doing an assessment or sitting in Tehran and looking at an assessment, you have complete destabilization.

I want to continue the conversation now with Ryan Crocker. He's a former U.S. ambassador to Syria, as well as former ambassador to Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan. He joins us now from Doha, Qatar. Thank you for being here. I want to start actually with your with your time as U.S. ambassador to Syria, because if I'm not mistaken I believe it overlapped with the time that Bashar al-Assad actually came to power in Syria in 2000. And I wonder how you compare that moment from when he first rose to power, I guess exceeded power from his father at that point to how we've arrived to this moment now, almost 25 years later? RYAN CROCKER, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO AFGHANISTAN, IRAQ, PAKISTAN &amp; SYRIA:  I actually got to know Bashar a bit before he became president. In the last year of Hafez al-Assad's life, when I was ambassador to Syria, I was asked to meet with Bashar, and we had several meetings, just the two of us that went on for hours. And again, I think that Assad was preparing for his own demise. And trying to introduce his son, who had not been chosen for the leadership role to the ways of the world particularly the wicked ways of the West, led by the United States. And I came away from those conversations thinking that, boy, we've got the conventional wisdom on Bashar wrong. We seem to think that because he knows how to turn on a computer and studied some post-doctoral ophthalmological studies in London that he was a nascent liberal Westerner. My conversation indicated the opposite, that he was every bit as committed to the rule that his father had founded, and even less flexible. So what happened next didn't really surprise me, sadly.",

Again, history is important and history in Syria includes the brutal suppression of the Muslim Brotherhood in Hama in February 1982, when Bashar's father ringed the city with forces loyal to the regime to destroy the Muslim brothers.And they did pretty much. But they also destroyed the city of Hama, the fourth largest city in Syria and as many as 30,000, almost all Sunni Muslim civilians. So that was an early indicator of how the Assad regime would control internal order with extreme brutality and sadly, it was like father like son.",

And the -- for the refugees and for the internally displaced you're talking about 14 million out of a population of 23, that's insane. They are so ecstatic to be able to come back home. Right now, as the rebels swept through Aleppo and Homs and Hama and liberated now Damascus in the entirety of Syria, IDPs have already been returning home and the refugees across Europe, many of them so many friends that I've spoken to are packing their bags and excited to be able to go back home to a place that is safe of the tyrant Bashar al-Assad and his allies. And the one place, I would say now in the Middle East that has a hope for democracy out of any of these Arab countries in the Middle East, many of which tried to save Assad up to the last minute and they're just so proud. I'm so proud. One of those refugees, is you know, is Caesar (ph). I was -- he's the person who exposed Assad's killing of men, women and children and elderly in horrible prisons. And, you know, we were just on the phone crying that now Caesar can even tell the world who he really is. So for the millions of refugees in the region and in Europe, it's time for them to come home.
