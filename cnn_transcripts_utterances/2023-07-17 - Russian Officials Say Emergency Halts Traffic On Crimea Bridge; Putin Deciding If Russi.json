At the moment, they're focused on this reasonableness bill that I mentioned earlier. But they're not yet talking about, for example, something that they did talk about in the past, which was how do we even appoint our Supreme Court justices, so changing the whole judicial appointments process in Israel and other parts of the larger package or reform.

This week, the internal Knesset committee will hold further discussions to finalize the final version of that bill that's supposed to be brought to a Knesset vote in the Israeli parliament, either Sunday or Monday of next week.

Extreme weather around the world is bringing dangerous flooding, wild fires and heat wave to several continents. In Asia, a powerful heat wave impacting China and Japan. China has not recorded its highest temperature ever. Just over 52 degrees Celsius at one location. Meanwhile, in southern Europe, an oppressive impressive heat wave comes right in the midst of a busy summer tour season. Climate scientists say temperatures could reach the hottest ever reported in Europe, as high as 48 degrees Celsius in Sicily and Sardinia. People in France, Greece, Turkey, Croatia and Spain also sweltering. On the Spanish island of L Palma, an out of control forest fire making matters worse, forcing at least 4,000 people to evacuate. In places sweltering under the stifling heat wave, doctors say they are treating more and more people for serious burns. CNN's Fredricka spoke earlier with Dr. Kevin Foster, a burn surgeon to explained how contact with extremely hot surfaces can cause unexpected injuries. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. KEVIN FOSTER, BURN SURGEON: Well, anything that is exposed to direct sunlight, and directly to the heat can cause pretty bad burn. But the things that we see are people who fall down onto hot asphalt, on to concrete. People who touch hot things in direct sunlight, for instance, door handles, upholstery inside of cars -- anything that you could think of. Water in your hose coming out is oftentimes close to boiling. So the biggest problem we're having right now and our biggest problem in the summertime is asphalt and concrete.

The other thing that is really bad for patients is that if they go down and they can't get up, oftentimes they suffer heat shock by their internal temperature going up far beyond normal.
