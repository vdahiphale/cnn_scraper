Stand by for new details on the blast and the search for a motive. Plus, we're learning about a very high level warning to law enforcement officials last month about potential vehicle ramming attacks over the holidays. I'll discuss these breaking stories with the U.S. Homeland Security secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas. He joins us live this hour. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. We begin this hour with two major breaking stories, the investigations into the deadly truck-ramming attack in New Orleans and the Cybertruck explosion in Las Vegas, authorities so far finding no definitive link, despite some very striking similarities. CNN's Natasha Chen is standing by in Las Vegas, but, first, let's go to CNN's Ryan Young. He has new information on the New Orleans attack. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

He said just before the summer, so only a few months ago. And they're going to want to talk to his family, because in the five recorded messages he posted to social media just in the hour-and- a-half before the ramming attack, he indicated that he had planned to gather his family together and killed them and then changed his mind and tried to make it into a political, you know, extremist statement associated with ISIS. But what we want to do is piece together his life, which from initial reports included financial ruin and two divorces and way behind on his bills, failed businesses, and look at how that void in his life left him open to radicalization, what was going on in his life in the last six months. Could it have been avoided? Was there leakage? Were there postings, you know, in his writings on social media that could have indicated it.

It looks like it was hastily done, particularly when you look at the evidence in the back of the truck. And so I don't think this individual planned this out very well.

One thing I'm interested in is whether he cased this location out, whether he planned in advance the exact location that he would use this truck to ram into a crowd of people. So, they could have done that, which is why I've said on a number of occasions, what's important is for city leaders to evaluate the security plan around the corner, evaluate the security plan around downtown New Orleans, to determine very quickly what enhancements and fortifications are needed.",

And there is the possibility of conflict, of a fight or something happening between the corruption investigation office that wants to bring in South Koreas elected president for questioning about what happened a month ago, the declaration of martial law and a potential conflict between the people who protect him. There is no plan, Wolf. No understanding between how these two entities interact and the elected president of South Korea, albeit suspended because he's going through impeachment.
