Well, Poppy, traditionally, in the weeks leading up to an election, the Justice Department does not take any overt action in cases that could have political consequences. Though over the past several weeks behind the scenes, the Biden Justice Department has been quiet planning how to best handle several of their most politically charged cases.And sources tell CNN that justice officials had even discussed whether they should appoint a special counsel to oversee the investigations into former President Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election and his alleged mishandling of national security documents kept at his Mar-a-Lago home. Now, officials have debated whether doing so could potentially insulate the Justice Department from accusations that the Biden administration is targeting his chief political rival, especially as Trump inches closer to a potential 2024 run. But a special counsel would ultimately still report to the attorney general, and as we saw with the Mueller probe into Trump/Russia connections in 2016, special counsels are certainly not immune from political attacks. So, even though we're in this so-called quiet period at the Justice Department, they are still staffing up their investigations with experienced prosecutors, they're using aggressive grand jury subpoenas and even secret court battles to compel testimony from witnesses in both Trump probes.",

But what we will see on Tuesday night is that this is going to be a lot of red first. Why? Because in Pennsylvania, the elections officials are not even allowed to open up process and begin counting all the absentee mail vote until the polls open on Tuesday. That's not true in every state but a state like Pennsylvania, which could prove critical, as you know, that means the processing doesn't even begin until Tuesday morning. It's going to take a while.We know Republicans tend to show up in greater numbers on Election Day in-person. Democrats tend to show up in greater numbers in the pre- election vote, that absentee by mail or in-person vote. So, if they're counting the Election Day vote, which we expect that they will in Pennsylvania, this is going to be very favorable to Republicans initially. And then as the absentee vote, which we still think -- it's not the height of the pandemic like 2020, but it's going to be substantial. That will start to fill in with the Democratic vote.",

There is a lot of enthusiasm for my candidacy. We're traveling all across our state with 100 counties and really meeting folks and talking about the things that matter most to folks here in North Carolina. So, I'm just really pleased. We are doing really well and Ted Budd and his national Republican allies know that. That's why they're spending millions of dollars to distort my judicial record. I've been a judge for over two decades and served as chief justice of the Supreme Court of North Carolina. I've had two successful statewide contested races here in the state.
