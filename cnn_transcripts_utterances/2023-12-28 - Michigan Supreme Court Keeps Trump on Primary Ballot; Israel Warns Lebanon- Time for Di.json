It's a decision that differs from the one that was reached by the Colorado Supreme Court last week. Trump responding in an interview, he was not surprised by the ruling. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)",

She is set to issue a decision in the coming days.This is all, of course, as DOJ prosecutors in Trump's federal election subversion case moved to block him from using the court as a form to sow disinformation. Let's bring in senior politics reporter from \"Axios\", Eugene Scott. Eugene, good morning to you. I hope you had a wonderful holiday week. So, let's talk about these dueling decisions about Trump's eligibility. Of course, the U.S. Supreme Court is likely going to have to weigh in on this. Can you help us understand the Michigan Supreme Court reasoning for the rejection and why it is different from what we saw in Colorado? EUGENE SCOTT, SENIOR POLITICS REPORTER, AXIOS:  Sure. In Michigan there is no qualification that requires a candidate proves certain things to actually be on the ballot. Whereas, in Colorado, you do have to meet a certain qualifications in terms of the Constitution. And so, these cases never were going to be the same. Trump is hoping that most of these cases rule the way that Michigan does and don't have a requirement regarding qualifications. That would work in his favor, just like this one did. But, we'll see what the Supreme Court says. Ultimately, that will influence all of these cases in terms of what can actually happen.",

And Trump is understandable.His concerns, his fears are understandable because she is the most powerful election official in the state and what she has rules, what she says can be based on, or will likely be based on what she has said in the past regarding his role in this incident.",

He asked the court yesterday, were said in a filing, quote, the court should not permit the defendant to turn the courtroom into a forum in which he propagates irrelevant disinformation and should reject his attempts to reject politics into this proceeding. Trump responded by calling the motion a pathetic attempt to take away his First Amendment right.

I, mean what they decide, what jurors, what they decide will be based on what they hear in this courtroom and if they hear misinformation coming from the former president, that could lead to a mistrial and disrupt the entire case that Smith is bringing forward. Ultimately, that is part of the goal of Trump's defense team, in part, because he has been making the argument since all of these were put forward that he is the subject of partisan attacks.And so, if you can get that message through well in court, there is a chance that his team hopes that someone in the jury will hear that, believe that, and vote accordingly.",

[05Because we're going to be past Iowa, past New Hampshire. We may get delayed past Super Tuesday, or the trial may be starting right around then. There are no cameras in this courtroom, but you can see Smith's point in saying that this is going to be a forum in the middle of an incredibly tense moment for the country, for the president to be able to say these things or not.

As you know, this has been a real issue and concern for him, for him being Trump, has when he is appeared in court, when he's been on campaign rallies and not being able to stick to facts.And therefore disrupt what has been put forward as reasons and justification for why he should be, in this case, in the situation in the first place.

Tensions on Israel's northern border with Lebanon continue to escalate. Hezbollah says that it fired 30 rockets, but it was in response to an earlier IDF airstrike on a Lebanese village. In Gaza, nearly 200 more Palestinians have been killed following Israeli strikes over the last 24 hours, according to the Hamas health ministry. A warning, the images you're about to see are disturbing. Families mourning their dead at one of the few working hospitals in Khan Younis. Others preying ahead of a burial amid ongoing shelling. Also, this new video on social media appears to show Palestinian men and at least two children detained and stripped by Israeli forces. All of this as Secretary of State Antony Blinken is expected to head back to Israel in the next week with visits planned to the occupied West Bank, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Qatar. CNN's Nada Bashir joins us now from London on this. Nada, good morning to you. Blinken's trip comes after he and senior U.S. officials met with Ron Dermer, of course, a close confidant of the Israeli prime minister. The White House says that talks included a transition to a different phase of war. What do you take that to mean? Because Israel's military chief, just yesterday, said, quote, the war will continue for many months. What do we expect?",

That certainly is in jeopardy.Now, just in the last few days, we have seen, of course, an intensification of those hostilities in exchange for shelling. Hezbollah saying they have targeted Israeli military positions across the border and, of course, we did see those airstrikes, as well, carried out by the Israeli military in southern Lebanon. The Israeli military say they had carried out strikes against Hezbollah positions along the border. Lebanese national media reported that at least three people were killed and Hezbollah later claiming that at least one of those was a Hezbollah fighter. Now, there is serious concern, the Israeli officials and Israeli military officials have said that they are looking at options on the table, as you heard there from Benny Gantz, or cabinet member warning that time is running out. The foreign ministry, as well, say they are looking at their options, the first being a political solution, but the second being a military solution in which they say the Israeli military would seek to remove Hezbollah from the region entirely along that border region, more specifically. And, of course, there is concern about the spilling of this war, the overspilling of this war across the region. We have seen hostilities intensifying the U.S., of course, raising concern around the targeting of U.S. military positions, both in Iraq and, of course, in Syria, by what they say to be, they are Iran-backed proxy groups in the region.",
