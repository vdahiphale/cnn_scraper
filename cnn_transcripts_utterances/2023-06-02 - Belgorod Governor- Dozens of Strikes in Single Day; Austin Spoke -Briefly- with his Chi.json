This hour Ukrainian official's say war has reached Russia while they deny involvement in attacks inside Russian territory. The Russian president is calling on his country to prevent destabilization from its enemies. The cult leader accused of encouraging his followers to starve themselves is in court in Kenya today, investigators have so far found nearly 250 bodies in a forest area. The United States and South Korea are holding their largest ever live fire drills near the border with North Korea. CNN is on the ground. The gates of war have opened in Russia, those words from a Ukrainian official. Ukraine, however, insists increasing attacks inside Russia's Belgrade region are the work of dissident Russians.

But of course, Christina amidst all this, it's very important to remember that on both sides, it's very often civilians that are bearing some of the heaviest prices. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KILEY (voice over): Grief has struck again in Kyiv overwhelming grief when a loved one is taken. Three people killed here at 3 a.m. civilians ran for cover.

He was telling his followers that the world was ending right about now in fact, and started the allegation say telling them to start fasting; he said the children should stop eating first. They're more than 70 bodies of young and older children in a morgue close to where I'm standing as well that show the impact, more than 240 remains have been already exhumed from this cult following in the Shakahola forest. You know, the Kenyan press is calling it the Shakahola massacre, but really the indications point that this was an orchestrated suicide and possible multiple murder cult that has broken families in this and many parts of Kenya. And this was a wide spectrum of people who believed this pastor, and that the world was ending, including professionals, flight attendants. There were policemen there, according to survivors and their families and social workers, all who believe that the world was coming to an end.

The drumbeat of strikes is also continuing in the Ukrainian capital residence of Kyiv seeking shelter here in a subway station.

And Nigeria's government is terrifying its plans to end fuel subsidies. This after the country's new president made an apparent off the cuff remark that triggered panic buying which nearly tripled the price. During his inauguration speech on Monday, the president declared the fuel subsidy \"Gone\". Now the government says that won't happen until the end of this month. Let's bring in our Senior Africa Editor Stephanie Busari with the details. And Stephanie, perhaps safe to say the president did not think through the impact of his words when he made them.

So you know, some people may say that it's a bit of a strategic move on his part, to just rip the band aid off if you like. But what many agree is that the fuel subsidy is untenable. It's very expensive. It costs Nigeria, around $867 million every month, and the country is in massive debt, debt about $100 billion in debt and using a large part of its revenue just to service debt, so many agree that the subsidy has to go.

We've been working a little bit with people in the Arabian Peninsula as well to try and understand how far it is a way. And then you know, if it does so happen to be something that is moved around by boating transport, perhaps coming up with better practices for mitigating that, for example, releasing your ballast water, well off shore, not nowhere near ports, which I believe is current practice. But perhaps there's other ways that has been introduced into these regions. We do see this disease manifests predominantly around ports and harbors at the moment.
