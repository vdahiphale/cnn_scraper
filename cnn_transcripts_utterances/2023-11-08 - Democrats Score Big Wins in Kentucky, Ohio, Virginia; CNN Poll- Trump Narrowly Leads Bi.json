Is that just Ohio, just abortion, or is that a push for Dems across the nation that helps them into 2024? LATOSHA BROWN, CO-FOUNDER, BLACK VOTES MATTER: You know, I think when we're looking at voters now, I think voters are a little bit more nuanced and sophisticated than sometimes the polls actually pick up. And so while I do think that abortion has been a key issue, not only we saw that in the midterms, but we saw it last night, that I think women and young voters in particular are over-performing -- are performing or responding to that. But I also think that there are other issues, as well. Marijuana passed, the legalization of marijuana passed, actually, in Ohio.

I think the issues we've seen play out across the country isn't really a good issue to talk about for Republicans. We haven't really figured out our cadence yet. We have made abortion about a primary, and it seems like we just continue to hammer the issue of abortion in -- through the lens of being -- running a primary.

Abortion also a critical issue in the governor's race in Kentucky and in the state legislature races throughout Virginia. Let's start with Ohio. We had the 2020 map up for a reason, because this is very clearly a red state. It has been moving in that direction cycle after cycle after cycle. Donald Trump in 2020 winning by 475,000 volts. So what happens when you put it to this actual ballot initiative itself? This wasn't even close. When it came to a constitutional right to abortion, the \"yes\" won by 500,000 votes. And here's what's most interesting here. I think this is what people trying to go county by county and pick out the data are looking at right now. If you look at the counties that Donald Trump won in 2020, these -- everything that's highlights in orange and green are counties that Trump won in this red state of Ohio. Everything that's green, these are Trump-won counties that voted in favor last night, underscoring the ability of this issue to just drive voters in favor of abortion rights. It's something we've seen repeatedly over the course of the last year. Whether it's in Kansas, whether it's Montana, whether it's in Michigan, whether it's in Kentucky. We saw it again in Ohio. Now, what about the governor's race? Because this is also a critical race to consider going forward. Now, when you talk about Andy Beshear, keep in mind, he was an incumbent. He is a popular incumbent, and that is important. But what also is important is when you look at the margin. Beshear running on abortion, the state's restrictive abortion law that Daniel Cameron had shown support for. He won, and he won handily: 66,000 votes ahead, boosting his margins, not just in blue districts that you see here but also minimizing his bleed in districts that are traditionally Republican. Want to compare it? Well, 2019, only won by 5,000 votes. Republicans would tell you Daniel Cameron is a much better candidate. Beshear beating Cameron by a significant margin. What about those state legislature races? We talked about Glenn Youngkin and that push there. Well, Glenn Youngkin wanted to flip a chamber and end up having a full trifecta. Not only did he not flip one, he lost a chamber. Now Democrats are in control of the state Senate, holding control there, but also flipping the state House. And what does that tell you? Well, most of these Democrats were running on abortion, running on a number of issues. But Youngkin tried to threat the needle, thought he could go on offense on the issue, at least according to the results last night in Virginia and Kentucky, and Ohio. That didn't work -- Poppy.",

There are still serious head winds, though, facing President Biden's reelection campaign.There was a brand-new CNN national poll this morning, and it shows Donald Trump beating Biden in a hypothetical rematch, 49-45. And when it comes to favorability ratings, both candidates are underwater: 39 percent favorable, versus unfavorable for Biden. Trump, not too far off, 38 percent favorable, versus 56 percent unfavorable. Still, what this poll makes clear is that Americans see Biden's weakness as Trump's strength. On whether the candidate has the stamina and the sharpness to serve effectively, only a quarter of Americans back Biden, compared to 53 percent who say Trump has that. And on being an effective world leader, Biden comes in at 36 percent. Trump comes in at 48 percent. Meanwhile, we are seeing the same trends nationally that we saw in those swing state polls from \"The New York Times\" and Siena College. Biden losing support among key groups that helped him win in 2020, like younger voters, voters younger than 35, where Trump leads by a point. But in 2020, Biden won that group by 24 points. Among black voters, 73 percent favor Biden. That number was 87 percent for Biden in 2020. And Latino voters, they're split. Fifty percent say Biden, 46 percent say Trump. That's a 4-point margin. In 2020, Biden won that group by 33 points. And as of right now, there appears to be a big enthusiasm gap.

But people have concerns about costs. They have concerns about inflation. The president certainly knows that and is focused on addressing what people are feeling in their day-to-day lives. But I think, as an electoral matter, if you're making decisions about how you turn out your voters, yesterday was a good road map. I mean, voters yesterday had concerns about the economy, but they turned out in droves to reject the Republican agenda on abortion. And again, in support of some of these core planks of the Biden economic agenda. So it is a confounding challenge, absolutely. There is a huge disconnect between how people feel about the economy, and, you know, what on paper is a strong economy, something the campaign and the White House grapple with.
