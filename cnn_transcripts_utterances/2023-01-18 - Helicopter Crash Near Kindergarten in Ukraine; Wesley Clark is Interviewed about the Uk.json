They've been there for hours now combing through the wreckage of that kindergarten, looking to see whether there might be more bodies under the rubble that was caused when this helicopter crashed into this kindergarten early this morning. We know that at least 17 people have been killed, nine of them were on board the helicopter. Everyone on that helicopter was killed. That includes the interior minister of Ukraine, Denys Monastyrskyy, the deputy interior minister, the secretary of state of the interior ministry, six others. But also on the ground, parents and children, people who were dropping their kids off at school. At least four children known to have been killed so far. And what we're really waiting to try to get a better sense of now is,how did this happen? Why did this happen? We know the weather was bad. That there was very thick fog this morning. We know that Ukraine's SBU, the security services, have opened an investigation trying to ascertain how this happened. They're not ruling anything out so far. But there is no indication at this stage at least that there was foul play or anything like that involved.",

And joining me now is former NATO supreme allied commander and retired general, Wesley Clark. General, thank you so much for joining us. So, we know that the interior minister is now the highest ranked official to have been killed since the war began. The investigation into this crash is just getting underway. I'm curious to get your thoughts, though, on whether you think this will change or at least officials will have to think twice about how they travel to and from different parts of this country given that it is constantly bombarded. GEN. WESLEY CLARK (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, I think that they've been very careful in using helicopters up to now. The Pumas (ph) are a reliable helicopter. It's not new. It's not an old Soviet helicopter. It's a western helicopter. So, yes, there could be a mechanical malfunction. The weather is always a factor. They've got to look at the weather. My guess is the pilots were pretty experienced and they're probably used to flying through tough weather. So, they're going to have to look very seriously at this. This would have been, if it was sabotage, it would certainly have been a key strike because you've taken out the top of the interior ministry. And that's the ministry that's responsible for internal security in Ukraine. So, it has a definite impact. And I'm sure President Zelenskyy and his team are going to do the best they can to replace those individuals as rapidly as possible and keep the functioning of the interior ministry.",

At least at the current expenditure rates. So, we're going to have to get up our industrial base to be able to do this.Can we do it? Will we do it? It's part of the larger question, Bianna, of, will the United States change its policy? Thus far we've only tried to prevent a loss for Ukraine. Will we actually give them what they need to eject Russia? That's the question. And to do that we have to be willing to accept the risk of Putin's outbursts, his threats, his nuclear threats, et cetera. And that's going to be, if not on the table, an underlying factor in the discussion today.",

And we're expecting prosecutors to essentially explain how they came to be able to charge Brian Walshe with murdering his wife, but also improper transfer -- transport of a body. Now, of course, the questions that remain, as evidence has sort of stacked up against Brian Walshe over the last two and a half weeks is, what is now linking him to the murder? Is evidence that they found at that transport center an hour outside of their home, Cohasset, linked now to the home where they also found bloody traces in the basement of their home? Did they find a body? These are all questions that we still have and wonder if prosecutors will sort of give answers to as this arraignment gets underway. So, again, now, two new charges against Brian Walshe. That will be laid out in court today. He's already been held behind bars on that original charge of misleading investigators. And a short time ago, we did see him go into court. The way the court works here, guys, in Norfolk County is it gets underway at 9:00 but it's up to the judge to set the schedule. So it's very unclear exactly what time he'll appear before the judge.",

Are there bone fragments or other things that get us from, well, there was blood to there was a body and it might have been dismembered.

And when you look at the chart of the Producer Price Inflation, this is running half the level it was at the peak. That's important. That is really showing you that the worst of the price increases are behind us.And when I dig into the core number, this next chart is one of my very favorites because three of the last six months you have had prices decline from one month to another.
