At least a million people can't access their funds. He is denying defrauding customers. The lawsuit alleges they did not properly disclose the scope and amount of compensation they personally received in exchange for the promotion of FTX. One of the plaintiffs in the proposed class action suit, Michael Livieratos, says, \"As a New England Patriots fan my entire life, you can imagine the influence that Tom Brady would have,\" claiming he moved nearly all his money from another crypto exchange to FTX. Adam Moskowitz, the lawyer representing the plaintiffs, told The Washington Post \"You have very rich people we all love telling us that they checked this out and it was okay. Why shouldn't they be held responsible?\" This is just the tip of the iceberg for the crypto fallout.

So, there are people who are absolutely flying, who are going out to eat, who are going to hotels. But in my opinion, they're putting that on their credit cards. And they're doing it because of why? They had so much in savings during the pandemic because we subsidized them in every possible way. They didn't have to pay their mortgages. They didn't have to pay their student loan.
