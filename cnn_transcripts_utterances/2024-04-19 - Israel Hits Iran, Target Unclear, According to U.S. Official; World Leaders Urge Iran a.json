      "sentences": "Back now to our top story today. U.S. official says, Israel carried out an overnight military strike inside Iran. Authorities say, three drones were successfully shot down near the city of Isfahan. Iranian state media is downplaying the impact of the strike, saying the situation in the city is normal and that their nuclear program sites are secure.Secretary of State Tony Blinken said this morning that the U.S. was not involved in any offensive operation in Iran. As of now, the Israeli military said it was unable to comment and Tehran has not identified a source behind this attack. Still, this is another sign of rising tensions between Israel and Iran and further raises the threat of a broader conflict in the Middle East. Joining me now, Former Defense Secretary under President Obama, Former CIA Director Leon Panetta. Mr. Secretary, what is -- what's your reaction to all of this? I mean, was this a bit of a gamble on the part of Israel might have gone, you know, spectacularly awful way? I mean, it didn't do a whole lot, and both sides are sort of saying, OK, we're moving on now. But I -- it could have ended up, you know, a lot worse.",

      "sentences": "Well, there's no question that the rules of engagement have changed in that part of the world. I mean, we've just had, not only Israel striking an embassy complex in Damascus, but Iran then striking back with 300 missiles into Israel. And now, Israel has struck at a target in Iran.Having said that, it also appears that Israel did pay attention to a lot of the warnings from the world, not to dramatically escalate the response. This was a pretty targeted effort, aimed at hitting a target in Iran near the nuclear facilities, and sending a message to Iran. They've kept their mouth shut. They haven't claimed any kind of victory here. They're keeping quiet. And at the same time, Iran does not appear willing to respond. So, I think the hope is that perhaps we have achieved some kind of rough balance at this point. And that perhaps deterrence has been reestablished.",

      "sentences": "I mean, the reality is that both sides have, in the past, been much more targeted. Israel has used more targeted assassination efforts and going after specific targets. And Iran basically relied on their proxies to respond. That may no longer be the case.I mean, I know they will try to get back to that. But once you have crossed the line, and you have actually attacked targets in another country, it gets very hard when something else now happens for those advising the leadership in both countries to say, wait a minute. This requires a direct attack as opposed to some kind of reduced proxy attack. So, once that appetite is there, I think it increases the danger. It doesn't reduce it.",

I have to imagine, Mr. Secretary, if the Iranians are more successful next time around, and perhaps they telegraphed it last weekend in a way that it was repelled, but next time around, if it doesn't work out that way, the U.S. could get drawn in. What kind of advice would you give the president, the administration in a scenario like that? Are we jumping too far ahead of ourselves? What do you think?",

      "sentences": "Well, I think we're probably looking at two paths forward, Jim, at this point. One is that, you know, I do believe that the better path would be to have Israel reinforce that coalition that came together that, in effect, really put together the defense of Israel by 99 percent knocking down those missiles.It's a great coalition. It's made up of the United States and Great Britain and France, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, UAE. I consider that a great coalition for Israel to be able to work with, not only in dealing with Iran, but in dealing with terrorism generally. So, if Israel is smart and relies on that coalition, I think there's a way to bring the war to -- in Gaza to an end, to look forward to what happens in the next chapter in Gaza, and hopefully resolve some of these terrible humanitarian issues that still need to be dealt with. That's the hopeful path.",

There are always efforts to try to upset the cart. I mean, nothing has changed in the relationship. It's still antagonistic.And if something happens, if there is an action that takes place, either by a proxy or by the players themselves, then I think it's Katie bar the door. Because both sides know that they have been successful at hitting targets in the other country. And although Iran has more questions, I -- make no mistake about it, Iran is trying to figure out what they have to do to be able to penetrate Israel and be able to effectively hit those targets. What Israel did show is that they could penetrate Iran and that Iran could not take defensive action. So, there are a lot of questions that have been raised here as a result of these efforts. And the question is going to be whether the leadership Wants to maintain a period of balance or whether or not they're going to continue to try to hit each other.",

We saw that happen in an unprecedented fashion last fall to Kevin McCarthy.Now, there are threats on the far right to Mike Johnson's speakership. Two Republicans have come out in support of it. Marjorie Taylor Greene leading that effort. The question is going to be whether or not she goes forward. She can call that vote at any time. It had to be taken within two legislative days. And then what happens then? Will Democrats vote with Republicans to kill that effort? That is the expectation. But the Democratic leaders are not saying if they will do that, hoping to extract more concessions from Mike Johnson in the process. But that is the drama that is playing out. But the significance of this vote right now, moving forward on this massive aid package as Ukraine says it desperately needs this money right now. Jim.",

The important thing to note here is that Donald Trump is under a gag order, sure. But his millions of followers, and particularly some very high-profile right wing social media influencers, are not under that gag order.And remember, we are getting information about these jurors that we are specifically not putting out because we don't want to release any kind of identifying information. However, when it comes to what the actual rules are, other than naming where exactly they work, the judge just said use common sense. So, we are using our best common sense to make sure the identity is protected, but that does not mean that these right-wing social media influencers who have access to the same information are going to use the same level of, \"Common sense,\" on what they put out, which could be a problem for the jury. And also, it really does give Donald Trump this extra megaphone without him actually having to put forward. And that's really what we've also seen with him in his actual violations, or at least what the prosecution says is violations of the gag order is him reposting other people's posts about the witnesses, et cetera.
