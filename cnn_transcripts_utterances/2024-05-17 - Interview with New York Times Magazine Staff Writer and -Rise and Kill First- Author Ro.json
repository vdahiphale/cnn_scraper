We understand from the IDF spokesman that their bodies were found in a tunnel. The narrative that he has of what happened, I think, really underscores just the brutal nature of every day that the families have to wait for information because what Daniel Hagari has said here is that they were murdered and it was their bodies that were taken to Gaza on October the 7th. So, these more than 200 days since where their families have been wondering where they were, were they in a tunnel, were they getting enough food, were they being brutalized? They'd heard the experiences of the other hostages who were released late last year, built up their hopes, had their hopes dashed, built their hopes up, had their hopes dashed campaign day and night for the government to focus on bringing their loved ones home. And it comes to this. and the information is shocking, I think, in itself that Daniel Higari said they did manage to survive the Nova Music Festival and run away, as a number of people did, and getting 10, 15 minutes away in their car and taking refuge amiss a film -- a kibbutz that was so close in some ways to putting them in a place of safety, yet it wasn't, because that had been overrun as well. And I remember driving past that kibbutz just a couple of days after October 7th and there were vehicles strewn in the road, shot up baby strollers in the road. It was chaos and carnage there. So, for these families now, this is the knowledge that their loved ones have been found that their bodies have been recovered. And another phase, if you will, of their suffering can begin after they can give them a dignified burial at home. It's what all the families are asking for.",

Just last week, Hamas said that they'd signed up to a hostage release deal thatIsrael hadn't been party to the details of and wasn't in the scope of what they were set to or willing to agree to. But what Hamas did by literally setting out how many hostages and which hostages, not by name, but by category, would be released and how many of their prisoners they would want released really built the hopes up for so many families that a deal was sort of almost within grasp. Again, another very brutal moment and a manipulation by Hamas. Certainly, that's what most people -- how most people interpret it. But it also put pressure on the government and for the public. There was polling last week that said, rather than another military operation in Rafah to clear out the last of Hamas and get to the leadership there, the majority of people in Israel, surveyed in that poll, said that they wanted a deal to release the hostages. So, this really heightens that. And for hostage families now, one of the main forums have said, look, the recovery of these three and the bringing home of their remains for burial in Israel is just a reminder that that's what we want. We want all of them brought back to Israel. So, I think part, you have that real pressure on the government, public pressure on the streets, demonstrations that they should cut a deal and not go for the military option at the moment. And the IDF this week in Gaza and ongoing battles, losing a number of soldiers. So, there's a real need to show by the government and the IDF that they really are getting something done, they are bringing some of the hostages home. And it's a pressure on the Prime Minister as well to show that he does prioritize the hostages, even though many people think that that's not at the top of his list.",

I mean, for Palestinians, historically, the conviction rate in military courts is in the '90s. For your piece, you bring data that shows the conviction rates for Israelis accused of violence, and let me read for it. Yesh Din, an Israeli human rights group, looking at more than 1,600 cases of settler violence in the West Bank between 2005 and 2023 found that just 3 percent ended in a conviction.

Christiane spoke with the artist amid a major retrospective of his work at London's prestigious Royal Academy. We look back now at their conversation about his work and how art can provide people a place to reflect on themselves and the sometimes chaotic world around us. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, here is a baby almost removed from the chest or the stomach of the mother and placed onto the Earth. And I think the baby is immensely peaceful. It seems to be at ease, and yet, at the same time, as you say, it's extremely vulnerable.
