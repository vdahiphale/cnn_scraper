      "sentences": "You are live in the \"CNN Newsroom.\" I'm Jim Acosta in Washington. Good evening. We begin the hour with mounting political and policy challenges for President Biden. There is the threat of a looming government shutdown in a week, the widening strike by the United Auto Workers Union, and a growing immigration crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border.Not to mention the latest polls find the president in a battle to win re-election. The nation's capital is buzzing over a new and controversial ABC News/Washington Post polls showing Biden 10 points behind former President Donald Trump in a head-to-head matchup of registered voters. Even \"The Washington Post\" acknowledges its own poll might be an outlier, as a similar new NBC News poll shows them tied at 46 percent. Joining us now to talk about this is Democratic Congresswoman Debbie Dingell of Michigan. Congresswoman, thank you very much for sharing a part of your Sunday with us. We appreciate it. You're in a key battleground state. There was a lot of fuss over Michigan the last time around. Are you worried about these polls? REP. DEBBIE DINGELL (D-MI): So, first of all, Jim, you were talking to the woman that everybody said was crazy when I told people that Donald Trump could and then would win Michigan in 2015, 2016. Polls are, you know, a snapshot in time. I didn't believe them. Everybody believed the polls and they didn't believe me. So, we're a year out. It's -- I think it's going to be close. Michigan is not a blue state. We are a purple state. I take this election next year very seriously, but I just laugh at these polls because I've been right. I have good gut instinct and I've been right and a lot of polls have been wrong. ACOSTA: I hear you. I know that feeling sometimes, but let me ask you this, not to spend too much time on these polls, but this NBC poll shows Trump and Biden tied at 46 percent and Biden supporters obviously will find that more encouraging. But how remarkable is it that this race appears to be deadlocked, even with the former president facing 91 criminal charges and four separate cases? How do you account for that? How do you explain that? Have you picked up on this from voters in Michigan?",

And Democrats did a terrible job of talking about trade. I will take him head on the subject of electric vehicles.We are competing in a global marketplace. He says there'll be 100 percent built in China. Other countries are at more than 50 percent of the vehicles being bought, our electric vehicles. I'm going to make them -- make sure I do everything to make sure they're built here in America with good paying union worker jobs. He doesn't -- he talks a good game.

We don't have separate appropriation bills because the same group ofpeople won't allow them even to be considered. We keep killing the rules to even consider individual appropriation bills. I believe it's irresponsible. It's not a way to run our government. It threatens so many aspects, starting with our national security. I will do anything I can to keep the government open, but I will not vote for a bill that satisfies this small group of people and would do serious damage, permanent damage, to everything from our national security, to the air traffic controllers, to the TSA, the food we eat, our health care, et cetera.

I think if you look at 2016, 2020, and now quite likely 2024, if it's a Trump- Biden rematch, there's going to be a very large group of people who don't like either candidate. And the winner of the election will be the person they dislike least. I mean, it's a bad way to run the railroad, but both parties are on course to do it. I wish it weren't so clear that Trump was even with Biden because for those of us who don't want to see Trump as the Republican nominee, this weakness on the part of the incumbent president simply spurs Trump's followers on to say we can beat him.",

And depending on how that goes, in another 50 years beyond that, it could very well have our number painted on it. And we need to watch Bennu very carefully. It's one of those near-Earth objects. Now, this is an asteroid that won't cause a dinosaur-like extinction event, but it would. It's about the size of the Empire State Building and would cause a huge regional catastrophe. So, it's important that NASA keep a close eye on Bennu.",

The former president is leading his next closest competitor, Ron DeSantis, by a whopping 43 points. All of the other candidates in the race are in single digits.Joining us now to talk about this is Republican presidential candidate, former Texas Congressman Will Hurd. Congressman, great to see you as always. We appreciate it. I hate to do a lot of poll questions here, but I just want to delve into these numbers. And, you know, this poll we were just showing a few moments ago, showing Trump just way out in front of the field, is this race over?",

There are still many weeks before the first state start having voting.But when you start drilling down in some of the early states, let's take a place like New Hampshire, that lead narrows pretty significantly. And when you see about those Trump voters, yes, he has a -- I always call it about 30% of hardcore support that no matter what, they're going to support them -- support him. But there's other -- there's a whole lot of other folks that voted for Donald Trump twice, recognized that he has a lot of baggage, and wants to see some of the other candidates and what they have to offer. And that's why we can accept this, Donald Trump as a nominee, as a fait accompli, because ultimately, two-thirds of Americans do not want to see a rematch between Joe Biden and Donald Trump. The problem is only 23% of Americans vote in primaries. We need to get those folks that vote in general elections to start thinking about the primary vote now. And if you're -- if you're watching in New Hampshire, Iowa, Nevada, South Carolina, and now Super Tuesday is going to be important in this vote, we need more people voting. If you want to have better options in November, now is the option. I'm hoping I can be one of those -- one of those folks. I have 24 hours to get 300 more donors that hit the 50,000 unique donor- threshold. I'm hoping some of your viewers go to hurdforamerica.com, give me at least $1 to have someone like me meet those requirements to get down to the debate stage.",

But if we put up Donald Trump, I think we're giving four more years to Joe Biden. ACOSTA: Let me drill down on that a little bit. This Wednesday, the second republican primary debate will be held at the Reagan Presidential Library in California. What is going on with Trump skipping these debates?

And this is a continuing example of Donald Trump not caring about the men and women who put on the uniform and protect us. Whether it's how he criticized John McCain, how he's criticizing General Milley, how he's telling secretaries of defense not to bring wounded soldiers in front of him because he doesn't want to see that, to me, that's absolutely disgusting. And the worst of all that is the fact that he would willingly have classified documents that men and women of our intelligence services, of our military put themselves in harm's way. And I think this makes him unfit for office. And one of the reasons that I'm running for president, because Donald Trump is not trying to make America great again. Donald Trump is trying to stay out of prison. And all of this drama, you know, the people that are enjoying it are adversaries like China and Russia. And because we have to continue to talk about these crazy things Donald Trump has done, it prevents us from having real conversations to ensure that America continues to exist the way we've known it for the next 247 years.",

They say that they want 12 individual bills to come to the floor. Well, guess what? Where have they been the last six months when those were being negotiated in the Appropriations Committee? They're actually preventing those bills from coming to the floor by preventing the procedural bill from happening so that you could have an up and down vote on these bills. So, these are people that want to see chaos. They want to see Kevin McCarthy fail. And to be honest, they're talking about how -- they're trying to be fiscal conservatives. Shutdowns have proven to cost more money. The last three shutdowns have cost about $4 billion. That's absolutely insane. So, the thing that these frauds are saying that they're trying to do before, they're actually bringing it on the American people. And they're going to be the ones that get blamed.
