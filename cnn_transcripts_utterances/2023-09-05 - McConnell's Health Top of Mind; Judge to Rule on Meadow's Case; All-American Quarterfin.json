There are a number of items on their short list to address, including avoiding a government shutdown in less than a month. Top of mind is Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's health. The Republican senator has frozen twice in front of reporters this summer, raising questions about his age, his health and his ability to effectively lead.CNN Capitol Hill reporter Melanie Zanona joins us now. It's been really fascinating to follow the Republican leadership response to this, Melanie, since it happened last to Mitch McConnell. And the fact that he's going to talk to them, obviously. But already talked to a number of them on the phone about this over the recess.",

And he is going to deliver his weekly press conference tomorrow. He's going to deliver his floor remarks later today. So, his performance, of course, is going to be heavily scrutinized. And then he's also going to be facing his own members for the first time. They have their weekly party lunches. There could also be a special conference meeting to specifically talk about his leadership and his health. And members still have a lot of questions about what is really going on and whether he is up to the job of leading them. So, this is going to be just a critical moment for Mitch McConnell to really tamp down speculation about both his health and his political future. But politics aside, there's also a ton of legislative business. Congress is racing to avoid a shutdown at the end of this month. And they are nowhere near close to completing their work on their annual spending bill. So, a short-term spending patch is going to be needed. But even that is proving to be complicated, guys, because one of the chief sticking points right now is whether a supplemental funding package, that includes both disaster aid and Ukraine money is going to be attached. So, it's going to be a huge showdown between House conserves and Senate Democrats and Republicans.",

      "sentences": "Well, this morning, we're also closely watching for a major ruling out of Georgia. At any moment a federal district judge could rule on Mark Meadows request to move his election subversion case out of Fulton County and into federal court. Both Meadows and DA Fani Willis gave the judge the additional briefs he asked for last week. Now we're just waiting to see how the judge rules. Before now, Meadows is set to be arraigned in court tomorrow, along with any of the other defendants who haven't waived their right to an arraignment. As we reported last week, Donald Trump has waived his and submitted a not guilty plea in writing.Let's bring in former senior investigative counsel for the January 6th Committee, and former federal prosecutor, Temidayo Aganga-Williams, and deputy chief of staff for former Congressman Adam Kinzinger, Maura Gillespie, and former executive director of the New York City Democratic Party, Basil Smikle. Guys, thanks for joining us. Temidayo, to start with you. Remind people what's at stake here in this Meadows element of the Georgia case specifically. Why we are waiting, to some degree with baited breath, in terms of what will happen next. TEMIDAYO AGANGA-WILLIAMS, FORMER SENIOR INVESTIGATIVE COUNSEL, JANUARY 6TH SELECT COMMITTEE: So, there's a criminal statute that allows an individual charged with state crimes, if that person is a federal officer and is charged for a crime that was conducted under color of law, meaning they -- they basically did the thing they're charged with because they were a federal employee, they can go to a court and say, I want to remove that case to federal court for basically a neutral jury, a neutral forum. And you can think way back when, more old time days, where folks were really concerned that states wouldn't be fair to the federal government. So, Mark Meadows is saying, I want my case out of Georgia court. Doesn't make it a federal case. He's going to have the same prosecutors. He's going to have the same criminal exposure. But it does put it before a different jury that's going to be likely a little bit more conservative than a Fulton County jury. It's going to be in the federal court, which is not where Fani Willis and her team are used to practicing. Why it's very important is that once it gets into federal court, one of the reasons why it would be in federal court is because he is what's called a colorable federal defense, which basically means there's some basis for him to have a defense in federal law against these state law charges. That's super important because once he gets to federal court, the court has acknowledged that he has at least a potential federal defense. Now, when he's there, he's going to assert that defense, which he already has. And if he's successful, that means those charges are fully dismissed. Now that becomes even more important because former President Trump is watching. Other federal employees, like Jeffrey Clark, who were also charged with crimes in Georgia, are going to be keeping an eye on that. And if that's successful, Fani Willis could have a whole swath of her cases removed and then dismissed in federal court. But it is a close call. I mean the judge has asked for supplemental briefing, which for lawyers, if a judge asks for you to brief an issue even more, that means the judge thinks it's not clear. He's basically say, I need your help. Go and dig deeper into case law. Find me support so I know which way to go. But I think everyone right now pretty has what's effectively a coin toss here to see whether this case is going to move or it's going to just stay in state court and proceed as expected.",

I mean this could put Fani Willis' whole probe in peril, no?AGANGA-WILLIAMS: It puts - it potentially could. I think the difference, though, that the former president has from Mark Meadows is that he has far more charges, right? So it's not - you're going to be looking at each act and each charge to see whether it falls under the gambit of this statute. So, I think the former president is in a different situation here because these charges are far more expansive and include a lot of conduct. If you remember, Mark Meadows has said, I just made a phone call here, and that's my job. I set up a meeting. I was just being chief of staff. But I think it's going to be tougher for the former president to look at all this conduct he's charged with and saying, I was faithfully executing the laws of the United States, because as many folks will know, the federal government doesn't have a role in conducting Georgia state elections, right?",

Do they -- will they feel that he going to federal court, whether it's Meadows and/or Trump, if they feel that hear again the ring leaders of all that we witnessed on January 6th are not being held accountable and, by the way, the folks who say, well, I did what I was told are the ones that are going to be punished and effectively let the ring leaders, if you will, off the hook.

But the difference, Phil, is, those platforms are so heavily reliant on ads from small and medium size businesses that aren't going to be called out, and so they haven't had big impacts on their businesses when there were boycotts and threats. For Elon Musk and Twitter, this is a serious business problem. The vast majority of Twitter's revenue comes from those big brands that can't afford to ignore messages like this from the ADL.",
