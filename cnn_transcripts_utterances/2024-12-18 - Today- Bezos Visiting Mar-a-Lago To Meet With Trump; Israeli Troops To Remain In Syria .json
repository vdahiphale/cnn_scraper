That's typically almost always their position.But this is really forecasting that there are going to be a lot of difficulties for Republicans to govern over the next two years. Now, Republicans are very excited saying they have this mandate in Washington with this trifecta, but they still have to deal with extremely slim margins. Plus, the filibuster in the Senate. Just talking about the House for starters, Republicans are going to have an even slimmer majority come next year. It's going to be 217 to 215, because Matt Gaetz is not taking the oath of office.",

Debt limit -- debt -- may send shivers up people's spines, but debt limit is likely going to come up next year. Again, we remember what kind of mess that was two years ago.

It was in 1973 that, you know, Israel last had control of the mountain after the Yom Kippur War. And, you know, a lot of hardliners in Israel feel they should never have let go of its possession. But this was part of the negotiation with Syria, all of which in, you know, Netanyahu's view is redundant now because the regime has gone away.So, you know, they have to find a new way of securing their own positions. And, you know, you can just see the views from there. You can see across these countries, you can see crucially across the buffer zone, which is meant to protect, you know, a safety zone really, between Syria and Israel. If there were any skirmishes. So it's strategically important, but symbolically it's so important as well. And when they talk about staying there as long as is required, until Israel is safe, it's going to be very difficult to see a situation where certainly someone like Netanyahu or some conservatives in Israel would be willing to give it up again because they've done it before and they feel they shouldn't have done it the first time.",

So, you know, all the sensitive points are the ones we've talked about before. You know, obviously Israel wants to get the hostages out. That's a priority.So which hostages are released? At what point? And during the different phases trying to tie that in with the withdrawal of Israeli troops, it appears that on the Hamas side, they've accepted that there will still be some Israeli troops in Gaza after all of this, but they're just trying to agree on which areas they pull out of and which areas the Gazans can move back into, into the north, for example. So lots of, you know, the broad principles seem to be there, as they have been for some time. But certainly the sounds are that they're getting some sort of agreement on those key crucial issues. And who knows? You know, if it speeds up, you could have a Donald Trump coming into power with hostages being released at the same time.",
