They charged him with involuntary manslaughter in the death of Jewish protester, Paul Kessler.Earlier this month, Kessler fell backward and he hit his head on the ground following an altercation during dueling protests over the Israel-Hamas war. Alnaji is expected to make his first court appearance today. CNN's Stephanie Elam is in Ventura County where the district attorney and county sheriff just spoke about this.

But obviously, they're saying more charges could be filed. And they continue to ask for the public's help, if they have any more video, any more images of what transpired in that intersection. Just again, to reiterate, it was a pro-Palestinian protest where there were a few pro-Israeli protesters, counter protesters, who showed up and that's where they intermingled and something transpired that ultimately led to Paul Kessler's death.",
