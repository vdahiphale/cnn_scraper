So the question is, do those political bodies have the final say here or can state courts step in?And, Ana, what's especially concerning to some people about this is just how far Republicans are trying to take this theory. Because in 2020, as you mentioned, you know, Trump supporters tried to push that it could even mean state legislatures could decide the electors in battleground states, potentially up ending the popular vote here. So it's a wide-ranging theory. We'll have to see how the Supreme Court interprets this and what they might allow.",

Gore, Chief Justice William Rehnquist.And in the last few years, Republicans have been pushing this during the 2020 election, especially during the 2020 election. And this North Carolina redistricting case, apparently, Republicans saw the perfect opportunity to use it as a platform for pushing this theory. They've been successful getting it now to the Supreme Court. The question is, how will these justices interpret it? Will they let be a wide-ranging theory? You asked about, how are the conservative justices leaning? I think it comes down to the chief justice, John Roberts, as well as Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. They're the ones, during the argument -- and they just wrapped up -- they seem to be pushing back a little bit and might try to rein in this theory. Maybe let Republicans have a bit of a win but maybe not go as far as the Republicans are pushing for here. (CROSSTALK)",

And many of our staff are women and/or members of the LGBTQ-plus community.\" Now, this group, on the other hand, is comparing the restaurant's decision to a time when people were denied service because of their race.

It is not illegal in Virginia to refuse service because of someone's political beliefs or really any other reason. What is illegal is discriminating against groups on the basis of their religion or race, sex, disability status or national origin.

And of course, this is not just a Walmart problem. Right? Target has said shoplifting is up by 50 percent. The industry tracks what they call shrinkage, which is lost inventory due to shoplifting, fraud and other issues. Shrinkage was $94 billion last year alone. Not just random shoplifters. They say organized crime is on the rise. And this is actually fueling a bit of a cat-and-mouse game because we've seen that drugstores have started to lock up everyday items like toothpaste, deodorant, even aluminum foil because it keeps getting stolen.
