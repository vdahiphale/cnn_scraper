      "sentences": "Well, Kate, here Durham goes through the steps that the FBI took in the course of this investigation and he criticizes them again and again, but he doesn't bring forth many new criticisms or really any significant new evidence.One key thing he really focuses on, though, is that he faults the FBI for opening a full investigation into possible links between the Trump campaign and Russia. He says that they should have proceeded with a preliminary review instead. Now, that requires a lower threshold to begin, but also means that agents don't have access to more invasive tools, like FISA surveillance warrants. And he nods that, yes, they did have enough to open a preliminary review at this time, but he faults them for not taking the usual steps, including not interviewing relevant witnesses, not reviewing its own intelligence databases or using any of the standard analytical tools typically employed by the FBI in evaluating raw intelligence. He says that instead the FBI relied on raw, unanalyzed and uncorroborated intelligence to open a full-blown investigation. And he also says that the FBI didn't have proof of any collusion when it opened this investigation. But, of course, Kate, that is often the case that when you initially start investigating alleged crimes, you may not necessarily have evidence of that crime at the outset. Now, he did not find any evidence of a grand conspiracy against former President Trump and he's not bringing forth any additional charges. Now, so far his years' long investigation has resulted in one minor conviction and two trial losses.",

It's why in response to the IG, inspector general's, 2019 report, we undertook more than 40 corrective actions and have since made dozens more.Now, Durham is particularly critical of senior FBI officials who were in office at this time. It's important to note, Kate, that many of the people who were in charge at the FBI at the time this began, they're no longer there. But Durham said that he believed that some people in the FBI at that time had a political bias that resulted in sort of a confirmation bias against the former president. Now, I will note that throughout the Mueller investigation it was Republicans, Trump-appointed Republicans, who were in charge at the FBI and the Justice Department. Now, of course, this report will continue to be battered about in political circles. We know that top House Republican Jim Jordan has asked the Justice Department to have Durham come and testify next week. So, we can expect that former President Trump and his allies will continue to use these findings, however nuanced, for their political objectives, even though they did not result in the blockbuster revelations that the former president had promised.",

As Paula noted, Durham indicted three people, Igor Danchenko and Michael Sussmann, they were charged with lying to the FBI, they were both found not guilty, and a mid-level FBI lawyer, Kevin Clinesmith, pleaded guilty to doctoring an email about a surveillance warrant.

So, he's going to talk about the Fed's messaging. He will apologize.You remember that Fed regulators have said that this is just bad management at some of these banks. That's what took them down. I'm sure you will hear Congress members, senators actually here, grill these CEOs. We'll also hear from the Signature Bank founder and the former CEO there about what went wrong at Signature Bank. So, two kind of separate instances, but both banks that were niche banks catering to a certain kind of client and then suddenly the rug was pulled out. You'll also hear from the Silicon Valley Bank CEO that the speed of the withdrawals, he's going to say that, I do not believe any bank could survive a run - a bank run of that velocity and magnitude, which was far beyond historical precedence.

The island became the first jurisdiction in Asia to legalize same-sex marriage and now the Taiwanese legislature has passed a bill that grants same-sex couples all the rights surrounding adopting a child. Previously only heterosexual couples and single people were given full adoption rights. Now to New Zealand. A fire in a hospital has killed six people and at least five others were injured. Dozens more remain unaccounted for. Hostiles are often frequented by young people looking for inexpensive ways to travel. The deadly incident happened in the capital city of Wellington. The cause of that fire, unknown. In Myanmar, at least 41 people are dead and dozens more are missing after a cyclone hit the southeast Asian nation. The death toll is expected to climb significantly with at least one rescue group saying they're bracing for a large-scale loss of life there. The cyclone, which barreled into Myanmar's coast on Sunday, is one of the strongest storms to ever hit that country. Kate.",
