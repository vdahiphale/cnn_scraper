Airman First Class Jack Teixeira's family had nothing to say leaving Federal Court today in Boston. Earlier, they watched him brought in shackles before a Judge. He entered no plea to a pair of charges under the Espionage Act, unauthorized retention and transmission of National Defense Information and unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents and material. He'll remain in custody until a detention hearing next Wednesday. As the hearing ended, a man in the courtroom shouted, \"Love you, Jack.\" Teixeira did not look back but responded, \"You too, Dad.\" According to the government's Court filing unsealed say the IT specialist received top secret security clearance in 2021 and may have had access to more sensitive material. The filing says he \"maintained sensitive compartmented access to other highly classified programs.\" And then, he began posting classified documents in December of last year. They showed up on the social media platform, Discord. The filing says he used his real name and home address in his billing information on the site. President Biden today issued a statement saying in part, \"I've directed our military and Intelligence Community to take steps to further secure and limit distribution of sensitive information, and our National Security team is closely coordinating with our partners and allies.\" He also weighed in late today on his way home from Ireland.

You really have a five-day case, in a case, you know, a leak investigation can go on for weeks or months.But it starts with the disclosures that this stuff is out there, the FBI comes into it Sunday night, going into Monday morning, and they start with dropping subpoenas and search warrants on Discord who owns the servers to A., preserve anything they have so it can't be deleted, and B., turned over subscriber information and any content. That leads them to some IP addresses and other connections. But basically, by Monday, they're at the home of an 18-year-old boy in California. He is a member of this server, and they're talking to him, his mom, and his lawyer. And finally, they agree he is going to sit down and cooperate with the FBI. And what he tells them was, I was part of this group, we were gamers, we did war games online. The guy who ran it was this guy, OG, or Original Gangster, meaning the senior member of the crew, and I did have a video chat with him. And his name was Jack and he worked on a military base. And during the video chat, which goes back to January, he said, you know, I was copying these classified documents so I could put them in the chat room so you guys could see them. But I realized, you know, I'm going to get caught literally kind of transcribing them at work. So to shortcut the process, I started bringing the classified documents home and then just photographing them. I mean, ironically, the thing he was doing to not arouse suspicion ultimately leads to him being caught because you know, the document I looked at said TS, top secret, HCI Human Compartmented Information that's information from human sources, SI, signals information picked up by groups like the NSA. TK, talent keyhole that satellites from the National Geospatial Agency, NOFORN, don't distribute to any country outside the Five Eyes. So this material is what was going out there, and the billing address and the name for the server was Jack Teixeira at that address in Massachusetts. Yesterday, they circled back to the 18-year-old and they show him an array of still photos, a lineup and they say which one of these faces is the guy you know as Jack? He pointed to the person that they identified as Teixeira that gave them the final piece of probable cause to move in which of course we've all seen on video how that went yesterday.",

Obviously, if you had any contact with foreign entity, stuff like that, but somebody so young was such kind of an empty slate, more than likely, you know, tripped no red flags.

It also supersedes its decision by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals to maintain access to mifepristone, but under older, more restrictive rules. Justice Alito stayed the ruling until 11:59, Wednesday night, while the Court considers an emergency appeal from the Biden administration.

Just think of what's happened over the last seven days since we first got that ruling from Judge Kacsmaryk in Texas, there's been so much confusion, there have been conflicting rulings. It truly has been cast in the idea of what would be available to women beginning tonight, which was when his order was going to take effect. So this just gives everyone a chance to pause. It's only five days, but it is a way for the Justices themselves to take a serious look at the briefs and decide should they themselves hear oral arguments? Should they let this play out at the Fifth Circuit, which is already now scheduled its own set of oral arguments for May 17th? What should be the next course of action? Of course, what the Department of Justice would like is for the Justices to make sure that these Lower Court rulings that went against the Food and Drug Administration essentially allow Judges themselves to put themselves in the shoes of the FDA, rather than have the expertise of the agency prevail, whether the Court will actually interfere with that, Anderson.",

We're going to defer to them.

That he wants to be laser focused on that.And this is of course a chance for him to really test out any enthusiasm, what enthusiasm there might be for his brand of leadership should he jump into the race later this year. And I did talk to some people who were in the crowd just to kind of take their temperature. And one gentleman I talked to said that he was very impressed with the list of deliverables that DeSantis had, that that was impactful for him to hear about the things that he had promised to do and then things that he had accomplished.",

But it's shocking to see them on this trek, particularly given the knowledge that adults struggle to complete it.Often adults die, indeed, on this sort of trek. Wilson, the boy, you saw that? Yes, a couple of days later. I was deeply troubled that he may have been permanently separated from his parents, but we did magically see them back together again. But this is often the issue here, that parents who are deeply struggling to move themselves, their own equipment, their own food, sometimes engage porters to carry their children for them. And those porters are a lot faster, race off ahead and then, in Wilson's case, end up separated. His case ended happily, but we do hear of others where that separation doesn't end in final reunification, Anderson.",

It's exceptionally physically grueling, even if the only thing you -- I had to do in my case was carry a light backpack and talk to people as you move. We kept seeing parents carrying all the food their family might need. Sometimes their children as well, walking at times with flip flops, croc type shoes, small backpacks, football shirts, startling at time to see exactly how poorly equipped some people seem to enter this particular challenge. A lot of that is down, I think, to the sort of propaganda, the sales campaign, that the cartels, the human traffickers, this what is basically is voluntary, but a large trafficking operation. What they say to people before they undertake it, that it's not going to be that hard, that it's going to be a few days. You don't have to really pack that much. And then they enter this. They see the terrain, they see how much longer it possibly is than they had ever remotely imagined. How much more food and everything they should really be requiring.
