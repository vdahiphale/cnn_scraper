Conditions have been called apocalyptic and are life-threatening. Major bridges in Tampa are closing as they get lashed with waves.And this, this is what winds of 125 miles per hour look like. You can see the gusts driving the rain and at one point sending debris flying across this parking lot. This is happening in Perry, Florida. The water this hour still rising with storm surges up to 16 feet possible in some areas. Now, just about one hour ago, white caps were just starting to hit the front yard of this orange home in Steinhatchee. Within 30 minutes, the water now nearing the roof line.",

      "sentences": "Yes, the images we're seeing right now are simply unprecedented. This is historic because Idalia is now the strongest storm to make landfall in the Big Bend region in 125 years. We want to take you to the region now.CNN News Central Anchors John Berman and Sara Sidner are kicking off our live team coverage. John is in Tallahassee. Sara is a bit further south in Crystal River. Let's go straight to John Berman now. John, what are you seeing where you are?",

      "sentences": "Yes. Boris, Rahel, thanks so much. I'm in Tallahassee, the capital of Florida, where it is raining at times heavily, where the wind has been picking up. Gusts here have been 40 to 50 miles per hour. Tallahassee has never been hit with hurricane force winds. Unclear if that will happen as the storm is now passing south and a little bit to the east of here.But Tallahassee will be very much in this severe storm zone for several hours. The major concern, and the thing I think we want to stress all morning long, is the danger from Hurricane Idalia is not over, and in fact, might very well be increasing right along the coast. The storm made landfall in Keaton Beach, but in Steinhatchee and other areas along the Gulf Coast, the storm surge could increase over the next several hours. The water levels could rise over the next several hours as the tide goes up and as that wind. Even though the eye of the storm has moved inland, not far from where I am right now, even though the eye has moved inland, the winds are still moving in the direction, pushing the water up on the shore. So this is still a very dangerous storm. And there are certain areas we don't have eyes on yet to know how bad the storm surge is, even as it continues to get worse. As I said, here in Tallahassee, the Capitol, this is where Governor Ron DeSantis and other state officials are coordinating the storm response, they can't get out much right now. They can't really move around even here because there are times -- and you will see over the next few hours -- there are times when the bands move through here and the wind is coming in from this direction, blowing debris, and the rain is falling and is simply blinding. They're expecting 6 to 10 inches of rain here, which could lead to severe freshwater flooding, puddling and things. They don't want people out. They don't want people driving. There are trees, big, beautiful trees, in some cases all over this city and this inland region. So many reports now of trees down, major tree damage in areas. So getting around, getting the response teams to the places they need to be, whether it be in the inland areas or along the coast where the storm surge is, will be very, very difficult. As Boris and Rahel said, we've got people all over the Gulf Coast and now inland as the storm moves in them. Here's some wind coming in to cover this storm as it moves through into Georgia. I'm in Tallahassee. Let's go down the coast. Sara Sidner is in Crystal River. Sara experiencing, I think, some of that storm surge.",

Chad Myers keeps on telling us -- Chad Myers keeps telling us the moon is closer to Earth than it's been, which is making the tides more powerful, which is the exact wrong time for this.To emphasize what Sara is saying, the storm surge is happening right now and getting worse. I just got word that Idalia is now a Category 2 storm. As it moves inland, the wind speeds are decreasing. But as bad as the wind is about 100-105 miles per hour, that's not the story that we're most concerned about right now. It is the storm surge. I'm going to go to Bill Weir, who's in Steinhatchee right on the coast. Bill, I was with you there last night. I just saw pictures of where we were standing last night. The water is now over where our heads were, substantially over where our heads were. Just tell us what you're seeing.",

Bill, I just want to ask while I have you, you say the Steinhatchee now moving inland. The water is flowing inland with the storm surge as it is. If it continues to get worse, what is worse like there? Can you even fathom what it would be like if this goes up another 2 feet, 3 feet, 4 feet?",

Sort of the old fishing shacks are here, but there's also retiree communities. Prefabricated mobile home type places are no match for this storm surge.I'm looking across the river and there's some newer construction up on stilts. It looks like they're going to be OK. So again, there's always those neighborhoods that show what resilience looks like for those who put in that initial investment. But again, this is sort of one of the least populated areas of Florida. So if there's any kind of silver lining, it's not like a major center like Tampa taking the brunt of this, but that's cold comfort to the people who live here and are worried about everything they have.",

It is a treacherous situation in Steinhatchee, and again predicted to get worse.As Bill just mentioned, the population in Steinhatchee is anywhere from 500 people to 1,000, depending on the seasons. It's not much. It's a very sparsely populated area all along where Idalia made landfall. It's a different story as you move further south. Tampa is not where it made landfall per se, but it is experiencing very dangerous storm surge. Let's go to Derek Van Dam who is there? Derek, what are you seeing?",

It is dangerous and the storm surge is why tens, if not hundreds of thousands of people up and down the Gulf Coast around the Big Bend where I am right now, up to Tallahassee, need to be on high alert and need to be vigilant for several more hours because the storm surge could very well get worse.As bad as it was where Derek Van Dam is standing in Tampa, and as awful as it is in Steinhatchee where Bill Weir is. The next several hours could see the waters rise even more. And Sara, it's hard to even imagine what that means at this point.",

We're not going to see high tide here in Crystal River, Florida until 04We keep moving back because the water keeps coming. We are almost at the end of this parking lot here as we are watching the water just rise and rise and rise. If it hits the maximum of what they think it could do, it could be 9 feet. I'm 5'9\". We're talking way over my head, if that storm surge happens in the way that has been predicted. We are hoping it doesn't. We are hoping it stays a bit lower. But no one has ever seen that kind of a storm surge here in modern history. It's been 125 years since the West Coast and this part of the West Coast has seen a storm like this. So people need to beware. Most people have already evacuated. There is still time, by the way, here in Crystal River to leave. We see people actually leaving as this water starts to come up now. Now, I wanted to get to our next guest who is with us. His name is Rob Herrin. He is with the Hillsborough County Fire and Rescue. Sir, thank you for what you do, and thank you for joining us. Can you tell us now, at this moment in time, what are the dangers for the people who live in Hillsborough County as you know it?",

It's kind of a rapid, you know, where we need the most needs, and then we'll backfill that with what's called a technical research and rescue team.

We also know that every hurricane that has ever come through Florida or anywhere else for that matter, there are always residents who stay. Some of whom maybe they can't get out in time, some of whom are just hard headed like me, and they stay in place hoping that they survive this storm.Can you give me a sense of have you seen it like this? Because I know that, you know, your county has seen storms before. Your county has gone through tropical storms, flooding, hurricanes. Sometimes you get more than one during hurricane season.

The roads, a lot of those, especially if you're in an area that you should have evacuated, are impassable right now.Electrical lines could be down. There's still so many hazards after the winds and rains have cleared, that we need to make sure our residents and visitors are aware of. But, yes, I'm hopeful that there's a little bit of a wakeup call for those, and I hope everybody makes it through it safely. Confident for that. We're ready to respond.

That does nobody any good.Can you give me some sense, though, of the numbers of people that you have from your department who are ready to go when the time is right for them to go out and help people and try to clear roads and try to get to people if they have stayed and are in danger.",
