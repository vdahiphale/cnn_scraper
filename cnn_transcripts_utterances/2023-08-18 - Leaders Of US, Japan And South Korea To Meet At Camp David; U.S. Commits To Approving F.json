Both Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol expressed optimism as they prepared to depart for the US.

We've heard from U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, he said that this meeting would give the three heads of state a chance to talk about concrete steps towards maintaining peace and stability in the region. But at its core, you know, this summit is about dealing with yes and erratic and missile threatening North Korea but more importantly, how to deal with a rising and aggressive China, Beijing is making its military presence felt, you know, very firmly in the region. Look at Taiwan, the territorial disputes in the South China Sea. And then you know what's happening over the Senkaku Islands with Japan. We heard from the U.S. Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel. He spoke on a panel hosted by the Brookings Institute earlier this week. He said that China assumed that South Korea and Japan would never resolve their differences and basically get on the same page. He believes that by embedding this mechanism of cooperation in the DNA, as he calls it, of the three governments to create a new normal, this will be a major deterrent for China. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RAHM EMANUEL, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO JAPAN: I think it doubles down not only in our strength about alliances, but more importantly, it doubles down on the fact that we've created something that exactly what China was hoping would never happen.

But look at the end of this Camp David summit, you know, we are expected to hear from the leaders that they will announce an expanded cooperation not only in joint military drills and military information sharing, but also in artificial intelligence supply chains and cyber and economic security. Michael, the hope is that this tri lat which has happened, you know, on the sides of other summits, the G7, NATO Summit, that this will become an annual meeting on its own.",

Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg stressed on Thursday that only Ukraine can decide when to hold talks with Russia to end the war. That clarification required after one of his top aides said Ukraine ceding territory to Russia could be one way for Kyiv to achieve peace and join NATO.The Secretary General now saying quote, what is important is that it is the Ukrainians themselves who must decide when they are willing to sit down at the negotiating table. The initial remark about ceding territory drew sharp criticism from inside Ukraine, a top adviser to President Zelenskyy calling the idea ridiculous, and warning that if Vladimir Putin doesn't suffer a crushing defeat, Russia would be emboldened to do this again. Now for more on this, let's bring in Mick Ryan. He's a retired Army Major General, and in the Australian Army and the author of \"War Transformed: The Future of 21st Century Great Power Competition and Conflict,\" he joins me now from Canberra. Always good to see you, Mick. Again, Stoltenberg essentially, you know, as we saw walking back those comments from his own office, what did you make of that coming from Stoltenberg office in the first place potentially damaging? MAJOR GEN. MICK RYAN, AUSTRALIAN ARMY (RET.): Well, good day, Michael, it's good to be with you again. I was surprised initially, I mean, Stoltenberg has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine throughout the war. And these kinds of comments haven't passed his lips, certainly. So, you know, they're, they're not good and not productive comments, but he'll be minimizing the damage.

It is the same for the United States where you just have a massive domestic economy that tends to be relatively more important for you.But some of the main channels for China, one is around commodity exporters so countries like Australia, Brazil, Indonesia, sending things that end up in China's construction sector such as iron ore or cement or electricity generated through coal. And as the property sector declines, those commodity exporters are finding things hard. And because Chinese households have such low level of confidence, the outbound travel rebound has been very, very bleak. That of course, is affecting mostly countries nearby in Asia, places like Thailand and Vietnam that will be really counting on a boom in Chinese tourism once the COVID restrictions ended. There is a silver lining for the rest of the world though in China's slow down as there is too much capacity in China's manufacturing sector relative to soft domestic demand. We are seeing deflation, particularly in producer prices. Much more so than in consumer prices. Those falling factory prices mean lower export prices. That has actually helped if you're the rest of the world and you're in a country that's suffering from high inflation right now.

And since the big stock market crash in 2015, property sector has been where Chinese households put all their cash. Now as property prices are falling and start coming down, of course, the number of big developers like Evergrande are in financial difficulties. Projects are not getting completed, households are (INAUDIBLE) and seeing their saving rates tick up in China.
