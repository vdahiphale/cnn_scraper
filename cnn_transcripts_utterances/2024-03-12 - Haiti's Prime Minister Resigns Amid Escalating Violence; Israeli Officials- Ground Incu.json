It will be a caretaker government until they name a prime minister and a new Cabinet. Haiti needs peace. Haiti needs stability. His resignation comes just hours after regional leaders met in Jamaica to discuss a framework for a political transition. The country was plunged into chaos after powerful gangs carried out highly coordinated attacks across the capital Port-au-Prince last month.

We know that the US has just carried out an air drops, some 26,000 meals, 25,000 bottles of water, and specifically this went in to Northern Gaza, which is really the area where it is needed more than anywhere else. This is the area where very little aid has managed to get to over recent months.Now, we also heard from the World Health Organization that they did manage to actually get a shipment into al-Shifa Hospital. This is one of the few remaining hospitals that is able to take the injured in of this point. And they say that they were able to supply food, fuel, and medical supplies for 42,000 patients. But they desperately need more. Another hospital as well was able to take some of that aid. But it's not just the aid at this point that the aid groups say that they are bringing and they -- that is needed. They also say that more medical personnel are needed. Of course, many would have been injured, many have been killed, and many are also trying to keep their families alive. So, this is another one of the challenges that the collapsed health system in Gaza is facing at this point. Now, we did hear from the head of World Food Programme, Cindy McCain, as you heard then, saying that what is happening at the moment in northern Gaza, despite those air drops from the United States, targeting that particular area is simply not enough. She has said what is needed at this point is some 300 trucks every single day just to that one area alone. And there are still many concerns and many wounds of Northern Gaza, in particular, being on the brink of famine. Now, we are unfortunately still hearing reports of newborns, also of children dying of malnutrition, and dehydration. In these situations, children are always the worst hit as they -- their smaller bodies are unable to weather any kind of shock, such as not having enough to eat and to drink. So, at this point when it comes to the aid getting in still, aid organizations are saying the air drops are not enough. There still needs to be more coming by land, that is the best way to be able to target the areas that need it. But also, there is a welcome for the potential maritime corridor that would be coming from Larnaca in Cyprus. At this point we heard from a government official in Cyprus, that it was practical issues that postponed this and they believe those issues appear to have been resolved. But we don't know for sure when that maritime corridor will be open completely and when that ship laden with goods will be able to get to those who needed. Rosemary.",

What more do we know about this latest kidnapping? I think what we can safely say is it points to the fact that the people of Nigeria, certainly certain parts of Nigeria and the North are no safer than they were 10 years ago. We know in quite eerily familiar fashion, having read some of the accounts of some of the kids who were able to escape, that suddenly they were surrounded by men on motorbikes, who started shooting, herding them into groups and forcing them out of the school compound. The understanding that they were marched into the surrounding forest, which is eerily similar to what happened to the Chibok girls back in 2014, where the same thing. But in this case, clearly identified as Islamic militants stormed their school in the middle of the night, herded them off, set fire to their school, and marched them into the forest. As of yet, no accounts of these almost 300 children aged between eight and 15 by all accounts, having been rescued or having been returned to their loved ones.

It is that of some of the young women who have escaped in recent years, and now the count is roughly 98 are unaccounted for, we don't know whether all of them are alive, but we know 98 remain unaccounted for. Of some of the ones who escaped, most recently, the conversation that is emerging, and what I was told today, then only by one individual is that of some of the women who remain with a captive -- with their captors, they don't want to come back. There is an element of Stockholm syndrome that is firmly taken hold with some of them, and they do not want to return to their families. And, you know, many years ago, there was a video that came out actually, about one of the girls who actually I write about in my book, \"Dorcas Yakubu\", and she's on tape saying, I do not want to come back. This is my family. So, it's become quite complicated. It's not -- it's not simply a situation around the government, locating them, paying a ransom or rescuing them by force. There was now this element because they have been brainwashed where some feel that their place now is with the Islamic militant community. And then there are those who this young woman also told me, who felt that even if they could escape, they are in such remote places, they wouldn't even know where to go. They are sort of lost in the wilderness. So, it has taken on an even more heartbreaking context.

QUEST (voice-over): And her hair ends abruptly. The zipper on Kate's sweater is misaligned. The other big agencies, Reuters and AFP, were quick to issue their own kill notices, telling news outlets not to use the image. Then, more than 24 hours after she posted it, the Princess of Wales apologized, saying like many amateur photographers, I do occasionally experiment with editing. At one level, this is nothing more than an amateur photographer getting it wrong. But the underlying issue is the fact that the Princess of Wales has not been seen since having unspecified abdominal surgery back in January. This grainy photograph taken on Monday as Kate traveled to a private appointment with William is one of the few images that surfaced since then. We don't know what editing she did and the palace hasn't released the unedited version. So, is this just an amateur photographer's learning experience or is there something more to the picture that has fueled a thousand words of speculation?
