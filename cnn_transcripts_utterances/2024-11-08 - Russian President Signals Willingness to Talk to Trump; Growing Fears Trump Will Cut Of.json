      "sentences": "Welcome back to CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Max Foster. If you're just joining us, here are some of today's top stories.Donald Trump bringing key members of his planned administration into the fold. There's one of them. The president-elect announced that Susie Wiles, former campaign manager, will be his chief of staff. Hers is the first of several key positions the president has announced in this transition period. President Joe Biden reaffirmed his intention to facilitate the peaceful transfer of power to Donald Trump. During a speech to the nation, the president called for unity and acceptance of the 2024 election results. The balance of power is still up in the air in the U.S. Congress. Votes are still being counted in key swing states such as Nevada and Arizona. Several races are up for grabs. As of now, Republicans hold a slim majority in the Senate and they're leading in the House as well. Now, Russia's president says a new world order is taking shape. Vladimir Putin claims the Western-led post-Cold War era is giving way to a complex world of multilateral cooperation. During a forum in Sochi, President Putin also said he'd be willing to talk to Donald Trump because his comments on Russia's war in Ukraine deserve attention. However, the Kremlin downplayed earlier claims by Trump that under his leadership, the war could be quickly resolved. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "It's quite obvious that Russia wanted Trump to win. But I thought the let's say the theatricality of today was very interesting because, again, he did not immediately jump in and say, congratulations, Mr. Trump. He waited a bit.And I would interpret that as, you know, Putin, a little coy. He is the leader of a big country, too. And he doesn't have to wait on pins and needles for another president. But that said, this relationship is extremely important. And Ukraine at the top of the list. From what people understand of it, it essentially would freeze everything in place, which means that the Russians would be holding the territory, the Ukrainian territory that they have, that they've won. And then they would somehow come to territorial concessions. In other words, the Ukrainians would have to give up probably Donbas, that eastern region, and Crimea. And then there might be peacekeepers. It's a little unclear. Right now, they're, you know, they're getting as much as they can from the United States. They're getting help from Europe. But if that, if the United States stopped giving aid, it would be really very, very difficult. And that's a nightmare scenario for Zelenskyy. It's hard to say exactly what would satisfy Putin. But he ultimately will need a win, too. And he's already said Crimea is a no-go. We have to have Crimea. He's very, very serious and insists on keeping Donbas. Maybe that would satisfy him. But you can bet that he would want to essentially freeze any possibility for Ukraine to join NATO. There would be no way that he would accept that and probably just kind of neutralize Ukraine.

That is punishable to up to 15 years in prison. Other charges include supplying cocaine and supplying narcotics. Now Liam Payne, authorities say, was found with both alcohol, antidepressants, and a significant amount of cocaine in his system after that fall that led to his death. They say that they've reviewed over 800 hours of video and also looked over his cell phone. They went through a forensic extraction. They analyzed calls, text messages, and posts on social media that he had made in the days leading up to his death. They also said that they rolled out self-inflicted injuries or the intervention of other people, which paints a picture that despite the company of these other people who were now preliminarily charged, that he was alone at the time of his fall. They say also that the injuries were compatible with those that would come from a fall, so he wasn't injured before he fell. And also that based on his posture and the positioning of his body, that it looks like he was already in a state of semi or total unconsciousness by the time that he fell. Of course, his death has caused so much grief to fans of One Direction and of his solo career across the world. We saw an outpour of love from fans in Argentina. His father had traveled to Buenos Aires to retrieve his body, which should arrive in the U.K. soon. And more details are to come on a possible funeral. Julia Vargas Jones, CNN, Los Angeles.

      "sentences": "Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, has a new deadline to turn over nearly everything he owns of value to two women he defamed while he was working for Donald Trump after the 2020 election. That new deadline, it was set by a federal judge in Manhattan on Thursday.That judge told Giuliani, you know, you weren't supposed to turn these things over last week but let me hear what you have to say. Giuliani's lawyer got up to argue all different things about why Giuliani might not have been able to get these items to these two women because he owes them $150 million. They're going to sell off things like sports memorabilia from the Yankees, an apartment that he has in Manhattan's Upper East Side, luxury watches, about two dozen of them. One of the excuses that Giuliani's attorney gave in court was that some of these items he thinks might not actually be something that Giuliani should have to give up in court, that there might be a legal argument there. And he even told the judge, you and I differ on the law. And the judge said, no, this is done. There was a court order weeks ago, and you have to turn these items over. When Giuliani's attorney said a wristwatch that the mayor himself received from his grandfather, Rudolfo Giuliani, when that wristwatch was being sought by these two women, Giuliani's attorney told the judge it was vindictive of them to go after that. And the judge said, no, that's my order. The law is the law. I don't apply it differently to your client. Giuliani himself was in the court. The judge had ordered him to come to Manhattan from Palm Beach, where he's living. He was in there just earlier this week, driving around in the very Mercedes-Benz from 1980 that he's supposed to be giving the keys and title to these two women, Shaye Moss and Ruby Freeman. He was driving around in that Mercedes on Tuesday to vote after he was supposed to have given them the car, the keys, all of that is going to be picked up by the lawyers for Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss by the end of next week. As Giuliani was exiting the court, he stopped by cameras. CNN asked him if Donald Trump would help him. And he said he doesn't need the incoming president's help. Katelyn Polantz, CNN, New York.
