And the next few days will be critical to seeing whether or not that deal can indeed be achieved. I'm told that the Egyptians now have a new framework that is on the table for Hamas to review. It was submitted with Israeli input, crafted with Israeli input, but not all of the points have been agreed to by Israel. But the next coming -- next couple of days are going to be key to seeing whether or not what's in this framework is enough for Hamas to be willing to at least move forward with negotiations or perhaps whether this week could spell the end of those negotiations for the time being and instead a Rafah offensive to be launched. This latest framework, I'm told, would see 20 to 33 Israeli hostages released over the course of several weeks with about one day of ceasefire for every hostage release. But then what would follow that would be effectively a one-year ceasefire or what these officials are calling the restoration of sustainable calm, diplomatic speak to effectively avoid talking about a permanent ceasefire in writing here. And there is a delicate dance to be had here over whether or not over the timing of this first phase of the agreement that would see those 20 to 33 hostages released. And then this kind of longer term more comprehensive agreement, which would see not only the remaining Israeli hostages as well as the bodies of dead hostages released, but also of course an end to the war, the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Gaza Strip. Something that Hamas has been insisting on in order to even begin to move forward with the first phase of this agreement. So critical days ahead to determine the possibility of this happening. And we know, of course, that the United States says that they believe that the ball now is in Hamas's court.",

If you look behind me, you can see a whole bunch ofbarricades that are piled up in the middle of university yard here with that Palestinian flag posted on top of it. What happened overnight, those barricades had been surrounding this small part of the yard here where there were these groups of tents. Just about 20 campers were left from this now, days-long protest. But overnight there was this incident, and they decided all of these protesters to pull up those barricades. As you can see, so many more tents have come into the yard, and this is what H Street, just outside G.W.'s property, looks like here. The protest has only been growing, and the big question as we enter Monday morning is when, if at all, will D.C. police come in and clear out these protests? Up to this point, they have said they really don't want the optics of that. They don't want to be removing tents and potentially arresting these protesters who have said that they are not going to leave, even if it means being arrested, that they have these demands for G.W. and for some of the other schools in the D.C. area to divest from anything connected to Israel and the Israeli government.

That number is 81 percent. If you look at those between the ages of 18 and 34. That CNN poll also asked registered voters about the presidential race finding that Donald Trump leads Biden in that head-to- head matchup. CNN's Political Director David Chalian enjoys this now from Washington with a closer look at the latest polling. It had been sort of narrowing, I guess, a little bit from what we've seen in a lot of the polling. The space between Joe Biden and Donald Trump. But we're seeing Trump eke out ahead here.",

Erica.Focus less on the margin between the two candidates and understand each candidate's level of support. And I think you see a remarkably consistent race across our polling for the last eight months. Donald Trump's support level has been within a narrow band of two percentage points, somewhere between 47 and 49 percent. Joe Biden's support level has been within a narrow band of three points, between 43 and 46 percent. That's all within the margin of error. So, this race has been a remarkably consistent one showing a Trump lead for the most part. And again, this is nationally, and that's not, of course, how we actually elect presidents here in the U.S. It's an electoral college camp, but today it is 49 percent to 43 percent in our poll with about six months to go in this race. Obviously, this is not predictive. This is just the snapshot of where things are now, Erica. One thing I would just note is on the issue matrix, yes, the economy is the most important issue for voters. There's no doubt about that. And Joe Biden's economic rating is at 34 percent approval. It is below his overall approval rating at 40 percent. So that's a clear trouble spot on issue number one for voters for the president. But that Israel-Hamas war issue is even worse, Erica.",

But I will also note some recent survey work done by the Institute of Politics at Harvard, a deep dive into the youth vote, found that the Israel-Hamas issue, while overwhelmingly young voters are opposed to the way Biden's handling it, is not the top issue on their mind. They also are economy voters in this election, according to that survey. But this was a key part of the Biden coalition, the winning coalition in 2020, young voters, and keeping them enthused and engaged and supporting Biden for these next six months. There's no doubt that this Israel-Hamas issue complicates that. As does, Erica, this whole notion of just with more time since the Trump presidency, Americans seem to have a rosier view of the Trump presidency than they do of being in it with Biden right now. 55 percent call the Trump presidency a success. That is a complete reversal from where Americans were when the Trump presidency ended and they were assessing it in real time. But with a little bit of distance, a majority say that was a success, whereas 61 percent of Americans in this poll call the Biden presidency a failure. So, the Biden team also is going to have the challenge of reminding voters of what those chaotic four years were like because in their hazy memory, things are not quite as they assessed it at the time.",

But as youpoint out all these other issues, I was also struck by something in our CNN polling. And you and I had a brief e-mail conversation about this earlier. But we talk so often about how divided this country is and Americans talk so often about how divided this country is. The fact that a very high number, 71 percent of Trump supporters say they don't understand why anybody would back Biden. 67 percent of Biden supporters say they can't understand why anyone would back Trump.

It's not just that you're choosing one candidate over the other. It's that in choosing your candidate, you can't even fathom why anybody would support the other person. So, think about that when you think about your neighbors and coworkers and all the people you interact with. If you have chosen a candidate this race, you can't even understand why somebody else would go in a different way. We live in such polarized times we sort ourselves geographically through our politics these days in America. And that's what makes this race, which has so many unique circumstances about it, given Trump on trial and Biden's low standing, still I think a rather unpredictable race because it's going to be so dependent on turning out your own supporters come election day.",
