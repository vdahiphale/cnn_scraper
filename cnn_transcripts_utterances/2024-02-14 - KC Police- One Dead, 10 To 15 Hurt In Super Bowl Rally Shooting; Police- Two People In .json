But it is a very active scene in terms of the investigation, which is still going on to try to determine exactly what happened here.Now, of course, this happened at the end of that huge rally, celebrating the Chiefs and their Super Bowl victory, we still do not yet have confirmation if the shooting was actually targeting that rally or connected in any way to that rally. The police are still working on that. In terms of injuries, well, very sadly, one person has died and at least 14 others are injured. Some of them in pretty bad state. We are told that three people, this is from the fire department, three are critical, five are serious. But that number is very fluid, we're told that people are still walking in to hospitals.

CHIEF OF HOMELAND SECURITY AND INTELLIGENCE: Well, Wolf, as Andrew just said, I've worked at least a dozen of these between my time in New York and D.C. These are very, very difficult to stop a determined assailant. But the fact that she had 800 officers out there should be a deterrent for most people. Unfortunately, it wasn't today. And I want to be mindful of the fact that the victims, their family members may be watching this broadcast right now. Quite honestly, the fact that you had emergency response on the scene, providing life safety and life support, could possibly have averted a worst disaster. We've learned a lot in the emergency response community after the Boston Marathon attack. And so I'm sure as more comes out, you'll hear about the pre staged assets in terms of intelligence and first responders that weren't seen. But these are very, very difficult to secure. But I don't want to worry people like I've been to these, I've been involved in the planning of these, and they are quite secure.

What do you learning? COY WIRE, CNN SPORTS ANCHORThis is the first time the community could really rally and cheer for their team in person. Now, there's several players posting on social media Chiefs guard, Trey Smith, saying, my thoughts and prayers are with everyone affected by to today's incidents. A huge thank you to the first responders who ran towards the sound of danger. You're the ones who should be celebrated today. Chiefs defensive tackle Donovan Smith, simply saying, praying for everyone today in Kansas City. Now, Wolf, as a former player, I can see that these players would have been fanatically thinking about their families. Many of them are on the parade route, so they're thinking, are they OK? Thinking about the kids or members of the community who volunteered for their foundations at times throughout the season, who create that bond with your community. So this was a very daunting moment for many of the players indeed. Now, Mayor Quinton Lucas did say during a news press conference that all Kansas City Chiefs players, coaches and staff were safe and accounted for after the shooting at the end of that Super Bowl celebration rally, Wolf.",

The fact that they do have two individuals that were armed, could lead to all types of speculation. But you know, it could be as something as simple as a minor dispute between people, or something that can be proven to be actually more of a evolving conspiracy.The fact of the matter is that guns are ubiquitous in our country. This marks I believe, the 57th mass shooting, that's for more people shot in one incidents this year alone. And so we're on track to be like last year, which is, you know, 1.3, 1.4 mass shootings a day. And so, investigators, as Andrew said, are really working all the leads, are checking all the CCTV, all the all the tips and leads that they're getting.

We're unfortunately very familiar in this country with coverage and information about situations in which a sole shooter goes into a school, a church, a grocery store, you name it, and commits a mass shooting. And so, that's the format we kind of expect. So having two armed persons taken into custody right away, is a little bit of an anomaly.However, if you look more broadly across the scope of mass shootings, and terrorist attacks and things like that, it's not uncommon to see more than one offender, more than one shooter, more than one armed person. So, it really depends -- a lot depends on what we're actually dealing with here. I think Donell is absolutely right, this may have been nothing more than a dispute between two people who happen to be armed. And then when one person pulls out a gun, the other one does, and then you have shots fired. Or it could be something much more complicated like a planned attack. But if that's the case, it is somewhat rare that you'd see that executed by two armed individuals.",

I've heard different numbers, quite frankly, over the course of the reporting the last few hours. I think recently, one of the hospitals is reported they have as many as eight people who they are treating for gunshot wounds and the remainder who have been injured in ways other than being shot, maybe in fleeing, getting trampled by the crowd, what have you. So, what it says is that wherever you had this conflagration that turned into shots fired possibly between the two people who are currently in custody, but we don't know that for sure yet. It certainly suggests a lack of precision and a lack of direction, or possibly an intent to harm as many people as they could. You know, we still haven't heard from law enforcement in terms of how many shots they think were fired. And so, possibly we'll hear that at the next news conference at the top of the hour. But there's a lot of details here, Wolf, that we haven't heard yet, there's just a lot of facts that we're waiting on.Certainly the more people who are -- who happen to be injured by gunshots, you know, at the center of this controversy, as that number goes up, the situation gets more and more grim.

Take a look at that video right there. It's just heartbreaking to go through the minds.And so many young kids are with their parents, their families, they're running as well, simply to try to stay safe there.

And so, this is well planned, these type of events happen all the time.And you know, once again, the rapid response of law enforcement and EMS and fire is assisted by the fact that they have these cordons that they put people. That also actually becomes what we call a fatal funnel, right? And so you really don't need to have good precision or really be targeting anybody to shoot someone and hurt a lot of people by stampede or just having that congestion. We call that, you know, crowded spaces and vulnerable places. So, there's a kind of juxtaposition there when you have so many people kind of penned in there. You really can't go anywhere you see people jumping over, you know, barricades. But those barricades allow for law enforcement and first responders to get in rapidly treat patients you know, stop the threat, and then kind of locate who needs help.",

Andrew, are you surprised that a shooting like this could take place when police were already on the scene with more than 800 law enforcement officers, they're getting ready for all of this? MCCABE: Yes, not at all, Wolf, not surprised at all. I mean, this is a massive event, 10s of 1000s of people at least conducted in an open area outside in which access to the event is not controlled. And then -- so, in addition to that, you have -- it takes place in a state that has very loose open carry laws and firearms law. So, it just makes sense that you're going to have some percentage of that population attending the event or going to be carrying weapons. Compare that to an event, like we experience here every four years or so on the inauguration of a new president. So we have a massive open space, it's Pennsylvania Avenue from the Capitol to the White House where the President typically -- you know, we have a parade and the President walks or ride some distance along Pennsylvania Avenue. The lengths that the law enforcement community goes to here in D.C. to completely ensure that there are no guns anywhere near that street, that could possibly be used at or near the president is the entire area is frozen a day in advance, every vehicle is removed. Every person who has a ticket, you have to have a ticket to get into that area has to go through magnetometer and metal screening to make sure they don't have firearms. That's the only way to secure a massive outdoor area like this. It takes 1000s of officers and National Guard helping them out and a massive amount of resources to do it. So, it doesn't surprise me that we had people in this crowd who, for whatever reason, hopefully we'll find that out soon ended up in a violent confrontation involving firearms.",

I am certain, I'm 100 percent certain that someone was recording or multiple people were recording with their cell phones at the time this happened. And so, obviously, the individuals that they've detained, have firearms, they'll have to obviously test those firearms to see if those are similar to the shell casings that they found on the scene. So there's a lot of work that has to go on.And, obviously, this is a huge crime scenes that has been trampled with -- by people. And so, it's not unlikely for folks to get home and find a shell casing in a bag or in an item of clothing or in the hospital. And so, they have to talk to people in the hospitals. There's a lot of evidence that has to be gathered. And so obviously, this is just evolving as we're watching this unfold.

And we know that the presentation or the show essentially with the players and others was taking place kind of on the -- on that southern facing entrance of the train station.So those two locations are pretty close by. We also know the shooting started right at the end of the ceremony just after some of the players had been speaking or singing. So the event seems to have taken place locationally not far from where the players were located and likely temporarily, you know, pretty close to when they were on the stage now remains to be seen exactly, you know, whether or not they were up there when the shooting was actually taking place.
