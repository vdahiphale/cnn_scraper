They are concern -- authorities are concerned enough that they're adding more drones this year in New York and more boats to keep watches -- watch on the beaches here for sharks. Me, not so worried. This is a great deal for me. But I want to show you, so here.We're at Rockaway Beach. This is New York City -- surfing in New York City. I know this is -- you know, everybody thinks, oh, New York, they don't have waves. They don't have beaches. They don't have surfing. Every day, people are out here even in the wintertime. And this morning, we spoke to one surfer out here who says they actually think that they saw a Thresher shark about six-foot-long, and then got out of the water when he saw that. And another surfer says that he was approached by a shark last year and got out. So, it does happen even in New York City. The most serious incident we have recently was the Turks and Caicos where a 22-year-old woman when they were snorkeling past the reef on a -- on a -- on off of a private boat, and the shark took her leg amazingly enough. And she is alive, thanks to very quick work by the tour company that they are with. But a very, very serious bite for her. They're -- They think it was a case of mistaken identity but not entirely sure. That means that the shark may have thought she was food. There was also a young woman in New Jersey, that her foot -- she was surfing, her foot got bitten by watching things with a shark. And there was a young woman in Florida who was just sitting out in the water off the beach, and she got bit by a shark in her stomach and on her arm. So, snorkeling, surfing, just sitting in the water right near the beach -- the shore, nothing is really safe. You have to pay attention. This is their backyard. This is their front yard. So, you know surfers telling us they are very respectful of that. And they also say look, if you see schools of fish or seals, places to stay away from, you do not want them thinking you're a meal.

The remains of retired Army Staff Sergeant Nicholas Maimer, are now in the process of being returned back to the United States and back home to his family. Yesterday, the leader of the Russian-backed Wagner paramilitary group handed over his remains to the Ukrainians. And the Wagner leader also put out a video of two coffins, one draped with an American flag, and one with a Turkish flag saying that Maimer died in the battle for Bakhmut, also saying that his body was found in the rubble of a destroyed building.Joining me right now is retired Lieutenant Colonel Perry Blackburn. He's the founder of a nonprofit, AFGFree, who -- it's an organization that providing humanitarian aid and training in Ukraine, and he'd been working with Maimer for about a year is what I -- is my understanding when this all happened. Colonel, thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me. I also read that you may have been one of the first people -- because of your work together and your coordination with folks on the ground there, you may have been one of the first people to get the call that he had been killed. What's your understanding of what happened? LT. COL. PERRY BLACKBURN (RET), U.S. ARMY: I was actually one of the first people to get that phone call, unfortunately. And it's not the first time that's happened in my life as a veteran, and particularly in this area of the world where we've seen a lot of violence and conflict. And so, it was pretty -- it was really difficult. Obviously, it's always tough. But Nick and I were partners in humanitarian work over there. And we were -- we had been talking constantly about the activities that were happening. And we were -- we would just talk probably about three weeks prior to him getting killed about an offensive that was about to occur and what the humanitarian aid would look like in that area. because as we've seen in the past, is pretty devastating. And if -- we all know from the -- what we've seen Bakhmut, Bakhmut is devastated. But there's casualties other than the combatants, right? And they're civilians and they're non-combatants. And that's who we really were focused on to try to give a to -- and really what we do most of the time. And so, that was truly what Nick was primarily focused on, was helping the people. And he's a great humanitarian. It's a huge loss to our community, to the Special Forces community. It's a huge loss to the Ukrainians. And I have to say the Ukrainians have done a great job all along the whole time here to get Nick back. I think he's probably one of the quickest returns that we've had. There's a lot of informal lines of communication that we used to try to get to ensure that he was returned safely and in a dignified manner.",

I want to read this for everybody.He said I think this is one of the most clear-cut unjust invasions in recent history. That's what he told the newspaper. It's really obvious to everybody, that it's an unjustified invasion. So, I felt like my moral compass just pointed me towards it. I read that and kind of wondered what -- how that sits with you today, especially as we're heading into -- you know, we're heading into Memorial Day weekend and just in the face of it all.",
