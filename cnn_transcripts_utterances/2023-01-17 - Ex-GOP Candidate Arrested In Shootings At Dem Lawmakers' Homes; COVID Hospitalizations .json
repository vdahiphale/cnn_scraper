So they're aiming high, which doesn't mean anything to somebody who has bullets coming into their child's bedroom at 1:00 in the morning while sleeping. They recover a shell casing there, ballistics inside. Half an hour, 40 minutes later, they stop a Silver Nissan. In the Nissan, 800 fentanyl pills and a wanted felon. In the inventory search, two guns, a Glock with a drum magazine and an A.R. pistol. That car is registered to Pena. They traced the other registered car as a black Audi, connected to one of the earlier shootings.

But as you mentioned, Victor, we're far below what we've seen in previous winter surges.Here's a look at that. We should have a chart looking at the past two years of hospitalization rates. You see, starting January 27th of 2021, there's a spike right there. And then as we keep going, we enter 2022, there was another spike in the middle of the chart. But at the end of the chart is where we are today, and you see how we are seeing a slight increase, but we're not nearly as high as those previous surges. That's what's welcome news. We are seeing this across the country. We should have a map showing all states, here state by state differences and hospitalization differences. Here's the same map of last year. January 17th of 2022, this same map last year as you see here. There were some high hospitalization rates across various states but the map looks very different today. That's what's welcome news here. There are still two looming concerns that public health officials are watching closely. Number one, the risk of a new variant emerging. And then, number two, we're still seeing slow uptake of the updated COVID-19 vaccine, the booster, that was released in September. So we need to get our vaccination rates up. And we need to continue to monitor for variants. But outside of that, this is welcome news -- Victor and Alisyn?",

After the team meeting, after that final game of the season, most guys have their cars running in the parking lot. They want to get out of dodge as fast as they can. The season is so long, so taxing mentally, emotionally, physically. I would spend a day or two in bed, like doing nothing. Most guys want to spend time with families, kissing and cuddling kids, and take a trip to get away, and far away. Tom Brady likely going to be doing the same type of thing.
