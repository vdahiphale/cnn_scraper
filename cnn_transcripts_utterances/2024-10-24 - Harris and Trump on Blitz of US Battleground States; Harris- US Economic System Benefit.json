It has been seven top battlegrounds ever since Kamala Harris rose to the top of the Democratic ticket in late July. At the time, some people have thought that a couple might fall out, North Carolina might fall out, or Arizona might fall out. That is not the case. Donald Trump spent two full days in North Carolina this week, he won that state four years ago. So that is a sign when a candidate spends his time in a place that they are not confident of a victory there. So when you look at that, those seven states are going to be the roadway map for the next 12 days. But tonight in Georgia, it is so interesting, that was the narrowest margin of victory for Joe Biden four years ago, 11,000 votes out of five million or so cast, that is why Vice President Harris will be there making her first appearance with Barack Obama.",

And as soon as that press conference starts, we'll bring it to you and I'll give you some more information of what's happening. Let's talk about Boeing, which is back to the drawing board after union members rejected a deal to get 33,000 people back to work. It includes a 35 percent pay increase and retirement contributions. It fell short of the full pension plan, that contributory plan, a defined benefit scheme that the workers were demanding. The CEO, Kelly Ortberg, it's clearly a blow. He wrote, \"Boeing needs a fundamental culture change.\" Well, clearly it's not (INAUDIBLE) so far. Vanessa is with me.

And unfortunately, though, we haven't seen a union in my recent memory that has given up a pension plan and then gotten it back. So ultimately, Richard, they're going to have to work on other things.

And if they can get back to that point, then maybe there's a conversation about Boeing's future. The company, though, Richard, as you know very well, is not going to go away there. They're one of just two companies that make commercial aircrafts for airlines. So they're not going away, but it's just, they're in such dire straits.

And the impetus for what's about to happen is purportedly new evidence. There's a couple of pieces of purportedly new evidence. There's a letter that one of the brothers wrote to a cousin saying that he had been sexually abused by the father, and then separately, there's a letter written by another person, actually a member of the band Menudo, which the father managed, saying that the father had sexually assaulted him. So the question, first of all, is this really new evidence? There's some evidence, Jean Casarez of CNN just said on air, that it appears that first letter may have been around as early as 2015 or really before that.

I think on the one perspective you say, look, we have these new and I think better understandings of the impact of sexual abuse particularly of boys that we didn't have in the '90s. If you look at the big picture, is 34 years behind bars that these men who probably if they had been convicted of involuntary manslaughter, is that sufficient? On the other hand, evidence of the sexual abuse isn't quite a perfect legal defense to what they did. And let me point specifically here to the mother, the Menendez brothers' mother, right. Clearly the father was the one who was sexually abusing the boys. There's little question that the mother knew about it and enabled it, but somebody knowing about abuse and enabling it and being a horrible person is not really a defense to murdering that person. It really does not make out a compelling self-defense claim. So if you were to mechanically apply the law here, I'm not sure that it fits. But on the other hand, if you look at the bigger picture, I think there's an argument that in the larger interest of justice, it makes sense to let them out after all this time.",
