The charges against Trump remained the same, four counts related to his alleged attempts to stay in power after losing the 2020 election. But now prosecutors have narrowed the focus of their case to comply with last month's controversial ruling by the Supreme Court, which granted presidential immunity for official acts while in office.Trump is still accused of obstructing Congress' certification of the 2020 college results on January 6th. That's when a mob of Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol. And at 36 pages long, the new indictment, nine pages shorter than the original, and among the many changes, removing all references to official acts as well as the 45th president. Here's CNN's Katelyn Polantz. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

So this is the case that's existed for a year in federal court in Washington, D.C., and was on hold as the Supreme Court looked at questions of presidential immunity. They said that Trump couldn't be prosecuted or taken to trial on things he was doing while he was president officially, after the election while he was still serving, even on January 6th.And so the Justice Department has now responded by going to the federal grand jury in Washington and cutting down the charges against him. They've cut out things like what Donald Trump was saying to the Justice Department and officials there about spreading allegations of election fraud across the country. And instead, they are making the focus be about Donald Trump and what he was told by his campaign and what he was telling private advisers of his to do to try and spread this idea of election fraud, especially in battleground states, and to block Congress from certifying his loss of the election. One of the things, though, that is very important going forward in the coming days we're going to see a lot of discussion about this is the role of Mike Pence as the vice president. Pence is still in this charging document against Donald Trump. The rewritten, pared-down version. And Pence is very likely to be a witness both in the coming weeks, in upcoming proceedings that have yet to be scheduled, and then if the Justice Department is allowed to bring him in as a trial witness before a jury. That's because the Justice Department now says Mike Pence was not always just in the executive branch under the Constitution. He was working for the Congress or he was presiding over Congress as president of the Senate on January 6th. And that's how Trump was trying to pressure him to block the election result.

All of the references, they're all with 30 references, John, to the Department of Justice, those have all been removed. Of the unindicted co-conspirator, Jeffrey Clark, who was the interim attorney general at the time of this conspiracy, has been again removed from this superseding indictment, so clearly the Justice Department's herculean task to overcome what these Supreme Court has done by essentially giving Donald Trump a blank check to do or to engage in any conduct that he deems appropriate.",

I've also been informed by my attorneys that you're not even allowed to bring cases literally right before an election. A direct assault on democracy. This is an unprecedented abuse of the criminal justice system.And he goes on and on and on. You know, Trump is referring to a Justice Department policy which is called the 60-day rule.

That's why we see references to Donald Trump as a candidate versus Trump as president.And that's why all the references and conversations with respect to anyone in the Justice Department have been removed. The question still remains for Judge Chutkan, is she going to determine that this superseding indictment complies with the parameters that have been outlined by the Supreme Court's decision regarding immunity? We know that pretrial hearings are likely to be scheduled forthwith, and this judge is going to have to make this determination. And ultimately, John, this case is probably headed back to the Supreme Court because no matter what this judge determines with respect to actions that are private versus official, we can expect and count on Donald Trump's team appealing the decision by the trial judge and taking this case all the way back to the Supreme Court.",

They are negotiating with Hamas through the Egyptians, Qataris and the United States for a deal. But I must comment that they are negotiating a bad deal because the deal that's on the table is for a six-week ceasefire during which time 32 hostages would come home. In other words, another 76 would be left in Gaza for further negotiations. This is not the way to go. We need a deal that's going to end this war in three weeks, a maximum of three weeks and bring all the hostages home. And that's the deal that they need to be negotiating now. And my message is to the United States government, to the Qataris and the Egyptians to put that deal forward because I know that Hamas will agree to it.

On the other side, the Hamas narrative is that they released him. My estimation is that there's a bit of truth in everything and a lot of lying in everything, and we really don't know what the story is, but what's important here is that if Farhan Al-Qadi is an Arab, he's a Bedouin, he speaks Arabic as his native language, and he might actually be the source of a lot more intelligence information than Israel has been able to get from the other Israeli Jewish hostages who don't know Arabic and don't understand what was being said around them.
