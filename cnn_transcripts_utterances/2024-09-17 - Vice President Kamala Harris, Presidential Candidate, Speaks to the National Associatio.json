      "sentences": "So when we came into -- well, first of all, let me just say it -- it is good to be with the National Association of Black Journalists, and I thank you for the work you're doing; that your members do every day. It is very important that we ensure that this organization and your members always have the resources and the platforms to deliver the voices that must be heard, so I thank you for hosting me today.Four years ago, when we came in, we came in during the worst unemployment since the Great Depression. We came in during the worst public health epidemic in centuries. We came in after the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War, and a lot of it due in large part to the mismanagement by the former president as it relates to COVID, and obviously, January 6th. And we had, then, a lot of work to do to clean up a mess. As of today, we have created over 16 million new jobs, over 800,000 new manufacturing jobs. We have the lowest black unemployment rate in generations. We have invested in small businesses, and I'm going to -- they're -- to the benefit of many people, but including black small businesses, some of the highest rate of creation of new black small businesses in years. We have done the work of capping the cost of prescription medication for our seniors for issues like insulin. And again, I'm speaking to the black journalists who care about all people, but in particular, I'll talk about the impact on black people, where we know black folks are 60 times more likely -- 60 percent -- excuse me -- more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes, and we have now finally capped the cost of insulin for our seniors at $35 a month, capped the cost of prescription medication for our seniors at $2,000 a year because we, unlike the former president, who promised to do it, we finally have allowed Medicare to negotiate drug prices against the big pharmaceutical companies. And these are just some of the accomplishments. Is the price of groceries still too high? Yes. Do we have more work to do? Yes. And I will tell you, I do believe that I offer a new generation of leadership for our country that is about, in particular, turning the page on an era that, sadly, has shown us attempts by some to incite fear, to create division in our country, and to do the work that is about bringing some level of optimism, and dare I say, ambition about what I know is possible in our country. And so my plan for the economy includes what I imagine and believe and call a -- a -- an opportunity economy, what we can do to grow an opportunity economy where all people have access to the resources to compete, to apply their incredible work ethic, their ambition, their aspirations and their dreams, and actually not just get by, but get ahead. And I can talk in more detail about it, but specifically, I'll mention a few things.",

Because I know that when you talk about the return on that investment, allowing people to work, allowing people to pursue their dreams, in terms of how they want to work, where they want to work, benefits us all. It strengthens the entire economy. We saw, for example, during the pandemic what happened. And it sadly has dissipated as a conversation that we need to resuscitate, which is the number of women that had to leave the workforce because of the lack of childcare and home healthcare and so many of our families, and particular women end up carrying the responsibility.

These are facts that have had impact and we need to -- we need to speak truth about it, and we need to speak truth about it in a way that is about driving solutions. And frankly, I think that we -- you know -- and part of that is -- is studying it to figure out exactly what we need to do. But I -- part of what we can do right now is, for example, what I'm talking about in terms of building an opportunity economy, which is addressing explicitly the obstacles that historically and currently exist, and dealing with them -- student loan debt, medical debt, bias in home appraisals, what we need to do in terms of dealing with an issue that I have championed for years, black maternal mortality, which is the fact that black women are three to four times more likely to die in connection with childbirth than other women.
