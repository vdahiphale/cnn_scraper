And it would only be a temporary and brief shutdown because when this does come to the floor, potentially on Sunday, it is expected to pass. But, Laura, it is a shutdown nonetheless and just another example of Congress's struggles to govern. Remember, they were supposed to have funded the government back in October but instead, they decided to kick the can down the road, they passed temporary patches after temporary patches, and then they finally did release this massive bill, over a thousand pages, at 3 a.m. yesterday, so they did not give themselves a lot of time to read these bills and to get them through both chambers.

I mean, his media company, we understand, it's officially going public, which could net him shares worth about $3 billion at current market prices. But some actors (ph) are telling CNN that that number, three and a half billion, so to speak, is inflated.

I'm not sure that the president will be able to kind of turn it around quickly enough if Monday stays as the deadline. And similarly, I don't think Miss James will be able to get her hands on it that quickly either.So, I think, you know, one aspect here that could kick in by Monday is pure delay, just looking for time to pull things together. The other would be to substantively go after the price tag that has been put on this appeal. And, you know, look, when I was a prosecutor, which I did for a long time, we used to say behind closed doors, bad facts make bad case law. What that meant is you might be able to stretch a case before a friendly judge or a jury to get a result that you're comfortable with. But if it's really creative and if it's really out of whack with the body of law in that issue, you eventually find out the hard way with an appellate court. I think there's a solid chance, depending on how well Trump's team preserved the issues, there's a solid chance of this whole price tag being dramatically lowered. COATES:  Yeah. And preserving the issue for everyone out there, in order to have something argued on appeal, you have to at the trial court level have raised the issue first, so the appellate court is able to actually evaluate what it is down the line. And then, of course, you've got the novelty of the Eighth Amendment that I know has been argued by some on social media. Likely his team will do the same about this being an excessive fine. But the court will consider a number of factors and proportionality will be a really big one. I'm sure his Truth Social post isn't helping in some respects. Jim Trusty, thank you so much for joining.

So, imagine if Google could open up an app store on the iOS app store. That would be a huge change, big impacts for Apple's business model. You know, other potential changes include potentially having to allow others to build digital wallets that can tap into Apple's tap-to-pay chip that are on the iPhones.",

Thank you so much, Brian Fung.Well, I want to bring in someone who, frankly, knows Apple better than most, if not all. One of the company's co-founders, Steve Wozniak, joins me now. So exciting to have you here. I can't think of a better person to have this conversation with, Woz. I'm so glad you came. How are you? STEVE WOZNIAK, CO-FOUNDER, APPLE:  Oh, my gosh, I'm really good. We're on a long, long road trip vacation. We got a free month. And so, I'm so happy to be able to do this. COATES:  Oh, me, too. I hope you have a good road trip. I'm jealous, frankly, that I'm not traveling along with you. But I'm sure you're going to have lots of stories to tell, and you'll have to share it with us someday. But, look, I know you're not a lawyer, so let's avoid the legal perspective. I can bring that in a different realm. Maybe not on a Friday night. But, look, Apple stock, it has gone up nearly 5,000 percent since the launch of iPhone, the one sitting right next to me, by the way.

WOZNIAK:  I think there are things you can say on all sides of it. I'm kind of glad for the protection that I have for my privacy and for not getting hacked as much. Apple does a better job than the others in tracking you. Tracking you is questionable but, my gosh, look at what we're accusing TikTok of, and then go look at Facebook and Google, and that's how they make their business.
