      "sentences": "Well, first of all, who is surprised? I'm really who is surprised by the way that some Republicans are attacking and attempting to other rides vice president Kamala Harris now that she's a black woman of South Asian descent, the presumptive Democratic nominee 101 days until Election Day, but not even seven days into this new matchup. The sexist and racist rhetoric around the Harris candidacy has begun. Some Republicans are calling this, let me see if you've heard this, the DEI candidate using diversity, equity and inclusion as a slur. And of course, they're suggesting that her primary qualifications are that she's a woman and a minority ignoring that she has been elected at the local, state and federal level.And listen, there is Harris policy to scrutinize later this hour, we're going to do that we're going to focus on her policy towards Israel and the war in Gaza. But this DEI narrative is intended to suggest that she's just unqualified. Now have race and gender historically been relevant when choosing a running mate? Of course. Of course it has. Otherwise how would you explain the 47 white men who had the job before her? Now the tone here is clear. Just because it was expected though that does not mean that we should not call it out and the people who use it to account. Former President Donald Trump mispronounces their name he calls a garbage, a bum. You've seen the clips, we don't need to play him again here. This week, Republican vice presidential nominee J.D. Vance said that Harris has not shown enough gratitude. Vice President Harris talked about our love for the country. But Vance says yeah, but she's not grateful enough. Despite the rapid coalescing of the Democratic Party behind Harris in the hundreds of millions of dollars raised in the day since there was this headline for The Washington Post this week. Harris's ascent feels some black women with jubilation and fear. And this from the New York Times, \"In interviews around the country, black voters voiced enthusiasm for the reshaped campaign. They also worried about how a polarized country would see it.\" And this from this Associated Press who spoke with black women voters here in Atlanta, 23 year old Carrington Jackson put it this way. \"She's at the intersection of sexism and racism. I think now that's going to be a whole other battle as well as competing against Donald Trump's supporters.\" And this 146 year old Mary Jameson, she puts it this way. \"If a white woman can't win, how can a black woman wait?\" Harris, of course, is not the first to try. Shirley Chisholm ran for the Democratic nomination in 1972. She did not win it. But she shared this lesson about politics. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SHIRLEY CHRISHOLM, FIRST BLACK WOMAN ELECTED TO CONGRESS; PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  How is breaking that tradition, that tradition in which only white males have only been the gentleman in this country that have guided the ship of space, so you don't expect people black white men or women to suddenly overcome a tradition that has been steeped ever since the inception of this republic? So I understand that I've broken the ice. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Since the 1950s, the majority of white women have voted for the Republican presidential candidate and all but two elections. And so I wanted to take the baton from Jotake. She gave me her counsel incredibly wise, and she told me that the work that white women need to do is different. And so we came together on this call, which was less of a rally and more of a reckoning, to talk about the mistakes that we've made, the regrets that we have, and how we can do better going forward.I woke up this morning to an email saying that we have now raised over $10 million. But this is just the start. We have a coalition call on Monday night with leaders like Jotaka, for women for Harris, and it is a call I would love for everyone to join Monday night, because the only way we win this election in 100 days is if we come together and stand shoulder to shoulder and get out there and get out the vote together. And that's exactly what we plan to do. BLACKWELL:  Shannon, let me stay with you because there is, as you might appreciate some skepticism that when white women in November get to the intersection of race and gender, that as you suggested, the majority will choose their whiteness over their gender as they did the last two times that Donald Trump was on the ballot. Let's take a look at 2020 and 2016. In 2020 55% of white women voted for Trump, according to CNN exit polls 52% in 2016, when there was a white woman on the ballot for Democrats. Why should anyone expect that this year will be different that when you hit that intersection, white women will choose Kamala Harris over their whiteness, and focus on Donald Trump.",

And I am hopeful that when we hear these comments from the other side about cat ladies and women who don't have children and taking away women's access to abortion or even IVF that that will get some of the women the white women who are sitting on the fence off of the fence and get them on the right side of this issue.My friend Brittany Packnett Cunningham always says, your whiteness will not save you from what the patriarchy has in store for you.

Christopher Dunn has spent 30 years in prison for murder he did not commit. So when the St. Louis Circuit Court overturned his conviction in order his immediate release his family was as they describe it over the moon.On Wednesday, his wife was on her way to pick him up. But Missouri's Attorney General Andrew Bailey has been fighting to keep Dunn in prison and before he could be set free, Missouri Supreme Court blocked his release. And a statement to a CNN affiliate in St. Louis Bailey's office said, \"Throughout the appeals process multiple courts have affirmed Christopher Dunn's murder conviction. We will always fight for the rule of law and to obtain justice for victims. Christopher's wife Kira is with us along with Tricia Rojo Bushnell. She's the director of the Midwest Innocence Project, which represents Dunn. Welcome to you both. And Kira, let me start with you. I understand that you visited your husband twice yesterday. What is he saying and feeling? KIRA DUNN, CHRISTOPHER DUNN'S WIFE:  Well, Chris is a very strong and resilient person. We found over the years with these enormous ups and downs that if we take that right emotionally on that roller coaster, we won't survive it. Chris has already had three heart attacks since his hearing in 2018. So we've learned to live emotionally somewhere in the middle. And so even though this was a huge hit, and Chris was as low as I've ever seen him, he's stabilized here and we're just living in the moment, moment by moment, keeping our hope alive right now.",

But in Missouri is the only state in the country that says innocence is not a claim to get out of prison unless you are sentenced to death. And Chris wasn't sentenced to death at that time. And the only reason his innocence was allowed to be heard this time was because a prosecutor brought that motion.So this isn't a moment where Chris is just alleging something that hasn't been proven.

He'd had his blood tested. He'd been processed out in every way and was just finishing those final signatures.

But I also recognize it as a symptom of a larger culture within our politics, and unfortunately, even within the Democratic Party of anti-Arab and anti-Palestinian racism and bigotry that, you know, has no problem trying to shut down or silence or malign people who are speaking up for Palestinian human rights.

And these anti-literacy laws made it an actual crime to teach newly freed slaves or Negros the ability to read or write. It was actually literally punishable under law, you can be fined, whipped, and imprisoned. And so, what we're seeing now is a reemergence of what we'd like to call modern day anti-literacy laws. And so, there were multiple calls from a large coalition of people in lawmakers and the NAACP and the ACLU to really urge the Georgia State Superintendent to reconsider his position before we reconsider it for him, because this is an elected position.And he's supposed to serve in the best interest of all Georgians and all students.

I'm an artist from Philadelphia and based in Mexico City and I work in primarily collage sculpture, ceramics, a plethora of different mediums throughout 2014, '15. That's when I started developing my collage practice. This is when I think a lot of these social movements were gaining traction around the country, Black Lives Matters, Me Too, all of these things. I mean, we've been talking about these things for a while in our communities but -- and again, you know, national traction.Collage for me is -- it's a way of building upon layers. And I found myself as I was speaking about these things there was layers that I had to peel back from myself. And collage really helped me look at these different aspects of everything. You know, I was able to play with my own image, but also the images of other people and create a narrative that spoke two different things at the same time. And I was chosen to produce the Paris 2024 Olympic posters, synchronized swimming for the Olympics and then relay raced Paralympic relay race for the Paralympics. When 1924, Paris hosted the Olympic Games, and I use that poster as kind of a starting point. And it was a very different poster. I wanted to kind of use that as a starting point and show what that might look like today in 2024 so that maybe in the next 100 years they can look back at my posters and kind of see who we were as people, what we stood for. I think that's kind of the job as an artist is to be kind of record keeper for the times that you live in. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
