Now, the former president -- seen there the day he was detained -- faces charges of rebellion and conspiracy. Peru's new government is furious about President Lopez Obrador's public support of former President Castillo, going as far as ordering the Mexican ambassador to Peru to leave the country and declaring him persona non grata. ROMO (on camera):  The political crisis has become an international saga with the new Peruvian government accusing Mexico of meddling in its internal affairs. And Mexico saying the due process rights of Pedro Castillo were violated when he was ousted. But Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador didn't stop there. He also railed against the U.S. government. OBRADOR (through translator):  And I, to be honest, am very sorry that the United States government, which always talks about democracy -- in this case, instead of asking that the will of the people be respected, that the democratically-elected president be respected -- what they end up doing is endorsing all the shady maneuvers to remove the president. ROMO (voice-over):  More specifically, the Mexican president criticized the recent meeting U.S. ambassador to Peru Lisa Kenna held with current Peruvian President Dina Boluarte, who succeeded Castillo, as well as other officials in the new government. He also criticized the fact that the White House recognizes Boluarte as the legitimate president of Peru when Mexico still considers Castillo, the South American country's true president. Earlier this month, the U.S. Embassy in Lima said on Twitter that \"The United States reaffirms its respect for the democratic institutions in Peru and rejects any misinformation that promotes contrary ideas. We continue to support of the people of Peru and call for peace and unity.\" President Lopez Obrador is expected to host both U.S. President Joe Biden and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in early January for the North American Leaders' Summit to be held in Mexico City.

JOHN KERRY, U.S. SPECIAL PRESIDENTIAL ENVOY FOR CLIMATE:  And we have been working very closely -- without China -- even if the U.S. is, as we are, moving towards a 1.5-degree program, which we are -- if we don't have China, nobody else can make it to that goal. ROBERTSON (voice-over):  As with previous years, 2023 will offer opportunity to develop diplomatic off-ramps, perhaps none more poignant than the G7 to be hosted by Japan in Hiroshima. There will be another climate summit, too. But as this year's COP 27 in Egypt showed, during global economic hardship domestic politics trump collective salvation. The G20, in India, could be a place where compromises are made. The war in Ukraine would be in its 19th month and by then, battlefield realties hard to ignore despite Putin's new threats of a long war. ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  This will end, and it will end almost certainly with diplomacy, with a negotiation. But what I think we have to see is a just and durable peace, not a phony peace. ROBERTSON (voice-over):  So, the big diplomatic question for 2023, how to get Putin to agree. The answer may lie in the soaring food and energy costs triggered by the war. If the global situation worsens, collective pressure for some kind of peace will increase.

We've seen the quarterback cast as a pretty frustrated figure on the sidelines a few times already this season. But in the end, in his 331st start, he put on the show that we've come to expect. How'd he do it? Because he's Tom Brady. He always does it. It was a pretty -- it was not really a pretty game by his standards. He threw a pair of interceptions to Marco Wilson in regulation -- the second one coming while the game was tied at six in the third quarter. And then, with eight minutes left in the fourth, the Buccaneers found themselves down 10 and Brady would go to work after that. It was a third and goal situation. He found Rachaad White to cut the Cardinals' lead down to three. And then from there, Tampa Bay would force overtime. The 45-year-old quarterback looking like his old self. Brady ended up completing all six of his passes on a drive of 69 yards and then coming up clutch when it mattered the most. Kicker Ryan Succop capping of Brady's 57th career game-winning drive as the Bucs keep their playoff hopes alive with a 19-16 win. Elsewhere, the Dolphins taking on the Packers. It was 46 degrees at kickoff. And if it was, in fact, that cold, that's the coldest home game since 1989 for Miami. But that didn't seem to bother the Dolphins one bit early on. Tua Tagovailoa finding Jaylen Waddle for the 84-yard touchdown in the opening quarter. Good luck catching that guy. The second half, though, was all Packers. AJ Dillon running this one in for the score in the third quarter to tie the game up a 20. And then in the fourth quarter, the Green Bay defense really came to life and they might have saved the Packers' season. They would pick off Tua three straight times, the final one coming with just about 90 seconds left, to seal the 26-20 win. Jaire Alexander had one of those three interceptions.
