Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. Tonight, colliding crises in the Middle East. How should the Biden administration respond to the killing of the first Americans in this October 7th war? Three are dead and dozens injured after the USS and Iran- backed militia conducted a drone attack on their base, which is known as Tower 22 in Jordan. How can the United States also convince Israel to ensure fewer civilians are killed in Gaza, where Palestinian health authorities now say more than 26,000 are dead, 200 killed in the last 24 hours alone? And Israel reports Hamas sent a barrage of new rocket fire its way. How will more desperately needed humanitarian aid reach Gaza as the United States and almost half the donors suspend funding to the U.N. agency that does this after Israel shared intelligence showing 12 UNRWA staff members were allegedly involved in the October 7 attacks on Israel? Daniel Kurtzer was U.S. ambassador to Cairo under the Clinton administration and Tel Aviv for George W. Bush. He's advised many administrations. And he's joining us now from Washington, D.C. Ambassador Kurtzer, how concerned are you about the killing of three servicemen? It appears this was inevitable, that this was going to happen at some point. DANIEL KURTZER, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO ISRAEL AND EGYPT: Well, it's not surprising that, our troops that have been in the line of fire now for many years in the Middle East, have suffered casualties. It's sad and it's presented Washington with a dilemma about when and how to respond. Clearly, the situation in Gaza has inflamed tensions, but these attacks were going on even before the war in Gaza. And the objective, of course, has been that if we're fighting the terrorists there, we're preventing them from organizing and attacking elsewhere. So, my guess is that the administration will calibrate its response so as not to widen a war, but will certainly respond in a manner designed to make a convincing argument that these attacks should stop.",

But I know whatyou mean, that that's where this coalition, if you like, of Iran-backed proxies are stationed. I want to ask you another question on this regarding the urging to go to war against Iran itself. A democratic strategist, Simon Rosenberg, basically said about the GOP, if you are unhappy with Iran today, first thing you should do is come out for funding Ukraine fully.

Iran has thrown all of itsweight, some of its technology at drone making capability behind Russia's attacks in Ukraine. And therefore, there's an urgency in Washington to ensure that we continue supporting Ukraine. And that makes for a very difficult political problem here because Republicans have tied funding for Ukraine and for Israel to a border deal, which is being negotiated. So, it's a very complex intersection of foreign and domestic politics. But I think that Rosenberg is exactly right, that the last thing we would want is to pull back from Ukraine or to walk away from the Middle East and allow both Russia and Iran to score a success.",

So, Trump has politicized a national security issue and he has politicized an issue that would have been a victory for him had it been achieved during his presidency. So, we have a problem here, which we've had now for a number of years where politics has invaded every aspect of life, including on this very important issue of how to control our southern border.",

Now, the U.N. says these are very serious allegations. I believe they've fired -- UNRWA have fired these 12 and investigations go on. Let me ask you first.

But as you say, if it's not UNRWA then it has to be Israel, right? This is Anshel Pfeffer, the famous Israeli journalist who wrote in Haaretz today. Israel is not about to suspend its ties with UNRWA, unless the Israel Defense Forces decide it wants to distribute the food, water, and medical supplies to over 2 million Palestinians in Gaza, it needs UNRWA to do it. It's just a matter of time before those Western governments restore UNRWA's funding. I think you agree with that. But it does go to the fact that the suspension is probably temporary. But the fact of the matter is that there is an ongoing, I mean, major conflict between Israel and the U.N. in general.",

Onthe one hand, Israel has known for quite some time that UNRWA is a very faulted organization. Their educational system preaches hatred and incitement. It has been infiltrated by very rabid opponents of Israel. Now, on the other hand, it is the most effective deliverer of education and social affairs and food aid and so forth on the ground. And the argument that this person made was that there will be a reckoning someday, but that it can't take place now because the humanitarian needs on the ground are too severe. So, I think Anshel Pfeffer is exactly right. And the U.N. ought to act swiftly to deal with this, so that we can get back to a situation which UNRWA can deliver aid the way it has until now.",

And to that end, you know, the -- there's been -- as described, there was a rally in Jerusalem of government ministers and Knesset ministers -- members rather, calling for the resettlement of Gaza despite, as we know, warnings from the United States, the top U.N. court. This is what the national security guy, Ben-Gvir, said at the event.

I think there were 11 or 12 ministers who attended that conference and called not only for the resettlement of Gaza by Israel, but basically said that that means the depopulation of the Palestinians in Gaza. So, Netanyahu is clearly not in charge. It shows in the polls. The latest polls show he has somewhere less than 20 percent support for remaining in power. Most of the retired national security community in Israel wants him out. But he's hanging on, and that puts a little bit of pressure on Washington, on the president to back up his words that he shared with Netanyahu with some actions to see whether or not we can change -- see change in Israeli policy.",

Earlier this month, North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Un, tested a new ballistic missile, launched several cruise missiles, and claimed the successful test of an underwater nuclear weapons system. Once focused on a reunified peninsula, Kim Jong Un is now calling the South his primary foe and invariable principal enemy. Those are his words. Even tearing down \"the arch of reunification,\" a symbol of hope for the peninsula. Earlier, I spoke to South Korea's former foreign minister, Kang Kyung-wha, who told me that to prevent conflict there, there needs to be meaningful engagement, not just show summits, like the one led by President Trump in Hanoi in 2019, which she called a debacle.

Are you more and more worried, like everybody appears to be, about your northern neighbor? Kim Jong Un, head of North Korea, has done a whole load of much more provocative things recently. And has said that, one way or another, you know -- one way or another, there will be reunification, even if it's not peaceful. Do you think that he's on a path to war? KYUNG-WHA: Well, it certainly feels that way, but he always tempers that hawkish statement with moderation. So, for example, I think after he says all these things filled with hostility, he says, unless somebody touches us first, we're not going to touch them. The exercises are not designed to harm anybody -- any countries around. So, you see a bit of an attempt to control the level of the hostile rhetoric. It is still concerning, of course. But this heightened rhetoric plus the testing of the missiles, this is a continuation of a pattern that began after the debacle of the 2019 Hanoi Summit between the United States and North Korea. After that, they immediately went back to launching the missiles, and that has picked up speed more frequency in the recent years, and then the -- you know, the rhetorical hostility that goes it -- with it is, of course, more recent.",

Andof course, it was all meant to be rosy before they had met in your country, in South Korea, or at least up there at the border. And it was all meant to be rosy. But you're saying that actually what Trump did didn't amount to much. There was no ratcheting down of tensions. KYUNG-WHA: Well, I think -- yes, I think what came out of that -- so, what didn't come out of that summit is, you know, in hindsight, it's all a very missed opportunity. An opportunity that could have -- the life of that opportunity should have been kept, even if they didn't have an agreement there. I think that somehow a way to continue the discussion to keep North Korea engaged would have been extremely important. And frankly, we would not be in this situation. But I think, you know, that the -- the failure I think is explained -- I explained it that's what -- the president has tremendous desire, intention to do something, but there was very little backup at the working level. And this is -- you know, this is the typical Trump leadership on these issues. Will, but very little follow up and support from the working level.

The close collaboration between Russia and North Korea on the military front. North Korean's artillery shells and missiles going to the Ukraine battlefield is a concern, not just for us here on the Korean peninsula, but also in Europe. So -- and it's glad that Mr. Sullivan expressed that concern to the Chinese in Bangkok to Mr. Wang Yi, very explicitly and requested called for China's intervention. China's pressure on the North Koreans to do something about this. What China does about it. We'll have to see very carefully. But it's a global concern. So, I think it's right that the media has now returned its focus on North Korea's behavior. But we also need to calculate, yes, we have to respond with a very solid defense posture for sure, so that we're prepared for any provocations. But -- and we must do it with overwhelming force that -- so that it's the - - one round finishes the provocation and doesn't escalate into further us. Because if we get into that stage, it becomes really, really difficult. And I don't think anybody, at this time in the world, would like to see another flashpoint getting out of control.

Trump has also said that if he returns, he is going to slap a 60 percent tariff on all goods from China. Does threatening to slap a 60 percent trade tariff on China hurt or hinder stability?

And they found themselves, they tell us, they say -- they said it to the committee and they said it to us, they find themselves in a moment, a critical moment in their lives where Rudy Giuliani, Jenna Ellis, one of Trump's attorneys, and Trump himself, on the telephone asked them to do something that they felt uncomfortable doing, that they thought he was asking them to lie. And in every case, these Americans, these right-wing conservatives, Trump supporting Americans chose the constitution.",

You can hear what his own attorneys thought in many critical moments. It was a supercharged environment around the White House. And the great good news for those of us who practice long form journalism is a lot of it exists. Exists on the record, exists by people who are willing to talk to us, exists by audio recordings, video recordings. It's pretty hard to make the argument, for example, in a very simple way that the crowd was just really slightly unruly. They got a little bit out of hand, but they didn't really commit criminal behavior when you look at the video of the criminal behavior being committed.",

We know he's a big believer in conspiracy theories. When is talking about a conspiracy a crime? When is it, as they say, crime -- yelling fire in a crowded theater when there isn't a fire. You know, what is the -- is that a First amendment right? You have the right that freedom of speech. You do not. And the limits on what the president of the United States can say with impunity, is it limited? His defense team is arguing, no, he can say anything he wants. He's the president of the United States. And if presidents can't say anything they want, and if they are not free to speak, be careful of any rules that come along that limit that because someday your president, the one you like the other side maybe trying to get him or her for their speech for things they say in office. So, that fine line, that argument over that fine line, Trump's lies, are they illegal? And when and where would they be illegal in a case like January 6th?
