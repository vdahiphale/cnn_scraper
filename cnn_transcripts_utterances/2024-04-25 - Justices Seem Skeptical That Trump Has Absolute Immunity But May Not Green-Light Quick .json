It seems completely tautological to me for us to hold that presidents cannot be prosecuted under any criminal statute without a clear statement from Congress to avoid the question of whether or not the Constitution allows them to be prosecuted.

And the court offered a construction that it had to be for because an official act to avoid that problem. I think if there was such a well-received understanding that presidents are not included in general federal criminal law unless the president is specifically named, which he is not in section 201.

I thought he was arguing that all official acts get immunity. And so I didn't understand us to be having to drill down on which official acts do.

[12:40:02] I mean, we have amicus briefs here from Professor Liederman, for example, who says, you know, a president would not be prohibited by statute from perjuring himself under oath about official matters. From corruptly altering, destroying, or concealing documents to prevent them from being used in an official proceeding, from suborning others to commit perjury, from bribing witnesses or public officials. And he goes on and on and on about the things that a president in office with the knowledge that they have no criminal accountability would do.

Two hours and 40 minutes, right, I'm sorry.Time flies when you're having fun. Two hours and 40 minutes of oral arguments in a very momentous U.S. Supreme Court case. Donald J. Trump petitioner versus the United States, in which all nine justices tested the arguments of that of Donald Trump's attorney, as well as that of the attorney representing Special Counsel Jack Smith, who is seeking to prosecute Donald Trump. But Mr. Trump and his attorneys are claiming that he should have immunity for official acts he committed while he was president. And right now, as we heard from the justices, they realize they're making a decision, not just about this case, but a decision that will have implications for all future U.S. presidents. Let me bring in Laura Coates because it sounded as though some of the justices were more focused on what their ruling might potentially mean for a future president than they were focused on what this meeting would mean for the prosecution of Donald Trump. I don't mean that as a value judgment, I'm just in terms of how they were testing the arguments. LAURA COATES, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CHIEF LEGAL ANALYST: Well, we want that in part to think about the long term consequences of this question. Would a president have immunity? It's not just looking in the past, it's about what would come forward. Now, remember, this really came down to the last few minutes of this oral argument. Ketanji Brown Jackson asking the question about these competing interests. On the one hand, you have someone like Donald Trump who was saying, listen, every president has got to have immunity. Otherwise, they'll be so afraid to do their actual job. I'm paraphrasing, of course. And she's saying that's one interest. But the other one is, what do you do with an unbounded president who has no fear of any criminal liability, and the only solution is a political one? How do you balance those two things? And ultimately, the entire discussion today was about that. But also about, well, what should we be doing in this instance right now? Is this what we can resolve right now? Or is it a matter of us taking it back to the lower court and saying, listen, you guys figure out what's an official act. You guys figure out what is a personal act. We're not going to go through a list, give you an itemized list of all the things that could be presidential and what could be personal. You figure that out. Now the consequence of that is, is it about the prosecution that would be impacted here today, or about a prospective one in the future? And that's where you look at the counsel for Trump. We all want to have resolution. We all want to know what the answer is today. But it's in their best interest to have it put off to the future. To think about it not for this moment, but maybe prospectively that buys more and more time.",

And it's pretty clear from what we heard that the majority of justices are not willing to just toss out the special counsel's case.And as you heard there, from her, she's like, you could potentially make the Oval Office, right, this hotbed of crime. And it was interesting, too, from the Trump legal team, we even heard them kind of draw down some of their argument, because Justice Amy Coney Barrett, she got one of Trump's lawyers to concede that not everything in this indictment was an official act that was so significant. And so that's kind of the bad news for Trump, right? But the good news is that Chief Justice John Roberts clearly believes that the lower courts did not do enough to suss out exactly what is an official act versus a private act. So what they're setting up here is likely the justices are going to come up with some sort of test and then send it back down to the lower courts for more litigation. And what that means is that we could, maybe, all be sitting here again in a year after more litigation at the lower court level. Or, if Trump is re-elected, he can make this case go away. So even if he's not likely poised for a legal win at the high court, strategically, it sounded like this is going to be a win for him.",

I mean, the whole idea of the Constitution, they put the Congress as Act I rather than the presidency. There were checks and balances on a president.The idea that simply by ascending to that office you can do whatever you want and that makes it a law? I mean, that's an absurd thought. And we're not really dealing with that right now. My guess is what everybody else is saying, that the Supreme Court will reject that idea of absolute immunity, but somehow throw it back on the courts, the lower courts, which means it'll be delayed and the accountability will never be had. And the only hope for that, I think, is what Abraham Lincoln said is if the rule of law is not followed, that that's the most important thing that a democracy will be failing at. He gave a famous speech in the 1830s about mob law having replaced the rule of law. And he said, let reverence for the law be taught to the children by their mothers. Let it be taught in the schools. Let it be taught in the bully pulpit. And that's the way we'll be able to get out of a problem that we have when a possible dictator might arise. So now the real challenge, I think, for our country is we're left, we didn't have it on January 6th, I thought that would educate the country as to the failure of the rule of law by not agreeing to the transition of power. I thought it would happen with the Senate hearings. Now it's going to have to happen during the election. And what Lincoln would say is it's so important to somehow educate the country, go back to the founding, go back to the Constitution, and educate the country as to what's happened here. And then the people will have that power, not a jury of 12, but the people will have that power in November to get that accountability in case President Trump were to win the election again, and then make the case go away as we've said that it might. COOPER: Well, I mean, it's so interesting you're drawing parallels between our moment today and the situation facing Abraham Lincoln. I mean, obviously, look ahead of the Civil War and during the Civil War and after the country was incredibly divided. Did -- I mean, how does it compare to the divisions we see today? You know, I was looking at the demonstrations on college campuses, which we were reporting on yesterday. And then you think back to the demonstrations which took place on the Columbia campus in the 1960s, where students were actually even taking over buildings and holding, you know, officials from the college kind of hostage. How do you see the parallels?",

And one of the things that Lincoln said at the start of the Civil War, which relates to this whole transition of power, he said the central issue they were fighting for then was if the South that lost that election could decide they could secede from the union because they didn't accept the results of the election, then democracy would be an absurdity.It was impossible to have a popular government. We're not at that state where it's motion, where states are succeeding because they didn't accept the decision of the election. But we're at a state where we're -- we could be a continuing sense of questioning the results of elections time after time after time after time when one party loses. And that's why this has to be decided in the right way. But that's the great thing we can learn from history. We can learn what mistakes were made and hopefully we can change those because we still have a chance to write our own chapter for this next part of our history.",
