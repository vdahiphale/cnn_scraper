Kennedy. I mean, I'm not kidding, listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX): I don't get angry often, but you mess with my wife, you mess with my kids, that'll do it every time. Donald, you're a sniveling coward and leave Heidi the hell alone. I'm going to tell you what I really think of Donald Trump. This man is a pathological liar. He doesn't know the difference between truth and lies. He lies practically every word that comes out of his mouth. Donald does seem to have an issue with women. Donald.

And so, Cruz, who's up for reelection, thinks this is going to help him in Texas, which it probably will. But when you look back at history, recent history, it wasn't that long ago that he was -- that he was describing Trump this way. It's head- scratching. Lindsey Graham is another one, right, who is now an appendage of Donald Trump's.

If you look at Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis, while some of their criticisms of Donald Trump have come sort of late to the party, if you will, they've been very mild and timid for the most part because they recognize, as DeSantis said about Haley, we need these individuals to win a republican primary. And so, the last thing you want to do is insult the guy that most of them are currently supporting. I mean, in many ways, Trump really has ideologically transformed the Republican Party. It's not the contextual conservatism that I sort of fell in love with, philosophically speaking. It is more of a populist, nationalist movement party. And most of these politicians who care about being reelected, they care about power and influence, they recognize that, so they're going to fall in line. LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Yeah, he has transformed the base and the voters of the party and the coalition that Republicans like Ted Cruz believe that they need to win elections. Now, what's stunning is that on the same hand, even though a lot of Republicans like Ted Cruz and Lindsey Graham and others in the Senate and the House, they had a moment right after January 6th where Trump was his weakest. And at that moment, these establishment Republicans could have said, we're breaking, we're going to break now because if we don't, we're going to potentially lose future elections.",

Now, President Biden has signaled that he's open to negotiating with Republicans on immigration, on new asylum restrictions, and on potentially limiting the president's ability to offer limited entry to migrants from certain countries. Would you still support President Biden if he agrees to those proposals? BETO O'ROURKE, FORMER TEXAS REPRESENTATIVE: What I hope President Biden will do at tomorrow's meeting is lay out a bold vision and plan to secure our border and make sure that this country is living up to our values. The very extremist proposal that's on the table that you alluded to from Senate Republicans and even more extreme version from House Republicans would make a terrible situation at our border right now much worse. The problem, Abby, is that there aren't enough legal means for people to orderly and lawfully and safely come to this country when they're unable to stay in their own. That's why we're seeing the record numbers of apprehensions. The deal on the table right now would constrict this even further, which, by the way, would not stop the flow of people coming into this country. It would push them into the hands of smugglers and further worsen security and chaos at our border right now. So, I hope the president will stand strong for a much better deal. And yes, he should work with Republicans and Democrats alike to solve the problems that we have here. But the deal, as we see it right now, is a very bad one. The president is walking into a trap. If he agrees to this deal, not only will it be bad for the border and bad for immigration policy, it will be bad for his reelection in November of this year.",

You can't do it. But they're not doing it. So, what? We're just supposed to let this happen? So, we're going to work together with the states and the local sheriffs, so you're not going to have these conflicts like that exist right now between Biden and Texas or between Biden and local sheriffs and places down in Texas.

Should states do nothing if the federal government isn't doing enough to deal with just the sheer numbers, which I think you would agree are at a crisis point at the border?O'ROURKE: You know, what the governor is proposing would be akin to someone 60 years ago saying, you know what, we're just not going to follow federal law in the states that choose not to. For example, implementing Brown versus Board of Education. And in fact, when that situation occurred with Governor Faubus in Arkansas in 1957, you had President Eisenhower nationalize the guard there in that state to make sure that the Little Rock Nine could successfully integrate their local high school. I don't know if it has to come to that. Congressman Joaquin Castro today proposed that President Biden federalize the guard here in Texas because, as you know, the Texas National Guard, under the governor's order, is blocking federal border patrol agents from being able to do the job that they were trained to do, to literally secure our border and to protect against unlawful entries, and to save those who are in very desperate, very vulnerable situations. Because of the governor's refusal to follow the Constitution and U.S. law, we are seeing people die at record levels. In fact, in the El Paso sector where I am right now, last year, we had a record level of migrant deaths double the number that we saw the year before. What we need the president to do right now is to step up and successfully, peacefully confront Governor Abbott, make sure that he reimposes federal authority on the border. And then there's some other steps that he can take right now while he waits for Congress to do their job. He can speed up the asylum process. So, those who belong in this country can stay. Those who do not are returned to the country from which they came. He can authorize more people to work in this country. We have 10 million job openings right now that we can't fill. We have asylum seekers who are here, who are unable to work. And Abby, the last thing that he can do right now without waiting for Congress is to help regional partners throughout the western hemisphere who are actually shouldering a far greater burden of asylum seekers and migrants than the U.S. is, partners like Columbia who can no longer sustain the millions of Venezuelans who have come to that country. Why don't we help those countries, those migrants in those places so they don't feel the need to come to the United States right now? Those are the kind of bold steps the president could take right now and make sure that we do not have a further constitutional crisis here in Texas provoked by Governor Abbott.",

And just to quickly come back to the issue with which we started, if he's able to strike a far better deal on immigration, if he's able to lay out a vision and a plan that stir the energy and excitement and the interest of the people of this country, especially young people, for example, a deal that fully legalizes dreamers in this country, that creates a pathway to citizenship. More legal ways for people who want to come to this country, do better for themselves and do better for all of us, that's the kind of thing, that's the right thing to do for the right reasons for our country.

She is seeking more than $10 million in damages from Trump's defamatory statements about her sexual assault allegations. Trump denies any wrongdoing whatsoever. And today was the first time in decades that both Trump and Carroll were in the same room. A jury of nine people now has to decide how much in damages Trump should pay.
