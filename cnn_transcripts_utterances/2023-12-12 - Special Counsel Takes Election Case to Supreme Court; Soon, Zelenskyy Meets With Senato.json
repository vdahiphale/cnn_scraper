So, there are some things we do know and some things we don't know. Let's start with what we do know. There is such a thing as what we call civil immunity, meaning that a federal official or former federal official cannot be sued civilly for anything that falls within the scope of the job.We actually got that from a decision back in 1982 involving Richard Nixon. Nothing to do with Watergate, basically a former federal official had been fired during the Nixon administration, sues Richard Nixon and the Supreme Court says you can't sue him because firing and hiring federal officials, that's part of the job as president, that's within the scope of working in the White House. Now, here is what we don't know but we're going to find out very soon. First of all, criminal immunity. I put that question mark there on purpose. We don't know whether there is such thing as criminal immunity. Can you be immune from criminal prosecution? And the question really is, first, is there such thing as criminal immunity? The second thing, if so, did Donald Trump's conduct fall within the scope of his job as president or not? The way it was described to me, by the way, doesn't just apply to the president, when I became a federal prosecutor, was, if you get sued for bringing a case, for something you do in court, you're covered. That's within the scope of the job as a prosecutor. But if you go out in the weekend and get in a bar fight, not that I ever would, you're not covered for that because that's outside the scope. Now, the district judge has already ruled on this case. She has rejected Donald Trump's criminal immunity argument. She has said there's no divine right of kings, therefore, there is no criminal immunity. But that's the issue as it's teed up now.",

He was here at the White House yesterday meeting with National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan ahead of that full slate of meetings up on Capitol Hill, meeting with the full Senate and then one-on-one meetings with the House speaker and the House Democratic leader as well before coming here to the White House in the afternoon for meetings and a press conference with President Biden. And both Zelenskyy and President Biden have warned that in action on this aid on Ukraine will simply be playing into Putin's hands. You've had officials warning for weeks that not giving this aid to Ukraine at this moment will kneecap them on the battlefield. But Zelenskyy is really facing a very difficult and nearly impossible task at this moment. Republicans remain dug in that any aid for Ukraine must also have changes to border policy paired with it. And there are Republicans up on Capitol Hill yesterday who said that Zelenskyy's visit wasn't going to change their minds on that matter. So, right now, this is a very complicated moment for both Zelenskyy, who needs the support for -- to continue his fight against Russia on the battlefield, but also for President Biden, who has made his calls for western unity central to try to face Russia's aggression against Ukraine. HARLOW:  For sure. And tomorrow, a huge political battle is going to come to a head with the House deciding whether it will formalize an impeachment inquiry against President Biden.

He said, quote, if they press onwards with this baseless fishing expedition, it only proves how divorce from reality the sham investigation is and will come this is and will come at the expense of meaning work to actually address the issues the American people care about. But all of this could also present a very complicated, political dynamic for President Biden. If they decide to move forward with that impeachment inquiry, and then you potentially head into a full impeachment of the president heading into a 2024 presidential campaign, it all could complicate much of the political dynamics for him as well.",

They have a voice in who will serve them. And they have a voice in whether their values are going to be reflected in the decisions of lawmakers.

Because the Texas Supreme Court saying doctors can make this decision but they're essentially arguing that the language that Kate's doctor used wasn't clear enough.They write, Dr. Carson asked the court to preauthorize an abortion yet she could not or at least did not attest to the court that Ms. Cox's condition poses the risks the exception requires.

We have been watching them line up and get inspected. We have seen cases, for example, in their cargo holds from the World Food Programme.You can see another long line of trucks right here awaiting their turn to get inspected. They're coming from the Egyptian side of the border. And just in a few moments, they'll come around this corner to go down into that inspection process. But, Phil, essentially, what this does is that this allows for more approved aid to get into Gaza. It does not necessarily mean that more aid is going to get into Gaza. No aid will be crossing from this side. All of these trucks that you see here that are being inspected, they then have to go back into Egypt and back up to that Rafah crossing before they are allowed into Gaza. And so even if more aid is approved and Israel, has had a very strict inspection process, there's still a bottleneck at that Rafah crossing. Rafah is not built to handle a large volume of trucks.
