I'm Alisyn Camerota.Sources tell CNN that former Vice President Mike Pence may be open to telling federal prosecutors what he knows about Donald Trump's efforts to stop the peaceful transfer of power on January 6th. Tonight, we have more on what he might tell them. Plus, it's been a horrible 10 days of mass shootings in the U.S. from the murder of three UVA students to what happened at Club Q in Colorado Springs, and then last night, six people were shot and killed in a Walmart in Chesapeake, Virginia. Four people are still in the hospital tonight from that event. Is there any way out of this awful cycle that seems to be one of our national pastimes. Other countries don't endure this hell, what is the answer to ending mass shootings and this gun violence epidemic? We have a lot of people here with us tonight that have ideas that go way beyond thoughts and prayers. All right, so we have a lot to talk about. Let's begin with the Justice Department seeking testimony from former Vice President Mike Pence. CNN senior crime and justice reporter, Katelyn Polantz has been working this story for us. So, Katelyn, what's the latest tonight? KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN CRIME &amp; JUSTICE REPORTER:  Well, Alisyn, the Justice Department approached Mike Pence's team weeks ago wanting to talk with him in their criminal probe into January 6th and the moments after the election, obviously they're looking into Donald Trump, the White House, everything that was going on there to try and disrupt, potentially Congress from certifying the presidency and from allowing Joe Biden to become president. In this situation, our reporting is that Mike Pence is open to discussing a possible arrangement with the Justice Department where he could provide testimony. So, he would be a witness in this sort of situation. And we know throughout these past couple of weeks, Alisyn, the Justice Department has been carving out information around both Trump and Pence, right? They've been looking at the conversations that you would've had. We know that they have brought in Pence's top deputies, Greg Jacob, and Marc Short into the grand jury. They brought them back a second time into the grand jury in recent weeks. Then, because they had declined to answer some very, very deep questions into the heart of the Oval Office. Now they're sharing them. And so now the question is, will Pence also fill in whatever blanks are left? Will he choose to speak? And also, how aggressive will the new special prosecutor, special counsel Jack Smith be in wanting to move this forward and potentially have more negotiations with the Pence team.",

When you have a House committee, of course Congress has an oversight responsibility and they're investigating for that purpose. When we're talking about Department of Justice, we're talking about a department that is involved in criminality, not themselves, but in the investigation of it.And so, when you're doing that, the only effective way not to testify is to assert some privilege or to otherwise give the indication, Alisyn, that you shouldn't testify. I don't think, you know, the privilege will carry the day. I don't think he is looking to assert privilege. I don't think it necessarily applies here. And I think there will come a point in time that he does speak. Last point. You know, I think there's reasons to negotiate his testimony. The Justice Department always wants a motivated witness, a calm witness, a cooperative witness, a witness who is there not having any belief that they are, and he's not the subject to target of any investigation. I think it allows them to be more forthcoming. That is the witness. I think it allows them to be more explanatory. And by the way, there's a little wrinkle here. There's an election coming up upon which him and the president, the former president, may be, at opposite sides. And so, he may be very motivated to tell a story as to what happened, not to mention the book that you talked about. So, help me God, in which he has many excerpts in that book with respect to those conversations between him, the president, other parties who --",

The president's lawyers, including Mr. Eastman, were now requesting that I simply reject the electors. I later learned that Mr. Eastman had conceded to my general counsel. That rejecting electoral votes was a bad idea, and any attempt to do so would be quickly overturned by unanimous Supreme Court. This guy didn't even believe what he was telling the president.

You know, the whole -- the whole testimony, all four hours and 16 minutes is online. You can watch it if you want to this day, where he was subpoenaed. He appeared before the special counsel appointed by the Department of Justice, and he said a lot of really embarrassing things about conversations and actions that went on between him and Monica Lewinsky and others in the White House. So, Mike Pence, you know, I think Joey is right. You want him to be in a good mood. This is the first part of a negotiation, but in the end, he's going to have to testify. CAMEROTA:  Let's talk about what's happening with Donald Trump. I know it can be hard to keep up with all of the various cases that Donald Trump is involved in, but here, let's just break it down to this week and what's happened this week. So here is what has happened, Joey. The New York judge has scheduled a trial date for the Trump Organization in that lawsuit that's been brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James. The Supreme Court did clear the way for a House committee to get Donald Trump's taxes after he had tried to block them for years. An appeals court has been skeptical of Donald Trump's arguments for, you know, what he was doing with all of those classified documents at Mar-a-Lago. And then Senator Lindsey Graham has testified before the Fulton County grand jury again about trying to overturn the election results in Georgia. That's just, I mean, we're not done with this week yet, Joey, so that's what's happened.",

So, I think some -- at some point in time, Alisyn, you've heard the expression that chickens come home to roost, right? You reap what you sow. All the things you can say. I think that the reckoning time is here. And when you run for president, that does not act as a bar to investigations and potential indictments, and of course prosecution.

I saw some polling tonight before we went on the air. National polling that indicated Donald Trump's favorability with Republicans had dropped. Ron DeSantis was on the rise. It appears to me that Republican voters are finally catching up to all this and deciding maybe they've had enough and maybe the bags are too heavy to carry and too risky to roll the dice on him for another run from the White House.

Nice to have all of you. And we need solutions obviously with we're way past the time of thoughts and prayers. What's interesting, Jennifer, is that Virginia has relatively strong gun laws. So, I'll put up what they did in 2020. This was a democratic state legislature, and they made progress for, or at least what Democrats consider progress. And so, they passed universal background checks, which as we know are very popular with the public. There is a reporting requirement for loss or stolen gun, limit of one handgun purchase per month for most people that seems like it should be enough. And then they have red flag laws.

He threatened what he would do there would be retaliation if he was ever fired.I mean, is there no kind of screening or questions that could be asked by gun sellers.

It happens all the time, and other than in local markets, it doesn't even get reported. That's how entrenched it is in our culture. So, you know, you want to talk about who has responsibility? Yes. There's the gun sellers. Yes, there's the governor. There's also Walmart. There's the workplace. You know, the employees who went to work had the right to expect a safe workplace, not somebody who's a supervisor who's muttering to himself exhibiting deranged behavior and then took their lives. And the Occupational Safety and Health Administration part of the Labor Department, where's Marty Walsh? Where's the White House? What are they going to do about this? I've been writing about this for years. This has been going on for years. It's an absolute epidemic. There are the measures that can be taken but not if we don't collect the data, talk about the data. The secretary of labor needs to step forward today, right now, perhaps before the end of the week and say what he is prepared to do. There was some talk about violence being directed at hospital workers. That's a particular workplace where there was a lot of workplace violence during and after the pandemic.

Awareness and education are critical for these laws to work well, and that could have helped in Virginia and it could have helped in Colorado. Other laws like background checks, limits on high-capacity magazines and semiautomatic weapons. These are important. They're not restricting someone, but they're keeping people safe. And then there's a lot of community work that we can do. Strengthening the bonds within communities, learning the signs, recognizing the signs of someone who is in crisis or could be at risk of hurting themselves or someone else, and taking action to get that person help. Not thinking it's someone else's problem, someone else will take care of it. But actually, being that up stand and leaning in. That's something kids can do. That's something adults can do.
