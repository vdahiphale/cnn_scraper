That had led to many hospitals and clinics in the state to pausing access to IVF and IVF treatments. Donald Trump quickly came out and said that he supports IVF and that he thinks people should continue to be able to have access to it. So that is what I was told he was referring to last night. But, as you said, and I think we have to be very clear on this, the reason that this is even a topic of discussion right now about questions over whether women can access those treatments is because of the Dobbs decision and because Donald Trump had put conservative Supreme Court justices on the bench. But to get to the other part -- other parts of what he said during that town hall, I think another very striking moment was when he was asked directly about what he meant when he said over the weekend that the greatest threat to the United States is not our foreign adversaries, but the enemy from within. And I want you to take a listen to how he defined it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So go back to that decision in Alabama. Trump was one of the first Republicans to come out and say, whoa, whoa, whoa, we are not going to do anything to harm that, to get in the way of it, been promoting it. Now, I don't necessarily know the terminology. I think that town hall could have been a missed opportunity to have someone maybe like Megyn Kelly or Katie Britt or Melania or someone there to soften the message a little bit. But, I mean, no one can deny that in the party, he has been on the forefront pushing it. And I don't think women really think he's going to come and do anything to take that away. That's a Democrat scare tactic. And look at what he says he's going to do, what he's pushed in the party. He's been the most vocal, basically told the whole party to get in line.

If you're a disaffected Republican or an independent or maybe not decided, you're probably going to take a step back and say, I don't think that's very helpful. He said the same thing about Jewish voters and Catholic voters. And some of us kind of looked and said, I don't know if that was the best way to say that. So I don't think it brings people over, but it gins up the base, for sure. Now, look at Harris. I think she is making those overtures to Republicans and to undecideds. Now it's going to -- whoever is going to win, it's going to be the kind of election we're going to have. If this is a base election, Harris is not going to win. If this is going to be the kind of election where it's going to be decided on the margins in places like Washington, Pennsylvania or elsewhere, then Harris might luck out.

We are seeing now hundreds of thousands of people in Northern Gaza who are at dire risk as it relates to the humanitarian situation there.

That's probably number one. And, number two, when you're looking at the various targets within the master target list that's being prepared or has been prepared, there's always a final determination in terms of the currency of the intelligence, the validity of the intelligence, the source of the intelligence, and then a reading of the current condition on the ground, where you intend to strike. That's a very laborious process, and they need to go through that. That's an absolute necessity before you make a determination that this is a target that you want to strike. So I would imagine that that target list is pretty robust. Also, what type of delivery means? Is this going to be a kinetic strike? Are you looking at a drone? Are you looking at a ballistic missile? Or is there the application of cyber capabilities, where you really can do some mal -- the injection of some malware to cause some problems that may not pop up immediately, but then have some increased downstream effects, negative effects, obviously, on the Iranians?
