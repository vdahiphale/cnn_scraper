It's been there since the beginning of the war but really stepped up in recent weeks about how this is a defensive operation they're carried out in Ukraine, how this is a sort of an existential battle for Russia. This is really how he's trying to sell this to his people now that we're into the second year of this war. That they're not the aggressor, this is about defense. So, look out for that. We did hear Putin in December address the security services and called for them to step up, what he calls surveillance of traders, spies and saboteurs. This is very important -- a key hallmark of this conflict has been control of the population at home, control of information. There is, you know, serious barely any free media left. Things like the expansion of the foreign agent law. Border security is now part of it. So, I think that you can look out for more of that.

Here's what he shared earlier. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: They have studied coronaviruses for a long time. But that is not new information. I mean, reporters have been covering this know that. In fact, one of the lead researchers in the lab there in Wuhan is Shi Zhengli, known as the bat lady. She's known as that because she's been studying bats and coronaviruses really since the days of SARS. So, for some 20 years. So, that is not new information. But I think we need to know were the coronaviruses that were being studied in the lab, similar, identical or related to the virus that caused COVID. And you'd want to look at the actual viruses and do genetic sequencing of those viruses. Another thing that you can do -- there were blood samples that were taken from workers in the lab at that time. If you were able to go back and look at those blood samples and say did they show antibodies to the COVID virus, then that would be another pretty definitive piece of data. And then you know you'd obviously want to have a complete forensics investigation of the lab. But it's these things, these types of things that we don't have still. That's been the lack of transparency that so many people have been talking about. I think the answer to the question I think everyone is asking is knowable.
