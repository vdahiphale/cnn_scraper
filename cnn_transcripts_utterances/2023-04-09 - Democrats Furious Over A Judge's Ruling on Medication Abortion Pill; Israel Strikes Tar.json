Now, Republican lawmakers, meanwhile, have been far less outspoken and many have been virtually silent on the issue.And that's something that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer pointed out on a press call Saturday morning. Here's what he had to say. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY):  I think the Republicans know that these -- their decisions, the Dobbs decision, this court decision are wildly unpopular with the American people. They're probably, at least in some of the survey data, unpopular with a large number of Republicans. So what -- they are afraid to speak out. But that is outrageous. TREENE:  Now, I will argue that Schumer's press call was on a Saturday during a holiday weekend, so I'm not sure how many Republicans were actually playing close attention to him. But Schumer's point was valid. This is very tricky territory for Republicans to navigate. Abortion in the wake of the Dobbs decision has not been in warning message for them, and we saw that very clearly in the 2022 midterm elections. As for what Congress can do, they don't have many options. The bills that they want to pass are essentially dead on arrival. They can and have already begun applying pressure on the Biden administration to appeal the ruling, but legislatively, there really isn't much that Congress can do. Schumer has said, however, that Senate Democrats remain committed to passing the Women's Health Protection Act, which is a bill aimed at preserving abortion access nationwide, but that legislation failed to pass last year due to the balance of power in Congress and remains unlikely to pass now given Republicans control the House and Democrats have a narrow majority in the Senate -- Victor, Amara.

That area of concern growing bigger already rockets coming from Gaza, there is already a tip for tap there with the Israeli military, also southern Lebanon in the last few days, a tip for tat retaliatory strikes there.And now, Syria as well entering to into the fray, but it just demonstrates and explains to you how quickly an event on that very contentious site, of course, the Al Aqsa mosque site known as Temple Mount to Jews, any confrontation there, how quickly it devolves and brings really in the region into these escalating tensions, and that's where all eyes were today. Back on the old city, where three different faiths were observing three different religious traditions, all under a very heavy Israeli security presence. You have, of course, Easter mass taking place churches there inside the old city. You had a very important prayer serve service, rather taking place for Passover at the western wall. I know we have images to show you of that thousands of people there praying. And then at the top of the mountain, of course, on that complex, again, known as the Noble Sanctuary to Muslims, known as Temple Mount to Jews, you had coinciding prayers overnight, of course, the holy month of Ramadan overnight, Muslims were observing overnight prayers. Those took place peacefully, but there was a moment of tension there, Victor and Amara, when Israeli authorities overnight accused some youth of barricading themselves inside the mosque. Jordan's which is the protector, if you will, the manager of Al Aqsa mosque complex, responded quickly to those accusations, warning Israel not to enter the mosque as it had several days ago, warning that any raid on Al Aqsa mosque would have catastrophic consequences. Thankfully, the night did pass peacefully. But this morning, some Muslim worshippers, eyewitnesses telling us they were not allowed into Al Aqsa mosque to carry out dawn prayers. That coincided with some non most -- non-Muslim worshippers rather, Jewish groups visiting that complex. They are allowed, of course to pass through that site, to pass through that contentious area under a heavy police presence. Again, this day did unfold peacefully, but you still have that wider issue. You still have that bigger picture, escalating tensions, ramping up rhetoric. We don't know what happens next. But keep all eyes again on that holy site.",

Palestinian militant groups here in Lebanon have been blamed instead. But this group is so influential that whatever they say may well have an impact on what actually happens next. In the meantime, you have the Lebanese military that is trying to prevent the next attack or potential attack from happening. And when we went to southern Lebanon yesterday, we quickly realized started to understand how many challenges they have ahead of them. First off, just when you look at the landscape, you realize that there's plenty of good, easy places to hide weapons if you wanted to. You have Iraqi hillsides. You have orchards, things like that. There's all the complexities involved with the factions and the militant groups that they are trying to keep at bay. Plus, you have the Palestinian refugee camps there that have been there for decades that the Lebanese authorities don't actually have the jurisdiction to police directly. On top of that, it's easy to find people with an ax to grind when it comes to Israel. In fact, we went to the site of one of the Israeli strikes, and we found people who were making no apologies for Lebanese or rockets coming from Lebanon going into Israel. Here's one of those people.

Now, Jordan, Israel's neighbor, has warned any further actions at the site will have catastrophic consequences. The last hour, I spoke with Ron Dermer, Israel's minister of strategic affairs, who said Israel has a responsibility to protect worshippers of all religions visiting that holy site. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RON DERMER, ISRAEL'S MINISTER OF STRATEGIC AFFAIRS:  Well, what we can't do as these as Israel who's responsible for security on the site, we cannot allow innocent civilians to be killed by violent terrorists who would barricade themselves into the Al Aqsa Mosque. That is that is not that is not a policy that we would be able to adopt. We do not want to go in there. It is the last thing. Unfortunately today, Victor, we didn't have to go in because the people who went in there did not go there according to our intelligence to perpetrate violence, and so therefore there was no incidents. It's very rare when Israeli police have to go into the Al Aqsa compound. I think it's happened three times in the last half dozen years. It is the last thing we want to do, but we also have a responsibility to protect our civilians to protect Muslim worshippers to protect Jews and non Jews who go to the temple mount, which is part of the status quo. We cannot allow those violent young men who are masked, and were armed to perpetrate those attacks, because then you'll have a situation that will be infinitely worse than the pictures that you saw on Wednesday.
