Plus, Moscow launches yet another round of missile attacks on the key Ukrainian port city of Odessa. This upcoming week will bring little relief from extreme heat in the United States. Right now, some 80 million people are under heat alerts with dangerous temperatures expected in the desert southwest and in Southern Texas and along the gulf coast. Those temperatures will peak around five or ten degrees above normal. Arizona's capital has recorded miserable temperatures for week weeks. For the 23rd day in a row, Phoenix will hit a high of 110 degrees Fahrenheit, that's more than 43 degrees Celsius. But we've been seeing storms elsewhere in North America. Canadian officials have declared a state of emergency in pars of Nova Scotia. Storms dumped three months of rain on the province in 24 hours, causing extensive flooding.

      "sentences": "Laila, it's hard to know where to start, isn't it? But let's start with the prime minister's health at the moment. As you say, he's had a pacemaker installed as a result of this condition called a transient heart block, which effectively can either partially or completely block electric signals that control heartbeat, which can therefore lead to irregular heartbeats or preventing the heart from pumping enough blood around the body which can lead to dizziness, and as we're learning, fainting, which apparently also is what happened to Netanyahu a week ago.Now, according to doctors, and this is the first I believe that anyone's heard of this, according to doctors, this condition has been known for many years but it doesn't appear to have been publicized until today. But the operation, according to doctors, was a success. Netanyahu is expected to be discharged later today. And, of course, against this backdrop, we have the scenes of thousands upon thousands of protesters marching on Jerusalem for the past few days. They're there right now by the Supreme Court, by the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, as debate gets under way and the final readings then come on Monday and Tuesday for the first part of this government's controversial judicial overhaul. Now, the bit of this judicial overhaul that is at play right now is the so-called reasonableness bill. This would -- if passed, it would prevent the Supreme Court from striking out decisions by the government of the day which it deems unreasonable. Now, in the past, it has prevented, for example, Netanyahu appointing Aryeh Deri, one of his coalition allies, from being named as a minister because he's been convicted three times, including of tax fraud. And Netanyahu wants him, for example, eventually to be finance minister, among other things. The Supreme Court thus far has said that is unreasonable. If this part of this judicial overhaul passed, in future, the Supreme Court would not be allowed to say, no, you can't appoint this minister because he's been convicted for tax fraud. They wouldn't be able to say that that is unreasonable. And this is just one part of a much broader judicial overhaul that Prime Minister Netanyahu has been pushing. Now, before he went under the knife, interestingly, he did say that the efforts to reach a wide agreement are continuing. But there's no sign of any compromise just yet. These protests have been going for more than six months now. You recall that back in March, they were actually paused when Netanyahu's own defense minister called, Yoav Gallant, called for a compromise, for a pause in this legislation. That resulted in Netanyahu temporarily sacking Gallant and also spontaneous protests, which caused the strikes at the airport and other places and also for that legislation to be paused. Netanyahu has since continued. He's under pressure from all sides, really, because his more right wing and conservative coalition partners, they want this legislation passed, they want it to go forward. If Netanyahu doesn't go forward with it, then it's possible that they could break with him. At the same time, Netanyahu under immense pressure from the opposition, from all the protesters that we're seeing out on the streets week in, week out, for over six months. He's also under pressure from reservists, thousands of whom have now said that they will not turn up for duty if this legislation is passed without any form of compromise. And, of course, there's one other element of pressure, which is no less than U.S. President Joe Biden, who has also called for some kind of compromise to be reached in order to ensure that Israel's democratic character remains intact. So, pressure from all sides. That can't be helping Netanyahu's health. But, as I say, the operation was successful. The pacemaker has been installed. And Netanyahu himself plans to be in the Knesset, the Israeli parliament, for the readings and certainly for the votes on this first part of the government's controversial judicial overhaul. Laila?",

And there was a hospital worker, a woman, who said she had to delay her vacations because of this. and she plans to get going tomorrow. But, clearly, people are coming out. This is what both parties want, both the conservative -- the main conservative party, which is poised, according to the polls, to be the biggest vote-getter but might fall short of a majority, as you said. That leader has called for people to give him a majority on his own, whereas the socialist prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, who called these snap elections after his party suffered a drubbing in local elections at the end of May is also calling for a rebound and wants people to come out, a leftist wave.

AITOR HERNANDEZ-MORALES, IBERIAN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT, POLITICO: So, it's a key moment for Spain. Basically, during these past four years, what Spain has had is a left wing coalition government, that's the first coalition in Spain's history. And, basically, they have to decide whether they want to continue with Pedro Sanchez's government. He is a socialist prime minister. And, overall, his government has been characterized by progressive social measures, or whether they want to hand over power to Alberto Nunez Feijoo. He is the leader of the center right popular party. And as you were mentioning before, the key factor here is that neither of these classic big parties have enough power to be able to score an absolute majority. So, they're going to have to make deals. On Sanchez's side, it's pretty clear he would just repeat the coalition that he's had these past four years. But on Feijoo's side, it's more problematic or more troubling for Europe in the sense that he's very much open to making a deal with the far right. and that has people nervous in Spain and in Brussels.",

We've also had extended drought in Spain. So, these are not new problems for Spain. They're very much used to being kind of at the forefront of climate change on this continent. And yet climate change has not been an issue at all in this election. It's been a very odd campaign which many people have actually compared to an American-style campaign, a Trumpian-style campaign, because the right has very much focused on issues that are not real problems for Spain but are very emotional problems. So, much of the campaign has been spent, for example, discussing issues related to ETA, the Basque terrorist group, which disappeared over a decade ago. They're defunct. But (INAUDIBLE) has sought to try to link the current prime minister with this vanished terrorist group and suggests that he is somehow making alliances with these people that used to kill Spaniards and set off bombs. That still is an emotional trigger, especially for older generations of Spaniards. And so the focus of conversations have been on the issues like that instead of dealing with things like climate change, youth unemployment, which Spain has one of the highest figures, issues like the demographic challenge because the Spanish population is gradually declining, many other issues that are much more pressing for Spaniards.",

And so you want to make sure that you're partnering with brands that really focus on that same target, right? Otherwise, you're going to be lost in that mix, so to speak. But everything is pink. And I think everything can go pink this month as well as the brands. We're seeing things like fun buoy floats, swoon lemonade, pink lemonade. So, it's pink. You better believe they're trying to partner with Barbie. And if they're targeting females and young women, they're going to be trying to partner with Barbie. It just makes so much sense.",

Video from the crowd shows the moment lead singer Matty Healy kisses a band mate. Healy had finished delivering a speech full of expletives, slamming Malaysia's stance against homosexuality. Well, Malaysia responded by canceling the rest of the three-day festival. Some members of the country's LGBTQ community criticized the onstage kiss, calling it performative, and warning it could lead to further discrimination.

Maybe the 2019 finalists from Holland or perhaps the reigning European champions, England. The Lioness is, though, struggling, I will say, to beat tournament debutant Haiti on Saturday, and Brisbane had to having to rely and a retake and penalty before they could claim three points.Now, no question, it was a clear penalty, for sure, and Georgia Stanway's initial spot kick appearing to be well-saved by the Haiti goalie, Kerly Theus. England, though, get the retake. The keeper was well off her line when she makes that save there, no question. Stanway, the Bayern Munich midfielder, making no mistake this time around, 1-0 the final score. The English happy to get that first game out of the way with three points in hand. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
