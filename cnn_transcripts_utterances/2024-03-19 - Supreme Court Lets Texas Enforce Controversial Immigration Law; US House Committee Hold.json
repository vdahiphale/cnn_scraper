They are actually in Vegas for the day and a strong performance for the Dow as you can see, up eight-tenths of a percent ahead of that all- important Fed decision day on Wednesday. Those are the market these are the main events: The US Supreme Courts allows Texas to begin enforcing a controversial immigration law. On the eve of the Fed decision, the Bank of Japan raising interest rates and signaling the end of an era. And what a strange trip it's been. Unilever planning to spin off its ice cream unit including Ben &amp; Jerry's. Live from New York, it is Tuesday, March 19th, I'm Julia Chatterley, in for Richard Quest and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. Good evening. Once again, the US Supreme Court is letting Texas proceed with a controversial immigration law. The law allows state officials to detain and arrest people they suspect of entering the country illegally. Now the order isn't a final decision, though the law is facing challenges at a federal appeals court. Immigration advocates have raised concerns that the law could lead to an increase in racial profiling among other concerns. Joan Biskupic is in Washington for us. Joan, great to have you with us. Profound implications for migrants, whether they're recent or otherwise, for foreign relations with Mexico and upending long-held a balance of power between state and federal authorities. This was a big decision today.",

For more than a century, the federal government has been the one that would take enforcement and to its own hands and what Texas has done here is really different. And the fact that the US Supreme Court allowed it to take effect today is very significant, even though, as you say, this could be temporary. Now the majority of the court did not explain its reasoning, but three of our liberal justices dissented and said, at one point: \"Today, the court invites further chaos and crisis in immigration enforcement. Texas passed a law that directly regulates the entry and removal of noncitizens and explicitly instructs its state courts to disregard any ongoing federal immigration proceedings. That law upends the federal-state balance of power that has existed for over a century.\" So as I said, a lot of reverberations, now, to your point about the fact that this could be just temporary, a lower appellate court here is actually going to hold a hearing on the merits of this law signed by Governor Abbott on April 3rd. So the lower court could reconsider its original decision that this law should be able to take effect and maybe that would change things in the immediate weeks, but Julia, there is also a chance that the merits of this case will not be resolved for months and months, and that this law would be able to stay in effect for the long term, actually.",

How is this going to work? So first of all, we don't know how long it is going to last, but what we do know is at least for the next couple of weeks Texas authorities, if they believe, right, \"suspect\" is the language, so we have no standard for this. That someone is suspected of having broken immigration law, they will then have authority over that person. So that now all of a sudden, implicates anyone who doesn't satisfy what a police officer thinks an American looks like and secondly, once they're in court, does that mean that a state judge can say, well, I don't care what the federal rules are, I am going to detain this person even if the federal authorities determine that this person could seek asylum, that this person had family members, all of the complicated immigration rules that stand under federal law.

So you now have an authority to pick them up. They haven't done anything else illegal. They haven't gone through a red light, they haven't pick pocketed anyone. They've done nothing illegal. So, if you're a US citizen and you are Hispanic or even Black because we don't know how far -- we don't know -- you're not -- let's just say, you're not White, so are you going to carry a passport now to prove that you're actually a citizen?

So this is the foreign policy implications of this, and this is why you want a federal government in charge. But what if the immigrant says no? So now, you've just put this burden on state courts and state facilities. I can tell you Texas will not handle what is about to happen to it. It may not like -- I -- you know, this idea that the governor that we have this border surge, right, we have this border crisis. There is no exception in the Constitution for a governor to say, I don't like federal policy, right? And that's what the Supreme Court has now recognized and no, we just know given the Supreme Court that if this were a liberal governor deciding, we just want to let everyone in, right?

The bank's policy rate is now zero to 0.1 percent. It has been negative since 2016. Rising wages and mild inflation made the pivot possible. The US Federal Reserve has also begun its two-day policy meeting. It is expected to hold its benchmark rate steady on Wednesday. The fed will also release interest rate projections for the rest of the year. Raghuram Rajan is the former chief economist for the IMF, and now, professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. Raghu, great to have you on the show. Let's talk about the bank of Japan first.

The wage negotiations that Japan has every year to really look healthy for workers. And this time around, the shunto wage negotiation seemed to be trending towards 3.7 percent on average, wage growth for workers. So I think the Bank of Japan being the last Central Bank to raise rates. So, they all feel, it is there, that inflation is here to stay. This is not a premature move. And of course, with investors seeing seriously negative real rates in Japan, it is time for them to let the short-term interest rate go up. It is a tiny move, from small negative to small positive. Yes, they did abandon yield curve control that is holding the 10-year rate, but even that was not binding. They had said, if it goes about above one percent, we will react, but it is at 0.7 and change. So really these are tiny moves. It is more important for what it suggests for the future.",

What the long-term effects will be depend of course, on where they take interest rates, too. Right now, Japanese household are seeing that on their deposits on which they own pretty much nothing with inflation at two and three percent, they are earning negative real rates, contrast that with the US investor or the US household who is getting two-and-a-half percent real on their deposits. So a lot of Japanese money is going outside and what happens when Japanese rates come to a reasonable level, it is going to go back. That is going to affect liquidity in global markets. I mean, Japanese investors have been buying US equities. That is going to change. But it is also going to have effects on Japanese debt. The government is one of the most indebted governments in the world by some counts 250 percent of GDP. Of course, people talk about whether it should be net or gross. Nevertheless, it is a big number. And if you raise interest rates on that big number, very quickly, the Japanese government has to pay a lot in interest expenses and that is going to play out over time as a physical constraint on what it can do.

You think of the Unilever supply chain. They have brands like Hellmann's Mayonnaise, Dove soap and shampoo, those are those are dry products versus Ben &amp; Jerry's and Magnum which are cold supply chain products.

Our salary is worth nothing. This charity was born as a shelter for the homeless with the capacity for 50 people, but most of the over 200 meals handed out today are taken away and eaten at home. Volunteers asking for IDs to make sure nobody hoards on food, which is scarce for everyone. Inside, the kitchen is in full motion. Some of the guests are our own neighbors who I would have never imagined they needed charity, says this volunteer. And next to the kitchen, a clothing bank. This is another aspect of the new poverty crisis here in Argentina. When these service was started it was mostly for homeless people, adults, while instead here you see the sizes of 4 years old, four, five, six, seven, 8 years old, meaning that the families can no longer afford to buy the clothes for their little ones. Argentina's poverty rate was already rising before President Javier Milei took office in December. Since then, his focus has been on an austerity drive to bring inflation down. His reforms like devaluing the Argentinian peso over 50 percent were applauded abroad but punished many in Argentina, who have seen their salaries collapsed and can no longer afford to buy food.

I think this is an interesting story, Julia, because more than 15 years after the Greek debt crisis and the euro debt crisis, there's now a new head of state, Milei, who is spreading the austerity gospel, slashing down costs, trying to bring all the benefits down, and to say that, like he said in that piece and when he took office, there is no more money and so everybody needs to tighten the belt. Right now Milei is still popular here in Argentina. Most of the people we spoke this week in Buenos Aires have been telling us that they all agree that something needs to be done. And frankly that a shake in the system like the one that Milei is proposing is much welcome. It's been 20 years of continuous economic crisis, one after the other here in Argentina. But at the same time, they are worried that those who will end up paying the bill, foot in the bill, will be the poor, the most vulnerable, like the people that we met in that food kitchen. Those are people, Jua, that are not poor. This is Latin America. Poverty is an issue and is spread. But those people were the ones right on the threshold between poverty and the middle class.
