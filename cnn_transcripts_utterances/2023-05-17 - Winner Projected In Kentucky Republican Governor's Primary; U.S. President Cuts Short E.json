Joe Biden is leaving later today for the G7 summit in Hiroshima, Japan. He was supposed to visit Papua New Guinea and Australia afterwards for a separate set of meetings. But now he will be heading back to Washington right after the G7 for debt talks with congressional leaders as the U.S. creeps ever closer to default.The latest round of negotiations on Tuesday between Republicans and the White House resulted in no major breakthroughs. The top House Republicans said the two sides are still far apart, but that a deal is possible by week's end. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): I did think this one was a little more productive. We're a long way apart. But what changed in this meeting was the President has now selected two people from his administration to directly negotiate with us. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): But the bottom line is that we all came to agreement that we were going to continue discussions. And hopefully we can come to an agreement. We don't have much time.

House Speaker Kevin McCarthy says the two sides are far apart, but he expects a deal by week's end spending cuts in exchange for his party agreeing to lift the debt limit. But with only two weeks left to make a deal and get it through Congress, there is a risk the debt ceiling won't be raised in time.If that happens, what would default mean for the housing industry, house prices and everyone's mortgage payments?",

And so, if their value and the repayment of treasury debts came into question, we're concerned that could send cascading fear and uncertainty throughout the credit system. And what that would mean for homeowners and homebuyers is much higher borrowing costs, as lenders are worried about their counterparties. They require higher interest rates to make loans.So, we're estimating that this could raise mortgage rates by about two points, from about 6-1/2 percent toward 8-1/2 percent on a 30-year mortgage in the U.S. That would be a huge blow to affordability for homebuyers who have already been struggling with major affordability challenges in the last year or so.

And this is really the heart of the spring home shopping season in the United States. So, this, you know, this is the time of year when -- on Zillow, we see some of the most new listings on any given week. A lot of home buyers are busy out there.

There are only four of the 25 states that Trump won in 2020 that have Democratic governors but Kentucky is one of them.Andy Beshear, the son of a former governor is very much a survivor. He's a skilled politician. He has one of the highest approval ratings of any governor in the country. Daniel Cameron, the black attorney general is a rising star for Republicans. He has an identity independent of Trump. So, he's not likely to be as completely defined by Trump as some of the endorse candidates in '22. This is a very close race, but I think many people think that Bashir amazingly, is somewhat favored in deep red Kentucky because he has established enough of an identity separate from his own party.",

And he looked really formidable. He has struggled in the transition from his very cosseted life in a conservative media bubble in Florida where he has had very little interaction with the mainstream press as he's tried to go onto the national stage.A difficulty symbolized by his answer in which he originally dismissed really the American interest in Ukraine before doubling back. So, I think he is clearly less formidable today than he was. Donald Trump has a hold on a big chunk of the party, but DeSantis may be at a low ebb. I mean, it may be a kind of a time to buy the stock not in the sense that he necessarily will challenge Trump -- beat Trump. But there is still an audience in the Republican party among donors and strategist and even a share of the voters for an alternative to Trump. His belligerent, hectoring behavior at the town hall last week, I think reminded many voters not only outside, but inside the Republican Party, what they don't like about him. And as you say, in the period where DeSantis has struggled, none of the other potential 24 candidates have gained a really built much of a foundation.

Ukraine, he said, always gets the missiles wrong speaking to state media. So, obviously, both of those reports, both of those claims can't be true. A U.S. official later telling CNN that they believe that a patriot battery was damaged, though not destroyed. This was not officially confirmed by the White House National Security spokesperson John Kirby who said that they are not officially commenting on that. But if it was damaged, they would of course help to repair it either inside Ukraine or out. So, a lot of sort of conflicting information.
