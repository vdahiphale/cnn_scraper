Just a day earlier, President Biden was in Tel Aviv, a dramatic show of support for Israel which also saw a deal to allow humanitarian assistance into Gaza.Well, for more, CNN's Katie Polglase is live for us this hour from London. So Katie, the agreement on that humanitarian assistance into Gaza is seen as crucial to winning over lawmakers within Biden's own party, who are very much opposed to helping Israel. So, what's known on the assistance going into Gaza? What do you know about that? And also, how will the president's speech be received, this call for American leadership around the globe? KATIE POLGLASE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning. Well, clearly, this address from Biden was towards a domestic audience. It's to make very clear that this is a conflict that may be very far from America, but it has a very important role for American security. America still has a very important role to play on the global stage. Have a listen to what Biden said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

There has been indications in the past couple of months that American public support for funding Ukraine has been waning.A poll by CNN back in August suggested that 55 percent, over half of Americans, think that Congress should no longer be giving aid to Ukraine. Now, the situation for Israel is, of course, different. The war is more recent. There has, unfortunately, been a rise in anti-Semitic, Islamophobic attacks in the United States. All of this brings the conflict back home. But still, public support is very divided. A recent CNN poll found that just 35 percent of Americans think that the U.S. is giving the right level of assistance to Israel. Thirty-six percent are unsure. This is all a major concern for Biden. And then, of course, there is the question of getting this funding through. There is a leadership vacuum in the House of Representatives, so asking for overall over $100 billion is really quite a big ask. And really, if you look now at what's happening on the ground in Israel, we're seeing messaging just in the past few hours, really, that this ground invasion may still happen. The IDF is saying they still have the green light to go ahead. All of this indicates that this war is continuing to escalate, is continuing on. And there is this concern for the Biden administration that it will spread across the region. So further chaos, further violence. And so this message from Biden to the American people is saying that America's role matters. That this is a question for American security, as well as global security. And this money is an investment and as global events play out, America's interests are protected, as well -- John. VAUSE: Katie, thank you. Katie Polglase there, live for us in London.

In a letter to the British trade secretary, they argue that Israel's actions \"have starkly demonstrated its flagrant disregard for international law, in clear violation of the prohibition on collective punishment and the prohibition on starvation as a method of warfare.\" The U.K. is the second largest defense exporter in the world. Britain also makes 15 percent of the F-35 fighter jet that Israel is using to fight Hamas. But in the last decade, only a modest $620 million worth of arms export licenses were approved for Israel. The U.K.'s biggest defense recipient, by far, is Saudi Arabia. In 2020, the Campaign Against Arms Trade lost a court case challenging the government's approval of British arms exports to the kingdom with a long history of humans rights abuses.
