I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. From Bosnia to Syria to Ukraine, war crimes, the ugliest side of war are an all too common reality wherever conflict rises. The failed promise of never again after the holocaust bringing hollowed time and time again. And with fewer survivors living to tell the tale with every passing year, testimonies like my first guest become more vital than ever. Tova Friedman was just five years old when she was shipped to Auschwitz, where several members of her family were killed. Somehow, Tova survived. And at 84, she's one of the youngest survivors of the Nazi extermination camp. Now, she is sharing it all in a new memoir called \"The Daughter of Auschwitz\", which went straight to number two in the \"New York Times\" best- seller list. And Tova joined me this week, along with co-author, the veteran journalist, Malcolm Brabant, about what compelled them to tell her story now with all its painful details. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

As a journalist, as a historian, Malcolm, what's brought you into this project?MALCOLM BRABANT, CO- AUTHOR, \"THE DAUGHTER OF AUSCHWITZ\":  Well, Tova said that she wanted to write a book for her grandchildren. And I said, actually we can do better than. We can write a book for the world's children. Because I -- when I talked to the first publisher that we dealt with, she said, you know, what you're talking about here is somebody who's -- we know about Anne Frank, for example. But Tova is taking on that story. And I think that Tova is a very historical figure. And when I met her two years ago at the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, I realized that I was in the presence of a historical figure. And I hoped that we have managed to show people why she is that figure. And what we try to do in the book is to make it almost like a sensory experience. So that you're walking in Tova's shoes all the way through the holocaust, not just an Auschwitz.

Because some of the most painful stuff to read, and some of the stuff that I've never really read before, in all the examination of the holocaust and what I have seen of genocide since, is the child's eye view.

So, the voice you hear, in a way, throughout this book, is the voice of a child but also Tova with her adult experience, but also it is the eye of a war reporter.And so, it's the sounds and the smells that I, you know, I recognize in Bosnia, for example. Seeing the 6,000 -- the army, the survivors, coming out of Srebrenica in 1995. If I dig into my memory bank, I can still smell the sweat and the fear as they came out, you know, in the hot summer. And see those, sort of, terrified faces after what they've been through. I remember seeing people being bussed from the Serb occupied territories into Srebrenica (ph). It's those faces in all of those things. But the war that we went through was nothing like the, sort of, the war that Tova went through. We had armored cars. We had the United Nations as a form of protection in a way. We had food. But Tova as a child had absolutely nothing. And that's something that I find almost impossible to believe.

In most of these cities, it's quite a bit less than some of the big superstar cities like San Francisco or New York. So, the answer is raising money. Often that money goes two or three times further in terms of their ability to hire people and investing growing the company. So, there are some aspects like that.There are also some considerations people have around lifestyle issue, there's family issues. There are reasons people want to be in another city. But perhaps the most important -- and this is what is starting to really develop and why I profile so many companies in the book. There are cities that really advantage those companies in terms of their location. I will just give you a couple of examples. There's a company in Chattanooga, Tennessee called FreightWaves that developed a platform. Kind of like a Bloomberg data platform for the trucking and logistics industry. I didn't know they still were there with our \"Rise of the Rest\" bus but most of the big trucking companies in America are headquartered in Chattanooga. So, if you're building a platform for the trucking industry, that's the best place in the country to be. Not Silicon Valley, Chattanooga. Another example is there's an entrepreneur, Carter Malloy, who was actually in San Francisco working for a hedge fund when he came up with the idea for a company called AcreTrader which is kind of a platform to invest in farmland. And he said, were -- if I'm going to get farmers to put their farms on our platform, I need to build up trust. And a better way to do that is to not be in San Francisco. So, he moved to Fayetteville, Arkansas -- Northwest Arkansas. Launched that company and it is scaling quite significantly. It was better for him to be an Arkansas, not California for that company. There are more and more examples of that that I profile in the book which I think bodes well for this next 10 or 20 years. As capital starts flowing, as talents starts dispersing, and you're building on the industry expertise. So, the domain expertise, it's so important in some of these industries of the future, that's going to advantage the \"Rise of the Rest\" cities. More companies will start and scale. More jobs will be created. More economic growth will be move -- driven forward. And that will help those communities. And as I said before, it really helped the country.",

The things that we celebrate in Silicon Valley, they feel disconnected from it. They don't see any benefits to their family, to their community of those companies scaling. And part of that is because of this notion that entrepreneurs are just on the coast of this -- that investors are only backing entrepreneurs on the coast. And if we can launch and scale more new companies that are creating more new jobs in more communities all across the country, I think it does create more of a sense of hope and possibility. A great example, last week I was in Detroit. It was actually the first stop of our first bus tour eight years ago. At the time, Detroit was struggling, the year before we were there, actually the city of Detroit went bankrupt. But now, it's happening in downtown Detroit. It is vibrant. There's -- dozens of start-ups that are scaling there. The buildings that are empty are now, you know, full. And there's a sense of hope and possibility in a city that has struggled for half a century. It is because of the start-ups, because of the entrepreneurs, and it's because of the investors backing those entrepreneurs in places like Detroit. So, we just need to get more of those investors who are sitting in New York City and sitting in San Francisco to be looking at opportunities all across the country. I think they will find the investment returns are comparable to what they could get on backing entrepreneurs in places like Silicon Valley.

And even some of the legislation that's passed Congress has been helpful in terms of driving innovation, including the Inflation Reduction Act, which has a significant investment in climate technologies which will help boost that whole sector. And also, what was in the CHIPS and Science Act, they authorized about $10 billion to fund regional hubs. You know, that would be helpful to this rise of the rest effort. If people don't fully appreciate it, but as you know, places like Silicon Valley didn't happen by accident. Some of that was government funding of semiconductor research half a century ago. Similarly, in Austin, that was driven in part by government funding. So, having the government boost the innovation that's happening in different cities build on the great research universities in so many cities and invest in establishing these regional hubs is helpful. So, I think the recent evidence in terms of the administration, there is more focus on business, and particularly focused on innovation, entrepreneurship, start-ups. The -- President Biden was just in Columbus, Ohio a few weeks ago to talk about what's happening there with the intel which helped launch Silicon Valley, if not trying to launch what they call the Silicon Heartland in the -- in Ohio. So, I think we're making progress.",

It's these iron entrepreneurs who are dreaming big dreams about better ways to, you know, help us live our lives.Better ways to, you know, reimagine some of the most important aspects of our lives. How we stay healthy, how we learn, what we eat, how we move around, how we invest. These are all, you know, playing out now. And it's not just happening on the coast, it's happening all across the, you know, the country. And I've had the privilege of the -- over the last decade traveling to dozens and dozens of cities, backing entrepreneurs in over 100 cities. And I'm really struck by what's happening there. Every city I go to, I'm amazed by what's going on. And that story is not being told. People in the communities I visit often don't know what is happening. Certainly, people around the country don't know what's happening. And that's why I wrote the book. This is a story that needed to be told. I felt -- it felt to me, like, this is a book that needed to be written, so people understood what's happening. And if we continue to back these entrepreneurs, we invest more of that venture capital in these entrepreneurs, in these different cities. I think it really will unleash wave of innovation, a wave of job creation that really will strengthen these communities and also strengthen our nation. So, I feel great about the progress we've made over the last decade. I think the next decade is when the rest really will rise and innovation really will disperse. And that's the best way, I think, to make sure America remains the most innovative entrepreneurial nation in the world. We need more shots on goal which is backing more people in more places, not just some people in some places.",
