He's always outperformed Donald Trump in his home state of New Hampshire. He's also Nikki Haley's most vocal and visible surrogate. I have to imagine that they're testing this to say, like, for his voice to resonate with Republicans -- they need to turn out in New Hampshire -- he has to at least say he's going to be with the nominee, whoever it is. I disagree with the strategy but I know Chris Sununu well enough to know I'd be stunned if he actually checks a box for a convicted felon, Donald Trump, on Election Day. HILL:  Right. But if he says he's going to do it, right, that message is still out there. Yes, you want all of these people, right? And to your point, there are a lot of people in this country who look at him and say you know, Chris Sununu -- that's a guy who I think I could trust. He seems a little bit more moderate. He is now saying I will vote for a convicted felon. FARAH-GRIFFIN:  Well, also in the point in the primary where you've also got to reach the voters like me -- the voters like the Chris Christie followers who want somebody who is actually going to take on Trump and actually take about his unfitness and his character. I understand the strategy perhaps of not doing that six months ago, while I disagree with it. Now there's no excuse for not saying this is why you need Nikki Haley.

And so, over 50 countries have been affected by this. So this is an international problem that required an international response. And so, there had been multiple warnings to include, early in January, 14 countries plus the United States issuing a warning to the Houthis that this action -- this illegal, reckless, dangerous action must stop or there would be consequences.

Boeing now has 10 days to submit a response to the FAA. This kind of investigation is pretty rare. And in the meantime, the Max 9 remains grounded in the U.S. Here is what the FAA said in its announcement of this investigation. \"This incident should have never happened and it cannot happen again. Boeing's manufacturing practices need to comply with the high safety standards they're legally accountable to meet.\" Remember, this investigation is focusing on the Boeing 737 Max 9 door plug. That is the part of Alaska 1282 that blew out a week ago. And since then, Alaska Airlines and United Airlines both found issues with their door plugs. United said it found loose bolts related to possible installation issues. Now, the bolts are really key. Four bolts keep the door plug snug against 12 fittings. And without those, the door can essentially shoot off like a rocket -- exactly what happened last week. Still, a very controlled message from Boeing. CEO Dave Calhoun has done one interview since this incident. He told CNBC the cause of that incident was a horrible escape when it came to Boeing's quality control. He insists that Boeing is taking a hard look at its own processes and the processes of its contractors. By the way, this lawsuit -- this class action suit filed in Washington State, home of Boeing -- the lawsuit alleges physical injuries, emotional trauma, passengers bruised, and they were thrust into a walking nightmare -- something the woman leading this investigation, NTSB chair Jennifer Homendy, says that passengers and flight crew were extremely traumatized by this.
