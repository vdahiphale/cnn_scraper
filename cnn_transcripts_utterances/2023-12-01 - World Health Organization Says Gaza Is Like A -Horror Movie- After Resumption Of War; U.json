Tonight, the World Health Organization says the situation in Gazais like a horror movie today, except a deadly consequences are all too real. Israel is unleashing airstrikes on densely-populated areas after efforts to extend a week-old truce with Hamas collapsed. The Hamas-run Health Ministry says more than 400 people -- than a 100 people, pardon me, have been killed in the new attacks. Many Palestinians heeded earlier warnings to flee south, but now parts of southern Gaza are coming under fierce bombardment including Khan Yunis. Israel calls the major city a fighting zone, telling residents to evacuate immediately. It is dropping leaflets, but people must have internet access and a charged phone to actually scan that QR code you're seeing on your screen, and then retrieve a map of so-called evacuation zones. The leaflets urging people to head further south to Rafah, that's near Egypt. Yet, Rafah, worth bearing in mind is also coming under fierce attack. Each side blames the other for the resumption of war. Listen to one IDF spokesman, told CNN. Have a listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But Isa, as you pointed out, southern Gaza is where Israel told Palestinians in northern Gaza to evacuate to. Secretary of State Antony Blinken who was just here yesterday said before Israel begins the next phase of its war, it has to have a concrete plan in place to protect civilians and avoid the number of civilian casualties we saw before the truce. Now, Israel as you pointed out had dropped some leaflets, warning it's an active war zone, and trying to put out this QR code that then leads to a map with very specific detailed parcels. The problem is to access that, you need electricity and you need internet connectivity, and neither of those have been guarantees. Israel promised in advance its campaign, if the fighting resumes, it will be even stronger and we're seeing that play out. Israel says it's carrying out those strikes from the sea, the land and the air. Meanwhile, Hamas also said it was ready for the continuation of the war and we have seen that firsthand in Tel Aviv. It was in fact one hour ago as we were standing right here that we saw a number of Iron Dome interceptors launched at a barrage here. It was the second barrage launched in the last several hours. And that's the first time we've seen rockets on Tel Aviv since probably about two weeks ago. So both sides here amping up their war efforts.",

Well, even though, fighting is raging, Hamas and Israel arestill indirectly negotiating about hostages. That is according to U.S. officials traveling with Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who left Israel just as the war resumed. The official says the U.S. believes another pause could happen as soon as today. CNN's M.J. Lee is following this part of the story for us from the White House. And M.J., as you heard Oren say there, it's been a day it seems of heavy fighting in Gaza, and each side clearly blaming the other for the end of the truce. So realistically, what are the prospects here MJ, or the likelihood of the truce being revised? M.J. LEE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, obviously, the seven-day truce has now come to an end with the fighting resuming overnight. But what sources are telling CNN is that, the negotiations between Israel and Hamas, of course, mediated by other parties like the Qataris. The U.S., of course, has been involved as well, that those talks over the release of potentially more hostages are continuing. The focus -- our understanding is still on women hostages, and that if and when Hamas is able to produce a list of hostages to be released that is acceptable to Israel, then the pause would potentially come back. And then at that point, we are told the negotiations would then move on to other categories of people among the hostages that are believed to be held by Hamas right now, including civilian men and then soldiers, though of course, as our previous reporting has shown, that category of people, the soldiers that are being held hostage, are believed to be the most difficult people to be negotiated out of Gaza. Now, yesterday's negotiations, we are told were particularly fraught over the issue of whether some of the women being held by Hamas were considered soldiers. This is something that Israel is rejecting. But again, we have seen over and over again, over the last seven days just how challenging, and fraught and difficult these negotiations have been between Israel and Hamas, as each day, Hamas has had to produce an acceptable list of hostages. So, we are seeing that at play, once again, except the big difference this time, of course, is that they weren't able to meet the deadline of the truce expiring. So the fighting has resumed, but again, our sources are telling us that those talks, those negotiations are still ongoing.",

I've been hoping this would -- they were slowly getting a little bit of their challenge, their challenge, back on fear and fear has returned in abundance. And very quickly, there was a strike near the hospital, we had to move quickly. Often, there's a second strike, and then at the hospital again to see, you know, twice as many people as there are beds, to people seeking refuge, few taking place, ambulances racing in with wounded and bloody people.

Thanks very much, Ben.Well, about 200 Palestinian prisoners were released in exchange for Israeli hostages over the past week. A majority of them were held in Israel without ever being charged. Diana Buttu is a human rights attorney and a former legal advisor for the PLO, and she joins us down. Diana, great to see you. Thank you very much for coming on. Let me first get your reaction, Diana, to the collapse of this truce and the bombardment that we've already seen, resuming today. I'm sure you heard Secretary Blinken say that the pause came to an end because of Hamas. The PA is blaming the U.S. for Israel's resumption of attacks on Gaza. Your thoughts.",

And I think it's very important for people to keep in mind that what Israel is bombing is effectively a very large refugee camp. Eighty percent of the population of the Gaza Strip are refugees were made refugees because of Israel back in 1948 and 50% of them are children. And so the idea that we couldn't even get the world community to exert pressure on Israel to stop the bombing of a refugee camp shows you the state of disarray of the world and of this notion of international law. It's really a pity. And I would have expected that the United States step forward and demand that Israel stop rather than given the green light to resume.",

And this has played itselfout in the way that Israel has carried out his bombing campaign. We've seen that close to 20,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's eight-week bombing campaign. And the infrastructure of the Gaza Strip has been devastated, untold trauma to children generation after generation. In terms of the truce, a truce can be put into place, but it actually requires that Israel accept that Palestinians have a right to live and that they have a right to live in their homeland. But instead, what Israel said that it wants to do is make the Gaza Strip smaller in size and thin out the population. In other words, what they're talking about is ethnic cleansing and nobody's going to accept that program.",

I'm going to read you a chunk of what New York Times said. Have a listen to this. \"For some Palestinians living under military occupation in the West Bank, the freed prisoners have become a potent symbol of Hamas's ability to achieve tangible results and its willingness to fight for the Palestinian cause. Each night in Ramallah, as new batches of prisoners were released, one refrain echoed across the crowds, 'the people want Hamas, the people want Hamas.'\" So then do the people want Hamas?",

Israel has -- since 1967, Israel set up a system of military courts that can convict Palestinians for violating anyof the more than 1,700 military orders. These military orders include things like membership in a political movement. They include anything from the vague idea of somehow threatening security without any real -- without any real definition of what that means. And so because nobody has ever put pressure on Israel to end this system, and remember there is a system in which Palestinians have picked up, thrown into prison without charge, without trial for six months and then have that renewed indefinitely, because they can do that and nobody has stopped them, Israel has used this period to pick up more and more and more Palestinians in the hopes that somehow they will use as bargaining chips. And that's the problem, is that if we go down the path of simply allowing Israel to be above international law and somehow view the Palestinians are not -- they're not even worthy of being (INAUDIBLE) to them, then it's the wrong system and this is what needs to be changed.",
