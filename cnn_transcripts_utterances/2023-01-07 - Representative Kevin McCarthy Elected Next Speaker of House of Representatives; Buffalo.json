So you have this red area, the moderate risk, and the yellow, the slight risk for excessive rainfall in the coming days. This is going to be the focus area today. But still a very similar area Sunday and Monday. It just shifts a little bit farther to the south. Here's a look at that first wave that's going to come in today and through the evening hours tonight, mainly focused across Oregon and then northern and central portions of California. That wave continues to slide in, and then by Sunday night we start to have our next wave begin to push in, and that's going to continue through Monday as well as Tuesday. Now, one of the longer-term concerns isn't just the flooding on the roads but a lot of the rivers.

So in that sense, this is a similar setup.And we have seen some places in this storm sequence, San Francisco, for example, that has seen their wettest 24-hour periods in well over century going back to the 1800s. So we are seeing hints in recent years of some increasing precipitation extremes in California, even though this particular event won't be as extreme as the kinds of scenarios we've outlined in our research.

The question is just how and to what degree, really.[10:25:00] And when it comes to extreme precipitation, we know that warming temperatures bring about an exponential increase in the water vapor holding capacity of the atmosphere. So that rises very quickly even for small amounts of warming. That raises the ceiling on how intense precipitation can become in a warming world. And so we probably have already seen about a 10 to 15 percent increase in that ceiling on how intense precipitation can become. So while we certainly have seen major storm sequences before we had a lot of climate change, we do believe that the likelihood of these sorts of extreme events is increasing, and that the climate change we have seen so far has probably doubled the likelihood of an extreme flood and storm sequence in California. So this really is an important consideration moving forward in a place that has seen, at least recently, more drought and water scarcity than flood to be circumspect in thinking about the other side of that hydrologic coin as well.",

I can tell you that much. In the long term, it's really thinking about how to co-manage the risks of both drought and flood. In a place like California, we are likely to see more of both in a warming world.So it's not just getting drier or it's not just getting wetter, but we're really going to see more of both kinds of extremes. And that sort of requires different approaches than if it were just getting wetter or just getting drier all of the time. And so thinking about how we can strategically leverage the occasional floods when they do occur to recharge groundwater, for example, or operate our existing large dams in ways that maintain safety margins during flood events but also give us more flexibility during droughts, these are the kinds of interventions along with things like restoring natural flood plains and giving rivers some room to roam that are likely to be promising and are consistent with what the research suggests California's future climate is going to look like.",

There is a lot to cover. And I want to start with this new drug. Can you tell us what it does and what some of those concerns are that people have?DR. LEANA WEN, CNN MEDICAL ANALYST: Most therapies for Alzheimer's disease are targeting the symptoms. And so if somebody has a specific symptom, that's what it helps. But this one is different because it's given to individuals early on in the course of their diagnosis. And the intention is to try to prevent progression of the disease and try to reduce the amount of cognitive decline. And so it offers this novel therapy. There is a lot of potential for it. But I think there are still a number of unanswered questions, as you mentioned, including about side effects, and specifically, there are some side effects that seem to be associated with this drug, including brain swelling, brain bleeding, which are severe consequences. And the question is, are we able to identify which patients will be eligible for it and which patients for whom the benefits will outweigh the risk. I think another unanswered question thus far is how this drug is going to be priced and specifically whether Medicare is going to cover it. And that's something that the federal agency has yet to make a determination about.",

And with every new variant, you want to ask three questions. Is it more contagious? Is it causing more severe disease? And is it evading the protection of our vaccines and prior infection? In this case, XBB.1.5 does appear to be extremely contagious, which is a concern and is the reason why it's displacing the other variants.However, it does not appear to cause more severe disease, and there is no indication that our vaccines are going to stop protecting us from severe illness. And so my takeaway here, again, is that people who have yet to receive the updated booster, especially if they are older individuals, people with chronic medical conditions, really should get that updated booster. It's very worrisome that only about a third of people 65 and older have gotten the updated booster. These are the people most vulnerable. They should get that booster.

So I think the problem there is bad.But I don't think that these travel restrictions really make sense, because we have so much COVID all around the world, and that doesn't make sense. It's really a drop in the bucket to try to restrict what's happening in China from coming here. Really, the issue should be to try to prevent new variants from developing, and also to identify these new variants as they are happening. So I hope that we will do more things like wastewater testing, including on flights that are coming from China, to see what new variants might be identified there.
