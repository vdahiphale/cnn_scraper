Now millions of people are in danger from flooding. Russia calls Denmark's plays just an F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine an escalation in the conflict. But how much of this will be a game changer? We'll explore. And India has some of the world's worst air pollution but the electric vehicle industry could soon transform the country's environment and its economy. And finally, a damning report from Human Rights Watch alleges that the Saudi border guards have killed hundreds of Ethiopian migrants crossing the Yemeni Saudi border. We'll speak to the author of that report about its findings. We start with the second hour of \"Connect the World\" with words of gratitude and a warning. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked Denmark for its pledge to send his country F-16 fighter jets in his speech to the Danish Parliament in Copenhagen. He also said Denmark and other allies near Russia will be under threat if Ukraine doesn't win the war both Denmark and the Netherlands so they will provide American F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine once pilot training is complete. Russia's Ambassador to Denmark called the Danish pledge an escalation. So I want to bring in our Nick Paton Walsh, who joins us this hour from Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine. Good to have you with us, Nick. So it seems like dozens of fighter jets have now been promised to Ukraine. The question is just how soon could they be on the battlefield?",

This U.S. decision is important as it clears one of the obstacles to delivery from European operators. U.S. authorization as the original manufacturer. Several issues remain, however. And Justin Bronk joins me now from London. Professor Bronk, good to have you on the program. I want to get to your concerns in just a moment.

But it will have superior radar, notably better radar warning receiver and general self-defense and situational awareness capabilities, which are key particularly in the high threat airspace of Ukraine. And compatibility with a massively wider range of Western made weaponry and equipment.

He of course is known as an empathizer in chief given the tragedy in his personal life. But he uncharacteristically gave a no comment when asked about Hawaiians a few days ago. The White House insists he's been on the phone hourly, almost making sure that everybody gets the resources they need.

That report claims hundreds of migrants seeking asylum including women and children have been shot at close range while trying to cross the Yemeni Saudi border and attacked with explosives. Take a look at this video uploaded to TikTok last year. It shows some of those trying to cross the border into Saudi Arabia and its deal located by Human Rights Watch. The report says the killings targeted they started in March of 2022. And they appear to have continue. And if committed as part of a Saudi government policy, they will constitute crimes against humanity. Well, Saudi government source told CNN the allegations are unfounded. This map is key to understanding the dangerous route these migrants and asylum seekers take. The video you saw is just the final leg. The journey begins with travel to Djibouti before crossing into the Gulf of Aden in unseaworthy vessels. Smugglers then transport them to Saada in an area under the control of Yemen's Houthi rebels.

He's pulling in new eyeballs, you see the social media numbers, you see how often the videos are being shared of his goals. RIDDELL (voice-over): And he is just reveling in all of it.

I mean, it was a star studded event, it became like the hottest ticket in town, so many A-list celebrities and other entertainers who wanted to take part, who wanted to be able to say in years to come, I was there. RIDDELL (voice-over): Messi's time in Miami is already historic. The first trophy in club history is the 44th of his career. That's a new record for any player. And he has the chance to win two more this season, but it will be tough in MLS by Miami, a bottom of the table with only 12 games left in the regular season.
