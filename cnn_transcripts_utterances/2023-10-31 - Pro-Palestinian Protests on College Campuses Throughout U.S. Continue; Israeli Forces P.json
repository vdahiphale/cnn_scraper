There's a problem on too many college campuses of trying to figure out if there's some way to thread a needle here that somehow maybe we don't have to talk about this horrific terror attack, that maybe we can help Jewish students without coming full square behind them in saying that we will not tolerate antisemitism on our campus, period, end of story. You cannot thread a needle. You have to be as full-throated in defense of Jewish students as you are in defense of every other student on campus.But if I can just explain why this makes so much sense, why when campuses have people protesting, chanting \"from the river to the sea,\" which is a chant that envisions Israel without Jews in it, which is Hamas's goal, or intifada, intifada. This century the second intifada in Israel killed 1,000 civilians with bombings at bus stops, on buses, at cafes, at pizza places. The language, the rhetoric being used in support of Hamas is dangerous and must be called out everywhere by university presidents, by elected officials, by everyone who understands that we have an obligation not just to protect the Jewish community but to stand squarely against terrorism, the kind that we experienced in our own country not that long ago, and that we need to stand against wherever it occurs, especially when there are Americans who were killed and Americans who are still being held hostage. We have got to come together on this issue.",

They have arrested over 1,500 Palestinians in recent weeks. And now we're learning that the IDF has also demolished the house of Saleh al-Aruri, who is effectively the de facto commander of Hamas in the West Bank, although he is believed to be living in Lebanon.But in new video that you can see here, the Israeli military demolishing that home, that is a tactic that the Israeli military has used in the past, typically with terrorists who carry out attacks. They then go ahead and demolish their homes. That's something that's been done in the West Bank over recent years. So you can see them doing that as they try and avoid a broader conflagration happening in the West Bank. And we know that as the Israeli military has focused its efforts here in the Gaza Strip, they're also very weary of this turning into a broader conflict, whether that is in the West Bank, in east Jerusalem, in northern Israel with Hezbollah in the north, and also, of course, carrying out airstrikes on weapons depots and supply lines in Syria which Iran has used to supply its proxies in the region. So we are actively monitoring all these different fronts. As of now, the hottest front is right here in Gaza. But of course, there is a risk of it turning into a broader conflict.",
