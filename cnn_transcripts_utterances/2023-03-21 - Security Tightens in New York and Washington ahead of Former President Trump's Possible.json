Well, today is the day that Donald Trump has predicted he will be indicted and arrested by New York prosecutors.But it is still unclear when or if that will actually happen, and a source close to the former president's legal team tells CNN not to expect any arrest or court appearance before next week. Still, police in New York are getting ready for any potential protest. Mayor Eric Adams says that there are no credible threats to the city, but they are putting up barricades and surveillance cameras just to be safe. And a police memo tells all officers to be in uniform and ready to deploy today. And in Washington, police have put up fencing around the U.S. Capital to keep potential protesters away. The grand jury in New York is investigating a $130,000 payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels. Former Trump attorney Michael Cohen says that he made the payment at Trump's direction to keep Daniels quiet about an alleged affair.

So, it is important by way of context to understand that this is a grand jury and a grand jury consists of 23 members, a simple majority of which, that is 12, are needed to vote out an indictment. Now, in that process it's not about proving a case beyond a reasonable doubt, as if you were at trial, it's about whether there is reasonable cause to believe that a crime was committed and the subject of that investigation, that is Mr. Trump, would have been the commissioner of those crimes, the one who committed the crimes.And so, I say that because you are going to have evidence oftentimes, and I've never really tried a case in over 20 years, where there haven't been conflicts and one person says A and another says B. So there's got to be credibility assessments. But in the context of a grand jury investigation, the issue simply is not whether Trump did this, but is there a reasonable cause to believe that he did and that's the essence of it. And so, while it could be damning, that is the contrary evidence that was given in terms of Michael Cohen, it does not mean that the grand jury would not indict just by virtue of that conflict, so potentially a trial jury forgets that part, could sort that out.",

It means that a grand jury, having indicted you, and again, it's not convicting you, it's just an accusation that you get it, which makes the case available to that and be sent to a trial jury for an assessment as to your guilt. And so, when that generally happens, there is arrest, but generallyalso,  the currency is extended, particularly to be extended here to a former president to surrender yourself. And so, the issue is, how is that done, whether it is done safely, of course, securely, of course. People have a first amendment right to protest. They'll be people who find that this is purely political, should not have happened, and is nonsense and they will be protesting. There are others who will say that it is about time that the president was found accountable for something and therefore there will be counter protests. And so, I think that's important, my hope is that they're peaceful, but people express their views as they should in any democracy.

We know District Attorney's office there is looking at and investigating and has convened a special grand jury to look into that. And there are other investigations of Mr. Trump.

Although neither First Republic nor JPMorgan would confirm that to us. I think like the regional banks are one thing. They are clearly under intense scrutiny because of some of the risky elements on their balance sheets, because of the number of uninsured deposits that some of them, including First Republic have and their exposure, of course, it's a rising interest rates and that kind of risk. Overall, though, the U.S. banking system is significantly more secure than it was in 2008. The regulations, the stress tests, the capital (inaudible) requirements, all of those things have made it. So, the question of course when it comes to this current crisis is whether or not people believe that. Whether depositors believe, that whether shareholders believe that. That is why you've seen the global regulators come out in full force and say, look, our respective banking systems are safe. And, look, this is something that has infected even the strongest banks in the U.S. system. Take a look at the losses of over March for those biggest banks. You can see that pretty much all of them losing double digits. JPMorgan down 11 percent, Wells Fargo, Bank of America having lost about a fifth of their value over the course of March. This is about confidence as I said. This is also about a realization of what happens when interest rates were low for the best part of a decade, and then jacked up so quickly. It means that banks are now having to offer bigger returns to savers and depositors. That eats into profitability. And the current crisis and confidence could lead to higher borrowing costs. Now, of course, for the markets, the focus shifts to the Federal Reserve. Will the current turmoil in the banking sector sort of weaken the argument for them to keep raising rates.

He broke his silence in a statement provided to CNN this morning, saying in part, \"I've tried my best to ignore the vicious rumors about my involvement in Stephen Smith's tragic death that continue to be published in the media as I grief over the brutal murders of my mother and brother. These baseless rumors of my involvement with Stephen and his death are false. I unequivocally deny any involvement in his death.
