Documents state before each victim went missing, triangulation of cell phone tower data showed the burner phones and the victims' phones traveled to Massapequa, Long Island, at about the same time as Heuermann, where his family home was located. They were never seen again.Heuermann was charged in the murder of the three women. He has pleaded not guilty.

They compartmentalize the part of them that is the sex addict, the sexual sadist, the power control person who will not take an argument from somebody they're paying for sex. That is a part of them that their wives and children, their coworkers never see.We've seen this before. Robert Hansen, the called \"Butcher Baker\" from Anchorage, Alaska, Kendall Francois, who killed eight women in his own home where he lived with his parents and his sister. And it's usually these families are marked by a level of dysfunction where there's just not a lot of communication going on, the marriage isn't really good, and the wife and the kids are out of the house a lot. In fact, that's why they're looking in South Carolina, New Jersey, Nevada, because we know he travelled there. And if he was in the habit of hiring sex workers and an argument would arise, and he would say, wait, I paid you, you must do what I like, and perhaps strangled them to death, which is what we believe most likely happened to these victims, then he might dispose them in that local area and then go back to his family, who are none the wiser. So I have to say from a variety of vantage points, Mr. Heuermann does look good for it, but most of all because the three women for whom he's charged, and I'm sure we'll see a fourth soon, were buried on the beach 20 minutes from where he lived. And usually these killers do kill where they are comfortable, where they know their surroundings, because, again, that's part of the grift.",

They will get in the car with him or go to his hotel room or go to his rental house where he's visiting and fixing things.The big key is, does he know these areas well enough that if he slips up and kills somebody -- because I don't think he really goes out planning to kill anybody. I think that in the process of a sexual encounter, an argument will arise and he will want to prove to them who is boss, and then a strangulation or perhaps beating will happen.

But now the Ukrainians are saying along pretty much all sectors the northeastern front that the Russians are trying to push forward there and are trying to gain territory.There's two sort of areas that the Russians are especially focusing on in that northeastern part of Ukraine. One of them is a town called Kupiansk, which is very far in the northeast. And the Ukrainians say the Russians have concentrated about 100,000 troops, as well as hundreds of tanks and multiple rocket launching systems. The other is a place a little further south called Lyman. I was there a couple of months ago. That is an extremely brutal, dangerous battlefield. It's in a forested area. The Ukrainians describe that as a very dynamic front, but also one where it's very difficult to make territorial gains. The Ukrainians do acknowledge that they are on the back foot, but they also say that by and large they are able to hold the line. A picture, of course, very different in the south of the country where the Ukrainians are saying that they are making advances, and that is where those comments from Volodymyr Zelenskyy that you just managed -- that you just said, they become so important. The Ukrainians acknowledging that so far the counteroffensive is going fairly slow. He says the reason for that is that the counteroffensive was delayed. It was delayed, he says, because they lacked munitions in the spring and also because they were still training on some of those western supplied weapons to be able to use them. And Zelenskyy says that that gave the Russians time to fortify their defenses down there in the south, but also to lay those massive minefields. And the Ukrainians are now saying they're starting to clear those minefields. It's a difficult process, and they hope that will help them speed things up, Fredricka.",

You had the opportunity to interview him about his career for \"The Wall Street Journal\" and you even produced a mini concert with him? [14:40:10] CHRISTOPHER JOHN FARLEY, SENIOR DIRECTOR, ARTS PROGRAMMING AND DEVELOPMENT, PBS:  Yes, it was great to spend time with Tony Bennett. Terrific guy. I'll never forget that I used to run a showcase for \"The Wall Street Journal\" where we would bring in artists and they would to an interview with me and sing a few songs. And he came in and he was terrific, he was great, he was warm to everybody. When he did his warm-up, he had a scarf wrapped around his neck. He only croaked out the words. I'm going, what's going on? Did Tony lose it? This was back in 2011. But then when it came to actually performing, man, he belted it out, he hit all those notes, he was incredible. And I realized that's why he had survived for so long. That's why his career was so long, because he knew when to belt it out, he knew when to hit those notes, when the spotlight was on. And before that, in the warm-ups, he was going to preserve his voice. So it was a great lesson for me and for everyone there. This is why Tony Bennett is the great that he is.",

And one of the songs he wanted to sing was \"On the Sunny Side of the Street.\" And I was having a devil of a time trying to get the people, the rights holders, to come down and give us a price for the rights that \"The Wall Street Journal\" could afford, because we're a newspaper. They weren't like a radio station or a performance space, really.And so in the end we couldn't get the rights, and I had to tell him we couldn't get the rights for \"On the Sunny Side of the Street,\" so I'm afraid that Mr. Bennett can't sing it. And I remember he passed word through his manager, like, you don't really tell Tony Bennett what to song. And he sang it anyway. He didn't care that we weren't going to broadcast it. He didn't care who was going to hear. He wanted to sing that song on that stage at that time. That's exactly what he did. And he was fantastic.",

He put himself in physical danger supporting Martin Luther King in that march from Selma to Montgomery in 1965. And he told me it came from the Army, in part, because when he was in the Army he saw segregation up close. He was prevented from heading out with some of his friends who happened to be black because officials in the Army didn't want to have fraternization between whites in the army and blacks in the Army. And that always upset him. He really wanted to see social justice done.And so when he had the chance as a celebrity, as a singer, to give back to help stop some of the wrongs he saw happening, he was all too willing to go down, support Martin Luther King and put his career and his body at risk because that's what he knew was right. He didn't like the way he saw people like Duke Ellington treated, and he saw him getting forced out of venues because they were black. And so he was willing to put his career, his life on the line in support of civil rights. And that's another reason why he's so beloved.",

And the one thing that I think is the common denominator with players who have lots of success is they keep the primary thing, the primary thing. And that's the tennis. That's the process, that's what got them to that point. So that's always going to be first and foremost I think with me, something that I'm going to do my best, and I think my coach would also do a good job of emphasizing, we need to keep this stuff the priority.But it is pretty cool, like you say, to have people talking about you in terms of someone who can do a deep run in a tournament, maybe possibly win a tournament. So all that's cool, that's great. But as long as I continue my process and I stay giving 100 percent when I step foot on the court, whatever the result is, it is.
