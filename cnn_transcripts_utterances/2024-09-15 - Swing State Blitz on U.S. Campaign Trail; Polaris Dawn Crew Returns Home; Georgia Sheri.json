Meanwhile, Kamala Harris spoke at an event hosted by the Congressional Black Caucus in Washington Saturday alongside President Joe Biden. She warned that a second Donald Trump term would pose a profound threat to the future of the country, saying, quote, \"Trump and his extremist allies intend to take our nation backward.\" She also criticized Trump for his failure to outline his health care plans during Tuesday's presidential debate. Here she is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, (D) U.S. VICE PRESIDENT &amp; DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: We have a vision of our country where we understand that the access to health care should not be a privilege just of those who can afford it. It should be a right. And that is why, together, we cap the cost of prescription drugs for our seniors and will cap the cost of prescription drugs for all Americans. We actually have a plan for health care, not just concepts of a plan. Concepts. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, this is all kind of rhetoric that we know he has used in the lead-up to 2016, as well as in 2020, really trying to stoke fears about undocumented immigrants in this country.

Wittenberg University in Springfield is taking extreme precautions after receiving an e-mail that threatened an on-campus shooting. A statement from the school says the message targeted Haitians. The remnants of what was Hurricane Francine continues to affect parts of the Southeastern U.S., threatening to bring heavy rain and flooding to a number of major cities in the region. Widespread rainfall totals of more than six inches are possible. More than five million people across four states are under flood alerts, with Alabama, Georgia and Tennessee expected to get the bulk of the rainfall through the next few days. And there's a new disturbance just off the Southeast Coast that could bring high winds and heavy rain into the Carolinas starting late tonight. At least 74 people are dead, and scores are still missing in Myanmar after heavy flooding and landslides caused by Typhoon Yagi, state media reports. Central Myanmar is currently the hardest hit, with the rain mainly affecting the capital, according to the U.N. Myanmar is just one of several countries in the region impacted by Typhoon Yagi, Asia's strongest storm so far this year. It brought heavy winds and rain to the region last weekend. The devastation caused by Yagi even prompted Myanmar's military junta to make a rare request for foreign aid. Meanwhile, in parts of Central and Eastern Europe, Storm Boris continues to bring heavy rain in decades to the region. The storm has already dumped a month's worth of rain onto several cities, causing rivers in Poland and the Czech Republic to burst their banks. Red alerts, the highest level of warning, have been issued across several countries. Four people have died in Romania, where the rainfall left hundreds stranded. Authorities warn they've recorded the heaviest rainfall in a century over the past 24 hours. CNN Meteorologist Elisa Raffa has the latest. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

I've spoken to the IDF about how it is that such destruction could have been wrought. Was it an aerial bombardment, for instance, which we've seen so much of and heard so much about? But they say it's not. They say they've been destroying tunnels under the ground here in the southern Gaza Strip. And they've been demolishing buildings, they say, that were booby-trapped.

And she's trying to position herself as a candidate of change in a very subtle way because she can't distance herself that much from the Biden administration. The Trump campaign is very different. He is a challenger, but he also was president for four years. But what he's done instead of giving a rationale for his candidacy, he has told a story about why we should not elect Kamala Harris.

But the economy is still the number one issue, and you see how Kamala Harris is, again, trying to separate herself from President Biden, saying there's a lot -- understanding that people are hurting, and there is still much more that needs to be done to bring that economic security or that economic freedom, and she calls it her opportunity economy to the American people.",

You get the blue states for Kamala Harris, the red states for Donald Trump, and those yellow are the toss-up states, the states that are within three points in the polling.And what do we see right now? We see really a race in which no one's anywhere close to 270 electoral votes. We got Kamala Harris at 226, Donald Trump at 219, and you got those seven key battleground states, we've been talking about them over and over and over again, that are still not anywhere close to being decided. Of course, those key great lake battleground states right up here, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and of course down in the Sun Belt, down in the southeast, North Carolina and Georgia, Nevada and Arizona in the southwest, that's where this election's going to be decided. And even post-debate, there is no sign that those states are moving anywhere out of the toss-up range. The bottom line is this race has continued to be the closest one in a generation, certainly since I've been alive consistently, and there is no sign that's anywhere changing. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The U.S. State Department calls Venezuela's accusations, quote, \"categorically false\" and says, quote, \"the U.S. continues to support a democratic solution to the country's political crisis.\" The Biden administration has unveiled declassified evidence that a Russian intelligence unit embedded in the state media network RT has played a key role in gathering global intelligence for the Kremlin. Secretary of State Antony Blinken says RT had cyber capabilities and took part in covert information and influence operations. Now, the revelations come one week after prosecutors brought charges against two RT employees for secretly funneling nearly $10 million to a Tennessee company to promote Russia-friendly content. CNN Contributor Jill Dougherty, our former Moscow Bureau Chief, talked about how the Kremlin goes about sowing division with disinformation. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Last September, a melting glacier in Greenland collapsed and caused a massive tsunami which sent off vibrations that seismologists kept picking up for nine days. No one knew why they were happening, and scientists from 15 countries spent months trying to figure it out while they finally came up with an answer published in the journal \"Science.\"They say the tsunami wave ended up trapped in a narrow fjord where it sloshed back and forth for days on end. The incident is another warning about the dangers of climate change, which is blamed for the glacier's collapse. I want to bring in Kristian Svennevig, a senior researcher at the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland. He's one of the scientists who worked on that international project. He's speaking to us from Copenhagen. Thank you so much for being here with us. So, as I mentioned, this mystery dates back to September 2023. So take us through how scientists around the world experienced this and wondered what was going on?",

So it was in a way that was never observed before. Some of our colleagues thought their instruments were broken, while others, they actually noted it down as a USO, Unidentified Seismic Object, just stressing how puzzling this was.",

Now, whooping cough, highly contagious, affects the lungs so team doctors advised against playing on Saturday and the Vikings did note that none of their players are seriously ill at this time. Now, Florida State, meanwhile, probably wishes they did not play yesterday. They lost yet again, this time to Memphis. The Seminoles, three first-half turnovers. They did have a Hail Mary attempt to try to tie it but it was batted down. So Florida State loses to Memphis 20-12, dropping them to 0-3 on this season. This was after going undefeated last year.
