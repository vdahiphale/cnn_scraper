Ukraine's military says it shot down 76 of them. The country's Air Force says Russia also fired four ballistic missiles which damaged critical infrastructure in one region. 16 people are missing after a tourist yacht sank in the Red Sea along the Egyptian coast on Monday. Egyptian officials say 28 passengers were rescued. Authorities are still investigating what caused the boat to sink, but Egyptian meteorologists say there were warnings of high waves and rough waters in the area. And Formula One is likely to add a new racing team. The group says it's reached agreement in principle with General Motors to create a GM Cadillac racing team. It would join the sport in 2026. The agreement comes after months of speculation surrounding that deal. New developments in the Menendez brothers bid to leave prison. The California judge has delayed the resentencing hearing for Lyle and Erik Menendez to give the incoming district attorney time to review the case. The brothers are serving a life sentence for the 1989 murder of their parents. CNN's Nick Watts has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOAN VANDERMOLEN, MENENDEZ BROTHERS' AUNT: They should never have been in such situations as presented themselves. What can a kid do when it's fathers? I can't stand it.

She said no children should have to live in fear day by day that their dad could come and rape them. It breaks my heart that my sister Kitty knew but did nothing about it.

On the other hand, it was an extremely gruesome killing. They shopped for guns. They ambushed their parents while they were sitting and watching television and eating ice cream. They fired 16 rounds. They blew their father's brains out. They blew their mother's face off. They even paused to reload when Kitty was crawling away to fire the final shot. So when you think of all that, you have to weigh the allegations of molestation versus this horrific crime and that's up to now the DA to do. The big question is, is this a case of celebrity justice? What about the thousands of other people who are doing life without the possibility of parole who have their reasons for doing what they did? So all of this is coming to a head because the Menendez brothers have two hit shows on Netflix. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And number three -- and this is critical -- rehabilitation. Are they sufficiently rehabilitated? That's going to be critical.

And, you know, I'm immensely grateful for the British public for, you know, taking money out of their pocket to actually donate to help the crisis. So definitely was a fantastic initiative.My perspective is that, you know, 40 years later, we need to start looking at, you know, the results of what we've achieved over time and see how I guess we can improve the model. Because from my perspective, you know, it was great that we on surface level were able to help the people in need in Ethiopia. But over the period of time, if we still have to, you know, rely on aid in order to, you know, support countries in Africa for, you know, for our crisis, I think we need to start revising it because we need to start being self sustainable as a continent. And another kind of issue that I had with the original model was that they pick one crisis in one country and they paint the whole of Africa as one image. And I think that's very detrimental to the whole of the continent.",

Everybody that I know go to Ghana for Christmas in December. You have a great time for peace and joy to escape the cold, you know.So in 2014, when he asked me to be a part of it, I made it very clear to him that that's untrue because I've already booked my flight to go to Ghana and, you know, I tried to say to him that there's a way that we can raise money to help the Ebola crisis at the time and still maintain the dignity of the people. And he was so adamant about changing a model and I felt like if you're trying to help someone, the best thing that you could do is actually start a dialogue and not just keep it a monologue where you say this is the help that you need. Rather, just let's have a conversation because I'm an African, you're helping Africans. So the best person to listen to are the people who are going through it. So I made the suggestion that what if we change the lyrics to this because the caliber of artists that are on the song will be able to still gather the people and still raise the money that needs to be raised. But he refused and unfortunately I had to say no because it wasn't in alignment with my mission of wanting to reposition Africa as a place of investment, place of tourism, place of joy.

When Ebola outbreak broke out in Guinea, people start canceling their flights in Kenya, which is like 6,000 kilometers apart, which is even greater than the width of the whole of Europe. But people still were canceling their flights.
