Tonight on \"Laura Coates Live.\"All right, you've heard this before. Members of the House are set to mark up two new articles of impeachment tomorrow. But this time, it's not for Donald Trump. It's also not for Joe Biden. Instead, they are targeting President Biden's Homeland Security secretary, the man you see right there, Alejandro Mayorkas. And the House Republicans that are accusing him, it's because he's not enforcing, they say, the border laws and he's losing the trust of the American people. You're probably wondering which is the high crime or misdemeanor in like a law and order episode. You probably won't find it tonight. The misdemeanor, the high crime, and you're not odd for asking the question because, of course, those are the actual constitutional standards for impeachment, frankly, it has been more nebulous over the years. But I wonder if you feel that would meet the criteria. Well, the top Democrat on the Homeland Security Committee says the articles don't include a shred of evidence. The DHS says it's a farce, and legal experts say that this really just boils down to not a legal dispute but a policy dispute. So, now, what is really going on? Look, no one is arguing that what's happening at the border is somehow all roses. It is, in fact, a problem. Crisis comes to mind, and that's why Democrats and Republicans, as you know, have been working together on a bipartisan border deal, though that right now does not at all seem very likely to happen. Why? Not because of an incumbent, not because of the actual president or even a sitting senator or member of Congress. It's because a candidate, a presidential candidate, Donald Trump, has said, don't do it, has told Republicans to torpedo it, making senators happy in his party while they're not too pleased about it all. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. TODD YOUNG (R-IN): This would be a very significant achievement of this republican minority in the U.S. Senate of forcing the issue. So, I hope no one is trying to take this away for campaign purposes. SEN. KEVIN CRAMER (R-ND): I don't see how we have a better story to tell when we miss the one opportunity. We have to fix it and we go and say, you know, I would love to have fixed it, but it was election season, so I thought I'd wait. SEN. JOHN CORNYN (R-TX): The question is, do you want to get something that will help us stem the tide of humanity coming across the border and drugs, or do you want to get nothing? (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It is a humanitarian crisis, it is a national security crisis, it is something that is affecting people all across this country. So, people want to have that flow of illegal immigration staunch, and I think on some basic level, the issue is, if you're going to have this average of 5,000 number in there, we don't know that, but I mean that's what has been suggested, then you're talking about the equivalent of another Syracuse, New York crossing the border on a recurring basis, you're talking about another Rochester, New York crossing the border on a recurring basis.Places where people are already struggling with poverty. Places where we've seen people across the political spectrum saying we cannot have our needs neglected to make sure that the needs of people who've only been here for 24 hours at SIC end up being first in line. So, ultimately, it comes down to what is the objective. Is this going to be the broader immigration reform that people have been seeking for decades, comprehensive immigration reform, or is this a stopgap that is supposed to deal with the actual acute crisis that we have on the southern border, and Republicans will say you cannot actually have a solution to the problem that codifies the very thing that we're trying to end?",

And I'm not just talking about the lawyers in the E. Jean Carroll case. I'm talking about some of these lawyers in the criminal cases and the other charges that he's facing. Somebody is undoubtedly telling him to be quiet. That is the smartest strategy that he could have right now. Not just because, you know, he just faces this million-dollar lawsuit that he's going to have to, you know, ultimately pay out, but also because E. Jean Carroll has said, I will sue you again, your words can be used against you. He can be caught in a lie. There are innumerable things that could happen.But what we also have seen is that at the same time, either Donald Trump or whoever is monitoring who is working his social media channels, Truth Social, Twitter, that kind of X, that kind of thing, has also been, I think, tweeting out and sending out lots of disinformation around E. Jean Carroll. We've also seen some of these, I think, harder right-wing media sources do the dirty work of Donald Trump. So, while Trump is not out there kind of speaking from his platform, we see that there are various media vehicles that are asking these questions about who is E. Jean Carroll. Does he really know her? Is this part of a larger rig system in order, I think, to push back on this larger narrative and really undermine E. Jean Carroll's entire approach? I will say this, though. It's not working in the broader public. And E. Jean Carroll has been very clear about this, particularly in going on this campaign and saying, what is this about? This is about accountability and is about controlling a narrative. So, even as Trump is silent at the hands and the advice of his lawyers, E. Jean Carroll is not and she is using this as an opportunity, I think, to fight back.",

Now, he is serving now life in prison without parole, excuse me, for killing four students in a Michigan school shooting back in 2021. And now, his parents are the first in the nation to go on trial for what could be charges against them to hold him responsible for their son's school shooting. So, who is the best to talk about all this with? Joey Jackson, of course, is here, CNN legal analyst and defense attorney extraordinaire. Joey, first of all, this Murdaugh trial, because you and I talked a lot about that trial in South Carolina. The fact that a juror says that they were swayed by a court clerk who was influencing that person in a way that was not expected, let's say, that was not enough to get a new trial.

Eleven said, absolutely not. Had no influence, right? This clerk had no influence. The other said the clerk did have an influence. However, that the other jurors had more of an influence with respect to why she voted to guilt, right? So, at the end of the day, you have a six-week trial, three-hour jury deliberation. and overwhelming evidence, which suggests, as you and I both know, harmless error. At the end of the day, yes, there was a miscue by this clerk, but it did not and it was not outcome determinative to the issue of guilt. The judge saying it was so overwhelming, it would not have mattered. This is not the last of it. It'll be appealed to the Court of Appeals, then to the Supreme Court, and then maybe federal court.
