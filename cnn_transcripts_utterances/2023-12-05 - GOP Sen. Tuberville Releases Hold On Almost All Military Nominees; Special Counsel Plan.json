      "sentences": "Well, there's a lot of relief. Remember, there's been bipartisan opposition to Tommy Tuberville's stand. He had very little support within the Senate Republican Conference for trying to block all military promotions, something that really has never been done before, but something that any senator can do under the rules of the Senate.What he's done for 10-plus months is hold up every military promotion until the Pentagon scrapped its policy, providing reimbursements for military personnel who travel out of states to get abortions. Well, the Pentagon has said it would not do that. And then after some time, an increasing number of Republicans came out to say Tommy Tuberville needs to back down. And behind closed doors, Tuberville addressed his conference. He talked to Senate Republicans at lunch today and said that he would, in fact, back down and decided that instead of holding up all nominees, he would release most of those nominees. There are about 450 right now, but now will allow all of them except for 11 to be held up. Those 11 are four-star-ranked generals, and those are the people that he wants to have individual roll-call votes on. Instead, he'll allow the rest of them to be approved in one fell swoop, something Senate Majority Leader, Chuck Schumer said could happen as soon as this afternoon. Those are - those nominees typically are quickly confirmed by a voice vote in the United States Senate. But if one senator like Tuberville decides to hold up the process, either the majority leader could take time-consuming steps on the floor to overcome those objections or those blockade can last for months on end as what happened here with Tuberville. So the question is what did he accomplish out of all of this? It's unclear because the Pentagon still has this policy. He believes that he got some concessions that helped him out to achieve some of his ultimate objectives. It's unclear exactly what that is, but I can tell you, in talking to Republicans in particular, they're satisfied with this because they were considering changing Senate procedures to overcome Tuberville's blockade. But they don't have to do that anymore now that Tuberville has agreed to back down, guys.",

They run out of money. Unclear if he would actually be able to do that.

In fact, they've been trying to work behind closed doors and over the course of the last several weeks with their Democratic colleagues to try and find a middle ground on immigration policy.But given the fact that this is an issue that's vexed Congress for the last several decades, no middle ground has been found. In fact, things reached an impasse over the weekend. And negotiators are still trying to find a way back to the table, trying to find a way forward. But in the meantime, Chuck Schumer says he has to move forward with trying to advance this package and Republicans say they're not going to support it.
