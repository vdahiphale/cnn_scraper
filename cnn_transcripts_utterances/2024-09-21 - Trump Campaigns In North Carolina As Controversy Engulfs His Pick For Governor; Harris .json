The Trump campaign has yet to comment on this despite some Republicans in North Carolina calling on Robinson to drop out with just 45 days is to go until Election Day. Now, the Harris campaign is seizing on this scandal, releasing a new ad seeking to tie Trump to Robinson. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. GOV.

Take the Biden one out from the summer and the other six, the snap poll polls have always judged him. This goes back to 2016, not to have won the debate, even though it didn't keep him from beating Hillary Clinton, he did lose three to her. So I am just wondering, what are you going to get out of this? And is it worth your time when you're running a campaign? And he is right, that late, I am not sure it would make a huge difference. You know, when you're using your time, you're asking yourself, am I getting something positive? And I just don't know that there is anything to get.

We saw -- you know, he really had no discipline, no ability to stay on message and to stay. So I understand why they don't want to do a debate. I agree with Scott, of course, a CNN debate would be excellent and a great opportunity, but I understand why he doesn't want to do it and I do think it would be another great opportunity for the vice president.

Obviously, we have this controversy surrounding the Trump endorsed Republican candidate for governor, Mark Robinson. We've had extensive reporting on that, and Scott, polls already showed Robinson doing poorly against his Democratic challenger before our CNN report.Then you kind of go out a little bit and think about the presidential race in North Carolina, which as Ron Brownstein said, last hour has been heartbreak hill for Democrats since 2008. But it shows a very tight race there in North Carolina. How do you think this controversy might impact the presidential race there?",

Remember, this is not the first time that Trump has -- and I know that Robinson kind of ran with doing very well in the primary and Trump kind of jumped on the bandwagon. We've seen him do that, too. But it is not the first time we've seen Trump go all in for MAGA candidates for candidates who are really too extreme for the electorate. We saw it in Pennsylvania, we saw it in the Georgia Senate race in 2022 with Herschel Walker. And so I think it is a reminder to voters in North Carolina that this is Donald Trump's guy. This is the person that Donald Trump said was Martin Luther King, Jr. times two. And so I do think it is a reminder to voters that trump has terrible judgment when it comes to candidates. And basically will support whoever he thinks is going to be MAGA enough and is going to be popular with his base.

It was the Democrat on that board, both she and the Independent voted against this. It was a three-two vote, but she was saying that essentially if this was so important, they should have made this change months ago. It is too close to the election and that she is concerned that this implies that there could be issues where there aren't any. If people have worked a 14-hour day and human error, they miss count, it could inject somewhat of a chaos into this. It is something that the Republican Secretary of State has called a mess.

The possibility of injecting human error into it. So I actually think they are valid arguments on both sides of this. I've not gotten overly exorcised about it one way or the other because my impression is there is going to be litigation and then a judge is going to tell us whether this is going to come to pass or not. So, you know, I think there are valid reasons to be skeptical of it. But at the same time, I don't think you can ever just discount the idea that there are people who want to have as much confidence in counting ballots as possible. Georgia is an important state and I would understand why Republicans would want to know, hey, that every single ballot get counted fairly? I think that is an okay impulse to have.

I do think he makes a legitimate argument about the economic conditions in this country. I mean, there are a lot of women out there who have direct contact with the Biden-Harris economy every day when they are going about their normal day at their jobs, when they are going to the grocery store to pick up food for the family, when they are paying for things for their kids every day. I mean, they know how expensive it is to live in the United States under Biden and Vice President Harris because of the decisions they've made. So if I were in his shoes and I saw a gender gap like this, I also would remind women voters of the United States,. the economy was better under me, life was cheaper under me, and it can be that way again, if you'll reconsider whether you want to vote for my candidacy.",

And that means she has no freedom, no right to make her own decisions about her health care. And as we saw tragically in Georgia, that can have deadly consequences.On the economy, I think we have to take a look at economic indicators. Overall, the economy is getting better from where it was four years ago when President Biden and Vice President Harris came in. Inflation is back under three percent, we just saw a rate cut from the Fed that is going to give a lot of us some relief. I am looking at my own mortgage when I saw that news and so I think for women, they will have more freedom under a Vice President Harris as a President Harris, in addition to an economic policy that will create more economic opportunity, and will continue to bring prices down.

And this will give you an understanding of just how close the presidential race is in the great state of North Carolina in the Tar Heel State.Look at this, it's Trump. But by less than a point, we're talking like 0.2 percentage points. It's basically a tie. The governor's race between Josh Stein and Mark Robinson, look at this, Josh Stein was already leading beforehand by 10 points. I wouldn't be surprised if that lead expands a little bit. I think the question is, does this race impact this one? And does the scandal impact the presidential race? That's a question I'm not quite sure about. What I do know, though, is that North Carolina is just really, really important for Donald Trump's chances of winning the White House, because this is the chance of winning the election if the - if either Kamala Harris or Donald Trump wins in the great state of North Carolina. Look at this, Kamala Harris, if she wins in North Carolina, she has a 95 percent chance of winning this election, which basically means it's a must win for Donald Trump. Even if Trump wins in the Tar Heel State, look at that, his chance of winning the election is 74 percent, which is pretty good, right? But Kamala Harris, it's not a must win state for her, it really is for Donald Trump. If he wants to win this election, he has to win in North Carolina.",

I've interviewed researchers and experts who are really worried about political violence spiking and getting even worse in the coming months.So as a society, we have to find ways to de-escalate. And I think that includes within media establishments. We know Donald Trump's not going to do it. He's not going to lower the temperature. There are other politicians who also want to keep the temperature really high. But I think the rest of us have to. So, Jessica, I've been seeking out what groups, what organizations are out there doing this work. There's great groups like Braver Angels trying to help conservatives and liberals make connections and see what they have in common. There's a group called Common Ground Committee that tries to heal divides and promote candidates to seek common ground. There's also a group called More in Common, and the name says it all. They try to show neighbors that they're not enemies. They actually are allies. And those are just a few examples. I'm not here to say the stakes are not high in November. The stakes are very high. It's just we all have to live together next year no matter what happens. And I think the great conservative commentator George Will said it best the other day. He was giving a speech and he said, the way you lower the temperature of politics is to lower the stakes of politics, right? To take away the sense that it's always a crisis, that it's always existential, and to help neighbors see each other as neighbors. I think the media has a role to play in helping us see that we have more in common than we might sometimes think when we're scrolling through our social media feeds. Because you and I both know, Jessica, when we're scrolling through social media, we get a world that looks a lot more divisive than it actually is.",

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [18:52:10] DEAN: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is reportedly planning to visit a Pennsylvania ammunition factory tomorrow. During his visit to the U.S., he hopes to persuade President Biden to allow Ukraine to use Western-made long-range missiles on targets inside Russia as part of his victory plan over Moscow. CNN Military Analyst retired Air Force Colonel Cedric Leighton is joining us now. And Colonel, good to see you. Good to have you with us on this Saturday night. Zelenskyy says he needs these restrictions lifted to use these weapons effectively to win the war against Russia. Do you think he's right and how likely is that to happen? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes, Jessica, good to be with you. I think he is right. It is absolutely essential for the Ukrainians to have as many long-range fires, as it's called in the military business, as possible, different types of weapons, different ranges, kinds of things that are necessary in order to put all the weapons systems that the Russians have at risk. How likely is it to happen? I think there's about a 50-50 chance that he's going to get permission to at least use some of the Western weapons. Chances are, though, that there will be certain restrictions on exactly what they can target. And I think the Ukrainians will probably learn to live with those restrictions. No attacking nuclear command and control centers, no attacking certain things that will be perceived by the Russians as a threat to the existence of the Russian state. That would be the kind of parameter that I could see being established for the Ukrainians in this case.",

He's made statements - others in his government have made statements that they are currently fighting us, basically for a battle for the existence of Russia as a state - as an expansion state. What might this look like?I think in this particular case, what you're looking at is the Russians will make a lot of noise. There'll be a lot of diplomatic movement on the Russian side to try to convince countries like Hungary and Turkey to peel off of NATO. But that will not ultimately be successful. But I do think that there will be a lot of pressure from the Russians, and there will be things that are on the - more unconventional side, things like cyber attacks, sabotage events, those kinds of things will probably be ramped up.",

And there's also a degree of war fatigue.So Zelenskyy understands all of that. He knows that there's war fatigue in the, you know, Western side, but there's also war fatigue within Ukraine. And he's basically racing against the clock to make sure that he can defend Ukraine and has the means to defend Ukraine no matter what happens with our election or with any other political situation, such as German elections, which will probably be coming up soon.
