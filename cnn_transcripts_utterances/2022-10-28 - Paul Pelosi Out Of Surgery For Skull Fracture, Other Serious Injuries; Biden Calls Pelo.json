Doctors expect 82-year-old, Paul Pelosi to make a complete recovery however, it was apparently a very near thing especially for a man of his age. Tonight, a spokesperson for his wife, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi second in the line of presidential succession said Mr. Pelosi underwent surgery to repair a fractured skull and serious injuries to his right arm and hands. A short time ago we learned she is now at the hospital with him. This is new video just of her motorcade arriving. She was in Washington when the attack happened. Additionally, we just learned that San Francisco's Police Chief is expected to update the public soon and we will bring you any new information as it becomes available. This is what we know so far: Law enforcement sources tell CNN he was attacked by a hammer-wielding intruder shouting, \"Where is Nancy?\" And according to two sources familiar with the situation, when police got there, the suspect who is now in custody and charged with attempted murder told them he was \"Waiting for Nancy.\" And although police say they have not determined a motive, the suspect's Facebook page is full of memes and conspiracy theories, including about the 2020 election and January 6th, when as you know, rioters indicated they sought to capture or kill Speaker Pelosi. And as if to underscore the kind of climate we are living in post insurrection and 11 days pre-election, Federal authorities late today put out a bulletin with the following warning. Quoting now: \"Following the 2022 Midterm Election, perceptions of election related fraud and dissatisfaction with electoral outcomes likely will result in heightened threats of violence against a broad range of targets, such as ideological opponents and election workers.\" Needless to say, this is not normal, or worse yet, maybe it is now. But it should certainly not be acceptable. First, CNN's Whitney Wild with more on the attack, the suspect and how this all unfolded. Whitney, what more are you learning about what happened and the charges the suspect is now facing.",

Here are just a few charges from that lengthy listSources tell CNN, the suspect entered through the back of the home and as you'd mentioned, he was shouting \"Where is Nancy? Where is Nancy?\" Further, sources tell CNN that the alleged attacker tried to tie up Pelosi until she came home. Sources tell my CNN colleague, John Miller, that when Pelosi called 9-1-1, he was trying to communicate with the dispatchers effectively in secret so that the assailant wouldn't figure out what he was doing. He had the phone near him, he was basically talking in code and it was just an astute 9-1-1 dispatcher who was able to get police over there quickly. Certainly, John, he was attempting not to get the assailant even angrier than he already was apparently, forced to talk basically in code to a 9-1-1 dispatcher.",

But you know, the thing that really echoes back to me here, John is something that we've known for quite some time and it is that these dispossessed people who are motivated by anger and grievance, they react very strongly to these conspiracy theories.You know, this is not a new thing. We saw this immediately after Donald Trump was elected and the attempted attack on the Comet Ping Pong Pizza Restaurant here in DC, when an individual following QAnon theories came up to DC and tried to shoot up the restaurant in an effort to save children. We saw it recently with that individual who tried to stage a solo attack on the FBI office in Cincinnati.

And it is only the members themselves, not their families, not their homes. And so, you know, when they were receiving about, I think they said 2021, there were about 10,000 threats received by Members of Congress, which is up I guess, about tenfold from previous years' averages, you can see that they're incredibly understaffed and overwhelmed.",

I think what's important to remember here is that Nancy Pelosi was the target today, and the words that this attacker said are just eerily reminiscent of January 6, when we saw the rioters going through saying \"Where is Nancy?\" I think what's most disappointing today, though, is yes, there were some Republicans who spoke out and condemned this. Obviously, Liz Cheney, Adam Kinzinger, Mitch McConnell said he was horrified and disgusted. Mike Pence spoke out and said there was no tolerance. But many Republicans have not said a word about it.

It's kind of shocking, I think, just if you lived through January 6, if you watched what happened to understand that when you look at the grassroots of the Republican base right now, they view January 6th, its assailants as heroes. You have a former President in Donald Trump going out on campaign rallies. When he goes out on campaign rallies right now, he talks about those January 6 defendants being political prisoners. So this is not just something that is happening in the fringe, it is happening in the very mainstream of the Republican Party and the direction of this is moving -- it is just moving in the wrong direction. We are not getting to a place where we are rejecting this kind of political violence. In fact, a major political party, is it even more -- has been brought even closer to this kind of violence as a result of the fact that Trump, he has made it just an article of faith among Republicans that you cannot say anything bad about January 6th.

And it will make us stronger.And I think these are the important elements are going to be on the ballot this year and the election, people have got to go out and vote. And they have to show that we are the strongest democracy in the world. And they saw what happened today, tragic. What happened to Paul Pelosi today you saw it happen to Steve Scalise, you saw what happened to where they wanted to get the governor of Michigan, Gretchen Whitmer, they wanted to kidnap her, I went through a death threat last year, state police had to protect me. We got to get away from this and get back to a place where there's common ground and we can get things done together. And I think President Obama, that's his message tonight in Georgia and the other states that he'll be going to.",

What happened to the Pelosi household, and Mr. Pelosi is terrible, it's disgusting. And I'm very concerned, candidly in our politics, that we're starting to treat politicians like something less than human like they're, you know, they're not entities, you know, human entities like the rest of us, they're to be disrespected or even violated in this way. And it's awful. And so, I just wanted to acknowledge what the governor said, I totally agree with him. And that's a sentiment that everybody ought to be addressing tonight.On the politics of President Obama campaigning, I think the reason he is campaigning and all these important states is because Joe Biden can't. Joe Biden is one of the biggest liabilities for Democrats in this election. And so, Barack Obama is still pretty popular guy and popular, certainly among Democrats. He can also draw a crowd, Joe Biden is also had trouble drawing crowds. So, I understand why he's out on the campaign trail, but I don't think he's going to fix inflation. In the next 10 days, I don't think he's going to fix the national crime wave in the next 10 days. I don't think he's going to fix the border in the next 10 days. And I think people who are excited to turn out if you're on, you know, from a Republican perspective, are not going to be persuaded. Well, I'm really unhappy with the direction of the country, which 70% of people are, but because Obama asked me, I'm going to change my entire outlook on America. It doesn't bother any Republican at all. I get why he's out there. I don't think it's going to be determinative,",

It's in new hands. Elon Musk now owns Twitter or as his profile now Stacy is quote, Chief Twit. It became official last night the $44 billion purchase comes after a lengthy saga that saw the company sue Musk to complete a deal, he proposed and said he wanted out of. There are a number of questions tonight about Musk's next move for instance, who will lead Twitter after he fired the company's top three executives. Also, what if any changes are coming to the company's moderation policies? And how will that affect bans on individuals such as former President Donald Trump? I'm joined now by our new CNN media analyst Sara Fischer who also reports for Axio. Sara, great to see you. Can you walk us through what you know so far about what Elon Musk might have planned for Twitter?",

But then today, he tweeted that there's going to be a new Content Moderation Council, and that no major decisions about reinstating accounts. What happened until that council convened. Now my guess is that Elon Musk is doing that so that he can punt the decision until after the midterms. And that's probably a wise thing for him to do. But I expect that you're going to see that decision come at least by January and the reason is this. Facebook, Meta, its parent company is supposed to make a decision about whether or not Trump's accounts are reinstated there.And so, I think that Elon Musk is going to want to match his reinstatement with whatever they're doing or beat them to it.",
