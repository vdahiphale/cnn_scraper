Plus, Democrats on Capitol Hill lick their wounds and search for solutions, as one lawmaker floats a provocative idea, a shadow cabinet of Democrats. That lawmaker, live with me tonight. And preparing for the promised retribution. How the DOJ is getting ready for Trump's 2.0 administration. Tonight on \"Laura Coates Live.\" Well, tonight, the biggest pick yet for Donald Trump's second administration. We are learning tonight that he is expected to choose Marco Rubio as secretary of state. It would be a huge role for the Florida senator, who has become a serious foreign policy hawk, especially on China and Iran. Now, Trump's choice did not appear to be an easy one. A source says the president-elect was leaning toward former Trump acting director of National Intelligence, Rick Grenell, as of this morning, of all times. But he shifted to Rubio after calls and conversations with Rubio allies. A big caveat you heard from us before, of course, we're hearing Trump could change his mind until the offer is formally made, maybe even afterwards. If you're finding the pick a bit of a surprise, you're not the only one, not least because of the heated insults they traded back in 2016. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, I think that is reflective of kind of where that started and where that has evolved into the party a few years down the road.

So, a confirmation would not be a terribly difficult process for him. And when you are looking at so many geopolitical conflicts that are going to be inherited by the second Trump administration coming out of the Biden administration, someone who not only has been in the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Senate understands this, but also knows their colleagues to be able to step into this role very efficiently.

A 129,000 convicted criminals were deported that year. Why so low? It wasn't a lack of political will during the Trump administration. I mean, Tom had a large voice in that. Stephen Miller was designing the policies. It's just that there aren't 1.5 million criminal aliens out there for ICE to apprehend. Now, what Tom is talking about though are some stats that came out lately in the campaign which were individuals who have been ordered to deport but for various reasons haven't left. But as he knows, those reasons are beyond ICE's control. Their home countries won't take them back. Maybe they're individuals still serving prison sentences who ICE can't touch until they complete their prison sentence, or they're individuals who are successfully able to prove that if they return to China, for instance, or Russia, they will be persecuted or tortured, and thus were entitled to legal protection. So, I guess what troubles me is the rhetoric. I get it. I get where the appeal is to the American public. Hey, let's focus on the worst first. Let's get those criminals off the streets. The bottom line, though, is they're just not there.",

Not a person is booked into a state federal or, you know, prisoner jail in this country without ICE knowing and without ICE taking an action.So now, you start talking about numbers. This administration has been very clear about the numerical goals. A million deportations in the first year or 11 million over the four years. Laura, the demographics are clear. You know, 50, 60% or more of the population has been in this country 15 years. 4.4 million children have an undocumented parent, U.S. citizen children. You can't get into a million a year or 11 million a year without dipping into that population. The criminal numbers just aren't there. The work at getting those at-large gang members, which I think I should do more of, and at-large criminals who have not yet been arrested, is tedious work, it's slow work.
