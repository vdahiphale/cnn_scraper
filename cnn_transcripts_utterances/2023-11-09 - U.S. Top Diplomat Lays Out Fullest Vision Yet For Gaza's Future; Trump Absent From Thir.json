Questions continue to swirl over who will control Gaza after the Israel Hamas war is over.The top five Republican presidential candidates come out swinging at each other and the front runner in their latest debate. But Donald Trump is a no show again. And done deal, finally, Hollywood actors reached a tentative agreements with the major film and television studios to end their months long strike. We begin with growing daylight between the U.S. and Israel over the political endgame in Gaza. Israel says its troops are now at the heart of Gaza City, targeting Hamas infrastructure and commanders and the IDF may not leave anytime soon. Well, earlier this week, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel will be in charge of Gaza overall security indefinitely after the war. But on Wednesday, the U.S. pushed back against that laying out its vision for Gaza is future. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: Gaza cannot be can continue to be run by Hamas. That simply invites a repetition of October 7 and Gaza uses a place from which to launch terrorist attacks. It's also clear that Israel cannot occupy Gaza. The only question is, is there some transition period that might be necessary and what might be the mechanisms that you could put in place for that, to make sure that there is security. But we're very clear on no reoccupation just as we're very clear on no displacement of the Palestinian population. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It is -- it says that it's making progress, that it destroyed 130 tunnel shafts and including one that it says it found near a school run by the -- run by UNRWA, the U.N. agency that provides relief to the Palestinians.So it's really focused on the war. We did hear those comments from Netanyahu talking about what may happen the day after this war is over in terms of having an hence worse overall responsibility for security for an indefinite period of time. Now, the merest hint that that would equate to Israel re occupying the Gaza Strip and the way that it did between 1967 and 2005 was quickly stamped down by the White House, which is now as we just heard from Secretary of State Antony Blinken giving some more of its thoughts as to what would happen next, but having the Palestinian Authority which administers parts of the West Bank, back in control of the Gaza Strip, which it did control for two years between 2005 till 2007. Hamas kicked it out violently in 2007 unrest of control, having the PA back in control of the Gaza Strip and unifying those two administrations has a number of practical obstacles. The Palestinian Authority led by Mahmoud Abbas is weak. It is unpopular, it is widely seen as corrupt. It lacks legitimacy. He's in the 19th year of a four-year term. And he's not going to want to add to that litany of being seen to be some kind of puppet government of the Israelis or the United States in the wake of this war. Although what he did say to Secretary of State Antony Blinken, when they spoke the other day, is that the PA, the Palestinian Authority would go back into Gaza, but only if this was part of a broader political settlement or plan towards a two-state solution towards an independent Palestinian state on land that Israel has occupied since '67, including with East Jerusalem as its capital. But Anna, I think right now where we are with this war ongoing, that seems fanciful at best.",

But as Salma Abdelaziz reports, what they described seeing along the way is nothing short of horrific. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Taking only what they can carry families are fleeing Gaza City. They wave white flags made of anything they can find. And as the sounds of war echo around them, they signal yet again that they are innocents. Now we're supposed to be in the safe area, but you can hear the bombs behind us, he says. All of our houses are gone. Nothing is left. The Israeli military has been calling for weeks on all those living in the northern part of the strip to southwards. Most recently opening what it called Safe Corridors for limited windows of time, pushing thousands here to Salah al-Din Street, where evacuees describe a harrowing journey. We saw along the road destruction dead bodies everywhere. And these really tanks with demand to search the youth, she says. We saw one young man stripped naked. We witnessed unbearable scenes. The only way to reach the root is by foot or by cart for those who can find room. There was heavy shelling on our neighborhood and we were forced to flee. We have to use these donkey carts because there's no fuel, he says. They cut everything off to force us out of our homes. Israeli troops are now in the heart of Gaza City. As Israel's defense minister apparently declared the entire city the whole of the enclaves largest population center, a legitimate target.
