      "sentences": "Welcome back to CNN's special live coverage.In less than two hours, Donald Trump will appear in court here in Washington to formerly fact the historic charges against him. The first indictment to accuse him of committing crimes while he was president of the United States. The four counts of conspiracy allege Trump plotted to overturn the 2020 presidential election using fake electors, pressuring then-Vice President Mike Pence, and exploiting the violence of the day to further convince members of Congress to delay the certification of Joe Biden's win. On January 6, 2021, Democratic Congressman Eric Swalwell gaveled the House session in to start the day. But by the time he left the floor, Swalwell had texted his wife that he loved her and to kiss their children good-bye. He was one of the last members of Congress to get out of the chamber. This video, some of the mob breaking into the capitol, shows a door that was some 30 feet from where Swalwell was. He heard the gunshot that killed a capitol rioter. And when he finally was able to escape the House floor, Swalwell was wearing a gas mask. Representative Eric Swalwell of California joins us right now. He was also an impeachment manager in Donald Trump's second impeachment trial, accusing him of inciting the January 6th insurrection. Congressman, thank you so much for joining us. I hope you're OK.

ERIC SWALWELL (D-CA): Wolf, first and foremost, I want justice for the police officers who stood between my colleagues and I as we were counting the votes and the violent mob that Donald Trump aimed at the capitol. I hope every American in the matter of the United States versus Donald Trump reads the indictment. It lays out that Donald Trump lost this election by a country mile. It wasn't close. It was 74 electoral votes, seven million by the popular vote. After the major media outlets called the race, after every state counted their votes, and after every court denied his bogus claims, he still lied and incited a mob at the capitol. He's entitled to a presumption of innocence but it's a compelling case this indictment lays out that he was responsible for the mayhem that day.",

To me, it seems pretty clear, if you think the guy who weaponized government, you should be able to say I'm not going to vote for that guy. My Republican colleagues can also do a lot more in the Congress to not be Donald Trump's law firm, but rather to unite with Democrats, to make unity the antidote towards these destructive attacks on the rule of law and our democracy.

While democracy was not an issue itself, abuse of presidential power was front and center in the issue. How much could a president do? If a president did it, was it legal just because he did it? As Nixon later would say. So it was a different time, yes, but also the public was very slow. Now, that hasn't happened here, because there's been very little public exposure, particularly to people in Trump's base, as to what he did. Now some will tolerate it.

Shimon, give our viewers a sense of what you're seeing, how tight security has become. SHIMON PROKUPECZ, CNN CRIME &amp; JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Certainly, in the last hour, Wolf, we have seen an increase in the police presence, the Washington Metro Police, more resources are starting to come in. I kind of want to give you a view, Wolf. This is where all of the media has been gathering here on Constitution Avenue, just all of the way down here. This is where the majority of all of the live positions are. And then looking a little further down here towards the middle, there are a few Trump supporters here. And it is actually quite remarkable, because I have covered the other two arraignments for the former president, and certainly, we saw a lot more Trump supporters during those moments. But we are not seeing that kind of presence here. And so far, we are two hours away from the arraignment. We're not seeing that. And then, Wolf, I just want to show you just how close we are to the capitol. There's the capitol, just across the street from this courthouse. So that is certainly something that is on the minds of many here and law enforcement as they work to secure the area. Then I want to show you here, this area here, Wolf. We will cross the street quickly. This is the street, we're on 3rd Street, where the former president is going to arrive. He is going to drive into the courthouse. His motorcade will arrive here. You can see that there are trucks in place already for security. There are snowplows down the street. And once his motorcade gets here, they will go into the garage here in the back of the courthouse, go inside, and that is when the process will begin. Technically, he is going to be under arrest. And then they'll take him upstairs to the courtroom where the arraignment is going to take place. But for now, what we've been seeing, certainly in the last hour, more Secret Service personnel arriving, more law enforcement officials as we get closer to the 4:00 hour -- Wolf?",
