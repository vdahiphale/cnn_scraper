His attorneys were quite concerned about bringing all the other charges he is facing, that he is yet to plead to and be convicted of, if he is, the financial charges, the charges of fraud. The state will be able to ask him about some of them. And the defense is worried, will the other allegations and other potential crimes cloud the jurors' viewpoints when Alex Murdaugh has to answer those questions or chooses not to so he doesn't incriminate him on this stand for this trial for the potential ones that he faces after this one.",

      "sentences": "So much more to be revealed in this case.Dianne Gallagher, who has been covering all of it for us, thank you for that. Joining us is criminal defense attorney and former prosecutor, Bernarda Villalona. Bernarda, you also have been covering this case from the beginning. Murdaugh's very first comments on the stand were frankly pretty jaw dropping, admitting he lied to police, and when he denied he was around those kennels at the time of the murder. What is the strategy here, as a criminal defense attorney? Putting him on the stand to perhaps clear the air around that at the very onset? BERNARDA VILLALONA, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY &amp; FORMER PROSECUTOR: Abby, he had no choice to admit that he lied because the evidence is so concrete. That video, that he had no idea existed, does exist. And it completely implicates him and putting him at the kennel. He could not run from it, especially when you had various witnesses close to his family that identified his voice on the video. So absolutely he had to own up to it. And it's a million-dollar question that everyone wants to know, why did you lie that you were not at the kennels? So he had to give an explanation as to that. That's why I think the main reason why the criminal defense attorney in this case made a calculated decision to put him on the stand. The question would be, was it worth it? In my honest opinion, when we're talking about the reason why he lied, one, it was due to his opiate addiction and he was paranoid. But also, too, of his distrust of the SCLD, the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division. But when you backtrack that, he was lying from the initial, from when he made that 911 call, when he said that he last saw his family an hour and a half or two hours ago. The question will be, will that satisfy this jury in determining he lied because of an opioid addiction or because of his distrust of law enforcement, which makes no sense. Remember, he comes from a long lineage of solicitors in that county. We'll just have to wait and see. I'm dying to hear the cross- examination in this case.",

I saw the tears coming, I saw the shake coming and it was planned. I knew, as having been a former prosecutor, and being a defense attorney and having tried hundreds of cases, of how you prep your witnesses? So I saw that coming. On the flip side, the prosecutor will argue just how he's crying, how he was crying when he was looking at you. He was also crying on a 911 call. He was also crying when he staged a shooting of himself. What do we know from the shooting? That despite those cries, it was all a lie. So which is the truth? What should I believe?

As you know, Abby, there's been a great deal of criticism in terms of why the transportation secretary wasn't here earlier. And he did address that when he was pushed on this particular question, and basically said, after more thought, he should have expressed his thoughts on the issue earlier and he should have been here sooner. So there's that. Also he's made several points he's made before, seemingly about the need for more regulation in the train industry, higher fines, tougher regulation, getting Congress involved as well. He was talking about that. One of the issues, though, that a number of residents we have spoken to over the past week, two weeks, repeatedly have brought up, they know politicians are coming in to give speeches and tour sites. What they're worried about is what happens five years from now? What's going to happen 10 years from now? I put that question to the transportation secretary.

And there's a bit of a timeline here. The NTSB says the temperature was sensed at four different spots as the train was approaching East Palestine. First, the temperature was at about 38 degrees, then continued to go up, went up to about 103 above the ambient temperature, and then ultimately to 253 degrees above the outside air temperature. It was only then that the crew was able to hear a critical alarm, warning them of this overheat and warning them also to slow down and stop the train. It was in the process of that braking, the preliminary report says, that the train derailed. About 38 cars derailed, some of them carrying this hazardous material that ultimately leaked and fed this fire. The NTSB said they very clearly know what happened. Now they have big questions as to why this wheel bearing overheated in the first place. Was it inspected properly? Was it used too much? Was it at the end of its useful like? There's some big questions here that Jennifer Homendy here, the chair of the NTSB, just laid out at a press conference. And they will be digging into that. Right now, we only know the very initial facts according to the NTSB, but it will take months, if not more than a year for them to reach their final probable cause. The NTSB underscores this one big thing. Chair Jennifer Homendy says you have to wait for the investigation process to play out. A lot of people will say different things here. They're simply trying to get to the bottom of this. The wheel bearing that they found is on its way to Washington, D.C., to be analyzed -- Abby?",
