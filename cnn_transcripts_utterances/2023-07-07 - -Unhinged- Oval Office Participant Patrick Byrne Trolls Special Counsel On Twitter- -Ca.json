We learned exclusively that Jack Smith's team continues to ask witnesses, about this meeting that took place, on December 18th, 2020, 19 days before the January 6 riot, and four days after the Electoral College ratified President Biden's win. That was the meeting, where there was a push, to seize voting machines, and declare martial law.

You can't testify against yourself.Now look, to your point, you can't have a conspiracy by yourself. But it's actually not that hard, to establish a conspiracy.

Cluster bombs are lethal weapons that can scatter, essentially, dozens of smaller explosives, over an area the size that can be up to several football fields. These so-called bomblets are supposed to go off, as soon as they hit the ground. But experts say that up to a third of them usually don't. Kids have been often known to find them, mistaking them for toys. Others turn into de facto landmines that go off, when people stumble upon them, years later, long after the conflict has ended. The dangers are so great, from cluster bombs, that they are banned by much of the world, today. Although as the White House highlighted, Russia uses them, really, with abandon, certainly in Ukraine. Factoring into today's decision, the White House says that Ukraine gave written assurances that they would minimize, any risk, from using these cluster bombs, to civilians. President Biden sat down with CNN's Fareed Zakaria, today, to explain why he changed his mind. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Number two, the Ukrainians are running out of ammunition, the ammunition, they used to call them 155-millimeter weapons. This is a -- this is a war relating to munitions. And they're running out of those that ammunition. And we're low on it. And so, what I finally did, I took the recommendation of the Defense Department, to not permanently, but to allow for, in this transition period, where we had more 155 weapons that -- these shells, for Ukrainians, to provide them with a something that has a very low dud rate. It's about one -- I think it's 150, which is the least likely to be blowing. And it's not used in civilian areas. They're trying to get through those trenches, and those -- and stop those tanks from rolling. And so, but it was not an easy decision. And it's not -- we're not signatories to that -- that agreement.

And President Biden made a determination that it's more important that they not lose ground, to the Russians, that they are able to succeed, or have a chance of success, in the counteroffensive. I mean, I think the point he makes is, I think, on balance, correct, which is the greatest harm to civilians, in the area, would be if the Russians win, because the Russians have shown themselves, to be totally indiscriminate. And so, here, what the Ukrainians are trying to do is use these weapons, to break up the Russian positions, which are hardened, which are in trenches, which are in tanks. There is always a danger. But again, we have to keep our eyes on the prize, I suppose, which is, if Russia would win the battle, in any of these situations, is that better or worse, for civilians?
