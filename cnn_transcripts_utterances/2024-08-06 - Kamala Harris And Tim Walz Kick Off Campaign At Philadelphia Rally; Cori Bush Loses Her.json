Harris knew exactly what she was doing when she used those words. No one had her name at the top of the ticket maybe a month ago. No one had his name on the ticket at all, perhaps even two weeks ago. And with about 90 days to go, they've got to prove their name should have always been there in the first place.Now leave it to Vegas to decide whether the odds are against them or in their favor. But I'll tell you, Harris is now betting that Coach Walz, as she called him tonight, can help her run a political offense that can somehow pierce Trump's coalition and win over some of those critical voters come November. Much easier said than done. But tonight, in Philadelphia, she began the work of introducing Walz to America for those who don't know who he is. She praised his 24 years at the National Guard, his time as a high school social studies teacher, his 12 years in Congress, don't forget and, of course, his time as governor of my home state, Minnesota. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He has been a model chief executive.

Sources tell CNN that Harris and Walz actually hit it off during the vetting process. They had political chemistry. And perhaps most importantly, Walz told the vetting team he had zero ambition to become president. Now, I find that particularly intriguing.The same could not be said about Governor Josh Shapiro, who reportedly came across as -- quote, unquote -- \"overly ambitious\" during the vetting process. Still, he tonight delivered a rousing speech praising this new ticket. Now, Walz, it seems, understands the assignment and has seemingly understood it for quite some time now. Voters, they want credibility as much as authenticity. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. TIM WALZ (D-MN), U.S. VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: You know it. You feel it. These guys are creepy. And yes, just weird as hell. And make no mistake, violent crime was up under Donald Trump. (APPLAUSE) That's not even counting the crimes he committed.

I think about a clip where Governor Walz said, you know, socialism is one man's neighborliness. And it's the sort of thing where if you're thinking about it purely ideologically, well, that sounds like a really nice spin on socialism. That sounds like maybe pretty far to the left. But talking about late neighborliness maybe doesn't code as political extremism. And so, I'm going to be interested to see, do voters look at things like that and think, wow, his views and his policy positions are very -- progressives really love him for that. Maybe he is too far to the left. Or do they say, you know, he's more moderate-coded because he's talking about hunting and fishing and all those sorts of things.",

It was a critical moment to define who he is and what he stands for, because up until the past couple of weeks, maybe you have never heard much about him.Joining me now is someone who knows Tim Walz well from their time in Congress together, former Democratic congressman and presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke. Thank you so much for joining us this evening. I mean, you know, Governor Walz. You went on runs with him. I understand you talked music with him. You both serve in the same committee, the Veterans Affairs Committee. How do you expect him to handle this role? BETO O'ROURKE, FORMER TEXAS REPRESENTATIVE: Well, let me tell you a little bit about the time that I spent with Tim in Congress. You know, the House Veterans Affairs Committee is where members of Congress are sent as a form of punishment. Few, if any, choose to be on that committee because there are no PAC dollars to be raised, there are no big ribbon cutting ceremonies, it's not sexy, you don't make the headlines in the newspapers. But Tim was one of those rare members, one of these rare human beings who wanted to be there because he wanted to help and serve those who had literally put their lives on the line for this country. I think that has something to do with his upbringing, with his character, and the fact that he served 24 years in the Army National Guard, leaving as a command sergeant major, I think the highest enlisted rank of any member who has ever served in the House of Representatives. That says a lot about Tim Walz to me and to the countless veterans that he served across this country. And yes, we got to know each other as friends. We sat next to each other. We talked music, The Replacements, Husker Du, Prince, Bob Dylan, Lizzo, all the great stuff coming out of Minnesota. And early morning runs. And I remember distinctly it being freezing cold in February in D.C., single digits, and I show up in seven layers, everything that I've got on because I'm a -- (LAUGHTER) -- kid from the desert southwest in El Paso, and Tim Walz is standing there in running shorts and a T-shirt just ready to go. The guy is as tough as an ox and the kindest human being you'll ever meet. And as Joe was just saying earlier, he is the person that you see up there. When you talk to him privately, he's just as folksy. He's just the same Tim Walz that you see up on that stage or behind that microphone. And the reason that most of us have never heard of Tim Walz, unless we serve with him or unless we live in the state of Minnesota, is the guy is not a blowhard. He's not a bloviator. He's not a grandstander. He's not touting his own record. He's just getting the job done. And I saw him do that for veterans, day in, day out.

He would call it an epiphany or a revelation, maybe a change of heart that should be appraised and applauded. You suggest that he is a conformist in that respect.But I am wondering what you make of the potential matchup in a debate between the two, particularly given that you know that the issues on the border are going to be top of mind. They're going to be a very important aspect of any debate, of any evaluation by voters. Harris is trying to appear tough on the border. Republicans are attacking her record. Walz supports a path to citizenship for some undocumented immigrants, but not much is known about his views on border security specifically. What can you tell us about this pairing on that issue? O'ROURKE: I cannot wait for this debate and specifically on this issue. I think Governor Walz is going to be able to show this country that President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris worked with Democrats and Republicans alike to put forward one of the most comprehensive border security and immigration proposals that this country has ever seen. They got buy in from hardcore right-wing Republicans. It was ready to pass and it was spiked. It was blown up at the end of the day by Donald Trump because he doesn't want the solution. He doesn't want to solve these problems. He wants to be able to run on the problem. And that's J.D. Vance's record as well. So, Tim Walz, Kamala Harris, Joe Biden have offered the American public solutions to a problem that we've had long before Joe Biden was president, before even Trump or Obama. This has been with us for the decades since we last had comprehensive immigration reform. You elect Kamala Harris and Tim Walz as the president and vice president of the United States of America, and I promise you they will make this a priority and they will get it done.",
