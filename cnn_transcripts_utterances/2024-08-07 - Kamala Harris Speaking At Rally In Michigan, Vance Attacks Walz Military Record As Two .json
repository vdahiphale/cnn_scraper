Donald Trump cares about crowd size. I mean, he's got to be paying attention to what's been happening on the ground for the Democrats. BRYAN LANZA, TRUMP 2016 DEPUTY COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR: Yes. But he's also paying attention to the facts like remember the big rally in Atlanta that the Harris campaign had last week, by the time Harris spoke, half the crowd had disappeared because they used celebrities to draw the big crowd to get them there to take the photos that say, hey, this is a big crowd size and they perform. Well, once the celebrities leave, the crowd leaves. So, I think you sort of have to add -- you know, President Trump is smart enough to know that it is being inflated, not by Kamala Harris, but by the celebrities that are trying to prop her up.",

But there was new audio that came out today of Donald Trump praising Governor Walz at the time, listen to this. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R) FORMER PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES: I'll tell you the best what they did in Minneapolis was incredible. They went in and dominated and it happened immediately.

They said he basically froze, was derelict of duty for three days before the National Guard came in.So yes, ultimately, Tim Walz, the governor, was able to get it right after three days of abandoning the city and watching it burn, watching the police station burn, watching businesses go up in flames, watching people get attacked violently. And finally, he stepped in. So sure President Trump is praising Tim Walz for doing something they should have done on day one that took him three days to finally respond. But let me sort of bring it back to the reality here, where we are, we're now on day -- within 24 hours after this guy been announced and now there's real questions about his military service and how he first ran for Congress, how he said he was returning from Afghanistan, which he actually never served in the military in combat. So, I don't know. I think from my standpoint, this pick, it appears to be a disaster if there's real questions about his military service and you have people who know him best. He is sort of platoon captain, as the people who he's with, they are the ones being critical of his military service. So, I don't know. I view this or 24 hours into this knotty conversation Harris campaign wants to have about their VP nominee, sort of misleading his military service because that goes to a question of character and she can't have any more questions about her character.",

And then perhaps off that platform, into another one where you maybe in a chat room and potentially, approached by an ISIS recruiter.

So, all the signs here -- teenagers, social media, encrypted means as well, and ISIS in the mix too -- real concerns too, John, about the return of what they call the directed threat.
