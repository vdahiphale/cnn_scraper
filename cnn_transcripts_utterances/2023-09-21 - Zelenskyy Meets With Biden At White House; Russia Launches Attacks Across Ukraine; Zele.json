And we begin with our world lead as right now, President Joe Biden meets with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House. Zelenskyy on a laser focused mission right here on Washington, D.C., secure more aid at all costs.Today, he's quoted as saying if we don't get the aid, we will lose the war. Russia even after 19 months of relentless attacks against Ukraine, showing no signs of slowing down. Just last night, multiple Ukrainian cities bombarded by a brutal wave of attacks. But those stakes in mind, Zelenskyy today also went to the Pentagon, and held critical meetings on Capitol Hill where aid for Ukraine is a key sticking point for some Republicans in the House spending bill which could all lead to a government shutdown. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy denied Zelenskyy a meeting with the full Republican conference. Let's begin at the White House with CNN's Kayla Tausche. Kayla, busy day there for you. President Biden and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy are meeting right now. What do we know about this meeting and will Zelenskyy walk away with anything he's asking for in terms of aid?",

President Biden is expected to introduce the Ukrainian leader to the former commerce secretary, Penny Pritzker, who's going to be serving as a top diplomat to assist the country in its rebuilding and recovery effort. But, of course, first things first, and that is taking care of the war that is happening on the ground in his country right now. To that end, Zelenskyy is also going to be making a presentation to the president's cabinet to give his battlefield perspective and to share more information about what Ukraine needs right now at this moment.The Biden administration is expected to announce a new aid package, $325 million of artillery, anti-aircraft, and cluster munitions that the Biden administration says will help Ukraine in the near term on the ground in its counteroffensive with what it needs most right now. Notably, Pam, that's coming from an existing authorization from Congress. That is not new money. The White House has said that Ukraine needs $24 billion to be able to sustain the war from October 1st through the end of the year and that they've already begun having conversations with Congress about what happens after that? But it's that $24 billion package that remains in limbo right now, with congressional leaders trying to find some path forward to keep the domestic priorities funded and to keep the government open in the coming weeks. We will see what materializes, whether there can be any sort of agreement reached after Zelenskyy's visit today. Certainly, he is making a hard sell as part of this Capitol campaign but one end of Pennsylvania Avenue is far more supportive than the other -- Pam. BROWN:  All right. Kayla Tausche, thank you so much. Let's go now to Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine, where CNN senior international correspondent Fred Pleitgen is standing by.

He also warned that if the United States was to back away from its commitment to Ukraine, that Ukraine could fall to Russia. But there still is a block of hard-line conservatives who are still fiercely opposed to Ukraine aid, especially over here in the House, and that dynamic was really on full display in a pretty striking way today. Over in the Senate, you saw Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, and Mitch McConnell, the GOP leader, walking together flanking on each side of Zelenskyy as they walked into the Senate for their meeting. But over in the House, Kevin McCarthy did not accompany Zelenskyy, in fact, he took some steps to distance himself from the Ukrainian president and did not want official photogs in the room although our colleague Andy Greer obtained some of him posing inside. But it just really speaks of the divide they are facing and hear it in their tone. Just take a listen to the difference in the way McCarthy and McConnell are talking about Ukraine aid. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY):  This morning, I was proud to welcome President Zelenskyy to the Capitol. At the risk of repeating myself, Americans' support for Ukraine is not charity. It's an investment in our own direct interests. REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  Look, we've got to get our first our fiscal house taken care of here in America. I'm more than willing to look at that, but the one thing I know is if the president is only focused on that and had 10,000 people on the border and wants to ignore that, I think there are priorities here.

Which is, frankly, when you have nine days until a shutdown, why yesterday and late into the evening the Problem Solvers Caucus, a bipartisan group of 32 Democrats and 30 Republicans, we sat in a room and put together a bipartisan agreement to actually keep the lights on in the government, make sure that people, our veteran, our seniors, the military doesn't suffer with an unnecessary government shutdown and keep the country moving forward.

I agree with many of my colleagues that we need to reduce spending. With all due respect to my colleague standing next to me, obviously, over the last two years, spending increased dramatically. I do want to rein that in. I do think that's why the American people elected a House Republican majority.But they elected us to govern and we have that responsibility. And so, I say to my colleagues on the right -- yes, we got to rein in spending, yes, we need to work through the appropriations process but we cannot inflict pain on the American people in that process. A shutdown will only hurt the American people and that is what I am trying to avoid and it's why I'm willing to work across the aisle to ensure a CR passes but I will continue to talk to my colleagues in the House Republican majority to impress upon them the need to work together to govern. We are in a divided government. The Democrats control the Senate and the White House, so we're not going to get everything we want and we have to work together to get there. GOTTHEIMER:  And I'll just say there is a huge difference between as Michael was pointing out between what's reasonable and draconian. The stuff coming out that we're reading about what they want to do to families in this country is draconian and crosses the line. There is a place for reasonableness and including, by the way, as we've been doing focus on paying down the debt and have a fiscal commission we've suggested as a way to move forward because I think you want to look at long-term deficit issues. But not hurt people, not hurt our veterans or seniors, not cut military pay, right, and make sure we look out for people and there's a way to do both and that's what we're proposing, a reasonable commonsense bipartisan way forward. And you cannot bend to extremism, and I think that's one of the big lessons of right now for the Republicans that the extremists don't want to solve problems, they actually just want to muck things up and burn the place down as Speaker McCarthy said.",

And that's very dangerous. The melding -- the blurring, I should say of opinion and journalism, that's a dangerous thing.",

At that point in time, once I was retained, I went to go do a welfare check on Mr. Lee at the prison.And instantly once I saw Mr. Lee, I knew that something was wrong. There were a bump above his head. Mr. Lee complained of urinating blood when he was using the rest room and there were also physical signs of some type of bruising around the ribs. Later on, I found out that Mr. Lee was tone to the hospital and he was diagnosed with a fractured rib. According to Mr. Lee, once he was arrested at a home, he was then transported to what we now foe to be the brave cave, says that upon entry into the brave cave, Officer Troy Lawrence and other officers started to take off their body worn cameras, and said once he entered into the warehouse, he said he was instantly attacked by Mr. Lawrence and several other officers. Another officer performed a leg sweep and what transpired there he described as a gang style beating. Once that occurred, Mr. Lee was then interviewed, interrogated without counsel being present. At that point in time, again, he was then transported to the parish prison. Once he was transported to parish prison, Baton Rouge parish prison, did not admit -- did not allow him to come in and he was then taken to the hospital and that's where he was diagnosed with fractured ribs.",

I can tell you in our reporting throughout the course of the day in speaking with the migrants who we witnessed cross over, hundreds and hundreds at a time today, many of them tell us, and many of the ones that were crossing here in Venezuela, the vast majority of them were from Venezuela.So those are people who've been -- and they told us they've been waiting on the Mexican side of the border for several months in many cases as they tried to go through what is known as the CBP One app. And basically, this is an application process that allows migrants to set up an appointment to present their asylum case. Many of these migrants have been telling us they've been waiting months and months to get through. And a sense of desperation is setting in. That's why you're seeing these massive numbers in part showing up on the American side of the river, creating a great deal of headaches for the border patrol agents, state authorities and the local officials who are trying to be able to cope with the amount of people here that are arriving. But by and large, what we're hearing from the migrants who say they're tired of waiting, that there's a sense of desperation setting in and they just wanted to get across.",

This is all unfolding as state authorities, Border Patrol agents were standing there waiting for them to get through and then they were taken into custody.Many of these people-- in fact, it was kind of a surreal scene. The first man that came across he stood up and instantly apologized to the United States for entering illegally. But as I mentioned, it's really the sense of desperation. And these migrants tell us they are willing to take their chances with the immigration process here and if that means they'll be deported then they'll deal with that. But it's almost like they've gotten to the point where they're tired of waiting and they want to push along into the system to see what may or may not happen for them.",

You know, that's not by accident.And so, a lot of these -- the sheriff is very concerned that there are bigger forces at play here, smuggling operations that will prey on these people once they are processed and given the paperwork needed to be able to stay in the United States. And they say they've been seeing smuggling operations and people coming here to Eagle Pass to move these migrants to other parts of the country. So these are the different types of issues and concerns that law enforcement that we've spoken with here say they have at this moment.",
