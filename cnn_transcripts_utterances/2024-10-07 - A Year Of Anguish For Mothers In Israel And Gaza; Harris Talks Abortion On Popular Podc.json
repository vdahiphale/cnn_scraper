And amidst the moving tributes is a renewed push to bring home the dozens of hostages still being held by the terrorist group. Is there any hope of a deal on the horizon? Any hope of relief for the innocent civilians in Gaza and Lebanon being subjected to the horrors of war? I'm going to ask the Israeli ambassador to the U.S. coming up.Plus, the Harris-Walz campaign tries out a new strategy with just over one month until the presidential election, but will it be enough to reach the voters on the fence who have not decided which candidate to support or if they'll even get up off the couch and cast a ballot this November? But we start this hour with breaking news, a brand new forecast just in moments ago for Hurricane Milton, which is heading right towards Florida as an extremely dangerous Category Five hurricane. Today Milton became the strongest storm anywhere on the planet this year. Meteorologist Chad Myers is in CNN's Hurricane Headquarters. Chad, where is Milton set to make landfall and what is your best assessment as to when?",

The 5And in fact it's forecast, Jake, to get to 185 after midnight tonight. And then make landfall either as a Category Four or a Category Three very close to Tampa. When Helene hit the area, I know it went north of there. But the surge in Tampa Bay was six to seven feet. The forecast surge in Tampa itself is now 10 to 15 feet. So I talked to a guy today and said, hey man, I had six feet of water in my house. And I went, ugh, that's not good because six is now gonna be 10 or 15. So that house may not be there anymore. Dude, this is really, really a deadly storm that people are going to need to get away. If your local county emergency manager says you need to evacuate, now is the time. Unlike the storm that kind of -- Ian, that kind of turned into Fort Myers, we have time this time. You have time to find some place to shelter. And it is going to be one, obviously for the record books, but we've never had a stronger storm. Obviously in the Gulf of Mexico in the past couple of decades, the last storm that make landfall close to Tampa was a 102 years ago, the last major hurricane didn't have a name, but that was 1921. This is a devastating event. People need to take precautions. You need to tell your relatives, hey, Uncle Joe, you need to get out of there. They told you to leave, it's time. You have to go somewhere. You don't have to go to North Carolina. You have to go somewhere away from that surge, away from that water, Jake.",

It basically looks like a dump in our beautiful park in the middle of our little beach community. So that is very nerve-wracking and that is again why really important for people to heed these evacuation notices because we're not -- these aren't normal times.

And first of all, it's extraordinarily irresponsible. It's about him, it's not about you. And the reality is that FEMA has so many resources that are available to folks who desperately need them now, and resources that are about helping people get back on their feet and rebuild and have places to go. You are entitled to these resources. People are entitled to these resources and it is critically important that people apply for the help that is there to support. That all of those resources were created for just these kinds of moments in an emergency situation knowing that folks are entitled to have the relief that they so rightly need at this moment in time. So, listen to your sheriffs around the places that have been impacted by Helene, listen to your local sheriff who's going to tell you straight about what's available to you and how for so many reasons and ways there are no conditions attached to the relief that's available to you.",

Several explosions rocked Tel Aviv and there was the air raid siren once again. We've learned since that these were projectiles fired from the north, from Hezbollah in Lebanon, but they were not the only ones today.Earlier today, I was in a memorial for the survivors of the massacre at the Nova Music Festival. And while I was there, it was evacuated for several minutes because there was an interception then. We could see the smoke trail in the sky from the interceptor. That one, a missile the IDF later said fired from Yemen. It gives you a sense of how this is very much still a multi-front war and expanding, multi- front war with fighting in Gaza where this all began, but now an expanding war in Lebanon, strikes against the Houthis in Yemen. And this sense of anticipation right now, Jake, about exactly how and when Israel will respond to that enormous missile barrage we saw several days ago here. And I'll say, there are a lot of disagreements in this country on some things, including a hostage deal. I don't hear a lot of disagreement in this country about striking back at Iran.

That's why you've had Donald Trump be a little bit more reluctant to talk about it. He doesn't like getting sort of pinned down on the issue. I do think that there's a risk for Kamala Harris in this being kind of the only issue that she is known for insofar as she's very comfortable talking about it.But the number one issues that a lot of voters still have are things like the economy. They are things like immigration. And when it comes to the specific podcast, I do think that was probably the right topic. And I think it is very smart that she's going on these alternative podcasts. And by alternative, you know, non-political. Right now, if you care about politics at all, you've decided how you're voting in this election. But if you are somebody who really just does not want to be a part of this, thinks, being reached by something that is ostensibly non-political is kind of the only way you're going to get breached by these campaigns right now.

So it's kind of interesting at the same time that they're moving to a place that is more kind of pro-family policy. It's coming with this messaging that I would never have recommended.",

There was a clash between the Biden administration trying to enforce a 1986 law that requires treatment in emergency rooms to stabilize patients, even patients who might come in with pregnancy complications and could need an abortion.Now, states that have passed abortion bans have challenged the -- the Biden administration on this. And you probably remember last year the justices dismissed an Idaho case after hearing it, saying that there needed to be more fact finding and legal issue resolution below. But here now in Texas, they decided not to take up the case. The Biden administration, in fact, said, you don't need to take this case, but please get rid of that lower court ruling from the appellate court in the Texas matter because it's going to hurt women in Texas. The justices, with no reasoning explained, just said no. And there was no recorded vote or dissent. But I should say, Jake, that this only applies in Texas, that throughout the rest of the country, the Biden administration guidance about emergency room abortions will still hold. And I think the big takeaway here is the justices are not, even though there's still going to be conflict between states with abortion bans and the administration wanting this emergency room guidance to be able to help women who face pregnancy complications, that's not going to be resolved, at least not in this election year.
