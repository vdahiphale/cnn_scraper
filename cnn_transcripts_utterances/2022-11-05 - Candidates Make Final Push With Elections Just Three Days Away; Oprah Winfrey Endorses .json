Election day now just three days away and candidates are blanketing their states making their final pitches to voters. Several key races to watch. Today many eyes are on Pennsylvania which could play a pivotal role for control of the U.S. Senate. Democrat John Fetterman taking on Republican Mehmet Oz in a neck-and-neck contest and they are pulling out all of the firepower. A total of three presidents holding events across that state today. President Biden and former President Obama holding a campaign stop for Fetterman. While former President Trump is stumping for Oz. CNN's Jessica Dean is in Pittsburgh for all of the action on the campaign trail. Jessica, this is a critical stretch for both Senate candidates. And it looks like you've got a pretty good turnout behind you right now.",

This is the next three days and election day for this very tight race that could determine who controls the U.S. Senate.So behind me this is going to be a rally for John Fetterman, the Democratic nominee. Former President Barack Obama is scheduled to appear here not too long from now and there is a line stretched all the way around the block here to my right, people waiting to get in to hear from the former president and John Fetterman. He is, of course, running against, as you mentioned, Mehmet Oz, who will be seen with former President Donald Trump about an hour from here. We are expecting a big crowd there as well. And then President Biden will appear with Obama later today in Philadelphia. It is no coincidence that we have three presidents in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. This is a race that is absolutely critical. It is the most expensive Senate race in the country. It is incredibly tight and they are trying to fire up the base in both respective parties and then they are both after these Pennsylvania swing voters, Independents, people who are willing to vote for different parties and that happens here in Pennsylvania. They've got a lot of Independent and swing voters. Both candidates are looking for any edge that they can possibly get and they certainly are hoping that these last-minute rallies are going to fire up the base and get them where they want to go. One more thing to keep in mind Fredricka, as we head into the next couple of days. Both candidates heading back to the suburbs of Philadelphia. That's where a lot of those Independent voters are. Keep an eye on that on election night. That's going to be very pivotal for both of these campaigns.",

So we are seeing a lot of presidential firepower in your state in these final days before the election. Trump, Obama, Biden all making stops there today. Biden just barely eked out a win there in 2020. So what kind of impact do you think those campaign rallies will be making on this very tight race for Senate? John Micek, editor-in-chief, \"Pennsylvania Capital-Star\": Fredricka, I'm actually -- I'm in Bucks County today. This is a must-win county for John Fetterman and Mehmet Oz. One of the most populous counties, a swing county. It's elected Republican Brian Fitzpatrick to Congress. But has Democratic members of the state legislature. This is a place where you really need to turn out the votes with big rallies like this going into the final stretch. The Democrats are exciting the base, trying to get their voters all keyed up to go to the polls on Tuesday. I mean, this is a one or two-point race at most.

I mean again, every good word is going to help. When that Oprah endorsement came down the other evening, the Fetterman campaign blasted it out immediately to journalists, pulling out all the stops, putting it on social right away. I mean, that's something that hits Mehmet Oz directly where he lives. He basically owes his television existence to Oprah Winfrey. So the Fetterman people are seeing that as a big get.

Areas that he says are under threat if Republicans take control of the House and Senate. The White House has really been trying to key in into economic issues in the closing days of this campaign as they are keenly aware that the economy and inflation are top of mind for voters and as voter discontent over the economy could jeopardize Democrats' chances of holding on to power in the House and Senate.

And yes, we are kind of in it right now, Fred.Good to see you and good morning. 18 reports of tornadoes on the ground yesterday. They could be plus or minus a few when the weather service goes out and sees whether one skipped around or not. That's irrelevant. There was an awful lot of damage with very large tornadoes, certainly some of the damage that I have seen and some of the video live these were EF-3 or more tornadoes. These are big tornadoes. 150 miles per hour spinning around for a long time for many miles on end. And talk about miles. There was golf ball-sized hail in Madison, Wisconsin yesterday. And there was severe weather all the way down to the Gulf Coast in the same line of weather. That's how big this storm was. And it was even snowing in parts of Kansas this morning. Now, what I'm worried about today is the lightning that's going to be out there. Also some wind that's going to be rolling towards Chicago here, some warnings to your west, Chicago. Wind gusts 50, 60 miles per hour. But it's the lightning and people outside that really have me concerned because so many football games will be going on. I mean the Breeders' Cup is in Lexington, the horse racing there, and winds here across parts of the Great Lakes will be 40 to 60 miles an hour. That could bring down power lines. That could bring down some trees. So if you're going to be out and about today, it would be a good idea to have an app on your phone or even be able to look at the radar because here is 2:00. The rain all the way from the Great Lakes right on down to the gulf. Move you ahead until tomorrow morning, there are a few showers to the east there. Now, if you are going to get into the New York City marathon or even watch it, there could be a few showers around but not much. I think most of that will be drying out by the time this weather gets to New York City. Most of the rain will be down to the south. That's where the humidity is. It's a little bit humid down here across parts of the Gulf Coast and that's where the heaviest rain will be. One more thing for our viewers out to the west. There is one heck of a good snowstorm coming down especially in higher elevations. And I say good snowstorm because places that really need it. We had over 50 large fires a few weeks ago in the Pacific Northwest, that number is down significantly. We will take the rain. We'll take the snow. We'll take that snow that will melt next, I mean -- really next summer. That will be into the drinking water supplies of some of these people out there.",

Comer, as well as Jim Jordan, who's the top Republican on House Judiciary, are also planning a press conference for shortly after the election to talk about everything that Republicans have learned so far about Hunter Biden. Now, federal prosecutors have been investigating Hunter Biden for potential tax crimes and misleading statements, but no charges have been made and Hunter Biden has denied any wrongdoing. In addition, Jim Jordan has said its his mission to investigate the politicization of the FBI and DOJ. He released a more than thousand- page report this week making all of those claims, and he even sent letters to the top officials from DOJ, FBI -- basically putting them on notice for what a House Republican-led Judiciary Committee would be investigating of their agencies and how they should prepare. But more broadly, Republicans are looking into the U.S./Mexico border, the origins of COVID, and even the Biden administration's handling of the withdrawal from Afghanistan.

Now, the former president has not yet decided on a firm date, but one possibility that's been floated in his orbit is the Monday after the midterm elections or November 14th. We do not know where he will make his announcement or what exactly it will look like, but he has shown an eagerness about running again in his recent campaign appearances for midterm candidates. At his Thursday night rally in Sioux City, Iowa, Trump told the crowd to, quote, \"get ready\" because he will, quote, \"very, very, very probably run again in 2024\". Of course, this all comes as the former president and some of his associates face several ongoing investigations that could lead to indictments after the midterm elections. That remains on the mind of his aides as he plots his next chapter and it could lead to changes in his 2024 timeline. Back to you.",
