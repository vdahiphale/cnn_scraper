Now, first and foremost, we have learned that it was a joint operation between the Israeli military, the IDF, and the country's foreign intelligence services, the Mossad.Now according to the \"New York Times\" what they managed to do is to get small amounts of explosives inside these pagers next to the battery along with a switch which would enable them to be detonated remotely resulting in those explosions that we can see right now and which have caused chaos across Lebanon. At the same time we are also learning that the devices seem to be made by a company called Gold Apollo. This is a Taiwanese-based manufacturer of these pagers. But the chairman of that company says that the model in question, the AR924, was not manufactured by them. Rather, it was manufactured under license by a Hungarian distributor that goes by the name of BAC Consulting. It's based in Budapest. Now, what we don't know, of course, is at what point these explosives managed to find their way into these pagers. Was BAC Consulting, you know, somehow involved? We've reached out to the company. We will obviously bring you more details on that. We don't know if these explosives were perhaps installed via agents who got into the factory somehow, or if they got them into these devices in the course of shipment, perhaps intercepting the shipment while it was on its way to Hezbollah militants in Lebanon and getting the explosives in there at the time.

INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Death tolls are continuing to rise in several parts of Europe as a result of extreme weather conditions. First of all as a result of some of the havoc that's been caused by storm Boris in parts of Eastern and Central Europe. Some of the worst hit areas along Poland's border with the Czech Republic, where towns have been evacuated, bridges have collapsed, and there are fears that there could be more damage to come. In some parts of Central Europe, it was a month worth of rain that fell in a matter of just days, with many of those parts of Europe simply unprepared for the amount of water that fell from the sky. We've seen dams burst, bridges collapse and tens of thousands have to be evacuated already, with much of that chaos now spreading southwards to parts of Europe along the Danube. There are also fears about the wildfires that have gripped parts of Portugal in the center and the north of the country, Portugal and Spain that have been for many years now subject to forest fires over the course of ever-heating summers. This summer not so bad for those parts of southern Europe, but it is the late surge in temperatures over the course of the weekend that appears to have caused several of those wildfires to start.

We have to support her, and maybe this can happen to anyone, young, old, you never know. And it's important. This hurts. As a woman, this hurts. We can't imagine such things. It's unacceptable.

Investors are betting on a quarter point or half point cut, either of which could send stocks to new record highs. Tuesday's trading was relatively quiet ahead of the Fed's move. The Dow dropped almost 16 points, the Nasdaq was up nearly 36 points and the S&amp;P saw a minimal gain but straight time.Soaping changes are coming soon to teen accounts on Instagram.

      "sentences": "Right. Starting next week Instagram is going to start automatically applying new teen account settings for all users under the age of 18. Here's what that's gonna look likeSo even if you're a teen influencer your account will automatically be set to private. There's going to be new restrictions on who can message teens who can tag them and photos and comments. Teens will start seeing less sensitive content in their feed. So think for example, a post promoting a cosmetic procedure, they'll see less of that. Teen accounts will also be automatically set to sleep mode by default, which means they won't be receiving notifications overnight. Messages will receive an auto response and teens are going to start getting a warning when they've spent an hour on the platform each day. But here's what I think is the biggest change here. [03:55:01] Teens who are 16 and 17 years old, once this change happens, they can automatically by themselves go back in and change the settings back if they want. But teens who are 13 to 15 will have to receive parental approval through the app if they want to change any of these settings. That means if teens who are 13 to 15 haven't set up parental supervision, linked their parents' account to their account, they're going to have to do that if they want less of these restrictions. So potentially more control for parents here of young teens in terms of their kids' experience on Instagram. Now Instagram has over the past few years in the face of a lot of pressure rolled out some one-off changes, new policy updates to try to keep teens safe, but this is a much more comprehensive approach than what we've seen previously. Now there may still be ways for teens to get around this. They could pretty easily lie about their age when they're signing up for accounts on the platform for example, but I think certainly some reassurance for parents here that the company is making some effort to keep kids safe.
