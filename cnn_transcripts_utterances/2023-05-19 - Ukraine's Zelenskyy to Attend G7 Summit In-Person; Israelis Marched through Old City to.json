Now he's due to attend the gathering after first stopping in Saudi Arabia to attend today's Arab League Summit. That's according to CNN sources. And that meeting will also be significant.Now already, Ukraine is top of mind in Japan. The U.K. and the European Union have already announced new sanctions targeting Russia's diamond trade. And in a key development, sources tell CNN the U.S. will not stand in the way of allies sending F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine, something Kyiv has been requesting for months. CNN's White House reporter Kevin Liptak is live this hour in Hiroshima and our correspondent Salma Abdelaziz is standing by for us in London. Kevin, to you first, a surprise visit from Zelenskyy, it's interesting here that as much as China may be top of mind for these leaders still, Ukraine is the task ahead.

The real hope among world leaders here, including President Joe Biden, is that Ukraine will be able to regain some territory that will help Zelenskyy eventually gain some leverage at a negotiating table with Russia, of course when that happens, where that happens all remains to be seen.But the leaders are behind closed doors at this hour talking about Ukraine specifically at a very specific special session dedicated to that topic they are expected to emerge with a significant new sanctions against Russia including from the United States sanctioning 300 individuals, entities really trying to close some loopholes in the existing sanctions regime that had allowed Russian entities to evade those punishments going forward. The hope, really, is to clamp down on the Kremlin's war machine. You also heard from the United Kingdom earlier today banning imports of Russian diamonds. That had been sort of one of the remaining untapped industries in Russia that Western sanctions hadn't been applied to yet. So certainly, Ukraine really looming very large over these talks.

The U.K. and the Netherlands have indicated they're looking to form an international coalition to procure the jets and train Ukrainian pilots. So, fears of violence did not materialize on Thursday as Israelis marked one of the most contentious anniversaries on their calendar. Known as Jerusalem Day, it commemorates Israel's seizure of East Jerusalem in the 1967 war. Palestinians mostly stayed out of sight as Israeli flags paraded through the mostly Muslim Old City, sometimes accompanied by harsh anti-Arab rhetoric. CNN's Hadas Gold has our report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) HADAS GOLD, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): By the thousands they came, nearly all in white, waving Israeli flags. For these marchers, this is a celebration of when Israel took control of East Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 war, giving Jews access to their holy sites in the Old City. For Palestinians, it marks the beginning of the occupation of East Jerusalem. But in recent years, the march has also become more like a right-wing nationalist rally and a pretext for violence between Jewish Israelis and Palestinians, who make up most of the population in this part of the city. While most marchers were peaceful, some groups sing songs about getting revenge on Palestinians, erasing their names. Others going even further, chanting Mayor Village Burn. They were emboldened by the presence of right-wing government ministers, like National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Vir, who marched alongside them through the Old City and to the Western Wall. Thousands of police showed how tense the situation was even before the marchers started. Using heavy-handed tactics to clear the route, including our Senior CNN Correspondent Ben Wedeman. The marchers too targeted the press, throwing rocks, bottles and cans at our position, forcing reporters to cower for cover. But Jerusalem Day has seen much more serious violence than this. It was in 2021 as the thousands of Israelis made their way to the Old City that the Palestinian militant group Hamas fired rockets toward Jerusalem, setting off an 11-day war. Hamas and Islamic Jihad threatened the march again if any of their unnamed red lines were crossed. But this year, most of the drama stayed on the ground in clashes and scuffles and not rockets in the sky. Hadas Gold, CNN, Jerusalem. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
