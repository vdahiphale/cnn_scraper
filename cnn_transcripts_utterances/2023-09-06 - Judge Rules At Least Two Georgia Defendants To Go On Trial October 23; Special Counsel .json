Stand by for all the big takeaways from the first televised hearing in the election subversion case and the critical decisions expected in the coming days.Also tonight, breaking news, a new court filing reveals that the special counsel investigating Hunter Biden intends to indict the president's son on at least one gun charge within a matter of weeks. And a Pennsylvania prison just released video showing a fugitive killer's brazen escape climbing up a wall before he fled from the roof. We're tracking the week-long manhunt for a very dangerous murderer. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM. We begin with an early and important new ruling by the judge presiding over the Georgia election subversion case, the hearing playing out on live television and offering clues, important clues about critical decisions ahead, including when Donald Trump might stand trial. We have a team of legal and political experts ready to break it all down for us. First, let's go to CNN's Senior Legal Affairs Correspondent Paula Reid.

A new court filing revealing a Mar-a-Lago I.T. worker has now struck a deal with federal prosecutors in the Trump classified documents investigation and has now agreed to testify.Let's go back to CNN's Paula Reid. Paula, what more can you tell us about this agreement to flip on Trump? It's pretty significant. REID:  The special counsel has secured really this key cooperating witness. Yuscil Taveras oversees surveillance footage as part of his work as an I.T. professional at Mar-a-Lago. And we know surveillance. Footage is at the heart of this case, allegations that there were attempts to destroy or even conceal the surveillance footage at key points in the course of this investigation. Now, we've learned that Mr. Taveras, he came to this conclusion that he was going to testify in the case and cooperate after being threatened with prosecution. And that's notable because Trump's co- defendant, Walt Nauta, also faced that same threat, but he did not flip. So, the fact that prosecutors have secured this witness is a significant victory for them. One thing that could complicate this, though, is that both Walt Nauta and Yuscil Taveras were represented for a time by the same attorney, Stan Woodward, who is paid by a Trump-aligned PAC. Now, before he flipped, Mr. Taveras changed attorneys, and that's when this deal was offered and made. But this could complicate a potential trial. This is something that right now the judge wants to hear briefings from both sides about whether this is a conflict of interest, because, possibly, Stan Woodward could have to cross-examine his own client at some point.",

And I think you're going to see this replicate itself over and over and over again. And it really shows to the political weight of these legal processes that are playing out and how they continue to swallow up Donald Trump. I mean, he's only, by my math, I think he's averaging less than one campaign event a week right now, and there's no way to win a presidency in that type of campaign activity.

And one of the things is that you say that you're not addicted to drugs. Of course, we know that from Hunter Biden's own statements, from a book that he wrote, from interviews he's given that he was struggling with drug abuse at the time that he bought this firearm. We just got a response from Hunter Biden's attorney, and he says that they believe that the diversion agreement, this was an agreement that they had made with prosecutors under which this charge would go away, they believe that this remains valid and prevents any additional charges from being filed against Mr. Biden.

He had probably been down that hallway a number of times, had scoped out the roof, determined that he could survive pushing through the razor wire. Again, he's only five feet tall, 120 pounds. He's a tiny guy. And he may have even heard about the escape that happened virtually the same way just a month or two ago. So, his brain was working from the moment he walked into that facility. He planned to get out. And now he is out and it's been almost a week. He's evaded capture even though we've seen him six times. So, don't underestimate how clever and conniving he is and also, again, how determined and desperate. I think if they close in on him, he won't go down without a fight. They have to consider that he could take a hostage, that he may have knives or weapons. He may have stolen from some of these burglaries he's suspected in. He is incredibly dangerous.
