I'm Fredricka Whitfield. We begin this hour with the overseas kidnapping of an American nurse and her child. A Christian ministry group says Alix Dorsainvil was abducted Thursday morning while serving in their community near the capital of Haiti. Dorsainvil is married to the director of the humanitarian aid group. I want to bring in now CNN national correspondent Athena Jones for the latest on this. So, Athena, what are officials saying about this alleged abduction?",

      "sentences": "Hi, Fredricka. Well, we know that U.S. authorities are working with their Haitian counterparts and U.S. inter-government agencies to try to resolve this crisis. But we don't know or it's unclear right now who is responsible for this kidnapping, and whether they've made any demands, whether for ransom or anything else.We do have a statement from El Roi Haiti, that is the Christian humanitarian organization that Alix Dorsainvil, originally from New Hampshire, was working for. Here's what they said. They say, \"Alix is a deeply compassionate and loving person who considers Haiti her home and the Haitian her friends and family. Alix has worked tirelessly as our school and community nurse to bring relief to those who are suffering as she loves and serves the people of Haiti in the name of Jesus.\" And El Roi, that organization, says that their highest priority of course is to secure the safe return of Alix and her child. And so they want to limit the amount of information they provided. We do know that this was said to have occurred on Thursday morning at the campus of El Roi Haiti which is near the capital of Port-au-Prince. Now the State Department has also put out a statement saying, \"The U.S. Department of State and our embassies and consulates abroad have no higher priority than the safety and security of U.S. citizens overseas.\" But, Fredricka, the context of all of this is so important. This kidnapping comes amid growing concerns among U.S. officials and leaders all around the world about the worsening violence in Haiti. You'll remember it was just a couple of years ago that gangs assassinated President Jovenel Moise and there's been a power vacuum left, and so gangs have been taking over swaths of the country. The State Department has warned Americans not to travel to Haiti due to the kidnapping, the crime, the civil unrest, and the poor health care infrastructure. And just last week the State Department ordered family members and non-emergency personnel at the embassy there to leave the country immediately because of this deteriorating security situation. So this is not uncommon. Kidnappings are incredibly common in Haiti and we know that the world is watching. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on a recent visit to Haiti that Haitians are trapped living in a nightmare. And so they are -- the U.N. is backing the putting together a multinational force to try to bring security back to Haiti and get control from those gangs. But as of right now, all we know is that this young woman and her child have been kidnapped. We're waiting to hear more from authorities -- Fredricka.",

Part of the glass towers of Russia's elite. Some of that glass shattered. As possibly is the preconception they had over the past months that the war was something different, not necessarily affecting the sophisticated lives in the capital.We've seen those slowly bids by Ukraine who did not take direct responsibility for this. More opaque statements about how Russia's tranquil backwaters were no longer so calm. Ukraine trying to impact Russian psychology by hitting areas like this. Even the Kremlin, too, subject of a drone strike. Russia saying nobody injured in this but again it is simply a taste of what Ukrainians have been experiencing over the past nearly 18 months now. Nightly strikes often on parts of civilian in Ukraine. In Sumy, in northern Ukraine, 20 injured, two killed from Russian barrages at the same time as Moscow was being hit, and even here in Zaporizhzhia city, two dead in the last 24 hours and two injured from yet more attacks by Russia. Russia targeting civilian areas it seems repeatedly day after day. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy saying how these strikes on Moscow were a sign that the war was running to Russian territory but also to touting gains by Ukraine in the east near Bakhmut and also a slower, steadier, less publicly touted progress in the south near where I am here. This counteroffensive by Ukraine moving forward, it seems, slowly. They targeted part of Russia's railway supply line up from Crimea into Zaporizhzhia in the last 24 hours as well. That's potentially key for Russia's ability to defend the frontlines it's urgently holding on to at the moment despite these Ukrainian advances. But, still, Moscow being hit in such a way repeatedly now it seems will have an impact on those in Russia. We're told by the Kremlin that this could be a matter of days, this war, and now we're in its second year. Nick Paton Walsh, CNN, Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

But inside the courtroom, as we saw first in the Jean Carroll case and we're likely to see in these other cases, what matters are facts and statements of fact. And this kind of rhetoric, you know, he can say it as much as he wants in Iowa.

I think one thing we know -- obviously we are still far away from anyone voting, but I think it is already pretty apparent that the leading challengers to Donald Trump have neither the skill nor the will to take him down through their own actions. The one question is whether there is a camel's back dynamic among Republican voters, whether a critical mass of them will ultimately reach the conclusion that all of this is too much baggage to carry into a general election and that they have to find someone else.So far, as we were just saying, there really is no indication of that, but trials haven't started.

The idea that he is taking tens of millions of dollars from Republican base donors and using them on his own legal defense rather than their broader goal of trying to elect a Republican president, you know, evict Joe Biden from the White House, that would seem to be pretty much of a hanging curveball for anyone else running against him.But other than Will Hurd, who is, you know, in the asterisk level of support, we do not see any of the other Republican rivals mention that on Friday night in Des Moines. And again, it goes to the question, are they willing to directly confront someone who is 35 points ahead of them or are they simply hoping that something takes him down, and they will be there to pick up the pieces?

So, the gap in alcohol-related deaths among men versus women is narrowing.And this doesn't appear to be solely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Because when researchers eliminated the year 2020 from their data, they still had similar findings. And the researchers are now calling for more study into what could be driving these deaths. It could be related to how some people turn to alcohol to cope with stress or other factors. But these findings are really a reminder that if you choose to drink, watch how much. The CDC recommends limiting yourself to no more than two drinks a day for men and no more than one drink a day for women.
