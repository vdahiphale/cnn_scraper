Will they be able to defeat Hamas as they say they want to or will then become a mission to far because the prime minister is under huge amount of international political pressure and not least, from the United States, for a humanitarian pause. And one of the interesting things, listening to the prime minister speaking on television this evening, he said, on the diplomatic front, we are working 24 hours to keep the options open for the IDF to complete their mission. So it's really indicating there that he is facing a lot of pressure on how long the IDF can keep fighting for. And one of the principal reasons is the humanitarian situation for the people in Gaza, the high civilian death toll inside of Gaza. So can the IDF actually deliver a scenario whereby they can take significant enough control to be there for in the security control and going forward in the future? And again, one of the indicators that points to us is that eventuality is still some ways off. Just this evening, we've seen four different salvos of rockets take out from here in the past couple of hours. Three salvos going towards the center of Israel, another salvo going a little bit to the south of us here. It's indicative of the fact that Hamas is still able to fire its rockets from northern Gaza, despite the fact the IDF is in there fighting in the heart of Gaza, as officials say, but it would be a retrograde step for Israel to have to go back to being a security guarantor in Gaza. This was a thing that they relinquished back in 2005, because it was problematic. And that's only the security implications. What about their provisions of welfare and all the other things that they are essentially indicating would be in a vacuous state if Hamas was gone? With many open questions there, that statement leaves. And the answers really aren't clear at the moment.",

You know, one of them told me, look, the IDF is not taking huge casualties, in part, because Hamas isn't engaging them in a fight. They're still saying underground and hoping that they can hold out, because they would be overwhelmed if they were above -- fighting above ground. And another journalist who was witnessing the IDF preparing some of the munitions for the fighter jets that are protecting the troops on the ground, they've got the new munitions from the United States, he said, and that they were using these less explosive, but more precision missiles to sort of wonk a missile shield in -- a protective shield ahead of the IDF forces, ahead of the Israeli troops, so that they were protected on the ground, but also these lower explosive munitions, not only designed to protect the troops but, therefore also, to protect the civilians as well. So it's a really complex picture and we don't have an accurate assessment of is Hamas trying to avoid getting into big combat confrontation with the IDF.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Families are burying their dead in mass, with little time to mourn. \"Gaza is not a humanitarian crisis, but a crisis of humanity,\" the UN chief says. A month of war has devastated the strip. Israeli airstrikes have hit homes, schools, refugee camps, and ambulances. And the IDF has claimed all their legitimate Hamas targets. A siege has cut off food, fuel, water, and basic supplies, and there are no safe places. The UN says 70% of the strip's population forced out of their homes and desperate for refuge. The health care system is decimated. More than 60% of Gaza's hospitals and medical centers are out of service, according to the Palestinian authority. And the death toll, the UN says, defies humanity. Israeli attacks have killed over 10,000 Palestinians since October 7th, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah, drawing from sources in the Hamas-controlled enclave. Based on the ministry's figures, at least one child is being killed every 10 minutes, CNN calculations suggest, Gaza \"becoming a graveyard for children,\" the UN chief says. The bloody conflict is spurring anger and action in capitals from Berlin, to Ankara, to London, and beyond. The world is turning against Israel's war in Gaza, the global outcry getting louder. But the US, so far, unable to stem the bloodshed. After whirlwind Middle East tour, Secretary of State Antony Blinken failed to secure any pause to the fighting. And Prime Minister Netanyahu remains defiant. The IDF says it's dropping hundreds of bombs a day on Hamas targets as Israeli ground forces push deeper into the territory with a stated aim of wiping out the group. The UN describes Israel's assault as collective punishment. And the youngest are paying the highest price.",

You know, disproportionate attacks, that's no schools and refuges, nohospitals, no health centers, proportionality. I mean, we've seen dozens, Julia, dozens of schools and health centers attacked. People are seeking refuge in them. They're already -- you've already talked to doctors who have got children on the floor that they can't attend to and they're attending to them when they get there with a torchlight rather than power, no anesthetic. And we've seen at least 60% of all schools in the Gaza -- all schools -- have been, in some way, damaged. And, of course, they're not schools, they're refuges, and they're attacked. So, at some, point the legal experts will argue this. But if I talk to my colleagues on the ground and I hear stories of their children who are doing -- four-year-olds doing self-harm because they're so traumatized or parents looking under rubble for children, then I think the language of international law is very clear. And I think there have been enough experts around the world to speak to that. UNICEF, of course, is a frontline actor. We remain neutral in trying to be wary whatever we can, but we're going beyond a point where we can argue on language. I think the images are so very, very clear. And the images are that we are seeing up to 100 children killed every single day. And that's unprecedented. And that's not going to help anyone find a place of peace or safety going forward. That -- Julia, that just has to stop. And we will, as UNICEF, keep using every corridor power and meanwhile, keep trying to get trucks through so doctors have medicines and children have water.",

All sorts of supplies, not just humanitarian, but allsorts of supplies that will go into Gaza on a daily basis, commercial and others, was 500 trucks a day. The ask from the UN secretary general from the start has been 100, so that would be 20%. We're a fraction of that. So I would say a single-digit percentage is going in that needs to go in. That includes, right now, Julia, no fuel. This is not fuel for vehicles. This is fuel so hospitals don't go dark. This is fuel so incubators with babies don't stop, which will happen. We have these very real risk right now of seeing a staggered to believe this much I say it, but it's a fact. We may see deaths exponentially rise because we will see water outbreaks, 5% of water capacity to people in a place like this. They're not getting medicines. They're not getting surgical equipment. So, it's hard as it is to imagine, if we don't get a ceasefire, if we don't get the right amount of aid in, and it's a trickle -- everyone has said that. If UNICEF and our partners aren't able to do that, we can see an exponential rise of 4,200 children already killed and all the trauma and grief of their parents, this is the beginning. That is a terrifying thought. It's an utterly, of course, unacceptable thought in 2023 to have. But at the moment .",

So if we go back six or seven years to the last major conflict, the same Ministry of Health, the same one in Gaza, noted around 2,200 children have been killed. They do that real-time. We go in with a delayed verification. It's much more thorough. It's called triangular verification. It takes much more time. Our numbers were within a couple of percent of that. Almost identical. We don't have that concern based on past history and so forth. So then you look at these numbers, 2,000, 3,000, 400. I have the unfortunate advantage here is that I've seen what shrapnel does to children. I've seen it's meant to rip through steel. I've seen a five-year-old girl in a place like Ukraine who is riddled with that and who's, you know, trying to hang on. I've seen those mothers leave hospitals without their children. So I very much, both, A, have faith in those reported numbers, but B, I know the boys and girls and the moms and dads behind them.

Antonio Costa, who's been prime minister since 2015, said he was surprised by the criminal probe but will cooperate with authorities. The probe centers around multiple ventures requiring government authorization, including concessions for lithium minds, a hydrogen plant and a data center. Five people, so far, have been arrested, including Costa's chief of staff. One of his ministers has been named, too, as a formal suspect. Joao Povoa Marinheiro  joins us now from our sister network, CNN Portugal, in Lisbon. Joao, great to have you with us. Can you hear us? OK, good. We've got you.

We're talking about very big contracts. And basically what happened is that the prime minister's name and office has been inclined to this investigation. So dozens of searches have been conducted throughout the country. They've affected very close names to the prime minister's office, including his chief of staff and also a personal friend. They've been arrested. What we don't know right now is the specific charges against Antonio Costa because the only information we have available is this note from the attorneys, the attorney general's office, that basically suggests that the prime minister's name and his authority have been listed on a wiretap and that he may have facilitated some access to some of the contracts we are talking about right now. But the thing is, since this is a process that delivers a lot of political pressure and has led to the resignation of the prime minister, obviously the socialist party, the prime minister's party, want quick answers. And so they are asking for a swift investigation to clear out what's going on. We have to also have to take a note about the context right now. The prime minister's government has been under a lot of pressure, especially the public services, for the management of the public services. But for this to lead to his resignation, it's obviously related to something that is serious, although Antonio Costa wasn't that aware that this investigation was being conducted. So we don't know the timing of the investigation. But since the political heat is really elevated right now, probably things are going to be investigated really quickly.",

If they're talking about an indefinite period of time, to many inside of Israel and around the region, this sounds a little like what Israel did in southern Lebanon in the 1980s. Once you get into a war like this without having a clear end state in mind, it could end up being quite a quagmire and quite costly. So I think it's important, the advice that the United States and others are trying to give to Israel, to how it conducts its campaign will actually shape what things will look like in the post conflict period. It's clear that there are threats that are still imminent for Israel. But not having a plan, I think, is a dangerous scenario.",

But you have to argue too that surely they would be reluctant to be involved in any kind of peacekeeping operation, if Israel still considers itself responsible for security and is trying to carry out sporadic operations at that time.

No other outside power, not the European Unionpowers, not China, not Russia has the network of relationships that the United States has. That network was on full display when secretary of state Antony Blinken visited the region this past weekend. So to avoid that, I think you actually need to see more leadership and crafting; what does this all look like? In the long run, to me, a two state solution is the most likely thing. I'd add to the variables that you noted, the simple fact of the matter is that the Palestinian Authority and its leader, Mahmoud Abbas, also told Secretary Blinken that we are not going to go in there on the back of the tanks of the Israelis. Right? So this is a delicate balancing act between America's stated objective of supporting Israel's right of self-defense and eliminating deaths from Hamas versus what comes next in making sure that this campaign actually carves a pathway toward something that's sustainable.
