      "sentences": "Good morning or good evening, depending on where you're watching. I'm Rahel Solomon live in New York.Cohen in court, more cross-examination of Donald Trump's former fixer. We will have the latest for the hush money trial. Rolling out the red carpet, Russia's President Vladimir Putin and China's leader Xi Jinping get together in a show of strength in Beijing. And show me the money, a closer look at the state of the U.S. consumer as the Dow Jones crosses the key 40,000 milestone. It has finally happened. A lot to get to. But, let's start in Lower Manhattan where the gloves are off and sparks are sure to fly in the courtroom, as Donald Trump's lead attorney resumes cross-examining Michael Cohen. We are in the crucial homestretch of this historic trial. Now, Cohen, of course, is the prosecution's star witness. He is also the last one they plan to call. The defense is trying to paint Cohen as a bitter liar, bent on getting revenge against his former boss. Now, so far, he has kept his cool on the stand. But, Todd Blanche, the lead defense attorney, will certainly try to test Cohen today, and we can expect a bare knuckled cross-examination. Let's bring in CNN Justice Correspondent Jessica Schneider, who has been tracking all of the developments inside of the courtroom for us. So, Jessica, Cohen has been on the stand, it seems, like about an hour now. Take us inside of the courtroom. What's happened so far?",

      "sentences": "Yeah. There were a lot of battles with objections up until just about 10 a.m. Rahel. So, you're right. Starting at 10 a.m., Michael Cohen began taking questions again. Trump's defense team, they are really hammering Cohen about his past convictions, his past interactions with federal prosecutors and federal judges. They're reminding the jury that Cohen did plead guilty to several charges, including lying to Congress.But, in their latest batch of questioning, they're also letting the jury know, in their view, that Michael Cohen just didn't take full responsibility for committing various crimes, in particular, tax fraud. And this is likely what we're seeing from the defense, really trying to dispute this notion that Cohen is really a changed, a reformed man, and that the jury should believe him. So, in this line of questioning, we're seeing now the defense wants the jury to know that Michael Cohen, he might not be completely repentant about his past crimes that he has served prison time for. The defense is really stressing to the jury, in their mind, you can't believe what Michael Cohen says. It is notable, though, after several hours of cross-examination on Tuesday, about one hour today, the defense really has not brought up anything yet in relation to the damning testimony from Michael Cohen, where he said numerous times that Donald Trump knew about the hush money scheme, that Donald Trump was in on it every step of the way, including being knowledgeable about the repayment that was disguised as a legal retainer. And of course, that is the issue that is at the heart of this case. The defense really hasn't touched on it at all in the questioning so far in the cross. We'll see if they get to it at some point today. They've really just seemed to be relying solely on questioning Michael Cohen's credibility. But, Rahel, I think the question at this point is, will that go far enough with the jury to refute what we've heard in recent days, especially because the defense team has previously told the judge, they expect to wrap up this cross-examination by today? The court is only expected to go to 4 p.m. So, we could see, I mean, they could push it to next week, but their initial estimate was that they'd be wrapped with cross-exam by the end of the day.

And so, no one is going to say that on the stand. And you're not going to ask the question, because if the person says no, it really doesn't do anything. They're just denying what happened. And that actually Blanche encountered that -- not Blanche, Necheles encountered on a lot with Stormy Daniels, where she just kept hammering her and Daniels kept saying no, which is very ineffective.What you do on a defense is you're looking for small nuggets. You want to elicit an answer and admission, may not fit right into the flow at that moment. But, later, when you come back for your closing argument, you want to weave all that together and say, remember, they admitted this, they said this, and you put all that together.

That will be a hint that the prosecution doesn't think Blanche scored many points on cross, and they'll just use it to give some emphasis on Cohen's strong points.",

I want to listen to a little bit of what the President-elect had to say.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PETER PELLEGRINI, SLOVAK PRESIDENT-ELECT: It was a very personal discussion about how he feels and that I am very happy that he survived. I told him that we stand behind him and we think about him and we are sending him a lot of energy that he will handle this very difficult situation.

      "sentences": "Right. Economics, as we both know, is a big part of any storyline, and no exception here. If we look at these tariffs that were instituted by the United States toward China, first of all, I'm going to argue they're largely symbolic, because if we look at some of the items, including electrical vehicles, which is a big point of discussion, the number of electric vehicles that are actually being exported from China into the United States, it's a very small number. But, this is a way for the U.S. to send a message to China that this idea of flooding the market with cheap electronic and consumer goods that China is able to make because of support from the government, it's just not acceptable.But, it's not the United States is the only one that's making -- that's griping about this. It's Europe and other parts of the world. So, while on the surface this seems like a big deal, and it is, it's not necessarily going to be instituted or creating some kind of back and forth between the U.S. and China, some kind of trade war. It's an analyst from Citi weighed in. They also feel that this is not going to necessarily result in something where we're trying to publish -- China punish its country's -- American companies in China. By the way, Rahel, I think the real important trade relationship to watch is that between China and Russia, more than $200 billion in trade, US dollars is in this trade relationship. China is buying a lot of Russian energy and fuel, and Russia in part is buying a lot of consumer goods, phones and cars from China. So, that's the back and forth, which I think is probably very interesting to be watching in the months ahead, Rahel.",

I mean, this has been notably more tense in the past hour and a half plus that we've had today's cross-examination than when they first started off on Tuesday. It is interesting, though, the defense team has been harping on Michael Cohen's prior convictions. But, just minutes before the break, for the first time, Todd Blanche did wade into questions about the core of this case. He asked Michael Cohen about that home equity line of credit that Cohen drew from to make the $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels before Cohen was eventually paid back by Trump.So, it was very minor questioning, not a lot of meat to it. But, Blanche did ask Cohen about how he hid that home equity loan and the details of it from his family. The line of questioning, it seemed to be not only touching on the core of this case, but maybe casting some doubt on whether Cohen really did prioritize his family, as Cohen has previously testified that he does. He did say the real reason he pleaded guilty to those federal crimes were because of his family. A little bit of flimsy questioning. But, it is the first time that we're hearing questioning about the core of this case. Blanche also asked Cohen about deleting some text messages between him and his wife. So, maybe this is all part of the tactic to cast doubt on the truth of Cohen's testimony and make him look not as credible in front of the jury here. So, we've seen a bit of a ping pong in this cross-examination. Isn't doesn't seem to be a through line of questioning. The defense team really just seems to be throwing whatever they can at the wall, seeing what sticks, seeing what might resonate with the jury, Rahel. They've talked about everything from Michael Cohen's hatred of Donald Trump, how he was trying to profit off of Donald Trump, and then a lot most recently in the questioning about Cohen's prior convictions, and prior run-ins with the law. So, expect to hear more of that as we go through the afternoon. And as they went to break, the judge did remind the jurors to let him know if they're available to hear this case on Wednesday. The judge, rather than taking a usual dark day on next Wednesday, the judge wants to actually hear more of this case. He is trying to get this going.

Chinese leader Xi Jinping welcomed Putin on Thursday. He confirmed China's support for Russia, and said that Beijing would continue to be a good friend, a neighbor and partner. China is Russia's largest trading partner, and that has grown more important, as Western more sanctions against Russia continue.Joining us now with CNN political and national security analyst, David Sanger. David, good to have you. He is also the author of \"New Cold Wars: China's rise, Russia's invasion, and America's struggle to defend the West\". So, perfect person to talk to today. David, I want to ask, Putin and Xi had met dozens of time, dozens of times. For Putin, this is his 19th visit to China since Putin became President in 2000. How would you describe the nature of this relationship between Putin and Xi? DAVID SANGER, CNN POLITICAL &amp; NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Well, Rahel, I would call it an increasingly vital partnership for Putin, and an increasingly convenient one for Xi Jinping. It's not a full alliance, in the way that the United States has allies in NATO or with Japan or South Korea. But, it is central to their one common goal between President Xi and President Putin, which is to provide the world with an alternative to an American-led world order, run on American values. As you suggested, the two of them have met, in my count, 43, 44 times, something in that range. Just by comparison, President Biden as President has met Putin exactly once, and I doubt there'll be a second one, and a handful of times with Xi Jinping. And of course, he met him often when he was -- when President Biden was Vice President. The key part of this right now is that Russia has become increasingly dependent on trying to take the oil that it can no longer ship, and the gas that it can no longer ship to Europe. And the Chinese, while not providing arms, have been providing more and more technology that they can use in their weapons.",

The U.S. has put export controls on sending them the equipment to make their own semiconductors. And now, the President has issued what are essentially preemptive sanctions on electric vehicles and so forth. In other words, he is not waiting for the harm to come to the U.S. He is doing this ahead of time.Now, would this happen if it wasn't an election year? We can debate that. But, it's a very different things that say, we're not even going to let you get a toehold in the market. And that's what the President is doing here.

Coming up, a major milestone for the U.S. stock market.Here is a real time look at the Dow, making some history today, Dow crossing 40,000 and steadying there, up about three tenths of one percent, perhaps because of that inflation data we got yesterday, perhaps because of the indications of what this might mean from the Fed for rate cuts today.

      "sentences": "Well, Rahel, it's kind of fitting that this milestone has really been made possible by inflation, right, which has really just been the biggest force for the economy and for the market for the last several years. And it's the fact that yesterday's inflation report showed a cooling. Right? The annual rate of inflation started to tick lower, moving in the right direction, and that has been a big relief to investors on Wall Street. And so, this is a significant milestone. It's one that looked very unlikely just two years ago when a lot of people were freaking out about a potential recession brought on by high inflation. And if those recession fears, if those had actually come true, we'd be talking about Dow 30,000 or Dow 20,000.So, the fact that the market is up, you can see, up 113 points today, it was a big yesterday, does reflect some greater confidence that the Fed might just be able to pull this off. Right? Maybe they'll be able to get a soft landing where they can tame inflation without causing a recession. And of course, that would be great news for Wall Street and for Main Street. And it is worth pointing out that if you ask some market experts, they'll tell you they don't even really look at the Dow, right, because it's kind of a flawed, average. It's just 30 stocks. They're all large companies. And it's weighted by price instead of market value. But, listen, when you ask the average person on the street, if you ask them what the Dow is, they think stock market right away. And there -- it is home to 30 of the best known American brands out there. Right? I mean, JPMorgan, Apple, Amazon, McDonald's, Disney, all of them trade in the Dow. And it's not just the Dow hitting record highs. Right? The S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ are too. One other point here, Rahel, is when you talk about market milestones, there is often a debate over who this is good for, right, because it's true that affluent households do own most stocks. So, this does tend to be good news for more affluent households. But, it's also true that more than half of U.S. households own stocks, either directly or indirectly in their 401(k) and their pension funds. So, I do think that we can argue that this really is good news for most Americans. Rahel.",

      "sentences": "All right. Staying with the economy, and at a glance, new figures show that U.S. consumers could be reaching their breaking point and it would be easy to blame elevated inflation and the highest interest rates in decades. Government figures revealed that retail sales last month were unchanged compared to March. Economists at FactSet had predicted a rise of four tenths of a percent, according to FactSet. Now, those figures are adjusted for seasonal swings, but not inflation.But, here is the thing. There may be more to this story than that. Bank of America is betting on consumer spending to stay high and personal savings rates to, well, stay low. They say that baby boomers done with paying their mortgages and their kids' college tuitions, well, they're now spending their sizable (inaudible). Joining us now from New York is Aditya Bhave. He is a senior economist with Bank of America. Aditya, great to have you. The reason why I wanted to have this conversation is because there is so much talk about the health of the U.S. consumer, and for good reason. Consumer spending is two thirds of GDP. So, it really matters. But, I'm curious, is the consumer cracking, from your perspective? How would you describe the health of the U.S. consumer right now? ADITYA BHAVE, SR. ECONOMIST, BANK OF AMERICA: Good morning. Thank you for having me. So, we're actually quite optimistic on the U.S. consumer. The way I describe our outlook is a benign moderation. So, we don't expect spending growth to be as strong as last year, which was really very strong. But, at the same time, we think it holds up at around the two percent base, which is still pretty great for the upcoming quarters. As long as the labor market remains healthy, which is our expectation, we think consumer spending should hold up rather well.",

And then, wage growth. If you look at it cumulatively, in aggregate, since the start of the pandemic, you've seen the largest wage gains actually at the lower income side of the spectrum.So, while it is true that lower income households have disproportionately borne the burden of inflation for a variety of reasons, they spend more on necessities, food and energy that have seen the largest price increases. They're also more likely to rent than own. So, there is many reasons why they've borne this burden of inflation. But, a lot of that has been offset by wage growth and job growth that these households have also benefited from.",

But, I think one of the key ones is that a lot of debt got locked in at low interest rates before the Fed started hiking. Right? So, on the consumer side, the big story would be mortgages. The mortgage rate has gone up a lot, but a lot of households locked in very low mortgage rates, either by refinancing or by taking out mortgages, when rates -- when policy rates were close to zero.And then you have a similar phenomenon on the business side, where a lot of corporate debt has not yet been rolled over from the rates that were locked in before the Fed started hiking. So, it's really -- this is something that Chair Powell has said as well. It's not just how tight financial conditions are, but how long they remain tight. So, the longer policy rates remain elevated, the greater is the risk that that will have to be rolled over at higher rates. But, that hasn't happened to a great degree so far. Yeah.",
