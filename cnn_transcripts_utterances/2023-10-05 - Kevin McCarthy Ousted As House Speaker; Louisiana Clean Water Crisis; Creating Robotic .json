The motion to vacate was filed by representative Matt Gaetz, who along with seven other GOP members voted to oust the Speaker, with Democrats votes, the motion passed 216 to 210. McCarthy`s speakership was the third shortest in history and was plagued with GOP infighting over spending cuts, border security and providing aid to Ukraine. Now, the race is on for House Republicans to elect a new speaker as another possible government shutdown is 44 days away. Several names have emerged as possible contenders for speaker, including House Majority Leader, Steve Scalise. REP. MARIA SALAZAR, (R) FLORIDA: No one really knows who has the votes. So now we`re going to go through that exercise right now and see who has our - - our support.",

The Mississippi River ends where it starts flowing into the Gulf of Mexico. And that is in Louisiana where we`re headed next. CNN`s Chief Climate Correspondent Bill Weir is on the ground in Louisiana, where millions of residents are facing a possible clean water crisis as salt water from the Gulf of Mexico is creeping up the river threatening to contaminate their fresh water supply. We told you about this a bit earlier. Now, a severe summer drought that lowered the Mississippi river`s water levels is to blame for this. Let`s take a look at the infrastructure and possible solutions for this issue along the fourth longest river in the world. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

So theheavier salt water is running downhill towards new Orleans in the shape of a wedge with the toe, about 15 miles in front of the kind of inundation that could threaten the health of the vulnerable and destroy everything from lead pipes to appliances. So the Army Corps of Engineers is urgently racing against time and salt with a couple different tools. This is the first of what will be many barges that can bring about a half million gallons of freshwater at a time downstream. They use it to dilute the brackish stuff as it goes into a small water plant here in Plaquemines Parish. The Corps says they can move 36 million gallons a day. But even that wouldn`t be enough to save the New Orleans water supply. So they`re already talking about maybe building pipelines to prop up that water system. In the meantime, the Corps is also building a big sill, like an underwater speed bump, to try to slow the wedge as it moves inland. But these are all temporary fixes. And the leader of this parish says, if this is the new normal, that means parts of Louisiana will need the same kind of desalination that they use in Israel and other desert communities.",
