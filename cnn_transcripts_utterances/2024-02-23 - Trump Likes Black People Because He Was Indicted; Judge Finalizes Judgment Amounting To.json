Do you really think that people like you because you were indicted because there is some suggestion that's being made here that people see themselves in you? He's just like me. I too have been indicted.That discrimination and all that accompanies it can be reduced to what your experience has been. I guess stereotypes might be the new platform here. Forget a family man, forget a businessman, forget actual policies you might hold and want to put out into the universe. No, you must like me because you too have had a run in with the law. Why isn't that the pitch for all voters, right? He has said that he is the outsider, the consummate outsider outside the establishment. Why is it that only appeals maybe or that's why black voters like you? You cannot make this up, you realize. It's coming from a political frontrunner who's hoping to get more votes, not alienate voters. It tells you exactly what is wrong with where we are today. Earlier today, President Joe Biden's campaign made this statement calling Trump, well, the poster, the proud poster boy for modern racism. Now, I'm going to let you decide whether he is in fact as advertised. That's up to you to make that conclusion or not. But what he is selling, he hopes black voters are buying. That they are a monolith, that they too face indictments, that they think of discrimination only as it relates to the cases perhaps against him. And that's enough for them. And that is his final pitch in the wee small hours of the morning to voters, at least hours before the polls open in South Carolina. To which you have to say, what the Friday is this? I want to bring in Nikki Haley's campaign manager, Betsy Ankeny. We've got a lot to get to, but first I want to talk about obviously your candidate, Nikki Haley, and who you support and of course the trajectory of her potential success in South Carolina. But I have to get your reaction to this suggestion that Trump made just moments ago at a rally, by the way, a rally where black people and many were in the audience that they liked him because he was indicted and that he is the poster child of discrimination as a result. What is your response to that? BETSY ANKNEY, CAMPAIGN MANAGER, NIKKI HALEY'S 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN: Well, first, thank you for having me. And I think what you just showed is exactly why 70 percent of Americans do not want a Trump-Biden rematch. This is just more of the same chaos, more of the same drama, more of the same baggage. And it's exactly why 70 percent of Americans want something different and want something new. And that's what Nikki Haley has to offer. So we are running through the tape here in South Carolina. Nikki is taking her message to every corner of the state. And I think what you just showed shows the fact that there's just more chaos and more of the same with both Trump and Biden.",

The former governor first appeared to back it, saying that she believes frozen embryos are children. But then there was backlash, of course. And then it seemed that she qualified her remarks. And this is what she told Jake Tapper just yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think that the court was doing it based on the law, and I think Alabama needs to go back and look at the law. This is incredibly personal to me because I had both of my children with fertility. We don't want them to stop doing IVF treatments. We don't want them to stop doing artificial insemination. We want to make sure that people are able to have these blessings. But I think this is, again, needs to be decided on the people in every state. I personally believe an embryo is a baby.

Choice for GOP nominee nationally among the potential GOP electorate. Look at this. This is even worse polling for Nikki Haley than what she sees in South Carolina. Donald Trump up. Now, I'm not exactly a math genius here, but this looks like 63 points to me, according to Quinnipiac. How about this? I guess a slightly closer margin. 58 points, according to Marquette University Law School poll.

I, of course, I wandered over to him and I said, Mr. Poitier, you know, do you have any advice for me? You know, young knucklehead that I was.And he said he looked at me, kind of looked down because he was so tall. He looked down. He said, irony, and I understood what he meant. Certainly this film, \"American Fiction\" is, yeah, laced with irony, not only in the way we tell the story, but in the -- in the character of the story itself. And it's -- it's been really it's been really, you know, we've all been really pleased with the way audiences have received it. And it's because of those ironic tones, because these are, you know, complex issues that we deal with in the film. But they're also incredibly relevant right now. We're having conversations about race and representation and inclusion, conversations that are at the very forefront of the national dialogue right now, but conversations that we don't necessarily have well. What we're able to do in this film is have these conversations and at the same time have a laugh while doing it. And I think that provides kind of an open window for people across backgrounds who want to engage, but are fearful at times or traumatized at times. But we allow at least for the two hours that this film is running for people to come in and, you know, wrestle with these difficult things and have a and have a good time while doing it. So it's a nice recipe.",

Yeah, but I, you know, I -- I'm glad you say that because while our film focuses -- focuses on the publishing world and the film world to some extent, it really is a story about representation across the board. Maybe a personal inroad for me into this story in terms of the importance of representation, importance of dehumanizing of our stories is I have kids and I want my son to be seen for who he is.I want him to be to walk down the street and not be seen relative. And my daughter as well, relative to some caricature or some limiting portrait of who he or she might be in the media. I want them to be perceived as who they are. And so I think that the ways in which, you know, representation in the media affects that is deeply, deeply important. And it has been from the beginning of storytelling on film and in the theater in this country. Our film touches on a bit of that. And I hope, again, within the two hours that the film runs, that we elevate the conversation a little bit, that we shine some light, that that broadens the understanding of the humanity of -- of who we are as black folks, as who we are as Americans, ultimately. So I'm really, again, I'm pleased that the film is being received again. We're a small film. We, you know, the budget for our film was probably the catering budget for the last Batman movie that I did. We shot in 26 days. But we think it's a -- you know, it's a small film with big ideas. And it's really gratifying that audiences are responding to it in the way that they have. It's -- it's wonderful. COATES: That is wonderful. 26 days. That is unbelievable to think about. And, you know, I'm so glad that you are thinking about and using art as that safe, vicarious experience where we can better understand each other in this world. And I hope that's one of the ways that we get to wherever there is. I know that's very important to you, even outside of the art space, that, you know, as Americans, that perhaps things like equality, things like justice are not American fictions.",

The four-part docuseries provides a painfully candid depiction, it seems, of Williams' life today as she is struggling with health issues and perhaps alcohol abuse. It's executive produced by Williams herself. It includes on camera participation from her own family. Lifetime did decline to comment on the contents of the lawsuit. Now, for some perspective, let's bring in attorney Tamar Arminak, who, excuse me, Arminak, who represented Amanda Bynes and her parents in her conservatorship. Tamar, thank you so much for being here. Break down for us what sort of position Wendy Williams' guardian is in, in terms of the control. TAMAR ARMINAK, REPRESENTED AMANDA BYNES' PARENTS IN CONSERVATORSHIP: Well, when you're under a guardianship like Wendy is, Laura, you're essentially a minor under the law. So her guardian is essentially in the role of a parent, a parent for even a 10-year old child, controlling almost the most minute details of a person's life.",
