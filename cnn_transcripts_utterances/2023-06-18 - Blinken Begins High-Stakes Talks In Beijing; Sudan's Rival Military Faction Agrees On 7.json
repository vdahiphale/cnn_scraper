US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Qin Gang for more than five hours today. Blinken is now the first secretary of State to travel to China in five years. It's a meeting that is meant to steer relations between the two countries back on course after months of inflamed tensions. China's Foreign minister says that relations between China and the US are at the lowest they've been in decades. Despite that, however, he did decide to accept an invitation to visit Washington sometime in the near future. CNN national security correspondent, Kylie Atwood has more on what this visit could mean for the world's two largest economic superpowers. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Secretary of State, Antony Blinken wrapping up his first day of a two-day visit here in Beijing, his first trip to Beijing as secretary of State, the first Biden Cabinet official to visit the country.The meeting today lasted for more than five hours followed by a working dinner. We talked to US officials. The primary goal of this trip is to establish regular communications between the US and China, particularly military to military channels. Just in recent weeks, there were two incidents between the US and China in the South China Sea, in international airspace and in international waters due to aggressive Chinese military maneuvers. So of course, that is one of the issues that lays the backdrop of the tension between the two countries right now. Blinken also said that he is going to raise US concerns on a number of fronts with China; globally, of course, when it comes to the war in Ukraine, locally in the region here when it comes to Taiwan, and bilaterally, the issues between the US and China. Those three Americans who are wrongfully detained in the country, the issue of the opioid crisis back in the United States, because fentanyl, the inputs for fentanyl largely come from China. And so that is something that the secretary is saying that he is going to raise with his counterpart. Now, the US is also hoping that there are issues where the two countries can potentially work together. We have heard this from the Biden administration before on climate, on macroeconomic global stability, and for China's part, they had a rather aggressive tone leading into this meeting with the Foreign minister telling Secretary Blinken that he expects there to be respect, while he is here. He does not want the United States interfering in internal affairs in China. So we'll have to see if that aggressive tone translates into how these meetings occur over the course of the next day or so here in Beijing. And one more thing that US officials are looking ahead to is the potential for further meetings between US officials and Chinese officials. They want that to become more regular over the course of the next few months. Of course, in addition to the possibility of President Biden and President Xi sitting down on the sidelines of some meetings between world leaders in the coming months.

But you have this kind of core disagreement effectively, where China says that Taiwan, even though it doesn't rule it and never has, Communist China, it says that it is effectively Chinese territory, and that any contact that the US government has with self-ruling Taiwan is meddling in China's internal affairs. So that's a fundamental disagreement that both countries do not look at the same way.There are agreements that have been reached between Washington and Beijing in the past, the so-called One China Policy, where they kind of both agreed to say, okay, we're not going to call Taiwan an independent country, but it is very hard to see how both sides can come to a fresh re-understanding, if we can put it, of this status quo when you've got US government officials visiting Taiwan, and the Chinese government just hates it and will send fleets of warplanes flying towards Taiwan to show how much it disagrees with this. And we'll just have to see if something can kind of be hammered out, where this first round of talks in Beijing could lead to more rounds of discussions down the road. The military aspect is another big important part. It's just a couple of weeks of ago that the Chinese Defense minister refused to go beyond shaking hands with US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in Singapore. That's another area that we have to watch closely because those are the fields where the war planes and warships are coming so close to each other, that you could really have a terrible accident that could lead to something worse.",

Twenty years ago, the region descended into genocide. The same RSF leadership in place as their men were killed, occupied, and raped. Now, once again women's bodies are part of the field of war. This video is too disturbing to broadcast in full, but it goes on to show a girl, believed to be just 15 years old, being raped. You see here a man in light-colored fatigues matching those worn by the RSF. We've paused the video just before the camera pans to show another soldier wearing the same uniform forcing himself on to the prone girl. CNN verified and geolocated the area where this happened. We're not revealing the exact location in Khartoum to protect our sources and the young girl. This is not an isolated incident. We received and reviewed dozens of cases where women say they were raped by RSF soldiers. Identifying them by their light-colored fatigues and the insignia on their right soldiers. So who is complicit in this pain? (YEVGENY PRIGOZHIN speaking in foreign language.) ELBAGIR (voice over): The RSF's key ally, the notorious Russian mercenary group, Wagner has been sustaining their fight and providing the impetus to slaughter innocent people by supplying arms. We're going to show you. This is an Ilyushin-76 cargo plane operated by Wagner sitting at a Libyan airbase. A previous CNN investigation exposed how this Russian cargo plane was providing the RSF with deadly arms from a Russian naval base in Latakia, Syria via Wagner controlled bases in Libya. This pass then starts just days before the war begins in Sudan. Libya, Syria, and back and it picks up pace. What's interesting here is the new focus on the city where it goes next. Bangui, the capital of the Central African Republic. After our exposure of the Libya route, a route directly from the Central African Republican into Darfur became crucial for the RSF. Eyewitnesses at key transit points and intelligence active in the region told CNN, arms and supplies from this Ilyushin transported over land using the truck captured here and others like it. First to a Wagner base in Birao and then into South Darfur to an RSF base in Um Dafuq. Warner putting their thumb on the scales here to secure access to Sudan's resources through Darfur, creating chaos and terror, helping tip the balance of power in their war in the Ukraine whatever the cost.

And a lot of that is lawns that nobody walks on, that's sort of a rule of thumb is if the only people who walk across your lawn is maybe the person who owns it and the mail carrier, then maybe you need to rethink, as beautiful as it can look, something else to do that is a lot less water intensive. So that's one thing that Californians can do, just generally to help us all adapt to a warming climate.The other thing we're doing in California, which is -- and this is an outcome of this existing drought, which is all that lawn landscape in commercial and industrial parks, you know, you see it everywhere, we call it really just strictly ornamental lawn, all of that needs to come out so that we can make sure that we're putting water to the highest use. So Californians, if you're in the business sector or residential sector, we can all start working to adapt to that. The second biggest thing that residents can do is make sure you fix your leaks. Sometimes we don't know and especially in this automated age, when your water comes on and off, if you're watering the landscape, or even in your home and you really don't notice it unless you're really paying attention to your water bill. And so most water districts have services that can come out if you see something unusual, a spike in your use, that typically means something is leaking, you can't always see it and that is really important to get fixed.",

So the reasons why it has to do with not just access, you know, I'm here in Washington, DC and we're only number two to the state of Massachusetts in terms of coverage by insurance.

It certainly played a key role in the downfall of President Mubarak.But one problem with social media that really did become apparent, you know, notably, during the 2016 presidential election was platform's ability to quickly spread fake news, false information, disinformation, misinformation. Now this 2010 series talks about how algorithms were designed to specifically spread many kinds of false posts. So why did they do that?",

This all goes back to the platform's advertising based business models. They wanted to be able to tell the companies advertising with them, hey, people are spending a lot of time here and the way to get people to spend time there was to elevate content that they found really interesting, really exciting. Of course, that means that sensationalistic content, got a big leg up and fake news often tended to be quite sensationalistic.",

I think people understand now just what I was saying about how the most engaging content is rarely going to be the most wholesome or useful content.To some extent, we've improved the situation, platforms, but factchecks on, they have far more developed content moderation apparatuses than they had before. But I would say there is a long way to go, and the problem, of course, is that technology keeps evolving. Right now, people are extremely worried about AI large language models generating disinformation at a scale we've never seen before and can platforms keep up? They're worried about deepfakes. So we probably would be better at rooting out the Internet Research Agency of Russia's 2016 operations these days, but something different, something new, I don't know.",
