It's great to be with you today.It's Tuesday, April 2nd, 12 p.m. in Abu Dhabi and 10 a.m. in Gaza, where the World Central Kitchen says at least seven of its workers have been killed in an Israeli military strike. The organization says a convoy was hit, leaving a warehouse where the team had unloaded more than 100 tons of humanitarian food aid. World Central Kitchen's CEO calls it unforgivable. Australia's prime minister identified one of the victims as Australian aid worker Zomi Frankcom. He said his government is seeking accountability. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We have also heard from Hamas that says that this is more evidence that Israel is targeting innocent civilians and trying to terrorize aid workers into not doing their work on the ground. And remember, World Central Kitchen had the blessing of the Israelis to bring in aid by sea. They built this temporary jetty off the coast of Gaza in order to get the aid onto the land. They had sent their second shipment just on Saturday. It either had arrived, and that's what they were unloading, or if it hadn't arrived, then it won't. Because the World Central Kitchen says that it is pausing its operations in the region at the moment, and it will make decisions about the future of its work in the region very soon. And again, Eleni, this is not the first time either. You have UNRWA, another huge essential aid group, working in Gaza. They say that 165 of their workers have died since the war began.",

The bond was originally $464 million, but a court lowered it last month. Posting bond means that New York's attorney general cannot try to seize Trump properties to cover the judgment, at least until the state appeals court hears the case. Now, that is scheduled to happen in September. The judge in Trump's hush money trial has expanded the gag order against the former president. It will now prevent Trump from discussing the judge's family and the Manhattan district attorney's family. Over the weekend, Trump attacked the judge's daughter in social media posts. The judge says Trump's rhetoric could make those involved in the case afraid for their safety and the safety of their loved ones. Former federal prosecutor Jeffrey Toobin tells CNN that this is part of a Trump legal defense and political campaign. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
