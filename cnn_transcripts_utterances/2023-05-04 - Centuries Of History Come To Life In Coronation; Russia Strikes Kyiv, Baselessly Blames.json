Saturday morning, Charles III accompanied by Queen Camilla will make his way in a procession from Buckingham Palace to Westminster Abbey for a ceremony last carried out for his mother, Queen Elizabeth II back in June of 1953. Seventy years, in other words. For some at least, this is literally a once in a lifetime event. People are certainly treating it that way. They've been camping out along the procession route, some for days now wearing Union Jack's Royal regalia and other patriotic knickknacks, young and old, sleeping under tarps and tents on makeshift cots. And all around the city, everything from lanes to landmarks are decked in flags or lit up large for the occasion. Take a look at Big Ben there, 300 feet tall embodying centuries of history as it has never been seen before. Images of the national plants of England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and projected on it, and words dancing over it, including for until Queen Elizabeth died, that had not been heard since 1952, \"God save the King.\" Not far from there, Westminster Abbey security tight as it is all around this city where Saturday morning, the King and Queen will arrive in a coach built for the King's mother on the 60th anniversary of her coronation. There's certainly a lot to cover. That's a bit about the circumstances. We'll talk more about the pomp and ceremony and certainly the public relations of crowning a King.

Charles will be crowned with the St. Edward's crown, the very same one placed upon previous monarchs. Crown Jewels will feature including scepters, a golden orb, and various swords each with their own symbolism. He'll wear robes that have been passed down through the generations. The anointing, the most sacred spiritual part of the service will be hidden from view by a special screen, one of the only newly made pieces for the coronation, because Charles, who's always been known for his environmental campaigning has been keen to emphasize reuse. He'll be welcomed to the abbey first by a young chorister, to whom he'll say, \"I come not to be served, but to serve.\" Inclusivity is at the top of his agenda.

LAURA COATES, CNN ANCHOR AND SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST: And normally, you wouldn't really have hearsay statements, right, statements made outside of the courtroom admissible. This is an exception that's admitted here in a civil case, because it is essentially a statement against his interest. And more importantly, although this has been a Hollywood tape that's been out there since at least his first presidential campaign, it now gives even greater weight to that testimony, because now he is not the one testifying. He did not appear at trial, he does not have to appear at trial in a civil case, which is very surprising to many people. But because he did not do so, because he is yet to testify, and may not ever testify now that the defense has said he will not, it gives greater weight to what was said and so he's not going to counter it.

Those statements seem to contradict what his attorney is saying and there is an abundance of caution that is really demonstrated by judges to ensure that somebody who otherwise has a right to confront one's accuser, who has a right to testify in a case will have every opportunity to do so. Why? Because most are just are afraid of being appealed in a way that says the judge did not do enough to secure and protect the rights of any one accused, even in a civil context.

It's also that there was a whole lot of intervening circumstances where the, the actual government was saying we'd like these back, the Archives, we know that you have something, please return them and was able to actually delineate certain things that were there. So if there was a moment in time where documents were one, where they were not so supposed to be, they came after a subpoena and knowing that there was a subpoena active to try to retain and return these documents, documents removed, documents were put from one place to another in some effort to try to conceal documents or their existence or to keep them out of the rightful hands of the owner. Well, then that now thickens the plot here. And so any cooperating witness, although the identity we do not yet know, I don't want to get ahead of my skis. The fact that you have somebody who might have some insight as to what happened once there was actual notice given that documents were knowingly on that premises, and were not returned well, what happened in the interim?

But the circumstances from a legal standpoint -- and I'll defer to Joey Jackson on this -- is going to be whether this man intended to kill him or should have known his actions could have led to his death.

It's not only what a person is saying, it's what you believe and how they are actually acting.Was there any furtive gestures that he was making towards any passengers? Were the passengers led to believe that they were in immediate fear of any attack? Based upon the immediacy of that attack, did now, the person who subdued him, did that individual -- because you are allowed under the law to protect yourself or to protect others -- what did that person believe to be occurring at the time? Were those actions reasonable? And then when you get to the issue of the chokehold, Anderson, the issue is going to be, was that chokehold so sustained as to be disproportionate? And when he was in the chokehold, that is Mr. Neely, was he representing a threat of any kind at that point? So there's a lot to be parsed out, and I think there'll be a focus on the witnesses and what they specifically believed or felt. You know, you don't have to be attacking anyone to use physical force. The issue then becomes, was there an immediacy such that you felt that he was about to use the physical force? That will all be assessed by prosecutors and police.",
