The FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker told me that the door plug is a good design but only when it's properly executed. A big caveat there, the bolts that hold the door plug in place on the plane, they are key. There are four of them. If they're not installed, the door can shimmy out of its retaining grooves and shoot off with explosive force like we saw on January 5th.

This strike that the U.N. official is speaking about, we don't know how many casualties, but they are describing it as a mass casualty event. There have been a number of times before where U.N. safe shelters have been struck, and because there are a lot of displaced people crowded and crammed into these often ramshackle buildings, way more than would normally be present in these types of buildings the casualty tolls have been very high in the past, and it appears potentially that's what we are dealing with right now. According to one person in that U.N. camp he says that they can see tanks, Israeli tanks right outside of this building -- this shelter area, and that there are people around him to have shrapnel injuries, those nearby hospitals as well have been describing a situation where they have been under instructions to evacuate, but have not been able to evacuate because it's too dangerous. That there are hundreds of people in these hospitals who have infectious diseases, there are pregnant women, people there who just can't get to the hospital for the dialysis they need to get. So, this is an area that is right, if you will, at the focus of IDF activity at the moment. The IDF today saying they had encircled Khan Younis. The situation in this building, again, we don't have precise details of the number of casualties. We expect to get that. But it is relatively unusual for the U.N. to release a tweet like this, and draw attention to a situation like this.

These are seven stocks that really rise and fall on the market follows in sync. But for the average American if they're watching the stock market they may be really excited about their 401(k), but if you don't have a 401(k), there are other ways that you can kind of tell the economy is roaring, and moving in a really good direction, gas prices are a big way that everyday Americans feel every single day. Just how much they're spending, gas prices today, $3.09. From a year ago, $3.45. That's significant savings at the pump. And mortgage rates, many people have been out of the home buying markets, can't afford a mortgage. Mortgage rates coming in at 6.6 percent, that's the lowest since May of 2023.
