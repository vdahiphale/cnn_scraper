      "sentences": "Remember, the deficit is the difference between how much the government bring in in revenue and how much it spends. A few major drivers here. The biggest is about $145 billion in spending related to student debt relief, also FDIC deposit insurance related to the bank failures of last year, discretionary spending increases, Medicaid spending.No matter the driver, what's concerning here is the trend. When we look back to fiscal 2016, the deficit was about $600 billion, all the way on the left side of that chart. That is nothing to sneeze at, but that looks downright tiny compared to right now. We'd kill for a number like that. You'd have the deficit hawks dancing in the streets. So what happened? Well, COVID right. The deficit spiked around $3 trillion a year during COVID. We had bailouts and stimulus checks, small business loans. All of that was deemed necessary, but it was expensive. What's concerning here, though, is of course COVID is over. Deficits are still very high. They're actually going even higher. And it's unusual because normally that's something you see when the economy is in trouble, when unemployment is high. Right now, we have low unemployment and high deficits. It's very hard to make sense of this. Listen, this is a bipartisan problem, right? Both parties are to blame here. I think the good news is everyone agrees this is not sustainable. The bad news is it's going to take some bipartisan compromises to fix it, and we're nowhere near that right now, Sara.",

Coastal flooding and strong winds already beginning to be felt as we stand by to see if the storm will become the first named storm of this hurricane season. We have crews closely covering the fires and the tropics this hour. We begin though with Rosa Flores. She is in Corpus Christi, Texas. Rosa, now you are on the coast there.

And it's kind of surrounding this entire mountain community.Many of the roads blocked off. This road takes you out to the northern edge of ria Ruidoso where most of the fire damage in this particular area is expected to have been affected. Residents still can't get back in there. But if you look around here in this city, it's a ghost town at this moment. There are very few people around. The majority of the cars that we see are law enforcement vehicles, first responders, firefighters, that have descended on this area. Sara, as you mentioned, one person has died. Many of the people here have evacuated, gone off to communities several hours drive away to wait out this wildfire as the crews continue to do the work here. But you can see, just look around us here, just the intensity of the smoke that is kind of blowing off the fire areas that aren't too far away from where we are. There is a sliver of good news expected later today, where weather forecasts showed that it could start raining after 3:00 mountain time here and into tomorrow as well. So if that does happen, it would bring much needed relief and hopes of being able to extinguish these wildfires much faster, because right now, I believe the latest information we have is that much of it is still not fully contained in any kind of way. So these wildfires, intense, very mountainous region, difficult terrain for these fire crews to work through as well. Obviously, just a very dangerous situation is still unfolding here, Sara.",

House Freedom Caucus Chair Bob Good, he's less than a point behind his challenger, State Senator John McGuire. If I can see that right, that's like 342 votes. And forget the point, 342 votes.

As you noted, we have just a few hundred votes that separate these two Republicans who fought in this incredibly expensive primary race that pitted Donald Trump against the incumbent Bob Good. In fact, Donald Trump went out and not only did campaign events for John McGuire, but he got his allies to do things as well. Kevin McCarthy allied himself with Donald Trump because, as you noted, Bob Good, tried to knock him out and was successful, helped lead the effort to knock them out as speaker.So as we speak right now, we're still waiting to see when the votes come in, John. If you had postmarked your vote, you lived in this congressional district, you postmarked your vote by Election Day. If it arrives by Friday, is going to be counted.

Does that mean that let's say North Korea fires a missile against the United States and then the United States retaliates in some fashion and Russia attacks the United States? What specifically is Putin's argument there? In some cases, he doesn't want to define it publicly because that implicit, and actually explicit, but implicit threat is out there and that does what Putin wants to do. But then this big show. I mean, I am really, I guess astounded by the fact that Putin is beginning to sound like Kim Jong-un. He is using some of the same rhetoric, this hegemonic imperialist west, a lot of this is about the United States and the big focus is Ukraine, the utter transformation of Russia due to this war that Putin started and you're seeing the results here.",

The other thing that is amazing is that both of these countries say that they've signed this agreement out of self-defense. I mean, last time I checked, when has either North Korea or Russia been attacked? It has actually been, certainly in the case of Russia, the other way around where they've been attacking their neighbors, whether it is Ukraine or whether it is Georgia in the past or any other of their military actions. So it is a bit rich that both of them are saying we are so concerned about our defensive posture that we have to have some sort of treaty, it is really interesting.",

In other words, ammunition for the war against Ukraine. So China is in this position where they can actually exert significant leverage over both Russia and North Korea, which is something that I think the West is probably going to be looking at because China of course, has much larger goals, some of which depend on solid market relationships, at least economic relationships with the United States and with Europe.

Although I would argue China is different, a more sophisticated relationship, but definitely Iran, North Korea -- all of the -- to coin a phrase, no good knicks in the world, they will leverage to make difficulties for the United States. And if they can do that, individually, they are not that powerful, but combined, they could create a lot of mischief for the United States, and this is one of the problems. I think again, we go back to Ukraine. I believe that Putin is doing this because he is infuriated by the United States allowing Ukraine to use weapons to hit the Russian mainland.
