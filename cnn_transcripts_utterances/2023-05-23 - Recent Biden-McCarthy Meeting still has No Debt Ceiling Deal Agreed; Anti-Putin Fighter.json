Well, we are following a developing story from Washington where authorities have arrested a man who crashed a truck near the White House late Monday night.Officials say the driver slammed the vehicle into security barriers at a public square just across the street from the executive residence. They believe he may have done it intentionally. The driver has been charged with multiple crimes, including threatening to kill, harm, or kidnap a president, vice president, or family member. No reported injuries to any Secret Service or White House personnel. A much anticipated meeting between U.S. President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has come and gone with still no deal on raising the U.S. debt ceiling. Both the president and McCarthy said Monday's talks were productive, but it does nothing for a looming default, which could happen in just a matter of days. McCarthy was adamant they need to strike a deal this week in order to avoid the June 1st deadline when the U.S. could potentially default on its debt. U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has been a constant reminder of the urgency of the matter. In a letter to Congress, she informed lawmakers another week of data and negotiations have done nothing to change the situation. CNN's Melanie Zanona has more from Washington. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

So following that meeting at the White House, Speaker Kevin McCarthy struck a far more optimistic tone. Take a listen. REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY, U.S. HOUSE SPEAKER: I felt we had a productive discussion. We don't have an agreement yet, but I did feel the discussion was productive in areas that we have differences of opinion. I believe we can still get there. I believe we can get it done.",

So that remains a huge point of contention.

That is according to multiple sources familiar with notes taken by his lawyer and turned over to investigators.The notes provide more insight into Trump's thinking as the special counsel pursues its criminal investigation into the mishandling of classified materials and the possibility that Trump obstructed the investigation. Earlier this month he insisted he had the absolute right to take the documents and Trump's legal troubles don't stop there. Federal prosecutors with the special counsel's office have subpoenaed the Trump organization for information about its business deals with foreign countries, according to sources familiar with the investigation. One source said investigators appear to be focused on Trump's dealings with countries that could possibly be interested in the classified materials recovered from Mar-a-Lago. It's unclear when the subpoena was issued. The Trump organization had said it would not strike new deals with foreign countries while Trump was in office.

(voice-over): In the battalion bunker, the commander tells us the Russians have ramped up their shelling on his troops since they advanced. Tons of ammo, shrapnel, tanks firing, everything. His unit's drones recorded their recent successes. But now the Russians have regrouped. And in a moment of candor, following losses the previous night, admits morale is flagging. Let's be honest, he says, we are fighting heavily for more than a year. My soldiers went through many battles and two rotations near Bakhmut. Troops are exhausted, but we endure. (on-camera): Bakhmut, which is just over the hill in that direction, has become an object lesson in how Russia's wealth in men and ammunition can prevail. And then, unless Ukraine gets the modern weaponry support from its allies, it's going to struggle to tip the balance.

It is unclear whether it is connected to Christian Bruckner, the German suspect first named in the case in 2020. Bruckner, a convicted sex offender, lived in the Algarve between 1995 and 2007 in an apartment about a mile away from the resort where the McCanns were staying. He is in prison in Germany for the rape and murder of a 72-year-old woman committed in Portugal at the same resort. He has not been charged in McCann's disappearance, and denies any involvement.

Kohberger has been in custody since December, after he was arrested at his parents' Pennsylvanian home more than a month after the murders. He was tracked down after police zeroed in on a white Hyundai Elantra spotted near the crime scene and a description of the intruder by a surviving roommate identified as D.M., who said she heard crying and saw a mask man that night clad in black clothing and noting his height, weight, and bushy eyebrows, according to the probable cause affidavit. Investigators say that they found Kohberger's father's DNA on trash recovered from his family home, which was a close match to the DNA on a tan leather knife sheath left behind at the crime scene, according to the affidavit. Now, the prosecution has 60 days to decide whether they will pursue the death penalty in this case. (on-camera): And I spoke with the University of Idaho law professor about why exactly Brian Kohberger may have stayed silent instead of entering a plea, and he said there are a number of reasons, the first is that this is a highly scrutinized, highly public case and so it is possible that he did not want people to characterize his decision either way with a guilty plea or a not guilty plea. There is also the possibility that there are some talks behind closed- doors happening between the prosecution and the defense. There could be some kind of plea agreement happening, and this could be a decision that is part of that. And, lastly, it is possible that he is just being difficult and not wanting to cooperate. So there are a number of reasons. And while this does happen though, I am told that it is highly unusual. Veronica Miracle, CNN, San Francisco. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The bill passed the state's Republican-controlled legislature last week in a 33 to 15 vote. The governor hailed it as a significant win for conservatives. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV.
