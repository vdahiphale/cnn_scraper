And a bleak future what will happen to the 100,000 Armenians who've led Nagorno-Karabakh and what remains of that region. We're taking a quick check of Wall Street U.S. stocks are on track for a lower open with interest rate sensitive. Tech stocks under the most pressure pre market. Stocks are falling amid fresh rises in U.S. bond yields and the ongoing fears that the U.S. Federal Reserve will continue to raise interest rates. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury is now at its highest level in 16 years. With the United Nations Security Council has authorized an armed force to restore order to gang ravaged Haiti. Warring gangs control much of Port-au- Prince Haiti's Capital City and Main Port. The Caribbean country has also been plagued by political chaos and a struggling economy in recent years. Haiti's Prime Minister has repeatedly asked for military assistance and welcomes the UN support. The armed force is expected to be led by Kenya which has pledged thousand police to spearhead this mission. CNN's Patrick Oppmann is monitoring this story from Havana, Cuba and joins us now. Patrick, it seems kind of left field to have Kenya lead a security force in Haiti. It does have a troubling human rights record why Kenya?",

You could have other countries from the Caribbean offered to send troops as well as which is what they have been saying over the last few weeks and months. But it does seem to be a primarily Haitian us primarily Kenyan led mission. And perhaps it's Kenya just wanting to have a more visible world presences and as well, but the United States has certainly said they appreciate Kenya's assistance, and is pledging tens of million dollars of aid. But ultimately, you need peacekeepers troops that could pass the Security Council that's getting Russia, China and the U.S. are on the same page as something that's been very, very difficult.

A lot of them believe that by and large, they do have a good quantity of weapons to use on the front lines.

But then also ammunition is one of the things that I think, often underestimated, but it's a huge deal for a lot of the soldiers here on the frontlines. A lot of them believe that they don't have enough ammo to really put pressure on the Russians in some places. They say they need more of that ammo they needed to continue to keep coming.

It's certainly even less wise when the judge here is the finder of fact, right?What do I mean, by that this is a bench trial. And what that means is that this judge has to make an assessment as to whether or not those claims have been met. And the judge largely did that in a pre-trial motion that was filed. It's called a motion for summary judgment. And what that means in English is that the judge assesses whether there's any factual disputes as to necessitate a trial on those issues. The judge concluded as to the issue of fraud, there is not a factual dispute. In fact, there very much was fraud. And then you turn your attention to well, if that's the case, what are the damages amounts, and the judge not only concluding that there's issues with fraud, but now has to move into the issue of what the penalties should be? What does the appointment of a receiver and independent body to oversee the properties and potentially dissolve them and distribute assets? What would that look like? What would the amount of the fine look like? Should it be 250 million? Should it be somewhat less? What would the issues right in terms of the loss of the business certificates look like? So I say all that plan that to say that if this is the person who's deciding your fate, it really does not is not in your interest to attack them. However, we know that there's a presidential election happening. And certainly based upon public relations, the President has to cater right to a certain populace who buys into him to give the narrative he's giving.

Or it's not, you just can't walk into a room and say, I think its $2 billion more, not how it's done. And so you can make those arguments day and night. I should also note the judge sanctioned his attorneys. What does that mean? The judge finds his attorneys, his being Trump's attorney $7,500, a piece for making arguments that were disconnected with reality. And then his prior ruling indicated that this was a fantasy world. And so yes, there's subjectivity. But subjectivity cannot fly in the face of facts and fly in the face of reality.

We are waiting forU.S. presidential Biden's son Hunter to arrive at a Delaware courthouse. And for the first time ever we'll see the child of a city prep sitting President in court on criminal charges. Hunter Biden is expected to plead not guilty to lying on forms when he bought a handgun back in 2018. Senior U.S. Justice Correspondent for CNN, Evan Perez is in Wilmington, Delaware joining us now live good to have you with us, Evan. So Hunter Biden is facing three counts. Take us through the charges he's facing in court today. EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR U.S. JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Well we have three charges, all of them relate to him purchasing a handgun and owning this handgun for 11 days in 2018. Now, during the time that he owned this firearm, he was prohibited from owning firearms in the United States under federal law, because he was addicted to drugs. He has spoken about this, he has written a book about his struggles with drug abuse during that time period. And that's why according to prosecutors, it's a legal violation. He lied on the form when he bought the gun from the gun cellar. It's a form that is filled out for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives. So that's the crux of what Hunter Biden is facing. But obviously, there's a lot more to this. The politics obviously are hanging this. And the fact that just two months ago, Hunter Biden was in this federal courthouse, he was getting ready to agree to a plea agreement under which that gun charge would have gone away. If he had simply agreed to abide by a number of conditions over a couple of years, including not buying any firearms and also not using drugs. Now, all of that fell apart spectacularly after the judge raised some questions about that deal. And so here we are. Special Counsel, David Weiss, who's been overseeing this investigation for almost five years, is now going to be bringing these charges. We expect Hunter Biden to arrive at the federal courthouse any moment now. And we expect this hearing to be very, very brief. He's going to plead not guilty. And then he's going to be processed by the U.S. Marshals and then probably allowed to go home. But this is only the beginning of his legal troubles. We expect that the Special Counsel has said that they are looking to possibly bring tax charges related to not paying his taxes on time over a number of years. Those charges could be brought in Los Angeles, where Hunter Biden lives or in Washington D.C. where the taxes were filed so a lot more to come from Hunter Biden here at federal court, Lynda.",
