And this really has become the most critical summit when it comes to the leader's coordination on Ukraine. And that will be a pressing issue when they sit down and really get meetings underway in earnest starting tomorrow. One of the things that is expected to come out of this is a new set of sanctions. Really looking to close some of the loopholes in the existing sanctions sort of go after those who are evading the sanctions that are already in place. That is something that President Biden and the other world leaders really want to get a handle on. President Biden is also expected to talk about the situation on the battlefield in Ukraine as Ukraine prepares for this counter offensive.The world leaders really do want to ensure that Ukraine can regain some territory and that would ensure that it could have some leverage at an eventual negotiating table where that will be, when that will be remains an unknown, uncertain. But certainly, they want to make sure those discussions happen. Now remember, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has just finished a tour of Europe. The four European leaders who are part of the G7 all hosted him in their own countries. All pledging billions of dollars in new military aid. And so, this is really so coming up quite a critical moment. Of course, the other main issue that is looming over these talks is China, perhaps more so than the previous G7s for the simple reason that we are in Asia. It is -- the G7 only happens in Asia once every seven years. So, that will prove a critical point of discussion among these leaders. There are differences in the approach of between the Europeans and the Americans on how to approach China. But what President Biden really wants to do is come up with some sort of sort of general agreement about how to approach Beijing, as tensions increase around Taiwan in the South China Sea.

Now that's significant because the Special Counsel is looking at several crimes including possibly mishandling classified information.And it -- the Special Counsel could use these records to establish that Trump was on notice about the process of how you declassify materials and the fact that it applied to him. That could help inform prosecutors as they decide whether they want to bring a case. Now, the former president's lawyers have given various explanations for how and why he brought these classified documents down to Mar-a-Lago. The former president has suggested he automatically was able to declassify these documents. He's also said that he had a standing order to declassify them. And as lawyers, though, have argued that part of this was about the process being flawed and things were inadvertently packed up at the end of the administration. So, these records will help clarify the extent to which Trump was aware of how you declassify items. Now, the special counsel may have to wait to get their hands on these documents because the former president's legal team, they may file a legal challenge. They have not been successful in preventing prosecutors from getting much of the evidence that they have -- tried to obtain, I am told by a source familiar they're thinking they may still file a challenge because they want to try to protect constitutional and presidential privileges.

However, in fact, I don't think that anyone really disputes the physical facts of what happened. The inconsiderate driving, the dangerous driving which endangered the perpetrators as well as all bystanders and everyone else. Braking, various traffic violations and the sense that this is a group of paparazzi acting against essentially a couple of who are famous but they're strangers to the paparazzi in order to get photographs to be sold. Definitely what's coming through is that Harry and Meghan have a very heightened sense of vulnerability and threat. And of course, we know why that is. It's because of Harry's family history. It's because this is very personal for him. It ties into his feelings about losing his mother, his entire childhood being hounded being photographed, being served up for the tabloids and gossip and for speculation. It's also keying into their narrative of hang on, we thought that we left the U.K. in order to escape the hostility and yet it seems to have followed us here.

It seems that air defenses were able to shoot down all of the attempted attacks there though, as we've seen recently and you can see in this image there provided by the police chief in the region.That does not mean there's no danger. This is falling debris from those missiles that were shut down. They say though, no significant damage, no casualties as of yet reported in Kyiv. Air defenses also activated in Vinnytsia to the south west of Kyiv. Another region there. And unfortunately, in Odesa in the south, there was not 100 percent success rate for air defense. There was a -- an industrial facility that was hit. You can see images of that there, one person killed, two wounded, according to local officials there. So, another big night for Ukraine's air defenses and some damage reported. This clearly a strategy by Russia, this attritional strategy trying to exhaust Ukraine's air defenses. And in a different way, we see that same nutritional strategy in play in the East, especially in Bakhmut where fighting seems to be intensifying. We're seeing that both sides claiming advances. Ukraine in the past few days is that it's made gains, particularly in the suburbs to the north and south. Prigozhin, the head of Wagner on Wednesday saying that his forces had advanced some 260 meters. So you can see the sort of very reduced speed of advanced though within the city he -- in another dig against the Russian Ministry of Defense said that they would be able to do more if it weren't for Russian Ministry of Defense Forces retreating, he said. And we've got some new satellite images that show the real cost, Rosemary, of the fighting in Bakhmut. The intense damage. This is a set of theater and a set of shops you can see on the left May of last year and now on the right. Those buildings pretty much wiped off the map. We've got another before and after to show you. The school in the Western District of Kyiv school number 12. There's of Bakhmut rather, school number 12 on the right. It looks a little bit like ancient ruins again, you can see pretty buildings pretty much wiped off the map. This is an area in the west of Kyiv that we know has been heavily contested in the west of Bakhmut rather that's been heavily contested in recent weeks as Ukraine has moved very slowly to take back just a few city blocks. They continue to hold on. Russia also not giving up. We've had reports in recent days that they have been moving new units including paratroopers into that city. Rosemary? Shocking images for sure.

More than 5,000 people are under evacuation according to the Civil Protection, among them a four-month-old baby and an elderly handicapped man. The region had been undergoing severe drought. In 2022, low rainfall and extreme heat depleted the river Po. A crucial waterway for transport and irrigation. A winter with very little snow did little to help. And as bad as these floods are, they're only a drop in the bucket for what is needed to reverse the drought. Earlier this month, a downpour swelled the Po by five feet. This delusion of water will raise it even more, but it is still well below average.

I think anybody who throws that quote out that quickly has his own set of problems, including being a racist himself. The mayor is engaged in human trafficking of the worst kind.MARQUEZ (voiceover): Orange and Rockland counties now have temporary restraining orders barring New York City from sending migrants their way in the town of Riverhead on Long Island has preemptively declared a state of emergency to block the city sending migrants there too. New York's Mayor insists with this latest wave more than 4200 arriving last week alone, there is no room left in the city. And it's covering the cost of hotel rooms and care for the migrants. He just needs more space to temporarily house them.",

The backlash from some parents, teachers and students has been fierce. YOLANDA AYALA, PARENT: I don't have nothing against the immigrants. They're welcome here or whatever. And that's of -- why in schools? (END VIDEOTAPE) MARQUEZ (on camera): So, this decision to put migrants into gyms has been extremely controversial here in New York City. This is a sort of gym their putting in modular gyms that are disconnected from the school itself. There are a few of these in the city but because of the backlash, because of the anger this created. The city has reversed itself, after only a few days and said that they will pull all the migrants out, they've already pulled them out of this gym here. But the city also says that if the situation gets worse, it reserves the right to put migrants back into gyms like this. Back to you.",

Democrats were hoping to force a floor vote on a resolution that would have expelled George Santos, an effort to put every single Republican on the record here. But Speaker Kevin McCarthy came up with an off ramp, to help shield his members from taking a potentially tough vote.So, instead of voting on the resolution itself, the House voted on Wednesday along party lines to instead refer the resolution to the House Ethics Committee. Seven Democrats did vote present most of them are on the House Ethics Committee, and George Santos himself. We should point out did vote in favor of this referral. But this is essentially a delay tactic. Take a listen to House Speaker Kevin McCarthy describe his decision making. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): I would like the Ethics Committee to move rapidly on this. I think there's enough information out there now that they could start looking at this. And I think they could come back to Congress, probably faster than a court case could. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

This committee already was investigating George Santos since March. It is a bipartisan committee; it's made up equally of Republicans and Democrats. But it is not a committee that is known to move very quickly. So, it could take weeks or potentially even months for them to make a recommendation here. And even then, the full House would still need to vote on expulsion, which requires a two thirds majority in the House in order to succeed. But in the meantime, Democrats are making crystal clear that they are not going to let Republicans live this referral vote down. MELANIE ZANONA, CNN, Capitol Hill.",
