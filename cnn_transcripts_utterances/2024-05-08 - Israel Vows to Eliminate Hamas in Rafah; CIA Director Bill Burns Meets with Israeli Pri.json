This as international officials condemn Israel's operation and as airstrikes continue to target and kill Palestinians. And for the first time since this conflict began, the United States has paused a shipment of bombs to Israel and it concerns over their potential use in a ground operation in Rafah, a sign that Washington is growing increasingly frustrated with its ally's actions. And a group of U.S. lawmakers demanding answers from the Defense Secretary about the military's chaotic exit from Afghanistan, specifically about an incident that took place outside Kabul airport that CNN reporting helped uncover.

Medical officials on the ground say in the past 24 hours alone, Israeli airstrikes in Rafah have killed at least 35 people, including a four month old baby. About 50,000 people have fled Gaza's border city in the past 48 hours, according to the U.N. A short time ago, the director of the CIA, Bill Burns, met with Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel to discuss the state of hostage ceasefire negotiations, which are currently ongoing in Cairo. Jeremy Diamond has been across all of this on the ground for months right now. He is live for you in Jerusalem. Let's start with those hostage talks and Bill Burns in Israel, shuttling, of course, between Doha, Cairo and, as we now know, Israel and his conversation with the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

I haven't gotten a big sense yet of exactly what was discussed. But obviously this comes just two days after Hamas agreed to the latest framework proposal that they reworked effectively with the Egyptians and the Qataris. And now the effort is to try and bridge the gap between that Hamas offer and where the Israelis have been for the last two weeks, which is signing on effectively to a previous Egyptian framework. But there are several key gaps in these frameworks, one of which being, of course, Hamas' demand that Israel agree to a permanent cease-fire as part of a second phase of this agreement. And then there are some other issues as well, including the fact that Hamas has said it would fill out the number of 33 hostages released with the bodies of dead hostages if indeed they are unable to find enough living hostages that meet that first humanitarian category of release. I also understand that an Israeli delegation is still in Cairo, continuing further negotiations to try and bridge those gaps. So clearly there are efforts on multiple fronts at multiple different levels, both at the working level in Cairo and also here in Israel at the higher level, with the CIA director meeting with the Israeli prime minister.",

But at the same time, that offensive at some point will run in conflict with the possibility of a cease-fire, with the possibility of a hostage release. And so the question is, how much longer does this operation continue? Until perhaps a deal that Israel can agree to actually comes to light and that puts the operation on pause. The Israeli officials that I've been talking to over the course of the last couple of weeks have said, look, the Rafah operation, first of all, had been delayed for weeks as Israel engaged in further negotiations to see if a deal could be reached. It finally launched the first phase of this ground operation on Monday, at a time when it seemed the talks were at a standstill, before Hamas' latest offer came through. But now Israeli officials have said that, look if there is a good deal on the table, one that Israel can agree to, then that would put a stop to this offensive in Rafah. It's also not clear at this stage how far away we are from an all-out ground offensive because what we are seeing on the ground is certainly having an impact, an enormous impact on the humanitarian situation in Rafah. One of Gaza's largest hospitals, Yousef Al Najjar Hospital in Rafah, has had to shut down as a result of this operation. But it is still a quite limited operation on the ground. Two areas in eastern Rafah to the area around the Rafah border crossing where the Israeli military says they are conducting what they call counterterrorism operations. So it's not clear at what point that mission expands and at what point it becomes this all-out ground offensive that Israel has threatened for months. And perhaps, the hope being perhaps, the negotiators can bridge the gap between Israel and Hamas, get to a deal before that offensive actually comes to fruition.",

That report is due before Congress this week. And it follows an independent task force report that raised specific examples of violations, including the attack on a Jabalya  refugee camp on October 9th, which killed 39 people and for which the U.N. said no specific military objective. You can see the aftermath of that here. The report could increase pressure on Biden to put conditions on U.S. military aid to Israel, something Israel is warned against as it pushes forward in its operation against Hamas. Quite a lot to break down here, not least when that report might emerge. Kylie Atwood is at the State Department with more on what we can expect. Kylie, I guess this begs a very simple question.

The expectation here is that they are actually working to conclude this as rapidly as they can. So we probably will see this in the coming days here. But as you said, this is a really key report. It's going to make a determination from the United States, from the secretary of state, as to whether Israel is using U.S. weapons in accordance with international humanitarian law. And so the way that it works is that Israel has to provide assurances to the United States that they are following international humanitarian law. And then the secretary of state has to make a determination as to if those assurances are credible and reliable. Significantly, we have reported that there isn't a unanimous decision within the State Department as to whether those assurances are credible and reliable. And it's also important to note that this report isn't just going to be looking at that question. It's also going to be examining whether Israel has impeded the delivery of humanitarian aid, of course, into Gaza. And U.S. officials have consistently said that Israel is making strides on that front. However, they've also consistently said that Israel can do more. So where the determination on that front stands will be key for us to watch. And we have heard from lawmakers on the Hill and President Biden's own party, Senator Van Hollen specifically saying that the State Department officials can't just take the assurances from Israel on face value. That they have to actually probe them, that they have to have evidence, that they have to have explanations for why Israel carried out some of the airstrikes, some of the attacks that they did in that post October 7 period. But as you said, there have been some other organizations who have examined this, that have said that those strikes were actually not in accordance with international humanitarian law. So it's a really key report. And while it doesn't require the Biden administration to change policy, it could very well put immense pressure on the administration to further curb those deliveries of U.S. weapons to Israel, that we have seen for the first time. We're learning, today, that the Biden administration has recently paused some of those heavy bombs that were supposed to go to Israel.",

It's also where a small number of wounded and foreigners have been allowed out of Gaza. And it's where many of the freed hostages crossed into freedom early on. This crossing is now under Israeli control. Troops planted an Israeli flag, you can see there, and filmed it. This footage was given to us by the IDF. Now outside this once Palestinian controlled border station, footage shows Israeli tanks destroying signs which say \"Gaza\" and also, \"I love Gaza.\" Several tanks also seen in this IDF handout footage. In this area, we see no signs of any other presence apart from the Israeli military here. Now close by, the part of eastern Rafah, where Israel's military has issued evacuation orders. Some 100,000 told to leave immediately on Monday to the area of Al Mawasi. Now that's about five miles or eight kilometers away. But of course, most have no transport and fuel is scarce. It is an area the United Nations on the ground has called inhumane and has warned it is not suitable for habitation. Well over 1 million people are currently living or sheltering in Rafah. Some estimates are closer to 1.4 million. Most have been displaced once or more times by the Israeli military over the past seven months. Rafah itself is just 25 square miles. That is 64 square kilometers. It is a small area crammed with misery and fear. But it is also an area, the IDF says, houses the last stronghold of Hamas that needs to be destroyed. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Trump's attorney in Georgia said he's looking forward to making the case for why Fani Willis should be removed from the case and why the entire case should be dismissed. As you pointed out, a lower court judge did not remove Fani Willis from the case but it did say that either she or the fellow prosecutor she had a romantic relationship with, Nathan Wade, had to go. So Nathan Wade resigned from the team. But Trump's team and his fellow codefendants didn't just bring up the issue of this romantic relationship she had with her fellow prosecutor. They also brought up concerns about statements Fani Willis has made publicly about the case. Again, she's continued to speak publicly as she's running for reelection this year in Georgia, so we may see more of those statements come up as part of this appeal. But again, this just sort of ensures that this question about whether Fani Willis can continue to preside over the case is still going to be out there, is still going to be part of the conversation when the prosecutors, of course, hope to turn the conversation back to the actual election interference case at hand.

A lot of police officers in the area here. We know that protesters  were arrested for trespassing, as well as assault on police officers, because of a clash that happened between some of the demonstrators and officers, right here near this intersection, police using pepper spray during that clash. We don't know exactly a lot of the details on that. But look, it's an interesting case, Becky, what's happened here in D.C., because it was a unique situation that, for over the past couple of weeks, GW, the university, had repeatedly asked the city to come in and clear this encampment. But police had again and again declined that request, essentially because they didn't want the optics of coming in and arresting protesters for what they believed was a peaceful and fairly contained protest. But we heard the chief of police here in D.C. say this morning that, over the past few days, things really changed, that a campus police officers -- officer, they say, was assaulted in recent days. An item was snatched out of her hands. And they also said that multiple of those demonstrators were found inside one of the campus buildings here, essentially probing, scouting, looking for a space that they might take over and occupy, like what we saw at Columbia. And so the police chief felt that something had to change. And so, as of Monday, they were already putting plans in place to come in early this morning, close to 48 hours in advance, and clear these protesters out.

I should point out five of these eight with a combat experience themselves in Afghanistan as U.S. military veterans, pressing key questions against the Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. They asked for an explanation as to the key discrepancy that our video from our reporting shows against the two investigations the Pentagon had. Just a reminder, look cast back to August 2021. This ISIS suicide bomber explodes, kills phenomenally awful number of individuals, 170 Afghans, 13 U.S. service numbers, so many more potentially the most suicide bonds indeed have killed in previous events like that. And Afghans survivors talk to us in the aftermath and our first investigation about how they'd witnessed shooting or indeed been shot themselves. Later, Marines speak to U.S. military investigators, some about firing themselves from about seeing gunfire or feeling they were being hit by gunfire. But the Pentagon says, no, there were three episodes of nearly simultaneous gunfire that hit nobody. And the only people that opened fire were indeed U.S. or U.K. troops. Now the video that we found shows the video of gunfire itself went on for about four minutes. There were 11, not three episodes of it. And so it raises the question of exactly how reliable is that Pentagon narrative. And now we have congressmen saying, well, we need to have explained to us why the Pentagon investigators told us something that is so different to that new video in the briefings that we had about their recent investigation. I did that, too, Becky. Families of the 13 Gold Star families -- that's the surviving family members of the dead U.S. service men -- seven of those have released a statement to CNN, in which they feel they were misled by the Pentagon in a recent briefing and say they want the truth as well. So real, vocal, loud pressure here against the Pentagon to address these discrepancies in its narrative. And indeed, the congress men also asked too why no Afghans were interviewed in either of the two Pentagon investigations over the last two years. They haven't spoken to that, Doctor you heard there who said over 70 people in his hospital appeared to be dead from gunshot wounds. Let me tell you what the Pentagon did say. They said, \"We honor the service and sacrifice of our 13 service members killed at Abbey Gate and remain fully committed to ensuring our Gold Star families have the support and information they need. \"This will always be a sacred obligation for the Department of Defense.\" Another spokesman has said we are interested potentially in new video that leads us to get new information.
