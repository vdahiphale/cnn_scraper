But look, I think one thing that we should be watching for is whether or not this endorsement from DeSantis changes anything in the minds of Donald Trump already, it appears it has given the language we heard him use on Sunday. But you know, over the past year now, Donald Trump has really viciously gone after Ron DeSantis attacked him very heavily in the lead up to the Iowa caucuses. And part of that was because the campaign was worried about DeSantis as a rival, but the other part was because it was personal. Donald Trump very much believes that DeSantis was being disloyal by running for president after Trump had endorsed him for Florida governor in 2017. And that's where a lot of those attacks stemmed from, according to my conversations with Donald Trump's advisors and his allies. But I think the question now is, Will his endorsement change the game? Well, you see, Ron DeSantis become a potential surrogate for the Trump campaign. I know as well from our conversations with Trump's team that as of now, there are no plans for DeSantis to show up on the trail with them. But again, that could change in the coming weeks.

I mean, DeSantis's support had dwindled in New Hampshire and South Carolina, and while more of his voters are likely to go to Trump, than Haley, there aren't really enough of them to make a big material difference.I think the problem for Haley is that this reinforces the signal sent by all of the other Republicans who have been endorsing Trump in the last few days and weeks, whether they are consolidated or capitulating, you know, you can make your own judgment. But the risk is that it tells voters that the party has decided it's time to shut this down some ways similar what happened for Joe Biden, in early March 2020, when many of his former, you know, rivals unified behind him suddenly after South Carolina.

Mostly she criticizes him, either that he's too old. I'm more electable or this week, you know, more than before, you know, he's losing his memory. She won't weigh in on areas that reflect on his character or behavior. As you point out, she has ducked questions about his obvious racial signaling with the birtherisms, an attack on our immigrant heritage. He told CNN, you know, Dana Bash, this week that she didn't know anything about the E. Jean Carroll judgment against Trump, which is pretty implausible.

But it has also recorded high polling in some states, and is expected to make gains in regional and perhaps European elections this year. Something protesters say needs to change. KATRIN DELRIEUX, PROTESTER: I hope that it will make people change their minds. Some may not yet be sure whether they will vote for the AFD or not.

And this does sort of reawaken these ghosts of Germany's past, if you will.

The rest of Europe is not doing its part, enough is enough. There is a lot of frustration over that because the government hasn't really succeeded in mitigating the effects of migration on the infrastructure in Germany, the logistics around taking in these refugees is very complicated, a lot of local communities are strained. They don't have the resources to deal with them. And I think this is a lot of the frustration that you're seeing here. According to most academics who have looked into the sort of far-right movement in Germany, they say only about 25 percent of the people who would vote for the AFD are actually extremist themselves. So I think this gives you a sense of, you know, just how this is kind of frustrating a lot of people. There's a lot of volatility in the German electorate at the moment where, you know, most people want to send kind of a signal that they're frustrated with the way the establishment politicians are handling this issue of migration in particular.",

But before I get to that let me just tell you we are about two and a half kilometers away from where the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India's leader is right now.As you can see in those live visuals, he is right in the center and is being focused upon by the cameras as I speak to you, the consecration the Ram idol, an idol and a god which Hindus revere here in India will take place anytime now. The idol will be unveiled by one of those leaders inside, most probably Narendra Modi. Along with him, you can see a lot of priests, as well, the chanting is on, the prayers are on, any moment now that consecration that millions of Hindus have been waiting for across India will take place. Now let's talk about Narendra Modi. What does this mean for him, as you just asked me. Michael, this cements the legacy of the man, Narendra Modi. This is the crowning glory moment for Narendra Modi. It's been his ambition to deliver this temple to the people of India. In India, you have a population of 80 percent Hindus, that is a huge number of the 1.4 billion people that we are talking about. This is the moment that he has been waiting for for years. It was a promise as part of his manifesto in the 2014 elections ahead of winning that, as well as the 2019 elections. And today he is delivering on that promise. For the opposition a lot of them are boycotting this event today Michael, because they say that it has been politicized by a leader who is a prime minister of the country and should keep politics and religion separate. But he hasn't, according to them. And they will not be attending this event. But for Narendra Modi, like I said, and for Hindus all over India, this is a very emotional moment. It is a moment full of national pride and this is a moment that sees Indian prime minister as a Hindu national leader that he promised to be for this nation. Back to you.",
