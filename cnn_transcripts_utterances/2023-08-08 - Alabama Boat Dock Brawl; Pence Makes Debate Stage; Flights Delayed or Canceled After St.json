He's looking at Mike Pence. There is a possibility, there is a long way to go, that people slowly at first, and then maybe more rapidly later, can fall away from Donald Trump in Iowa. He is still far and away the leader. But there is a - I just spent ten days in Iowa and there is a very strong sense in Iowa, especially around political elites, that they take their role very seriously in the caucuses as first in the nation and they want to ensure that their role is relevant in nominating who will be the next - next nominee.

The cancellations put the numbers in the top five we have seen since Memorial Day. We've seen about 1,700 cancellations yesterday. The delay number, though, is the really big one, 8,800 flights delayed yesterday. That's a third of all flights in the U.S. Arriving on average, according to Flight Aware, about an hour and ten minutes late. The worst airports -- and this is really key -- Atlanta was the worst for cancellations yesterday, followed by New York's LaGuardia, and then here at Reagan National Airport. Then Newark, in New Jersey, a huge hub for United Airlines. And then Charlotte, which is a huge hub for American Airlines. Though the big headline there is Atlanta, because that is the world's busiest airport. It's also the worldwide headquarters for Delta Airlines, which is now apologizing to its customers, saying it's working to get its schedule back on track after it delayed about 1,300 flights yesterday. A third of all of its flights scheduled. So, we will see as the day develops here. The FAA warning not only of that ground stop in New England, but also we're going to see it, it says, in Florida, in Miami, in Orlando, Palm Beach, Ft.
