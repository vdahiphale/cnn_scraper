Tonight, Israel's prime minister is underpressure as the international community criticizes his rejection of a two- state solution. I speak to the Lithuanian foreign minister to get his reaction. Then we're just one day away from the New Hampshire primary, can Nikki Haley make a dent in Donald Trump's lead in the polls. Plus, this hour, historic as well as controversial ceremony in India as Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurates a Hindu temple on the site of an ancient destroyed Mosque. That and much more just ahead. But first this hour, \"a moment of truth is upon us. The whole world has to decide\". Those words from Jordan's Foreign Minister at a meeting in Brussels, joining calls from the European Union to re-launch the push for an independent Palestinian state. EU ministers met with diplomats from Arab nations today as well as Israel and the Palestinian Authority. EU Foreign Policy chief Josep Borrell didn't mince his words, saying Israel's war to destroy Hamas, is it working? He says peace cannot be achieved through military force alone, urging the world to pursue a two-state solution over Israeli objections. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The U.S. knows its role here, Isa, that you can't push Israel too hard, and they basically have taken the position of trying to control Israel and help Israel see the light, that what they are encouraging is actually to Israel's benefit. But time and time again, Isa, we have heard Israel essentially reject the American position. The U.S. has said repeatedly that there is a need for a reformed and revitalized Palestinian Authority after the war, Israel has said no to that. Secretary Blinken, President Biden talking about the need for a two-state solution. You never hear Prime Minister Netanyahu talking about that. In fact, he's saying no, essentially to Palestinian sovereignty. And so what President Joe Biden now is saying is that it's not black and white. That essentially, the devil is in the details. They're questioning essentially what the word \"sovereignty\" means, and allowing for the possibility that a future Palestinian state could be, as Israel has insisted on, be demilitarized.

New Hampshire is unique for a couple of reasons. Number one, it prides itself on kind of going against the grain and doing something different. And that's why she thought that she had a very good chance there. And number two, in addition to having a lot of independent voters, New Hampshire also has the ability for a group called undeclared voters, those are the ones who happen to say, I'm aligned with the Republicans or I'm aligned with Democrats. It allows those undeclared to vote in a primary of their choice, so they cannot be Republicans, but can show up and vote in the Republican primary. All of that means that New Hampshire is the early state where Nikki Haley is said to have the best chance. And even so, in all of the polling, including CNN's, she's actually running behind Donald Trump. She has the ability to catch up if these undeclared voters turn out on mass for her.

They're smoke rounds. PLEITGEN (voice-over): These shells will barely explode on impact. It's almost like firing cannon balls in medieval times. But the commander says sometimes it's all they can do. \"Every shell that is suitable for the paladin we use,\" he says, \"it's better than no shells.\" The Russians face no such shortages in this area. Ukrainian military intelligence believes Russia produced around two million rounds last year and acquired around one million from North Korea. Massive barrages have laid waste to Bakhmut and much of the surrounding area. At the headquarters of the 93rd Mechanized Brigades Artillery Division, the frustration is palpable. From their drones, they can see the Russians gathered to continue their assaults on Ukrainian positions, but they often can't take them out because they need to conserve ammunition, the commander tells me. \"The ratio is about 10:1,\" he says \"Ammunition is very important to us. Russia is a country that produces ammo. They have strategic reserves. Yes, they use old Soviet systems, but Soviet systems can still kill.\" Even without enough ammo, the Ukrainians say they are stopping most Russian assaults here and the M109 crew did manage to fire at Russian positions. But they know they'll need a lot more firepower to stop Russian advances. Frederik Pleitgen, CNN, near Bakhmut, Ukraine. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
