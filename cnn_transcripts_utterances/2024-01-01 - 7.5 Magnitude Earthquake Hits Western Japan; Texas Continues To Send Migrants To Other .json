This is a time when many people are still in their homes. You know, they could be in their family homes with their friends, with their loved ones. And what that means is that it's quite difficult to access people, even though they might be in their homes. It might take them a while to evacuate to higher ground. And, of course, it doesn't necessarily mean that all homes have these earthquake-capable homes that just withstand these really big tremors. Even here in Tokyo, we felt the tremors. So, to imagine what the people in Ishikawa Prefecture, many others on the Western Japan coast are feeling is really quite indescribable.",

We've seen some fires, particularly on the Noto Peninsula, which is the area of the highest risk. It's a peninsula north of Ishikawa prefecture, jutting out into the ocean. So, that was very alarming. All of us were very concerned about that.

There're no big reports of damage to them, but they all are automatically taken offline. So, the affected communities in many places are without power, and it's a very cold winter right now.

The U.S. Geological Survey says there were multiple aftershocks in the area. The city of Wajima in Ishikawa Prefecture has reported tsunami waves of around nearly four feet high, according to the Japanese public broadcaster, NHK.Japanese officials are urging people to evacuate to higher ground as soon as they can. We'll bring you the latest updates on this breaking news as it comes in. Now, Texas' Republican Governor Greg Abbott continues to send hundreds of migrants to cities run by Democrats. Officials say a plane carrying more than 350 asylum seekers arrived at an airport near Chicago on Sunday morning. CNN's Camila Bernal has more on the migrant crisis in the U.S. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CAMILA BERNAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over):  A breaking point at the U.S.-Mexico border as preliminary Homeland Security statistics show authorities encountered more than 225,000 migrants so far in December, the highest monthly total recorded in more than 20 years. And from the border to cities all over the U.S. struggling to keep up because this welcome comes at a cost. MAYOR MIKE JOHNSTON (D-DENVER, CO):  When you're talking about 10 percent of the budget to allocate for cities on this, that's unsustainable. When we have every single hotel room in the city full of migrants that have arrived, that's unsustainable.",

He is now sending buses outside of the city of Chicago, in some instances 100 miles away where people are being dropped off. They're being told that they are in the city of Chicago, literally dropped off in the middle of nowhere. I find that to be inhumane and unconscionable.",

In Louisiana, it will become illegal for those under 18 to receive those treatments, and healthcare professionals can have their licenses revoked for two years or more if they provide those services. On the other hand, Maryland, along with several other Democratic-led states, passed protections for gender affirming care for all ages, and as of January 1st, the state will require Medicaid to cover them. When it comes to abortion, the state of Washington is enacting a law with the goal of making the procedure more accessible by eliminating out of pocket costs, including deductibles and co-pays. This is, of course, in response to near total bans in several Republican-led states that took effect in 2023. In California, a law taking effect Monday protects local health care providers from out of state litigation over both abortion and gender affirming care to people from other states. When it comes to laws that are not as controversial, nearly half of all us states will increase their minimum wage in 2024. Washington will continue to have the highest minimum wage of all states at $16.28 an hour, up from $15.74. Another new law for 2024 getting a lot of attention is California's ban on carry and concealed firearms in sensitive places. This is despite the federal judge's prior ruling that the law is, quote, repugnant to the Second Amendment. Under the new law, people with permits would not be allowed to carry concealed firearms in places like schools, parks and hospitals, among others. A federal appeals court will allow the law to go into effect for now, while the court case continues. Rafael Romo, CNN, Atlanta.",
