I'm Dana Bash in Washington, where the state of our union is doing the math.We are 51 days from the election, and together with their running mates Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are focusing on the states that will decide the next president, with the race apparently deadlocked after what could be the only Harris/Trump debate. But Donald Trump is also doubling down on a baseless claim that he made at the debate, that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, are eating people's pets. Local officials and the state's Republican governor say there is absolutely no evidence of that claim, and they are warning it is actually hurting their city. Springfield, Ohio, is facing a fourth day of threats over the claims that have forced a college, hospitals, and schools to lock down. Meanwhile, Springfield police say they received two calls about Proud Boys marching through the city. Here's how Donald Trump responded to the controversy over Haitians who, I want to note, are in the U.S. legally. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They only identified two instances of people alleging Haitians were taking geese out of parks. They found zero evidence to substantiate those claims. Also, other evidence that you have talked about, even you have retweeted, alleged evidence, are unsourced social media videos from a different city, apparently no connection to Haitians. And this is from a conservative activist who offered a $5,000 reward for such things. And then going just back to the schools and the hospitals and so forth being overwhelmed, nobody is disputing that the town of Springfield, Ohio, needs help. But you're not just a bystander. You're the senator from Ohio. So instead of saying things that are wrong and actually causing the hospitals, the schools, the government buildings to be evacuated because of bomb threats because of the cats and dogs thing, why not actually be constructive and helping to better integrate them into the community? Because there are a lot of employers there who say that the Haitian workers are helping fill jobs that they need desperately filled.",

I have a lot to get to, but, first, your response to what you heard from Senator J.D. Vance. GOV. JOSH SHAPIRO (D-PA):  I mean, Dana, that was bonkers. Listen, the governor of Ohio, the mayor of that town in Ohio has said this is all made up, these are all lies, there is no truth to it. And the United States senator from Ohio just came on your show and blamed his own constituents for his own lies. This guy is so pathetic. But the thing is, it is dangerous. There is a causal connection between the B.S. that J.D. Vance and Donald Trump spew and the safety and security of the American people. When they go out and they lie about this stuff, they put their fellow Americans at risk. J.D. Vance should be ashamed of himself. He knows better. I mean, this guy, whether he's on your show or he's in some sports bar, where -- I mean, by the way, a total pick me in that sports bar the other day -- he just doesn't understand the power of his words, the power of his lies. And those lies are putting people at risk. This is dangerous stuff. I know it started because they wanted to just distract the American people from their failed policies and their chaos.

It's, by the way, Dana, one of the reasons why we have cut taxes four times in Pennsylvania for seniors, for families who are trying to afford childcare, for small businesses. We understand the importance of cutting costs and putting money back in Pennsylvanians' pockets. And I think if you listen to what the vice president laid out in her debate and in her commentary since and prior to that, she's got an economic plan to put money back in people's pockets as well. She's talking about cutting the costs of childcare. She's talking about cutting taxes for small businesses. She's talking about opening up the doors of opportunity to more Pennsylvanians, more Americans by eliminating the college degree requirement that opens up the doors for more jobs to more people. By the way, Dana, that was the first executive order I signed as governor here in Pennsylvania. And it's worked. It's created more opportunities for Pennsylvanians. So, I think the vice president clearly understands the need to put money back in people's pockets, the need to cut costs, the economic anxieties people are facing. And she's put forth plans to do that. Donald Trump has put forth no plans to actually do that, except cutting taxes for people who are at the very top of our income brackets and actually increasing the burden through his tariff policies on the middle class. So I don't blame my constituent in Erie County for raising those issues. But I think, if you examine the policies and plans put forth by the vice president, I think they're right on point.",

Just a couple of days ago, she was in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, and then in Wilkes-Barre a few hours later. These are communities that oftentimes feel ignored by national Democrats. She's showing up and, by the way, getting great crowds. And I'm feeling real enthusiasm. There's something to be said for the person who not only votes for the vice president, but is willing to put that sign on their lawn, willing to wear that T-shirt or maybe even that Taylor Swift friendship bracelet. It sends a message to their friends and neighbors that they're for Kamala Harris. They like her positions. They think she's the right person to lead us forward. And so I think what I'm seeing more and more of is not just the folks who are lining up to vote for her, but those who are enthusiastic about her candidacy in communities that oftentimes are not enthusiastic about Democratic candidates and encouraging their neighbors to be for them as well.

So this is a this is an issue where Donald Trump is winning. It will really blow the mind of the Democrats. Half of America now supports Trump's border wall. That has changed dramatically over the last three years. So the more we're talking about immigration, the better it is for Donald Trump.
