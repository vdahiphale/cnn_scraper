The Union is essentially demanding double the wage increases the automakers are offering, along with other enhancements.

A loyalty pledge would have helped Florida Governor Ron DeSantis so the fact that it's now abandoned is seen as a major defeat for the DeSantis campaign.

Federal prosecutors are asking for a narrowly tailored gag order on Trump, citing his attacks on people working the case and possible witnesses. The order would prevent Trump from making statements that could be considered disparaging and inflammatory or intimidating. More than 11,000 people in the Libyan city of Derna have been killed by floodwaters that ravaged the region last week. That's according to a U.N. report, which warns the death toll will likely rise as emergency crews continue to search for the missing. So far, workers have pulled dozens of bodies from the sea along the Derna coast. Rescue missions say most of the victims who were swept away are still in the water.

Part of the problem here is that entire neighborhoods in Derna were swept into the Mediterranean, and that's where some of the bodies are believed to remain. Some of them are decomposing now, and there are people who were killed in this catastrophic flooding that may never be found. That is a reality. The International Rescue Mission there, saying they need more resources as much as possible to help here. The African Union Chairperson has said that he's appealing to African Union member states to send the support that Libya needs. Part of the problem, again, here, is the east-west divide in the country between the Tripoli government that is recognized by the international community and in the eastern part of the country that includes Derna, that is led by the rebel leader Khalifa Haftar.

This region begins its long recovery from the devastating September 8th earthquake. Crews geared up to try to restore power to villages where earthquakes have been using flashlights to see at night. A lack of electricity also has knocked out streetlights along mountain roads hindering the transport of vital aid. The government has promised to build some 50,000 houses for those whose homes were destroyed but residents fear it could take months or years before it gets done. All right. Now to post-tropical cyclone Lee. It made a second landfall in Canada a few hours ago in New Brunswick. Lee's initial landfall was Saturday afternoon in southwest Nova Scotia just under hurricane strength. The storm surge caused coastal flooding, downed trees and knocked out power. But crews are making headway in restoring electricity. So at last check, almost 160,000 customers remain through the Canadian Maritimes were still in the dark. Lee is expected to continue to weaken throughout the day. CNN Meteorologist, Karen Maginnis is there with more on that. Karen, I'm thinking of all my friends in Atlantic Canada. What's the latest?",

We've seen some high waves batter this region as well as you saw power outages there as well. So it may take some time for that power to be restored. But in the meantime for Lee, now post-storm Lee had been at hurricanestrength, a Category 5 actually when it was in the Atlantic. But now weakening very rapidly. We just got an update from the National Hurricane Center and the wind associated with Lee now sitting at about 50 miles an hour or 85 kilometers per hour. And it's racing along, pushing off towards the northeast. So it is over Prince Edward Island, but also still impacting New Brunswick and Portia of Maine as well as that northern coast of Nova Scotia. It'll move over Newfoundland as we go into the next 12 to 24 hours. I think this is going to increase with the next 12 hours or so fairly rapidly as it really zooms its way across the northeast at about 22 miles per hour. But its impacts are still going to be felt. Could expect some power outages, down trees, down power lines. Also a fairly heavy surf. So if you hadn't batted down the hatches already, now is the time to do so. It's going to weaken as it encounters that much colder water in the North Atlantic. But we're still looking at the potential for tropical storm strength, the winds, even though this is post hurricane or post tropical system, Lee, what makes it post is it becomes more elongated and some of the heavier bands of precipitation are out from the center. It no longer has a center of circulation and is essentially a cold core storm. So Kim, this acted like a Nor'easter, although this is very early for that type of weather to impact the New England region of the United States and the Canadian Maritimes. Back to you.",

MORALES (through translator): In the coming months, I think there's the possibility in March and April, if the rain pattern remains the same as now. There would be possible water restrictions.
