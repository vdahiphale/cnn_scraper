There are new storms on the horizon, which could bring more rain to the area today.

Instead of having to do liquid fueled missiles, which is the technology they had in the past, which can require the missiles to have to sit at the launch point and be filled up with fuel for hours, this is solid fuel and thus it can kind of get deployed very quickly and launched.[09:50:03] It makes it much harder to detect on the ground and potentially to intercept. And North Korea's been on this missile launching binge for more than a year now. Last year more than 90 cruise and ballistic missile tests and launches counted. This was the 12th launch of this year. It gets condemned every time by the U.S. government, by allies, South Korea and Japan. You mentioned that it spooked residents and the authorities on that northern Japanese island of Hokkaido. And it just underscores that even though we're continuing to hear reports of food insecurity in North Korea, of poverty there, of problems that the government, that the regime there is committed absolutely to continuing to develop these costly nuclear weapons and missile launching systems almost at all costs, Pyongyang claims this is to improve and increase its war deterrence capability.
