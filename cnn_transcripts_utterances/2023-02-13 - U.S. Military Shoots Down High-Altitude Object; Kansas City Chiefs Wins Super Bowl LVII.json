Just ahead.(VIDEO PLAYIN) Kansas City fans are in for a long night of celebration as the Chiefs defeat the Eagles for the Super Bowl LVII title. We are live at the stadium with the highlights. The U.S. military shoots down yet another high-altitude object. What officials are saying about the most recent incident, and growing frustration in Turkey as rescuers dig through the rubble many are wondering why the government response has been so slow and why there weren't more preparations to begin with. Thanks for being with us. We begin with yet another shootdown of an unidentified object flying in U.S. airspace. This time, recovery teams are directing their attention to something shot down over the Great Lakes region. The Pentagon says whatever it was, it was not believed to be a military threat but that the order to send up an F-16 was given out of, quote, \"an abundance of caution.\" CNN's Arlette Saenz has more on what we know and what we are still waiting to hear.",

      "sentences": "For the third time in as many days, President Biden ordered the takedown of an unidentified object in North American airspace. The latest shoot down happened on Sunday afternoon. There was an object seen flying at about 20,000 feet over Michigan's upper peninsula and nearing Lake Huron. It was then that officials say an F-16 fighter jet shut it down.Now, officials have described this object as being octagonal in shape with strings attached to it but no discernible payload. And officials have also said that it is connected to some radar contact that was found in Montana on Saturday evening. Initially, fighter jet were sent up into the skies in Montana on Saturday to try to track down a possible object. They did not find anything, and that lead NORAD and NorthCom to believe that it was a radar anomaly. But then on Sunday, they re-acquired that radar contact and did find this unidentified object flying over Wisconsin and then Michigan. Ultimately, there was concern because of the height that this object was flying at, 20,000 feet which could pose some threat to civilian aircraft. There is also concern about the path that it was taking. So, the military leaders recommended to President Biden that he shoot it down and he ultimately, he issued the order. Now, this is just the latest in a string of puzzling events of aerial crafts being seen in the skies above the United States starting with that suspected Chinese spy balloon that was shot off the coast of South Carolina just nine days ago. And still so many questions about these other objects that were shut down, one off the Alaskan coast on Friday and then another shot in the Yukon in Canada on Saturday. Now, officials have been very careful and cautious about how they are trying to describe some of these objects. They say that they are still waiting for more information. And some of the big questions facing this administration is exactly the size of these items, also the origin and what their purposes are. All of these questions that they are hoping to get some answers to as these recovery operations are all underway. Arlette Saenz, CNN, the White House.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Rosemary. The Chinese government so far has not officially responded to the latest development but their foreign ministry's daily press briefing is about to start so let's see what they will have to say. But state media here has definitely been reporting the story and perhaps not surprisingly portraying the U.S. military actions as absurd and exaggerated.The nationalistic \"Global Times\" newspaper, for example, in their editorial comparing the U.S. actions as a clumsy performance art. And I quote them here, \"The grand takeoff of U.S. warplanes apparently satisfied some people's appetite for the China threat.\" It goes on to say, \"It is not a good sign for the world if the country with the strongest military is constantly surrounded by this kind of extreme emotion and sees everything as a threat and thus wants to destroy it.\" So, this kind of colorful language really echoing the official government stance after the U.S. shot down that first confirmed Chinese balloon that the U.S. has overreacted. The Chinese, of course, insist the device was civilian and drifted off course because of a weather even though U.S. officials and many experts very much disputed that. And the U.S. is now, of course, has announced sanctions against six Chinese entities related to the balloon, which by the way, according to CNN's own reporting, is part of a sweeping global intelligence gathering effort by the Chinese state. Now, the Chinese for their part, have been pushing back very hard on all these allegations and we are expecting them to condemn the latest sanctions and announce their own (inaudible) threat of countermeasures. But as you mentioned, the one intriguing development is on Sunday, state media here, quoting local maritime authorities as saying they have spotted their own UFO off the coast of east China. And the preparation was underway to shoot it down warning local fishermen to avoid the dangerous area, but also telling them to take photographs for evidence and potentially collecting debris if conditions allowed. That story obviously went viral given the timing and also given the Chinese military's previous promise to take similar actions after the U.S. shot down their balloon. But so far, we have not heard much updates after the initial reports came out, Rosemary, but all the silence obviously fueling even more curiosity and speculation. Rosemary?",

And where the Ukrainians have had some successes in getting one Western ally to commit to sending a weapon before the others followed suit. The best example of that recently was with tanks where there's now a dozen countries committed to sending tanks to Ukraine.And the very first was Poland. When it comes to fighter jets. Well, you have some countries, France, Netherlands, Portugal, saying that they're in theory open to this idea, but no one's actually committed. What the Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki has said is that look, if it were Poland deciding Ukraine would get these jets. But over the weekend in an interview with BBC the, Polish president Andrzej Duda sort of added to the complexity around this question by pointing out a very simple fact. And that's that Poland isn't in a position to send these fighter jets, F-16s, because his country has less than 50 of them. So even sending a very small number of these jets would really have big ramifications for the actual fleet of Polish jets. He also said that there's plenty of complexities involved in sending them around maintenance and technical servicing, which would mean that any decision for Poland to actually send these jets would really have to be made by NATO collectively. You had the U.K. recently being the first to commit to actually training Ukrainian pilots on Western fighter jets. But even the defense minister sort of downplayed the significance of that recently by saying that these may, in fact, come in handy after the war, rather than during it. But the Ukrainians continued to insist the Ukrainian ambassador to the U.K. said that, look, the reality is that we've heard this before. We heard it with tanks, we heard it with long-range artillery, and eventually these countries have come around. Rosemary?",

This is actually a matter of Ukrainians wearing down Russian troops to prevent them from actually launching any kind of a large-scale attacks. But they also acknowledged that their routes in and out of the town as of late have been restricted because of heavy fighting there.
