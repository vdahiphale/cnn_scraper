That is what many of these people are facing now. They are going to have to find a new place to live. And let me tell you, we have been learning more details about how powerful and devastating those tornadoes that hit this area over the weekend were. The National Weather Service here in Nashville says that a tornado that hit Clarksville, a community about 70 miles northwest of here, was an EF-3 tornado, packing winds of 150 miles an hour. It tracked for 43 miles. It was on the ground for more than one hour. And it killed three people. Among them, a 10-year-old boy. Authorities have identified him as Arlin Bernam (ph). His family told CNN that a friend of the family had to dig him out of the rubble along with his sister, who fortunately survived. Here, where we are, this is the Madison neighborhood here in the north side of Nashville. The tornado that hit this area was an EF-2 tornado, with wind of up to 125 mph. And an additional three people died here, including a 2-year-old boy. And earlier, we had an opportunity to talk to a couple that they had to run to their kitchen when they realized the tornado was coming this way, because it was the only room in the house that didn't have any windows. And that is a decision that might have saved their lives. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Remaining about 6,000 to 7,000 customers that still have to have power turned back on. But in any case, that is good news.

It's also approved for type 2 diabetes as Mounjaro.And really the findings from this study reinforce what we already know about these medicines, which is they work incredibly well while you are on them for most people but it can be hard to maintain that weight loss once you stop. Now check out this graph. This really summarizes what happened in the study. For nine months, everybody was on the medicine. And you can see there, on the average, they lost weight, about 20 percent of their body weight over time. Then they split the trial participants into two groups. Have stayed on the medicine and half switched to a placebo. Those who stayed on the drug continue to lose weight, although it did start to level out. Whereas those on placebo started to gain the weight back. And by the end of the year of follow-up, had gained back almost half of the weight that they had lost. Now the researchers also looked at it another way, which is how many of the participants maintained at least 80 percent of the weight that they lost in the first nine months. And 90 percent of participants taking the medicine the whole time maintained 80 percent of their weight loss. Whereas only 17 percent of those on placebo maintained that much weight loss. So this is something that we've known about these medicines but it really puts numbers to how difficult it can be once you stop taking these drugs to maintain weight loss -- Boris?",
