      "sentences": "Sleepwalking into a dictatorship, those grim words used by former Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney, as DonaldTrump marches toward the Republican nomination for President. Plus, the Biden campaign seems thrilled to campaign on Obamacare, launching a new effort to promote Biden's record on healthcare after Donald Trump brought it up again. This after he failed to repeal it in his first term. And as Israel's ground operations expand into southern Gaza, Congress still has not passed an additional aid package. I'll discuss with Democratic Representative Debbie Dingell. Good day, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt to our viewers watching in the United States and around the world. It's 11 a.m. here in Washington, Monday, December 4, 42 days until the Iowa caucuses, and just 336 days until Election Day. This is today's State of the Race. We are just six weeks away from the Iowa caucuses, and that's going to be our first real test of whether Donald Trump is the dominant frontrunner that the polls say that he is. Trump, of course, lost to Joe Biden in 2020, which means, we, as a country, poised for a rematch. But, to be clear, this is not a normal election and Trump is not a normal candidate. He denies he lost the last vote. He is on trial over allegations he plotted to overthrow it. And his supporters, in his name, attacks the Capitol on January 6. But, admitting any of that can be career suicide in today's GOP. Liz Cheney is deeply conservative and was a member of the House Republican leadership just a handful of years ago. But, she lost her primary after she challenged Trump. She offered this grim outlook for her party and our country this weekend. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LIZ CHENEY, FORMER U.S. HOUSE REPUBLICAN: He has told us what he will do. People who say, well, if he is elected, it's not that dangerous because we have all of these checks and balances, don't fully understand the extent to which the Republicans in Congress today have been co-opted. One of the things that we see happening today is a sort of a sleepwalking into dictatorship in the United States. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

If the election is a referendum on Joe Biden's economy, on Bidenomics right now, it seems like Trump is in a good position. But, when you talk about democracy, when you remind voters about what happened on January 6, when you look at what happened during the midterms when Biden was spending a lot of time giving primetime speeches about democracy, Democrats did quite well. People did not like the idea that all of the chaos that we saw under the Trump administration, all of the attacks on democracy, all of the attacks on norms could happen again. It's the way that the Biden campaign and the White House are trying to remind voters about the chaos that we saw in 2020 and 2019 and 2018 under Trump, and they want people to remember that and not think that Trump wasn't so bad.",

And I think Liz Cheney is absolutely right. Kasie, you know that voters and the American people, frankly, people in general these days, have the attention span of a gnat. And so, people might not necessarily remember how bad it was under Trump. And so, people like Liz Cheney reminding what he did, and then reports like The New York Times. The Atlantic is doing a big spread. Their whole next issue is about every single thing that he would destroy if he becomes President again. But, I also think it's important what we talked about in terms of what he is putting in place right now, and the fact that he is not making any quantum about this. They're not trying to make the secret at all. That I think points to the fact that they also believe that the American people are in this days. And so, sleepwalking is exactly the right word. And practice makes perfect, Kasie. His first term was practice. They now know what happened that didn't let him do what he wanted to do, and they are pinpointing those exact things and people and bureaucracies and processes, that they can now go in there and hopefully change to do what he wants.",

But, it's a question that we might actually see answered soon enough, where now even Republican Speaker Johnson wants to open an impeachment inquiry against President Biden. So, there is a number of these moments happening where we're seeing Republicans still likely going to -- go down that path, open investigation against Biden, continuing to do that, which does open the question, I think, if whether those Republicans do stick together, it might be a completely different House majority.

And so, the White House is trying to remind Americans about what Trump's second term could look like. But, at the same time, they are a little bit worried that people are having nostalgia about Trump. The economy was a little bit calmer. There wasn't as much happening on the world stage.

Let's start with kind of your role in Congress in this unfolding conflict. There still has not been a deal reached on aid to Israel. And of course, you have both Jewish and Arab American communities in your district, in the State of Michigan. This is really a central place where the debate over all of this is playing out.

DEBBIE DINGELL (D-MI): Well, first of all, I think we've got to look at what's happening over there. And we need to put in more humanitarian aid over there. Look, what Hamas did was unequivocally an act of terror. It's unforgivable. There were horrific things that happened. But, what's happening in Gaza is equally horrific. We don't know the exact number. Somewhere from 13,000 to 18,000 to 20,000 innocent civilians have died. 6,000 to 8,000 of them are children. They don't have food. They don't have water. They don't have medicine. We need to be getting humanitarian aid in there. The Vice President was the strongest we've heard the administration yesterday and saying to Israel, there are guidelines about how -- what you must do. And telling people that they've got to leave an area when there is no place to go is not humanitarian. So, I have people on both sides. I have met with families that have families that are hostages. I have so many families in my district who have lost family in Gaza. We have got to find if anything good comes out of this, and I mean anything. And this has been horrific time.

If you're a Gaza civilian, even as a military guy, this is one of the worst ways to handle something like this. The obligation that the Israelis actually have in this case, Kasie, is to safely move as many civilians as they possibly can out of harm's way. And what is happening with the grid map that Ben referenced in his reporting, that map has a -- about a -- several hundred different blocks where people can go or not go, depending on what the message is. But, if they can't get the message, it's going to be a real problem. In fact, more people could potentially lose their lives because of this.
