And I think a lot of observers are about this.Will you join in on this conversation with us, Kristin? Because we have former NASA astronaut and retired Air Force Colonel Terry Virts. And, Colonel, you, we should mention, you know a little bit about being stuck for a little while so you also have some experience with this. But just your reaction to this news? COL. TERRY VIRTS, FORMER NASA ASTRONAUT &amp; U.S. AIR FORCE, RETIRED (via telephone): Well, I think my first thought is I know that Butch and Suni are fine. They're having a good time. They're enjoying their time in space. And the other space station astronauts are probably glad to have them there. It's like free labor. And the other second thought I had was I'm sure NASA is, you know, looking at every option and they're making sure everything is safe. I talked to some friends of mine that have no concerns with the Boeing capsule. They think it's fine. There were some minor problems that they think they understand. But again, I'm not in those meetings, so I'm sure they're looking at every contingency.",

That was in the initial stages. Does that mentality still apply when you're now weeks and weeks, over 60 days out, at this point?",

It's an important American company, that they're trying to get this mission what they call certified. You know, it's like a final exam in college, you need to pass the course. So once they pass this mission, then they can fly operation crewed missions so they can launch just like the SpaceX capsule you're talking about. They can launch astronauts to and from the space station.They really want to get that done so they're taking whatever time they need to - and from what they said, it sounds like they understand what the problems were and it's not going to be a problem for re-entry. But again, I'm not -- I'm not in all of those meetings, so I guess we'll have to wait and see.",

When I was on my last flight in space, we had some rockets fail and, basically, we were stuck -- if that's the right word -- in space. And we didn't know for how long they had to do a safety investigation before they launched our replacement. So we were up there in space. It was kind of like during Covid. You didn't know how long it was going to last and you were low on supplies. But these are not low on supplies. So I think they're going to look at it as some bonus time in space more than they are being stuck. Because you never know when your next space mission is going be.

You saw that right there. And if confirmed this this could amount to Ukraine's most potent and far-reaching incursion into Russia in the two-and-a-half years since Russia's full-scale invasion.

      "sentences": "Nothing at all, which is quite remarkable, to be honest. And that there is really no other candidate potentially for making an incursion like this from Ukraine into Russia.And it's been quite far-reaching. We see one town, Sudzha, which appears to have certainly Ukrainian forces in it, says -- described by its mayor as, quote, \"very tense.\" But still, tentatively, in Russian control with evacuations ongoing. That's about three or four miles away from Ukraine's border, which suggests that, indeed, Ukraine's forces have pushed further inside territory, too. So a significant area under attack, from yesterday as well, this building and it's momentum. Russia's President Vladimir Putin saying this was a major provocation and accusing and Ukraine of being indiscriminate in its fire against civilians. A bit rich coming from the Kremlin, who'd been doing that to Ukraine for over two years now. But his chief of staff, Valery Gerasimov, has said quite clearly that they believe the advanced has been halted. That's not really what we're hearing from local officials there, who are helping people evacuate from that area and, generally, I think trying to get a grip on what's happening with extra reinforcements teams rushing in that direction. So unclear entirely what Ukraine's strategic goal was here. But they've certainly caught Russia off-guard. They certainly will be forced to deploy more forces in that direction. Is there a wider goal? Well, some analysts are pointing toward a gas terminal in that area that is key to a gas transit from Russia, through Ukraine, on to Europe. Yes, that's still happening three years in. It doesn't appear to have affected transit at the moment. But there are other questions, too, about Ukraine really struggling with manpower. The Donetsk frontline is where Russia is slowly moving towards very important Ukrainian hubs. Whether this was a good idea for Kiev to take essentially what seemed to be forces from its wider reserves into a battle like this -- it's embarrassing Moscow -- but is it costing them potentially less resources elsewhere? We fully don't know the answer to that right now. But it's a sign, I think, of Ukraine trying to put forward the idea that it has a positive headline, catch Russia off guard, but is it really going to cause damage to Putin, apart from the embarrassment, frankly, today? We'll have to see in the days ahead -- Brianna?",
