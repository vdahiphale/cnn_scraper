Misunderstanding about when he was supposed to show up, and then he was questioned at the bench, outside of the -- we could not hear it as the press. It is going to remain sealed.

And once they were seated and uncovered this, you know, questionable answer. And so, that juror was excused. So, the process is working. It's just, as you're saying, it's a question of how quickly do we get this jury and how much time do they have before the case gets underway if -- for them to uncover anything that could potentially be problematic.

They've always been very clannish. They have their private disagreements, but they come out with a united front, particularly with regard to candidacies coming from within the family.But it's very clear that a large majority of the prominent Kennedys who are still active in public life, in some fashion, feel very strongly that Biden should win, but also, that their brother represents a real threat, and he does, via the electoral college to Biden's second term. So, what they're doing is significant. They're going to have to do it again and again and again in various ways between now and November, because it's hard to reach people. And remember one of RFK Jr.'s big appeals seems to be to young people. And I can tell you living in the middle of a college campus, there is a lot of appeal for RFK Jr. In part, I think, because they have absolutely no idea where he stands on anything. It's simply a famous name. It's glitz. It's star power. And they're unhappy with both Biden and Trump. They're not going to vote for Trump, the vast majority of them, but their disillusion with Biden may be because of Gaza and there are other reasons besides.

You mentioned Michigan, he could easily be on the ballot and seems to be moving in that direction in Arizona, in Nevada, and in a number of other swing states, there are only seven or eight of them, really.

And that is because there are a number of Republicans on that committee who have already said that they will not support the rule moving forward. That means the Democrats are going to have to help in some way if this package is going to advance.Now, Democrats have made clear that they do view this Ukraine package, Israel package, Taiwan package as essential to not just the U.S., but global security, and that they want to take some steps.
