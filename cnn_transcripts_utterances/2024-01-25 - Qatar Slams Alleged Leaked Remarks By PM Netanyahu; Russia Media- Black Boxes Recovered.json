So it'sno surprise that Doha is evidently annoyed. In response to the leaked, Qatar's foreign ministry spokesperson said on X, quote: We are appalled by the alleged remarks attributed to the Israeli prime minister in various media reports about Qatar's mediation role. These remarks, if validated, are irresponsible and destructive to the efforts to save innocent lives, but are not surprising. Now this comes as the number of people killed after a U.N. facility was shelled in the city of Khan Younis has gone up to 12 according to UNRWA. Israel saying a, quote, thorough review is underway. The White House says it is, quote, gravely concerned by the strikes. Similar sentiment coming from the State Department. The deputy spokesperson saying, quote, we deplore today's attack on the U.N.'s Khan Younis training centers. Civilians must be protected and the protected nature of U.N. facilities must be respected. And humanitarian workers must be protected so they can continue providing civilians with lifesaving humanitarian assistance that they need. Now, despite all of those appeals and concerns voiced by the U.S., about protecting civilians in general, is Israel really listening? Well, I'm pleased to say that I can put that question straight to the State Department principal deputy spokesperson, Vedant Patel himself, who joins me now, live from Washington. Vedant, great to have you with us. Thank you so much. So, here's the question, you know, is Israel listening to concerns and calls made by the United States to do what it can to minimize civilian deaths? VEDANT PATEL, PRINCIPAL DEPUTY SPOKESPERSON, U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT:  First, thanks so much for having me. This is something that we have and will continue to raise with our Israeli partners that every possible step needs to be taken to minimize the impact on civilians. It is a moral and strategic imperative, not all of these conversations are easy. Some of them are tough conversations, but we'll continue to have them.",

Simultaneously though, every possible step needs to be taken to minimize impact on civilians. But let me also add that Hamas continues to conduct this war in a way in which they continue to co-locate themselves with civilian infrastructure. They continue to embed themselves within civilian infrastructure, using civilians as human shields. There's a clear track record of this. And so, it's critically important that our Israeli partners continue to stake -- take steps to hold them accountable while simultaneously doing everything possible to minimize the impact on civilians.",

I think if you take what was purported to be Prime Minister Netanyahu's comments that wereleaked from that meeting with hostage families, just a couple of days ago, part of the recording that also was leaked also said that the prime minister blamed Qatar for not putting enough pressure on Hamas. He said, because they finance them. And that was really something that Smotrich was following up on, but I think what will sting most or along with everything else in that rebuke by a prime -- apparently by Prime Minister Netanyahu, is this allegation that it is Qatar financing Hamas because Qatar helps get the funds to Hamas, that it is explicitly with Israel, say-so, political, say so, as well as the United States. And I think you get a sense of how bitter that is felt in Qatar by their response, which another part of the tweet that came from the foreign ministry spokesman -- spokesperson there went on to say that they feel that perhaps if that is proven to be Prime Minister Netanyahu speaking here, that he is really putting his own career above the safety of the hostages and others in Gaza. The implication being that he doesn't want to see a deal right now and I think if you listen to what the hostage families who met with the prime minister of had to say. They have said this in a statement in the last hour or so that, you know, when they go into these meetings with the prime minister, they their phones or handed over at the door so they can't record the conversations. But the prime minister's office does make a recording of the conference the session, and they are questioning why the prime minister's office, they are saying would seek to and have leaked this audio. They are also in playing here that the prime minister may not be acting in the best interests of the families and the implicit understanding for many people in Israel is that the hostages are handed over as part of a -- part of a truce type deal, that would be the end of the war on that would be potentially the end of Prime Minister Netanyahu's political career.

Now, this really speaks to the divisions within the party. There are -- the president is going out there to tout the economy while also grappling with divisions of his -- in his party over the situation in Israel. Now, Biden campaign aides have known that there would be protestors going into many of these events.

And we are miles away from recession. To your question though, about what this means for the Fed, I think that this could give the fed pause in terms of cutting interest rates. A lot of investors and economists had been penciling in interest rate cuts beginning in March. And I do think that some of Fed -- some Fed officials may have a hard time doing that at a time when the economy is growing at it above 3 percent pace, when unemployment is this low, they don't want to make inflation worse.
