And from there, the release of people took place. There were celebrations in the streets. People waving Palestinian flags, Hamas flags as well. Of the 39 prisoners, there were 22 women; two of them were girls andthen there were 15 teenage boys, ranging in age between 14 and 18. In terms of who may be released from there, those numbers leave only 11 women eligible for release out of the list of potential prisoners that could be released, that Israel has put out there in the public. So the rest would be boys, teenage boys, again, some as young as 14 up to 18 years old as well. Most people on that list or many people on that list are accused of relatively minor crimes-- throwing rocks, harming regional security. Others are accused or convicted of much more serious offenses as well. And in the days ahead, Laila, it is important to make clear that, look, this all seems quite delicate. Everything has to go according to the plan that has been set out. The Red Cross is implementing this on the ground. But even yesterday there were some clashes that took place outside the prison, inside the West Bank, where people had gathered to watch this release. The IDF used tear gas to disperse the crowd. The Palestinian Red Crescent said two teenagers, actually a 12-year old and a 16 year old, I should say, were shot and injured in those clashes. We have reached out to the IDF for comment. But you can bet that there are a lot of people on both sides of this who hope the fragile truce will hold, so their loved ones can finally go back home.",

Officials say they're in good physical condition and will undergo a medical assessment.

But in this moment of extreme intention and crisis, I think it's important that a human being, we can show some empathy. We can reassure them, just to ensure that the journey is back.

There was no damage reported nor were there casualties, according to the Pentagon but the growing attacks highlight the concerns about a wider conflict that could draw in U.S. troops. The U.S. has retaliated and tried to send a message of deterrence. The Pentagon says, including hitting two locations in Iraq earlier this week, which belonged to the Iran-backed Kata'ib Hezbollah, following an earlier attack by the group with close range ballistic missiles. In all, the U.S. has now carried out four sets of airstrikes for these dozens of strikes against U.S. and coalition forces. The U.S. strikes included three in Syria against facilities tied to Iran's Revolutionary Guard and Iran-backed proxy groups. The Pentagon argues that the deterrence is working because the conflict has not yet spread more widely in the Middle East -- Alex Marquardt, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE) (MUSIC PLAYING)",

For many, these are disturbing scenes. Nine year old, Ohad Munder being embraced, as he set free, then a woman being carried by a masked man as Palestinians cheer. For 49 long days of captivity in Gaza, aid workers from the Red Cross drive them through the border into Egypt and to freedom. Egyptian television shows a convoy of vehicles heading to the crossing. Then the hostages including 10 Thais, a Filipino and the 13 Israeli women and children disembarking for checks. Israeli military posted this grainy video of the moment they all finally reentered the country. A step says the Israeli Prime Minister toward bringing all hostages home. BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAEL PRIME MINISTER (through translator): We have just completed the return of the first of our hostages, children, their mothers and additional women. Each one of them is a whole world. But I emphasize to you the families and to you, citizens of Israel, we are committed to return all our hostages. CHANCE (voice-over): Most of the hostages released in this first group under the temporary truce were taken from Nir Oz, one of the small Israeli communities near Gaza ravaged by Hamas on October the seventh. At least 38 people there were killed and more than 70 abducted. People like Daniel Aloni and her five year old daughter, Emilia, both freed in this latest release but the relatives they were visiting when Hamas attacked remain unaccounted for as hostages. Doron Katz Asher and her two young daughters have also now been set free but her partner remains in Gaza. Behind every release, a poignant reminder of those left behind. Like the family of Omri Almog, his brother in law and niece killed, his sister and her three children still hostages. Yet Omri is now optimistic.

And what are your immediate concerns? DR. DAPHNA DOLLBERG, CLINICAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGIST, THE ACADEMIC COLLEGE OF TEL AVIV YAFFO: Well, what we think and we know from previous data about war on children and natural disasters -- there is no information about captivity of such young children. But what we know is that the younger children are actually most fragile. And unlike what we would like to think, young children do remember traumatic events. But because their language is not well developed and they are less equipped to process and communicate what they went through, they will show their distress through bodily reactions, like maybe refusal to eat or sleep or becoming physically sick. Or they may show their distress by behavioral manifestations and developmental regressions and sometimes even developmental arrest. We hope that whatever arrest will be temporary. But they may show it and they are definitely going to be very confused, very scared and on guard and fearful for a long time, despite being in a safe place. They may be very hypervigilant. And the most devastating thing, it's their failure to trust the adults around them, even and maybe particularly their parents because, in their mind, in their childish mind, the parent did not protect them. So I suspect we'll see many signs of PTSD -- post trauma stress disorder -- and we will need a long time to reestablish a sense of safety and protection and trust in these young children.",

But the tragedy in this case is that the parents, most of them were either in captivity themselves, some were murdered. We know at least about one young child, who will have to be told that she is an orphan. So the parents are not in the best shape. And even those who are here, who are safe, went through hell in the past few weeks. So the parents and children will need a very gentle, sensitive, long-term support. And Israel's ministry of welfare has been working in the past few weeks on sort of a multidisciplinary plan of support to the kidnapped China and their parents. And the main thing is really helping them very gradually return to a daily routine. Basic things like deciding what to eat and when to eat or what to wear and when to talk or not to talk will have to be paced, according to each individual's ability and with the help of whoever adult is around them, knows the children and can support the process.",
