And they just don't know how to deal with it. They tried. They occupied South Lebanon for many years. They tried to have a surrogate army in South Lebanon and then tried just shooting across the border and nothing works. And Hezbollah has gotten strong enough to fight them in 2006 to a ceasefire. And there's a kind of mutual deterrence along that border, which both -- both of them respected with rules of engagement. And so there's -- this bravado talk of the Israeli generals as cartoon stuff. We shouldn't take it seriously. They're just saying, we're tough. We're going to take care of our people. And we're going to show these people something. Well, they've been trying to do that -- for 25 years they've been trying to do that, and they haven't succeeded. So there really has to be diplomatic resolutions for all of these conflicts, and all of the conflicts are linked. And they all revolve somehow, around Palestine and Israel.

Those are the kinds of things that they're going to have to do, and they're going to have to have access to far more drones than they are currently using there currently, efforts underway, everything from crowd funding all the way to these efforts on the European side, where they're going to be using as many drones as they possibly can, and trying to obtain as many drones as they possibly can, in order to achieve that advantage.
