And it certainly gives us a clue as to what's on his agenda, which is to get right over to Moscow and meet with Vladimir Putin, where China is putting out these statement saying that it's about urging peace and promoting talks, and that China has an objective and impartial position.Remember, they put out that 12-point peace document, but refused to actually call the war an invasion, refused to condemn Russia's actions and are asking Ukraine to slice up its country and give Russia some of their territory that it stole to try to end what China calls a special military operation, parroting Russian propaganda. And then the Kremlin is saying that the two are going to be talking about strategic cooperation and signing important bilateral documents. What neither the Kremlin or Beijing talked about is whether they're going to be talking about providing lethal weapons, whether China will be willing to provide ammunition and lethal weapons that could actually shift the course of the conflict and it would be not good for Ukraine, even with the influx of western weapons. Analysts say if China were to actually decide to just give up this, you know, illusion of being a neutral party here, even though President Xi hasn't even talked by phone yet with President Zelenskyy of Ukraine, and if they actually start arming Russia, potentially trying to support Russia's war. And then that raises the whole question of, OK, they're - they're backing Russia in what they're doing in Ukraine, and then would they expect Russia's support for what's widely believed to be an ambition at some point to make a move here on the self-ruled democracy of Taiwan. So, a lot of people around the world and the west are nervous and waiting to see what happens at this big meeting in Moscow next week.",

However, the U.S. military is, quote, taking a close look at the drone's roots and assessing how to better deconflict with Russian forces.

And why does he want to talk to you? Because he and his investigators, they want to know what you've seen and what you've heard about any potential classified documents, any boxes that could have contained classified materials and how these things moved around the resort.Now, the former president's team, folks in his orbit argue, like, this is a little excessive, why are you bugging the groundskeeper, right? But this is an unprecedented situation. We have never had a former president who lived at a resort. And, of course, there are these legitimate questions. This investigation not only about classified documents, but also about any efforts to obstruct this investigation. So, in our reporting we learned that, for example, there's one young man who was caught on security camera moving boxes with a young man named Walt Nata (ph), one of the president's aides, who we know has also spoken to investigators. They want to talk to him. Who told you to move those boxes? Where did they go? Who, what, when, why, where, right?

Some of the nation's biggest banks putting cash - putting cash into the coffers of First Republic to show that the system is safe, the system is solid and to make sure that this bank does not teeter anymore. So, this has been remarkable and this has been led by Jamie Dimon ofJP Morgan Chase and by the Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen working the phones over 48-hours, putting together this - this package to show support for First Republic and try to draw a line under what has been a really tumultuous seven or eight days. You've got the - the bank stocks -- the regional bank stocks, we'll watch them closely today. They're leaning lower here in the pre- market. I'm going to tell you why. It's not existential. It's not worries about these going out of business. Now it's worries about their earnings. They're going to have to cut dividends. They're probably going to have to raise the interest rates they pay you, the saver, as they're trying to attract -- you know, attract deposits.

DeSantis went a long way to avoid making comments on Ukraine.  He looked -- but he looked quite frightened. And a dramatic example of this is on the eve of the Russian invasion of Ukraine there were 165 members of the Florida National Guard on a training mission inside Ukraine. They were, of course, evacuated when the Russians attacked, moved to a neighboring NATO country where they continued their training mission and they returned to Florida in August of 2022, by which time it was clear the United States was helping Ukraine. Now, a lot of governors would have used that as an opportunity to welcome the troops, maybe - you know, maybe appear in-person, certainly send a letter or statement thanking them for their service.
