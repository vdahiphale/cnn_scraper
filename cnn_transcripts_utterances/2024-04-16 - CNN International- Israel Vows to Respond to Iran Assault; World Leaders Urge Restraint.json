Jury selection was slow going on Monday, with dozens of potential jurors sent home after admitting they couldn't be fair and impartial.The presumptive Republican presidential nominee has been charged with 34 felonies for falsifying business records related to a 2016 payment to the former adult film star Stormy Daniels. Trump, who is required to appear in court, is the first former U.S. president to face a criminal trial. CNN's Kara Scannell has the details on day one. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This is considered an assault on America. Nothing like this has ever happened before. There's never been anything like it. KARA SCANNELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Donald Trump speaking out on a day that saw 96 potential jurors pass through magnetometers to enter the courtroom with Trump. They were sworn in and questioning began. A few minutes later, at least 50 prospective jurors were excused because they told the judge they could not be fair and impartial. Of those who remained, three questioned by the judge listed the New York Times and CNN as their sources of news. None said they had read any books by Michael Cohen or Trump, and none of them said they worked or volunteered for any pro-Trump or anti-Trump groups. Just nine members of today's jury pool were questioned and not dismissed by the time court adjourned. Trump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. [04:15:00] The Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg says the former president attempted to cover up payments made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels just before the 2016 election, trying to stop her from speaking out about the alleged affair with Trump. Judge Juan Merchan started the day by denying a motion from Trump's lawyers to recuse himself. As attorneys debated, Judge Juan Merchan said he would not allow the infamous Access Hollywood tape to be shown or video of Trump's deposition in the E. Jean Carroll lawsuit that found him liable for defamation. Karen McDougal, a model who says she had an affair with Trump in 2006 and was paid $150,000 to keep quiet about it, will be allowed to testify. Attorneys also argued about how much the jury can be told about Michael Cohen's crimes. MICHAEL COHEN, DONALD TRUMP'S FORMER ATTORNEY: I did it at the direction of, in concert with, and for the benefit of Donald J. Trump. SCANNELL (voice-over): The credibility of Trump's former fixer, who admitted he orchestrated the hush money payment to Stormy Daniels, will be one of the most fought over elements of the case. Trump, for his part, entered very few words into the court record. He could sometimes be seen leaning back in his chair with his arms folded and his eyes appeared to be closed for several minutes. When he was introduced as the defendant, Trump turned around and gave the potential jurors a tight-lipped smirk. Once jury selection began, Trump was active, at times conferring with his lawyer and holding the questionnaire up to read as the judge questioned jurors. Prosecutors also asked the judge to fine Trump for social media posts attacking witnesses involved in the case, saying he violated a gag order. The judge scheduled a hearing for next week to settle that matter. The trial is expected to last six to eight weeks. It may be the only case against Trump to face a jury before the 2024 election.

      "sentences": "Speaker Johnson made his long-awaited move on providing aid to Ukraine, aid to Israel, aid to Taiwan. Recall, about two months ago, the Senate passed a $95 billion aid package.Johnson essentially sidelined that bill because it did not include border security measures. Republicans had scuttled the bipartisan border security plan that had been cut in the Senate. They killed that plan. They said it did not go far enough. The election year politics, of course, helped deal with -- actually scuttled that plan as well. But nevertheless, now the question is what will Johnson do, given Ukraine has been clamoring for some support and Israel, too, in the aftermath of the Iranian attacks this past week, giving more urgency among Israel supporters in the Republican conference, in particular to move ahead with aid to Israel. So what did Johnson ultimately decide to do? He plans to move on separate pieces of legislation, aid to Israel, aid to Ukraine, aid to Taiwan, and also some other national security measures, four different plans. The ultimate question is will they ultimately be cobbled together in one package and sent back to the Senate for final action here? That is -- some of the process is uncertain, but it's significant because he's being warned by Republican hardliners not to tie any aid to Israel to any aid to Ukraine. Those hardliners say there should not be another dime of money spent for aid to Ukraine. And that has raised questions about whether Johnson can hang on amid threats from one congressman in particular, Marjorie Taylor Greene, that he could lose his job if he moves ahead with aid to Ukraine.
