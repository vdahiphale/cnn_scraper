She is among a small group of White House aides who moved with the former president to Florida after he lost the election. I want to bring in former State Department's spokesperson Nayyera Haq, Republican pollster Kristen Soltis-Anderson, legal analyst Elliot Williams, and Axios's Margaret Talev. Let me begin with you here, Elliot, on this exclusive reporting from CNN.

So, it should not surprise anybody. It is significant because whenever anybody gets a subpoena, no matter who they are, it is a big deal, and it is evidence in a testimony.

The challenge we are seeing right now is this is not an organic movement, this is prompted by national organizations that have taken education, realized what it means to families, including Hispanic voters, which is number one issue, and politicized it along the lines of identity.And so, they have shared everything from talking points to meeting times two names of books with local community. So, the idea that this is about what local parents want is part of a smokescreen receding right now. Ron DeSantis has clearly benefited politically from that. The challenge is it's not necessarily, as Kristen said, about things that are truly objectionable. Laws have been written vague enough but with enough political pressure that teachers and local authorities are scared. They don't want to get in trouble. (CROSSTALK) We have multiple stories around the country, not just in Florida, of teachers opting to just remove books that talk about clear identity, that talk about, you know, racism and systemic racism because they just don't want to fall afoul of laws they don't truly understand. SOLTIS-ANDERSON:  I totally disagree with the idea that it is sinister for parents to be organizing around their kids' schools. The idea of telling people about school board meetings times or giving them information that they can use when speaking with public officials, that's organizing, that's something that the left and the right does.",

Efforts to whitewash or gloss over uncomfortable aspect of U.S. history if the textbooks companies don't go along with it.

The conversation has to be had in order to prioritize the case. I did have the opportunity on behalf of the family to kind of go on a fact-finding mission in Mexico. And the reason why it was simple, the family is being ping-ponged. We know in America -- and I am a former prosecutor and so are you -- that victims have rights. And so, they have the right to be informed, they have the right to be kept abreast of what is happening in the case. And that is what was so shocking to me, that they were being given no information, which was leading all of us to believe that nothing was being done. And so, going to Mexico and hearing from Mexican authorities directly that we have completed our investigation, we have submitted all of our evidence and our physical evidence to the United States already, and essentially the ball is in their court was the biggest revelation of the trip, and understanding that, okay, now, we are back and we need to focus on the United States either extraditing the person who is named in the investigation that the Mexican authorities conducted, or something even more simple, the United States can ask for concurrent jurisdiction and take over and do their own investigation of the case and prosecute the people responsible or the person responsible here in the United States.",

Families of the victims and Boeing attorneys are in a legal battle over whether Boeing should have to pay for the victims' suffering in the minutes leading up to the deadly crash.Now, Boeing's attorneys argue the victims died instantaneously and say any hardship that they may have experienced before impact is not legally relevant for calculating damages. Back with me now, Nayyera Haq, Kristen Soltis-Anderson, Elliot Williams, and Margaret Talev as well. Let me just give a little bit more context here. I think it is a little bit shocking about the arguments being made on this issue. So, first of all, the Boeing attorneys say that the crash victims died immediately. It slammed into the ground. The company is making the case that they should not have to actually pay for damages for pain and suffering. And here is what Boeing is actually saying about it. They said, the Illinois laws provide that evidence of passengers' pre-impact pain and suffering may not be admitted to support a damages award in this case. If such evidence were admitted, it would unfairly be prejudicial and likely to confuse or mislead the jury, it should be excluded. Boeing recognizes the tremendous tragedy suffered by the families. On the other side of this view, the plaintiffs' attorneys are saying that they actually should pay for that six-minutes rollercoaster that was tragic and led to the fatal crash and the nosedive. They say that the people on the plane -- quote -- \"undeniably suffered horrific emotional distress, pain and suffering, and physical impact and injury while they endured extreme G-forces, braced for impact, knew the airplane was malfunctioning, and ultimately plummeted nose-down to the ground at terrifying speed.\" It's difficult even to read the statements and thinking about what that must have been like for that six-minute period. And again, it ended in absolute tragedy. But is the legal argument that Boeing is making somehow sound?",

I am dead serious here because it's -- look, as a matter of common sense, people die in a plane crash, they ought to be compensated for it. Right? It sorts of defies logic.Well, Boeing may have a point here in that damages across the country are a matter of state law and each of the 50 states is going to have a different scheme for how you compensate people who have been injured. And the argument Boeing is making is that, well, under Illinois State law, how someone might have suffered in the moments prior to that may not be compensable. Now, look, it's just even hard to say those words given the concept here. Now, look, a suffering can be compensated. We have an entire debate through the early 2000s over whether people who were tortured actually suffered in a way that they could be compensated. So, the idea that the mere fact that we don't know if someone felt pain in the moments before death is sort of silly and ludicrous. But this is going to be a legal fight. I think you're going to hear from a lot of psychologists saying careening to the ground near the speed of sound is itself such a profound sense of suffering that people, of course, suffered damages on that they can be compensated for --",

There were a lot of problems with that case. And so, this added on top of that. It's a public relations challenge and it is a tragedy for everyone who lost family loved ones on the crash. But more broadly, to your point, yes, we've just come out of a series of very close calls and that is everything from what our air traffic controllers doing to what is happening with the planes. In this case, we all rely on a basic amount of trust in the aircraft manufacturers and the regulators every time we get on a plane. Now, we're going to be moving into an era of self-driving vehicles like the more advanced technology gets the more we trust the things that we cannot control ourselves. I think -- SOLTIS-ANDERSON:  Yeah, and this is a reminder that for so many big companies out there, what may have in decades past been a public relations nightmare that you want to resolve because you want people to feel safe flying on your planes, you can continue selling them to airlines. Increasingly, companies don't just have to worry about what does the consumer think about my brand, but what does the government think of my brand, what do people in Washington think. For a company like Boeing, that is also makes -- a whole variety of types of aircraft. There are lots of purchases here in Washington, D.C. Your brand is challenged as company in any industry, but especially ones that have such close ties to the government.
