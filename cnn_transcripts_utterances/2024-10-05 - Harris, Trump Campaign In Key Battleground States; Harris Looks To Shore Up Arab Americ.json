Police reported that when they arrived, they found a 20-year-old man with facial injuries and the 70-year-old man with head injuries.Paterson spokesperson told CNN the attack stems from a previous encounter between the stepson and the attacker. Both victims suffered injuries but were able to defend themselves. They were taken to the hospital as a precaution. A Georgia judge has dismissed a Republican lawsuit questioning the security of voting machines for the 2024 election. DeKalb County Republicans and Trump-supporting lawyers filed the lawsuit claiming the Dominion Voting machines are illegal in Georgia. However, the judge ruled the machines are certified and any risks are currently speculative. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger maintains the machines are secure and the lawsuit seeks to mislead voters and challenge a possible Trump defeat.",

The rally is happening at the same location where a man tried to kill Trump almost three months ago, but this time, security will be much tighter. The Secret Service is working closely with state and local police as an extra precaution.Trump will be behind ballistic glass when he talks to the crowd. Let's talk more about this with CNN law enforcement analyst and former Secret Service agent, Jonathan Wackrow. Jonathan, good morning to you. So, let's talk about the vulnerability here or the threat. Does the Butler site today create any greater vulnerability, or is it more risky than any other outdoor venue than -- that the former President would use for a rally?",

And those threats are actually unprecedented for a former President or even, you know, presidential candidate.And those threats include the threats from domestic home-grown violent extremist as well as foreign entities, foreign hostile actors such as Iran. So, when you start looking at Donald Trump as the protectee against this threat environment, the Secret Service returning to Butler with the President is facing a significant challenge as they will throughout the rest of this election, and you're going to see today a large scale mobilization of protective resources that are unprecedented for a former President. And as you had alluded to in the intro here, you're going to see the former President behind ballistic glass. But what you are also going to see is almost presidential level protection to include, you know, tactical resources, you know, chemical, biological, and radiological mitigation resources. You're going to see aerial surveillance, which was a criticism the first time at Butler, you're going to see aerial surveillance and counter-drone technology all deployed. What I am hearing from sources within the Secret Service is that they've spent a lot of time looking at the -- you know, what went wrong the first time and have spent a considerable amount of time working with the state police, local resources to ensure that communication is seamless between the Secret Service and all law enforcement partners. There's a unified command post, which again was a criticism the first time they have implemented that, you know, for this event. What you will also -- you know, should note is that there will also be things that you don't see, protective resources such as counter-surveillance, Intelligence resources, more sharing of information between stakeholders. So, this is an unprecedented protective structure that has been set up for the former President's return to Butler, Pennsylvania today.",

So, every day, those agents are out there executing their job near flawlessly. We're seeing the results of that, both from these two assassination attempts, the reaction of those officers and agents was, you know, exactly almost textbook. But the challenge for the Secret Service does lie in the leadership. And it's right for the former first lady to question, what is going on with the leadership? And that presents a problem for the Secret Service. When you think about the motto is worthy of trust and confidence, you can't have a bifurcated viewpoint of the Secret Service. You can't. It's challenging to have a lot of respect for the officers and agents on day-to-day, and then question the leadership. And that's something that the acting director right now has to address not only to the protectees, but also to the American public, is restore that confidence and their ability to protect our political leaders.",
