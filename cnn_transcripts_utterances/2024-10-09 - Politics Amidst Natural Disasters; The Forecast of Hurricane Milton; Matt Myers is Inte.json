He will brief in just minutes as Hurricane Milton is now just hours away from making landfall. The outer bands already being felt. We've had our correspondents, you know, in pretty heavy rain already. The winds are starting to pick up.The director of the National Hurricane Center told us that some of the storm surge, as the high tide comes in and out over the next 12 hours, they will get some very high storm surge even as early as this afternoon. So, this is fully on at this point. This hurricane already starting to have an impact. We are following every twist and turn. And it is worth noting, this is all taking place, what, 26, 27 days before a presidential election. All of it intertwined. With us now, Scott Jennings, CNN's senior political commentator, former special assistant to President George W. Bush, and Kate Bedingfield, CNN political commentator, former White House communications director. You've both been in the White House when there are events like this beyond ones control. Scott, let me just start with you. I just have to imagine - and Ron DeSantis is set to speak any minute, and we'll go there when he does - the campaigns can't operate separately from this. They have to be aware of this. I don't know if they pause for today or tomorrow and let this land, but what do you do?",

I mean, this is the kind of historic storm that, you know, some people aren't going to survive it. There's going to be wide-spread property devastation. And you have to just show the empathy that people would expect out of the American president. So that's, I think, campaign communications, number one. Number two, what you can't do is try to insert politics into this. AndI think, honestly, this week, when Kamala Harris attacked Ron DeSantis as he was preparing for this hurricane, that was a huge campaign mistake for her. She should not have done that. Biden came out and corrected the record, said he and DeSantis are working well together. That was the proper response.",

I think if we're talking about not inserting politics into this conversation, I mean, that has unfortunately been what Donald Trump has done from the start here in spreading all of this misinformation, disinformation, confusing people who are on the ground in these areas who need assistance, need help.You know, so for - for Harris, I think the key here is to allow the government, allow the Biden administration, to run the response, which they have been incredibly aggressive about, despite what Donald Trump has - has tried to say. You know, you've had Republicans from Governor Kemp to Congressman Edwards, who represents western North Carolina, you've had Republicans come out and debunk some of the lies that Trump has told and say that they've been working effectively with the federal government. So, I think, you know, you take a step back today. You don't do the hyper political campaigning if you're the Harris campaign. You let the government respond, get people the - the help that they need. And then you reinforce that, you know, in your administration, moving forward, governments always going to be there to support people in this time of crisis. But absolutely, politics should take a backseat over the next couple of days.",

You know, I worked for President Biden when he went to Florida in 2022 in the wake of the hurricane there, went to Sanibel Island or nearby, you know, met with Governor DeSantis. They stood together behind a podium and talked about the support for that community. President Biden said, we'll be there. You know, the federal government will be there to help you rebuild.So, you know, these are actually moments where people see their leaders doing the right think, working across the aisle, responding effectively to a catastrophic - potentially we're looking at a catastrophic situation over the next 24, 36 hours.

That's going to continue throughout the day and it is going to get worse very quickly this afternoon into this evening. Forecasters fear that this could be one of the strongest storms - strongest hurricanes to ever hit Florida. Record and potentially deadly storm surge is expected. People have been evacuating for days. Derek Van Dam standing by with me right now. But some people are still sticking around. The county sheriff that I spoke to earlier today was pleading with them to get out. You might be uncomfortable, but you'll at least be alive is what he said, and safe.

CLARE DUFFY, CNN BUSINESS WRITER:  Yes, so this is a really important safety alert for anybody in the path of the storm who has an iPhone 14 or later. You need to make sure that you upgrade it to IOS 18. That's going to allow you to use this satellite messaging feature that will let you get messages out to your friends and family and emergency services if cell networks and internet networks go down. So, make this - people should make this part of their storm prep today. You've got to update your iPhone to IOS 18, and then you can go into your settings and actually do a demo of this satellite messaging feature so that you know how it works if and when you need to use it. To use the satellite messaging feature, you should just hold your iPhone in your hand, you don't have to hold it up to the sky or anything, hold it in your hand, and you need to have a clear view of the sky and of the horizon. And it may take a little bit longer for messages to go through, but they will go through. And folks should also update their emergency contacts, things like that in their phone, so that those things can get through to emergency services if they end up needing them.",
