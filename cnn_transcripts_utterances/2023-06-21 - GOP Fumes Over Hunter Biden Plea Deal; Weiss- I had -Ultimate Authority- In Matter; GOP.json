Republicans say there is no chance that Biden's will get off that easy.Plus, so much for that thought. The president says Xi Jinping is a dictator, China calls it an absurd provocation. And King Salman private jets and a Wall Street Journal op-ed. New reporting reveals Justice Samuel Alito took a lavish free trip with a Republican billionaire who later had business before the Supreme Court. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. Up first, justice and a partisan divide over whether it's been served or severed. Yesterday DOJ revealed that Hunter Biden struck a plea deal. Today that deal is at the center of a big fight over the Justice Department fairness and what should happen now. Mr. Biden's attorney calls the deal the end result of five years of diligent dogged fair work. This morning, the attorney general weighed in for the very first time saying, he left the Biden matter entirely in the hands of the Trump appointed U.S. attorney in Delaware. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

What are you hearing today so far? MANU RAJU, CNN CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENTThey have yet to provide evidence to tie the two together, but they are digging for that, and they believe that they will ultimately come up with it. The question that they have is what to the U.S. attorney in Delaware when he initiated this investigation under then President Donald Trump. What did he find? And why did he not pursue some of those questions that they have? So, the big question at the moment from Congressman Jim Jordan, chairs the House Judiciary Committee and Congressman James Comer, chairs the House Oversight Committee, both key committees investigating this matter are always, what does the Justice Department mean when they say this investigation into Hunter Biden is still quote on going. Because if this investigation is ongoing, it will be difficult for them potentially to get the records that they are seeking. So, that is one issue that James Comer is planning to try to figure out behind the closed doors. He's meeting with his attorneys today. And also, for Jim Jordan, who has yet to decide whether at what point to try to bring the U.S. attorney himself, David Weiss to come testify before the House Judiciary Committee. That is an ongoing discussion. Jordan indicating that he wants to see the actual plea entered in court of Hunter Biden before deciding on those next steps. And also, Dana, other Republican efforts as well in the House Ways and Means Committee tomorrow, they plan to go behind closed doors to look into allegations from an IRS whistleblower alleging that the Hunter Biden investigation over his tax issues was mishandled. So, what they actually come out of that remains to be seen. But it is Dana worth noting, not all Republicans are on the same page over all this. One of them, Senator Mitt Romney telling me yesterday that he does not believe the efforts to tried to conflate the Donald Trump's situation with the Hunter Biden situation is the right way to go. So that he said the Republicans need to be more selective in what they decide to criticize.",

Really interesting to see and hear the way Republicans on Capitol Hill have jumped on this. [12:05:00] I just want to play a little bit more of what our colleagues on the Hill are gathering from those Republican members, particularly in the House, but also the Senate. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. NANCY MACE, (R-SC): A lot of people, they get smacked with a gun charge. They don't get to walk away like Hunter Biden. REP. MIKE TURNER, (R-OH): This is a ridiculous sweetheart deal. They didn't even bring charges against Hunter until they already had this deal buttoned up, which is basically giving him a free pass. REP. JIM JORDAN, (R-OH): That's the big overall overarching concern is this double standard that the American people now see clearly and know that it exists. SEN. JOHN KENNEDY, (R-LA): They've made a very good deal. And he sucked it up like a hoover deluxe, and I don't -- I came by me. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

When you listen to lawmakers on Capitol Hill, especially the ones who are in-charge of the investigations like Jim Jordan and James Comer. They have a very specific outcome that they want out of this. They want to have an investigation that substantiates corruption, which is a huge accusation, bribery, that's a huge accusation.And I just think that that is the objective that I think the Republican base wants, that's what they believe they were elected to do. That's why they're in those chairmanships. However, the Justice Department has a completely different job to do. I mean, if they bring a case against anyone, whether it's Hunter Biden or anyone else, they have to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law, or they do what they did with Hunter Biden, which is get to a plea deal. And it just seems very clear that after five years, which is an extraordinary amount of time, they were not able to substantiate some of these huge accusations against Hunter Biden. And anything less than bribery and corruption is never going to satisfy the Hill. And that's just the reality of the politics.",

I think that was very evident yesterday, when we saw Manu, speaking with Speaker McCarthy, and he repeatedly kept pointing out this was overseen by a Trump appointed U.S. attorney. And yet the allegations are going to continue.And so, from the White House's perspective, look, this brings an end to some uncertainty that has hung over the president for and his administration for the last two and a half years. But it certainly will not end the political side of this. And the White House is very much aware of the fact that congressional Republicans are going to continue to push and prod and probe on this matter, trying to substantiate the allegations that so far have not come true in any sense of the word in terms of tying any of this to Joe Biden, or even validating some of the corruption allegations related to Hunter Biden. But this White House knows that this is going to continue. It's going to be something that they have to continue to push back on. But at least now they can say, look, a U.S. attorney appointed by the previous administration looked into this, they charged, and they found the plea deal with Hunter Biden.

And so, just because a politician says something doesn't make it true, but if that's the media, you're consuming, and you keep hearing that it's true, you believe it's true.So, there is a significant portion of the electorate that is convinced that Hunter Biden did more than tax on gun related stuff, that there's some kind of a Biden crime family or whatever Trump's expression is, and that anything short of being held accountable for it proves, you know, some sort of conspiracy, and that actually becomes -- that becomes a real issue in terms of voting. But I know there's that new CNN polling today, there really shows the split where the base, the Republican base is in one place, and independent voters as well as Democratic voters are really in a different space. So, I don't know where the rubber meets the road for the general election. But you can understand that this is a motivating factor for the base right now. [12:10:00] BASH: OK, everybody standby. It's very busy on Capitol Hill today. I want to go right there. Testimony from the special counsel who investigated the origins of the Trump, Russia probe, John Durham.

So, he's trying to drive home that point in his testimony today.But as you might expect, Dana, from the House judiciary hearing held with a bunch of cameras, there's a lot of playing politics going on. I mean, Democrats are basically saying that Durham work to keep Donald Trump's talking points alive with far-right conspiracy theorists. They're accusing Republicans of holding this hearing to try to distract from Donald Trump's indictment. And we heard from House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan, who is basically still saying that he has concerns about how the FBI continues to handle investigations, including how the FBI handled the search of Donald Trump's home at Mar-a-Lago. Now, there was also an interesting moment where John Durham was essentially asked if he wanted to defend the attorney general who appointed him, Bill Barr. Take a listen? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP.

Biden made that comment at a California fundraiser last night, recounting Xi's reaction to the Chinese spy balloon that was shot down earlier this year.He said in part, the reason why Xi Jinping got very upset in terms of when I shot that balloon down with two boxcars full of spy equipment in it is if he didn't know it was there. That's what the great embarrassment was for dictators. U.S. officials tell CNN's Kevin Liptak that they're surprised by the president's comments, specifically that he revealed what had been private intelligence in public and more broadly about Biden's remarks on China, barely a day after the secretary of state, his Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Xi Jinping in Beijing and that trip was reportedly aimed at reducing tensions. CNN's Arlette Saenz joins us live from the White House. So, Arlette, what is the strategy here? Is there any part of this that could be a game of diplomatic chess that we are not seeing? Maybe it's intentional?",

But then the president went a bit further last night when he used that dictator label in his explanation. Of course, the president does tend to speak a little bit more freely and candidly at these fundraisers, where the cameras are off. But these comments do come at a complicated Kayden (Ph) moment as it was just days ago, that Secretary of State Antony Blinken was on this visit to China to try to smooth over some of the tensions over that Chinese spy balloon incident, over some of the close calls that the Chinese and U.S. military have had in the air in the sea in recent weeks. Now, these comments from the president have earned a fierce rebuke very swiftly from the Chinese government, with a Chinese foreign ministry saying things like calling it absurd, also accusing them of engaging in an open political provocation. And saying that the comments from the president violated diplomatic etiquette. I think the question forward is how exactly these comments from President Biden will impact those relations with China. The president himself has openly talked about how he has hoped that there will be a thaw in these relations, in these conversations between the U.S. and China as they are remaining great competitors. But certainly, this moment adds another wrinkle to an already very tense relationship.",
