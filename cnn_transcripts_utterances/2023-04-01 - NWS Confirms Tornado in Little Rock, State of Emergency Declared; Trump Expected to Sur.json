Across parts of the southeast, we still have tornado watches up until nine o'clock Eastern time. Eight o'clock central time for parts of Georgia back into Alabama. We've had several Severe Thunderstorm Warnings this morning capable of producing wind gusts near 60 miles per hour in small hail. We're still watching the storms continue to track off to the north and east, holding that threaten areas in yellow. That includes places like Philadelphia, up into Syracuse back into Pittsburgh, these are areas that are most vulnerable for that tornado threat later this afternoon. The greatest threats however, wind and hail, and that will stretch down into parts of the southeast rolling into northern Florida later this afternoon as well. So that's that red hashed area that you're seeing that whole line ahead of the cold front moves in. That's round one for the Northeast. We're waiting until the afternoon. And that's five, six o'clock late afternoon, early evening when the storms really start to ramp up. And we can expect that to bring in some of the stronger storms for the Northeast.

But it's not clear just yet if there will be cameras allowed inside the courtroom itself to see Donald Trump faces charges for the first time. We also know that even on Friday, there was heavy security and lockdowns inside of the courthouse. Some of the areas were cleared out. And it's very likely that the courthouse itself will have a lot of restrictions and many restrictions particularly around Trump himself, to protect him as he's going through this process. On Tuesday, he is going to be read his charges. Once he's processed once he's arrested formally, and he's fingerprinted and photographed when he appears before the judge. He's going to learn for the first time what he's charged with and get the opportunity to enter his initial plea, which at this stage is almost always not guilty.

So one question is, will they try to pair it with the federal campaign violation idea, which is what Michael Cohen was found guilty for, and was went to prison for all they based on other state charges. And when you hear all the debate about there being a novel legal theory, that's really the novel aspect is whether they'll try to pair the New York State charge with the federal campaign violation charge.

Obviously, it's quite different when you're in court facing an actual legal proceeding. But politically, he will use the same playbook and he could have basically the same effect.I mean, these arguments have been very persuasive for Republican voters all the way through, they have not been that persuasive for voters outside of the circle of the Republican coalition, all the way through. And, you know, you can see the GOP dilemma or conundrum very much in one single poll result, which is NPR, PBS Marist last week, 80% of Republicans agreed that this is a witch hunt. 56% of the country overall disagreed that the investigations broadly into Trump are a witch hunt and consider them a fair -- a fair probe and fair inquiry. And that is the dilemma facing the Republican Party, that the mounting legal troubles for Donald Trump are improving his position as a candidate for the nomination, and may be simultaneously weakened him as a potential general election nominee.",

I do think that the judge will be very careful in what kind of gag order if they do issue one, while it's certainly within their authority to do so. And it's certainly, you know, questionable for Trump to be making threats, intimidating witnesses, which might actually be the basis for other charges.The judge is going to be cognizant of his first amendment rights, and particularly the rights of someone who's trying to campaign just how broad of a gag order they might issue. Now, we might look to the Roger Stone example where he had posted a threatening image of the judge there. And she basically said he couldn't post anymore. So I would be looking for the judge to do things incrementally rather than the sort of standard, you know, comprehensive gag order. I'd suspect the judge will probably be telling the lawyers don't be talking on the courtroom steps doing a press conference after every hearing to try and keep the integrity of the proceeding proper.",

I mean, you know, the dynamic as Victor's throughout his presidency, was whenever Trump would do something outrageous or inappropriate or crashing through norms, a chorus of Republican leaders would rise up to defend him and the most, that those who are critical of him in the party would do is stay silent. And that's what we are seeing again. I mean, you know, the most you get from Mitch McConnell is strategic silence while you get all of these voices getting up and saying that this is unfair to him. And that kind of drives the party in that direction. But again, it's important to remember that when you get out of kind of the conservative media, you know, bubble or distortion field, there -- that is not the dominant opinion among Americans overall. And this is only the beginning of this process. I mean, Republican leaders have gone to these extraordinary lengths to try to discredit and impede this investigation. They may have to do this two or three more times before anybody votes as other investigations reach their conclusion. And you do wonder about the cumulative effect of that not only on -- on Trump, but on kind of the public perception of the party's willingness to uphold any kind of standards and set any kind of limits on him if he is elected again.",

The West has a solid seven votes on the council. What it has to do to get the nine is to pick up an African country or Latin American country, and over the past year, the West has generally been able to do that.",

      "sentences": "Victor and Amara, this is some much needed good news on the inflation front. And it comes from the inflation gauge that the Federal Reserve watches most closely. That's the PCE index. It showed that prices were up by 0.3 percent between January and February, that is a significant cooldown from the month before.Over the prior 12 months, prices were up by 5 percent. Now, normally 5 percent inflation is nothing to celebrate, it's more than twice as hot as what is considered healthy inflation. But we of course are not in normal times. And if you look at the trend, you can see that it is moving in the right direction. Inflation is cooling off. This is actually the coolest annual inflation rating for this metric since September of 2021. And that does suggest that some of the Feds tough medicine is starting to work. Though it may not be working quick, fast enough for many Americans who are dealing with a high cost of living right now, especially at the grocery store. And we did just learn that the mood of consumers darkened in March, consumer sentiment falling to a four month low. That's according to the University of Michigan, which interestingly enough, found just a limited impact from the bank failures, the biggest bank failure since 2008. Now while consumers may not be overly concerned at this point about the bank crisis, some economists are worried about the risk of a credit crunch, which would make it more expensive and harder for all of us to borrow. It would potentially slow the economy and might even raise the risk of a recession. The big question at this point is whether or not the Federal Reserve is worried enough about a credit crunch and satisfied enough about cooling inflation that it decides to pause its interest rate hiking campaign. Victor and Amara?",

Jeanna, good to have you. So let's walk through some of the indicators, some of the variables that we learned this week. The personal consumption expenditures Price Index, something that we only talk about once a month, excluding food and energy increased 0.3 percent down from the 0.5 percent, from the earlier report, how important of a single metric is this to the Fed? And what do you make of that number 0.3 percent from January?",

That said, I think it's important to note that we have a long time before the Feds next meeting. It doesn't happen until May. We'll get more information on inflation before that.And so I think the real key here is to see whether this slowdown is sustained. You know, whether this is a signal that really, things are starting to turn the corner and continuing to turn the corner and that we're on this sort of path toward cooler and more comfortable inflation. And, you know, like Matt just said, we're still at a pretty high annual rate. So I think we're going to need to continue to see progress like this for the Fed to really feel comfortable taking their foot off the brake here.",

And so I think the big unanswered question that's going to be looming ahead of all of us between now and that May decision is just how profound that impact is.
