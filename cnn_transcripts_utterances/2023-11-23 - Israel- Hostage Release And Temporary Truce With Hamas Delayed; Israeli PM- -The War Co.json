I'm Paula Newton and we have breaking coverage this hour up first Israel's temporary truce with Hamas and the expected release of hostages held in Gaza now delayed. Israel says that process will not start before Friday. The update came just hours before humanitarian pause and fighting and the initial release of 50 women and children hostages was expected to begin. Now both us and Israeli officials point to what they say are logistical details for the delay while one Israeli official says Israel has not yet received the names of the first hostages to be freed. Now, ahead of the expected truce, Israeli forces continued ground and air operations Wednesday striking parts of northeastern and central Gaza. Though Palestinians say areas further south were also hit.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed confidence that the deal would soon go into effect. And he made clear the war against Hamas is far from over. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (voice-over): Citizens of Israel, I like to be clear the war continues. The war continues. We will continue with it until all our goals are achieved. To bring back the hostages, to demolish Hamas and ensure that the day afterwards, there is no source that educates terror to children and they terrorists. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

I'll build them into the human, into the civilian population, and you, me, the world will then tell Israel, you have to stop. You can't rescue hostages. You can't even destroy the Hamas terror capability, because Hamas built their terror capabilities into the civilian population.It's like giving the recipe of where the terrorists should build their capabilities. So I'm not saying in any way as a mother or as a human being, that I in any way want ever, and I never will target civilians, but you have to act against that type of terror capability. You can't allow it to grow. That would be a terrible lesson, let alone right now, it won't let the hostages out. It won't help the people of the Gaza Strip. And I agree the price is horrible, and there is no other way to do it. If we wanted to kill everybody in the Gaza Strip and find our hostages, then we wouldn't have soldiers in the ground operation, working slowly and systematically. You could do it in a different way and sarcasm doesn't work well, on TV or anywhere. We're working systematically. We're telling civilians to move. You're right, civilians absolutely have been horribly hurt. This is a war that civilians in Israel have been horribly hurt. It is a war.

Hamas meantime released a statement on Wednesday saying the deal involves hundreds of trucks, carrying aid medical supplies and fuel to parts of the enclave.

OF EXTERNAL RELATIONS AND COMMUNICATIONS AT UNRWA: Any halt in the act of hostilities is welcomed by everyone, especially by the people of Gaza, who have been through hell over the last seven weeks now. What we are expecting is if we do get the security guarantees that we need, we want to be able to go over the entire strip, the North, the middle, and the South. For the last few weeks, we've only been active in the middle in the south areas after the northern part of the strip has been completely sealed. We've been able to deliver food, some clean drinking water and to provide medical services, mostly through our mobile clinics and nine of our 25 health centers, because the rest of them are in the north and they've been closed.

Because of the volume of the calls, people weren't getting through. So we've started making promo announcements. If you can't get through, send us a voicemail to your WhatsApp. ELBAGIR: In the horrifying aftermath of the Hamas attack, Israel not only carried out mass detentions of Palestinians, but it's denying prisoners all family contact. This is the only way their families can reach out. The sheer volume of messages evidence of the realities of imprisonment here. Israeli law allows Palestinian prisoners to be detained indefinitely without trial or stated charge. The families don't even know whether the prisoners get to hear their messages. But that doesn't stop them from sending. The Israel Hamas hostage swap exchanging 150 Israeli-held Palestinian prisoners, women, and teenagers for 50 Hamas held hostages means that for now there is some help for both Israeli and Palestinian families.

SULTAN BARAKAT, CENTER FOR CONLICT AND HUMANITARIAN STUDIES, DOHA INSTITUTE: Yes. Well, it's very important, I think, to include those Palestinian prisoners, because of the moral messages since to the rest of the world, that when we talk about Hamas, having taken hostage hostages from Israel, it's also important to remember that for many decades, Israel has had the practice of imprisoning young people women indefinitely without putting them for trial or having any charges against them. And I think this is a point that maybe Hamas particularly (inaudible) wanted to score, and has been very successful through this pose to make it. Because right from the beginning, when he came out and tried to explain the reason for the attack on Israel, he caught it two objectives. One was the trying to prevent Israelis from further attacking a lot (inaudible), and the second was to release women and children from Israeli prisons, which, of course, he was particularly concerned about having spent much of his life in prison.
