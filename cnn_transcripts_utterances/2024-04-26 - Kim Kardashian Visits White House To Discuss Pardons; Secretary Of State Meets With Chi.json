George Conway talks about this. And he actually did very much the same view that David is taking, which is that this was an exercise and kicking the tires on every hypothetical to figure.

Remember (inaudible) oh, they're going to send it back. It's going to kick the trial down the road. That's horrible, because the country needs to see this trial. Fine. But I do think it makes this, this a subjective analysis if you will, allows for this kind of long trial within the trial to make a determination as to what's official act, what's non-official act, and therefore the private acts are criminal.

MICHAEL SMERCONISH, HOST, CNN'S SMERCONISH: I think its cowardice. And my heart breaks for those students. Because if you do the simple math, the class of 2024 college graduates, they were high school graduates in 2020 for the most part, which means Kasie, they did not have a high school graduation because of COVID. So they were robbed of a COVID graduation because of an act of God. And now they're robbed of a college graduation because of the situation on campus. I thought it was a mistake when they canceled the speech by the valedictorian. They cited safety concerns then, from a distance, it looks like more of a speech concern. But I just think it's terrible. And I have to also note this, I can't help but wonder if there's some astroturfing taking place here. I watched an interview on CNN two days ago. There was a senior citizen, who was interviewed on campus having shown up to rally in support of the students. How many of those are actually students on the USC campus?

And there was not a single day of his presidency when he had even 50 percent approval in any reputable poll, Rasmussen doesn't count. And this has always been that there has been this effort around Trump to conjure up this idea of some kind of populist hero, but he's the world's most consistently unpopular populist ever. Americans have rejected him again and again. And I'm optimistic and even confident that they will do it again in 2024.",

Because we do have some new CNN polling that shows that people are concerned that this is -- this is a hush money trial. 28 percent of people say that a conviction here should disqualify him from the presidency. When you look at January 6, that number is up at 47 percent.We also have some new numbers, looking at whether or not people think he's getting a fair trial here. And it really does seem to underscore that people are now just as divided over our court system. See, only 7 percent are very confident that there can be a fair verdict in Trump's hush money trial. Now when you kind of break down those additional, you know, third to third a quarter, that's going to reflect and we can kind of see in those numbers that there is some reflection of partisan leanings in terms of what you believe about this.",

It's like, there's like the breakdown of people who thought he was being treated too harshly, was exactly the same as people who thought he was being treated not harshly enough, right. And so, look, I think that the American people, right, we have to update our analysis.So I've been hearing a lot of people say like, this always just helps Trump, right? This always helps Trump. And in the primary that was true, because it crowded out the other candidates being able to make their points and it rallied people to Donald Trump. We are now in a general election environment in which it is slightly different. And you have to think about marginal voters. Now look, this case was always the least serious of all the cases. And so for this to be the only one that goes forward, that's not great. That doesn't mean that it has zero impact though. And I'll just make one last point, which is one of the things that's interesting to me that I'm hearing in the focus groups, especially from women, is that the Stormy Daniels case does remind people that Trump is really gross to women. OK, that now was coupled with a major policy issue where women have to have trust in their leader because of the abortion issue. And I think that cross cutting can actually hurt him in the general election. FRUM: I don't think we should pull for hypothetical questions, because people don't in fact, think about or know the answer to the question. How will I feel when the news media describes Donald Trump everyday as convicted felon Donald Trump? Would that -- is a fact not an assertion he's a convict when -- when and if he is a convicted felon? How will I feel, you don't know the answer to that question because you don't know your future yourself.",
