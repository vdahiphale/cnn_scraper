      "sentences": "Stephanie Elam, thank you so much for the latest there.The intensity of those Santa Ana winds, coupled with nearly a year of dry brush, are driving the rapid spread of these fires. In these images from CAL FIRE, you can hear, just listen there, that is the fury of the winds that have been carrying embers all around and starting fires. Joining us now is climate scientist Michael E. Mann. He is the director of the Penn Center for Science Sustainability and the media at the University of Pennsylvania. He's also the author of \"Our Fragile Moment, How Lessons from Earth's Past Can Help Us Survive the Climate Crisis.\" And, Michael, I wonder when you're looking at this, how does climate change contribute to this perfect firestorm? MICHAEL E. MANN, CLIMATE SCIENTIST: Yes, hi, Brianna. It's good to be with you, although I wish it was under better circumstances. We're certainly seeing a tragedy play out. And when we see these sorts of events, these massive wildfires, 15 of the worst 20 wildfires have occurred during the last 15 years in California. And so there's a clear trend towards these faster spreading, hotter burning, more destructive, more deadly wildfires. And as is always the case, there's an underlying factor and there's an immediate factor. And it's the interaction between those two that give you these extreme events. The underlying factor is, as you already alluded to, profound drought, very dry conditions, an extremely late start to the winter rainy season. It basically hasn't started and we're already into January. And there's a key meteorological variable that we look at, which is called the evaporative demand. It's basically how dry and thirsty the atmosphere is. And that correlates highly with wildfire potential. And we're seeing very high levels of evaporative demand, precisely in those regions where these wildfires have broken out. Now, the immediate factor, these winds, the Santa Ana winds, and we can't say those are caused by climate change. It's a natural occurrence, but it's the synergy between that natural occurrence, the Santa Ana winds, that immediate factor, and the underlying dry conditions that are definitely related to a trend of drier conditions in California, the Western U.S., caused by human-caused warming, due primarily to the burning of fossil fuels.",

And I wonder if you can explain or kind of fact-check for us, because we are hearing from President-elect Trump, who is blaming Governor Gavin Newsom and saying that this is about water policy to protect threatened species.

Yes, there are, in answer to your question. So, you know, this is obviously -- there's police here. There's fire personnel here. And this actually, you know, I mean, it's strange to say, this corner is now better than it was in terms of safety for anybody on it than it was 30 minutes ago. That location, even that location where we were five minutes ago, you know, that's a much less safe location now, just in the last few seconds, because now the winds have picked up and that whole area is just completely blackened. And you can hear that crackling. But a number of these houses, I mean, look, we've been watching very carefully this north side of the street on Harriet and Glen, mainly these houses on Harriet and a couple of them going a little bit northward on Glen and so far, they are untouched. And that's obviously a great blessing for all those folks. They have also evacuated, thankfully. But it's a real question of just what happens over here, particularly without water.
