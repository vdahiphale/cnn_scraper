We're joined by the brother of Brian Sicknick, the Capitol police officer who died after being assaulted during the January 6th attacks. And later, exactly one year after Russia wrongfully detained a Wall Street Journal reporter, a talk with the sister of Evan Gershkovich. Good evening, I'm Jim Sciutto, in for Anderson. Two breaking developments involving former President Trump's criminal trials this evening. First is whether the former president can continue his harassment of the daughter of the judge overseeing his hush money trial, a woman with no actual connection to the case whom Trump has falsely accused of attacking him. Tonight, the Manhattan DA's office has asked the judge to confirm that she is covered by a gag order issued on Tuesday. Trump's team indicates they may file a challenge to what they claim would be an expansion of that order. Kara Scannell joins us now with the latest. Kara, can you first remind people exactly what Trump has been saying about and how he's been attacking the judge's daughter?",

In one of those posts, Trump was saying that the judge was compromised. He also called out the judge's daughter by her name. And he was saying that she was working for Democratic operatives and is a Trump-hating person.Now, she has worked - she does work for an organization that does do work with Democratic campaigns. But he also made comments about her in one of his statements that she was - that she had posted a photo of him behind bars on a Twitter account. Now, a spokesman for the court said that that was not her Twitter account. She had deleted it more than a year ago. So it's unclear who was making these posts. But those were some of the statements that Trump has made about the judge and his daughter, Jim.",

Now, prosecutors are asking the judge to step in here. They say in a letter to the judge, \"The people believe that the March 26 order is properly read to protect family members of the Court. But to avoid any doubt - this court should now clarify or confirm that the Order protects family members of the Court, the District Attorney, and other individuals mentioned in the Order.\" Now, Trump's team is pushing back, saying that it's clear that this gag order does not include them. And they write to the judge to confirm or clarify the meaning of the gag order in the way people suggest would be to expand it. And so they're saying to the judge, if you are going to consider this, the people's, the district attorney's filing, they want an opportunity to respond in legal briefs to challenge this, because their point is that Donald Trump has not violated this gag order.

I'm joined now by former U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin and former Trump campaign advisor, David Urban. Thanks so much for taking the time this evening to join us. Judge, first, this is a pattern with the former president and a whole host of trials that he's been involved in, as well as other public attacks on people that get on his wrong side. And we know that oftentimes that public rhetoric is followed by genuine threats to the safety of those people that have been targeted. I want to ask you, as a member of the legal profession as a judge, the significance of a public attack like this on a judge presiding over a case and that judge's family. SHIRA SCHEINDLIN, FORMER U.S. DISTRICT COURT JUDGE: Yes. Well, that's exactly the danger here. If you're going to name the person and the person can be found, that person is at risk and there have been violent attacks on judges and their families over the years. One of the judges from the Southern District was murdered. A judge in New Jersey, her son was murdered. A judge in Chicago lost family members. So the threats are real and we know that Trump's followers occasionally will turn to threats and send threatening letters to Judge Engoron and his family, and his law clerk. So these threats could be real and that's serious. So how does it affect a judge? Well, a judge knows that they're in a high profile case and they can get protection if they need it and their family can get protection if they need it. But a judge does their job and I'm sure Judge Merchan will continue to do what he's doing.",

They demand an appeals court not only disqualify Willis, but her entire office. Nick Valencia joins us now from Atlanta with the details. Nick, what exactly are former President Trump and his co-defendants claiming in this appeal? NICK VALENCIA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, first we knew this was coming because Judge Scott McAfee granted a certificate for immediate review, but now it's official. And in this filing, former President Trump and eight of his remaining 14 co-defendants, including his former chief of staff, Mark Meadows, and his former attorney, Rudy Giuliani, they're making the case to a Georgia appellate court to, again, remove Fani Willis from this case. And here's what they're saying in part of the filing, which is just downright scathing. \"DA Willis has covered herself and her office in scandal and disrepute. The trial court's decision not to disqualify DA Willis under these circumstances is a structural error, a violation of the Defendant's due process rights, and seriously denigrates the public's confidence in the integrity of the criminal justice system.\" Look, we did reach out to the DA's office. They declined to comment. We could only anticipate a very pointed response from DA Willis.
