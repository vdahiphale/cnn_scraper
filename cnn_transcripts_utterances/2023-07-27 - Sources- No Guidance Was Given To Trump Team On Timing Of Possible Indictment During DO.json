The former President's lawyers apparently remain in the dark about the timing of the potential Trump indictment.Also tonight, tough questions for the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Is he willing to accept the fallout from his controversial judicial overall that has unleashed widespread protests, military opposition and tensions with the United States? Standby for my one on one interview with Netanyahu, that's coming up this hour. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM. We begin with the federal grand jury investigation of Donald Trump and 2020 election interference. A D.C. district court official says indictments are not, repeat, not expected today. But there's been a flurry of activity over at the courthouse here in Washington, including that meeting between the Special Counsel Jack Smith and Trump's lawyers. CNN Senior Justice Correspondent Evan Perez is with me here in THE SITUATION ROOM following all of this. You've been keeping a very close eye on what's going on? Where do things stand right now?",

We're told by sources that they -- that they made the case, that an indictment of the former president, which is what everyone expects, including they -- including them, that that would be disruptive, and that would be bad for the country. It was sort of a last gasp, so to speak for the former president and his legal team to make that case, again, anticipating because they received a target letter in the last couple of weeks, and that the grand jury was sitting today. We saw the grand jury there all day today, Wolf, they just a few minutes ago started leaving the courthouse. As you pointed out, the court official told or Katelyn Polantz and the group of the reporters there today that there was no grand jury, there was no indictment that was handed up by the grand jury today.And so we don't know what this means. We don't know whether that one is coming in the coming days. There is no clarification on that. We do know, Wolf, that during this meeting today with the special counsel team, Trump's team did not get any indication that an indictment was coming today or when it would be coming. They also don't believe at the result -- as a result of this -- of this interaction, that they changed any minds. So, the issue is now that we're basically just waiting to see when Jack Smith decides to take the action that everyone anticipates he will be taking.",

It's not likely to change the minds of where prosecutors were going. And I was actually told Trump wasn't interested in having his legal team go and meet with the special counsel's team initially.You know, it was 11 days ago, he got that target letter, and he just didn't seem to think that there would be much benefit in it believing, you know, this third indictment was inevitable in his view. But despite that, they still did go and meet, it was Todd Blanche, John Lauro, those are Trump's two latest attorneys meeting with them for about an hour and Jack Smith was in the room. But I was told, Wolf, they weren't going in there to argue the facts of the case or say, you know, you're wrong on this, you're wrong on this measure, but instead to broadly make the argument that an indictment, a federal indictment, another one of the former president, they believe would cause more turmoil in the country. Of course, the idea of whether or not Jack Smith was receptive to that message, we don't know that and we don't believe that -- we don't have any reason to believe, I should say, that it changes the nature of this investigation in the direction of it.",

They had a similar meeting around the time to the last time that Trump was indicted by Jack Smith's team. Obviously, they are in the documents investigation, Wolf.And essentially they're waiting to see what this is going to look like. But for Trump himself, it's kind of this foregone conclusion that he does believe an indictment is going to happen here. I mean, he is believed that since he got that target letter, not this past Sunday, but the one before that. And of course, the question here is what this defense is going to look like and what he was hinting at today saying he was being advised by many lawyers, obviously, that could be potentially pointing at those figures who had his ear in those weeks before the election, but certainly obviously after it, people who not only had his ear, but they were inside the Oval Office, they were invited into the White House, and he was connecting them with state officials, Republican state officials who we know have also spoken to Jack Smith's team. So I think that has really been the focus there. The question, of course, is what the defense here is going to look like. And I should note, one of those attorneys who is in the room today is John Lauro. He is a very recent addition to the legal team.

Also, shouldn't indictment come, and I don't have to speculate about this, we actually have two recent data points of Manhattan indictment and a federal indictment in the Mar-a-Lago case, it tends to galvanize his supporters, juice his grassroots donations to his campaign, which is -- which is no small advantage for him to have as well.

And so we're trying to bring it back in line.And we don't want a subservient court. We want an independent court, but not an all-powerful court. And that's what the corrections that we're doing. I think a lot of the things that you described are, you know, are in the choir, people are saying that they're giving indications, but I've been there before.

So presumably, Jack Smith believes he has proof beyond a reasonable doubt that this person acted intending to break the law, whether it's obstruction of justice, or some sort of documents related charge. The other thing to keep in mind looking at the bigger tactical picture here, the more defendants in this case, and this would be a third defendant along with Donald Trump and Walt Nauta, that's now one more person with an even more powerful incentive potentially, to cooperate because before this person was charged, there was really nothing to threaten him with no particular downside. And now, if and when this charge comes through, this person is going to have to make a decision, do I fight this charge and risk potential jail time? Or do I try to help my own bottom line by cooperating?So this gives Jack Smith and his team potentially some more leverage and Donald Trump potentially one more thing to worry about.",

So as you continue to add people to this indictment, those and the -- our theory is that Carlos De Oliveira has been added. He has the opportunity, yes, it goes through the same process that everyone else has, right. So he needs to be arraigned, he needs to have an attorney, those attorneys will likely have to go through the same process of submitting background forms to get access to classified material, because we know that's at the heart of this case.So those are all opportunities to add time to the process that we've already seen stretched out from an attempted trial date of December, and now we're looking at May. So it could play to the disadvantage of the prosecutors and in terms of adding a person that now has another opportunity to slow things down.",
