(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA REID, CNN CHIEF LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Former Special Counsel Robert Hur grilled by lawmakers from both sides of the aisle today about his investigation into President Biden's mishandling of classified documents. REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH): Mr. Hur, why did he do it? Why did Joe Biden, your words, willfully retained and disclosed classified materials? I mean, he knew the law, been in office like 50 years. REP. PRAMILA JAYAPAL (D-WA): You exonerated him. I know that the term, willful retention, has -- Mr. Hurr, it's my time.",

They're looking at the underlying crime of willful retention of classified documents, the same crime Donald Trump is being prosecuted for because he has cognitive ability and Joe Biden is not because he is an old man with a bad memory. Number two, they're looking at this from the standpoint of Joe Biden lied to the American people. When he had that press conference after this first came out, he told the American people, I did not disclose classified information to my ghostwriter. He lied about that. And as Jim Jordan said today, he had 8 million reasons to do so because he has $8 million from this book that he's writing. But he did, as we heard from Hur today, he shared this information with his ghostwriter. And, thirdly, they're taking away from this. This is just yet another case. The fact that they're going after Trump for willful retention of classified documents with the Mar-a-Lago case, he is yet another victim of the weaponization of the justice system.

It really amounted to four hours of an opportunity for Democrats to do what Adam Schiff did to remind the public, hey, this guy is a Republican. He was a top lieutenant in Trump's DOJ, and therefore he's politically motivated, but also gave them an opportunity to say that Donald Trump, A, was charged with a crime.

And I thought really effectively there was the attempt to suggest, well, hold on, have you created a new doctrine here by saying that, hold on, I can do whatever I want as long as I return the documents?

Does Poland still feel the United States is a reliable, reliable partner? MARK BRZEZINSKI, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO POLAND: Excellent question, Wolf. And what happened today was remarkable. A Polish president and a Polish prime minister, who are on opposite sides of the political spectrum, traveled to Washington to stand in solidarity with the American president, Joe Biden, to ask Congress to get this supplemental passed. Why? Because for the people of Poland, this is 1939, this is Central Europe being attacked by a vicious foreign attacker, and in this case, it's Russia against Ukraine. And Poland has been sticking its neck out in terms of sending weapons to Ukraine, to the Ukrainians so they can defend themselves, and also, Poland has been welcoming literally millions of refugees who have poured in from Ukraine into Poland. Wolf, you were in Poland last spring. You see the number of refugees on the street, every one of which is welcomed into a Polish home or apartment as a product of national policy. But the Poles expect the Americans to continue to support the Ukrainians, and this is what the Polish president and the Polish prime minister wanted to hear from the American president, and they did. And they also wanted to hear America's firm and total commitment that Article 5, all for one, one for all, Article 5 of the NATO pact is sacrosanct to the Americans, because the Poles are close, they have a history of being left by allies who promised to support them and then didn't, so they are anxious and uncertain.",

So, he was arguing it was a distinction without a difference, in my opinion. Maybe he was auditioning for to be Trump's attorney general. But you can't have a 345-page report that literally lays out charge after charge that you found insufficient evidence to be able to move forward with and then say that somehow that person is not absolved of blame.

But, certainly, we start looking at conditions, real conditions on aid Israel, I would support defensive aid, Iron Dome aid for Israel today, because I think that's important to protect Israelis. But what I won't to do is continue to support United States offensive military aid going in to kill people in Gaza when Benjamin Netanyahu has continued to say that he is completely opposed to a two-state solution.
