      "sentences": "Well, Casey, the Justice Department says it will take all appropriate steps to comply with this decision. In a statement, the Attorney General, Merrick Garland, who has overseen this historic effort to prosecute people who engaged in alleged criminal conduct related to January 6.He says, quote, \"The vast majority of the more than 1,400 defendants charged for their illegal actions on January 6 will not be affected by this decision.\" Now, he's correct about that, but we're still talking about hundreds of people who have been charged with this. There's also 52 people for whom obstruction is their only felony and 27 of them have already been incarcerated. So this decision is certainly some good news for them. We could fully expect their defense attorneys will try to pursue additional proceedings to get those convictions possibly overturned. Unclear, though if they'll be successful. This opinion does leave some wiggle room for prosecutors. The other big question is, of course, how does today's decision impact the January 6 case against former President Trump? Now, he too faces two charges of obstruction, but the conduct that he is charged with is quite different than people who are physically here at the Capitol on January 6. He is charged related to the fake elector scheme. But it's interesting, Kasie, in the opinion of the Chief Justice, John Roberts, he nods to the possibility that the obstruction statute could be violated by creating false evidence, and this complicated opinion to figure out exactly how they can use it to ultimately get it delayed. But, of course, the biggest question for them is another Supreme Court opinion that we expect to get on Monday about whether their client has immunity to protect him from the entire January 6 prosecution.",

Look, I mean, as Paula just pointed out, the Justice Department believes, and they've been preparing for this possibility ever since oral arguments. And they kind of got a sense of where this might be going. One of the things that we heard from them is that they believe that this was a very, very limited impact. They're talking about possibly 249 cases. I think we have a graphic that shows you a little bit of the universe we're talking about. 249 cases that could be affected. There's 52 people who have been sentenced, who've pleaded guilty to just this charge. And so that is, obviously, going to be affected by this. And then there's 27 people who are still serving their sentences, again, who could be affected by this. But keep in mind, for most of these people, there are other crimes, including Fisher, by the way, the defendant who brought this case. There were other crimes or alleged crimes that were that were charged in this -- against these people, including violence, carrying out violence against some of the officers at the Capitol that day. And so the vast majority of cases are not going to be affected. And the Justice Department is now going to have to look to see whether there's going to be a need to perhaps adjust some of those sentences as a result of this.",

In addition to the speech I made, in front of, I believe, the largest crowd I've ever spoken to, and I will tell you, nobody ever talks about that.

I think he sounds most like the 2020 version of himself, the person who lost the White House.And I think it's the thing that you hear on the road people really hold against Donald Trump. You hear about the kind of blocking of the peaceful transfer of power. And I think his attempts to obfuscate that does not wipe away the American memory on that issue. If Joe Biden is able to reframe Donald Trump as the January 6 version of him, that's where they want to be in this political race, because that's the version of Donald Trump Americans dislike the most.",

The rest of us watched it on television. And I think every single person has a memory of it. And that memory may be clouded somewhat by their partisanship, but we all saw what we saw. Now, a lot of Republicans do think that there were people who wound up at the Capitol, who did not commit any violent acts and who didn't do necessarily anything wrong that got caught up in this legal maelstrom. And so you do hear a lot of Republicans say, can't you separate the people who committed violence from the people who didn't? That is a conversation that goes on in the party.

And a lot of people chose to work from home today saying, we're just commiserating and we didn't want to do that at a desk. But we've also been able to speak to some voters here in North Carolina, a state with a growing Black and Hispanic population, with an abundance of college educated suburban voters that the Biden campaign believes it can flip. And the voters here today were not moved by last night's debate. They said they're still steadfastly focused on beating Trump. One that we talked to is even wearing a shirt that said free on Wednesdays. Of course, these events tend to be stocked with party loyalists, local donors, and state party officials, so that's perhaps not surprising.

NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Yeah. And listen, some of this is going to be the folks who are closest to him, right? His wife being somebody. You know, it seems like the only people that can convince Biden to step aside would have the last name Biden. You know, it's probably unlikely. I think Joe Biden has a lot of faith in himself. He has a big ego. He's a stubborn man. He also has a deep faith in Americans. He genuinely believes that when given this choice in November, between him, who is obviously an older man and displayed some of that last night, and Donald Trump, who he sees as corrupt, as an authoritarian, as someone who is a liar, he believes that the majority of Americans in the important swing states will choose Joe Biden.

I mean, Americans have said consistently that they wanted someone else to be the nominee. I mean, if you look at every piece of evidence we've had for the last two years, the majority of Democrats have said they wanted a different nominee, have said they wanted an open primary. Have said that their vote for Biden in 2020 was a sense of an emergency lever and not a sense of eight years. The people who have made the decision to turn that four years into eight years is President Biden and those rounds in the party who have really cleared the way for that. And so I understand that the political system creates an incentive to kind of put the incumbent in the position to do whatever they want to do next. But the American people, based on every piece of evidence we have, have consistently said that that's not where they were. And frankly, they were just not in the equation. And so I think that it's not really fair for us as of now to say, oh, he had a bad debate, what is there to do about it?
