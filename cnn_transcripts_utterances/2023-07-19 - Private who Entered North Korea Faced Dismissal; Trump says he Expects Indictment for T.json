      "sentences": "Welcome to \"First Move\". Fantastic to have you with us for weather weary Wednesday on the show. Temperature recordsbreaking as thermometer readings rise around the world and the July heatwave continues. Meanwhile, a midsummer melting of a different sort underway for global investors M for markets and a melt up with the DOW rising for seven straight sessions. It's actually the strongest advance in more than two years the S&amp;P and the NASDAQ hitting fresh 15 month highs too, amid hopes the United States can avoid recession. Well, that's for bank earnings financial giant Goldman Sachs reporting a rare profit miss a loan disappointment in fact after a whole host of strong Q2 banking results. L for lower inflation summer slowdown in the United Kingdom as prices ease to more than one year lows finally below 8 percent. Remember that still four times the Bank of England's 2 percent target. The rate rises are finally having an impact. And T the Tesla, the EV maker just one of the big tech firms reporting after the closing bell this Wednesday along with Netflix and IBM, I think Tesla investors want more cyber truck and less cage fight with Zuck and all the other nonsense. I'd probably end a poop emoji for that. I'll take it. Ahead of all those tech earnings in the meantime, a bit of pre market green on Wall Street. Strong gains for UK stocks after that encouraging inflation print the FTSE easily outperforming the rest of Europe as you can see there. The NIKKEI meanwhile outperforming in Asia and the HANG SENG easing for a second day with China's slowing economy remaining the focus, mining giant Rio Tinto warned that metal shipments to China are sagging saying China's recovery has fallen short of expectations. That's an interesting indicator. Plenty in the meantime of action across the commodity space wheat futures higher by over 4 percent and up now more than 12 percent over the past five trading sessions. As Ukrainian President Zelenskyy warns Russia is \"Deliberately targeting his country's Grain Deal infrastructure\". Kyiv now saying some 60,000 tons of grain were destroyed overnight in new missile attacks all the details on that in just a moment. But first, we're learning more about the U.S. soldier who the Pentagon says willfully ran across the border into North Korea. Army Private Travis King already faced disciplinary action for assault, and was supposed to be being sent back to the United States. But according to a U.S. official, he made his way to the Joint Border security area in the demilitarized zone and dashed over the demarcation line. Our Will Ripley is very close to the border and spoke with my colleague Christina McFarland, just a short while ago. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): We're still a bit of a distance from the DMZ approaching what's known as the unification bridge. And you can see even less than five miles out you can still there spike strips on the road. There are obviously all of these barricades. Basically, they do not want people getting close to the demilitarized zone, unless they are authorized to do so. Now tour groups they're suspended for the time being. They were allowed in. But there's a lot of protocol, a lot of security checks that you have to go through. And but in fact, if indeed it was at Panmunjom, where this whole incident happened, then this young U.S. Army a private 23-year-old Travis King may have actually stepped across in relatively the same way that President Trump stepped across when he went with Kim Jong-Un, which is just kind of, you know, we don't know if there's video that will ever be released that would show it obviously was probably caught on multiple security cameras, given the sensitivity of this location but whether or not that will ever see the light of day. We don't know. What we also don't know Christina is exactly how long Mr. King is going to be in North Korean custody. Pretty complicated situation, considering the two sides have not had any official lines of communication for a very long time. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Sir Richard Moore told CNN that the Russian President had to cut a \"Humiliating deal to end last month's short lived rebellion\". Nick Paton Walsh is in Prague, and joins us now. Nick, fascinating comments on this! I think it emphasizes the complexity of the relationship between Prigozhin and Vladimir Putin himself. And the fact is the power of his ability to enact this attempted rebellion in the first place. It also makes him a walking symbol of that humiliation for Vladimir Putin.",

And to quote Richard Moore, Sir Richard Moore, the Head of MI6, speaking earlier on today cut a deal to save his own skin. Now, it's important to remind people of the context of that day in which in the morning Wagner were marching with Prigozhin in the lead on Moscow, and then miraculously in the middle of the day, turn their forces around, and the whole thing seemed to be forgiven. But let's hear the words of the Head of a MI6 describing that day. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RICHARD MOORE, MI6 CHIEF: If you look at Putin's behaviors on that day, Prigozhin started off I think, as a traitor at breakfast. He had been pardoned by supper. And then a few days later, he was invited for tea. So there are some things and even the Chief of MI6 finds that a little bit difficult to try and interpret in terms of who's in and who's out?

OK, take a look at this dramatic video of Ukrainian air defenses shooting down Russian cruisemissiles it was recorded by CNN in the Port City of Odessa. The city came under intense Russian bombardment for the second night in a row. And President Zelenskyy says the Kremlin deliberately targeted infrastructure used for exporting Ukrainian grain. Russia of course this week pulled out of an agreement to let grain shipments pass safely through the Black Sea. Joining us now is Clare Sebastian. Clare President Zelenskyy saying that this infrastructure has been deliberately targeted and now we know 60,000 tons of grain was apparently destroyed just in those attacks overnight.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Julia. That's what President Zelenskyy was saying. And we have imagery out from Ukrainian officials aswell showing some damage it seems to port facilities, the Ministry of Communities Territories and Infrastructure saying that both Odessa and the Port of -- also on the Black Sea also included in that Grain Deal were hit. You can see quite significant level of damage there. We had heard earlier in the day, from a Ukrainian official and Odessa that there were missiles that got through that actually hit their targets that damaged a grain terminal, an oil facility and other port infrastructure for the second day running. We're seeing damage to this port. So that I think clearly significant Russia's account, though of this does deviate from that Russia's Ministry of Defense saying that they hit all their targets where of course, the Ukrainian Air Force is saying that they shut down more than half of the missiles and drones that were launched at the country. They're saying that they were only targeting military industrial facilities, fuel and ammunition storages and things like that. Also an airbase they said they hid in Central Ukraine. We haven't seen evidence of that as of yet. So not actually claiming to be hitting grain infrastructure but I think this can also be viewed Julia in the context of the Kremlin's comments on Tuesday. But it was still looking at proposals to respond to the attack on the Kurdish Bridge on Monday, which of course, Ukraine claimed responsibility for, though, of course, with the caveat that it is difficult to distinguish in this war, retaliation from the general course of Russia's aggression.",

DONALD TRUMP, 45TH U.S. PRESIDENT: I got the letter on Sunday night. Think of it. I don't think they've ever sent a letter on Sunday night. And they're in a rush because they want interference with the election. It's election interference never been done like this in the history of our country and it's a disgrace.

So he says for the time being, they're going to be stationed in Belarus. The plan is to make the Belarusian army, he says the second in the world if necessary, Wagner will stand with them. He says and then you know they will prepare themselves they're essentially reformed themselves and go on another journey. He says to Africa, at which point they'll return back when he says that they'll be confident enough, they will not be asked to make an embarrassment of ourselves and our experience. So this is not a Prigozhin, cowed and shamed by any experience of the last month also.
