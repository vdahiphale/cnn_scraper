(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KYUNG LAH, CNN SENIOR U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: The very latest from Phoenix and Maricopa County. Katie Hobbs, the Democrat will be the projected leader of the Arizona governor's race. You can see the figures right there. The Democrat, Katie Hobbs barely edging Republican Kari Lake. Now there are about 5 to 15,000 votes still left to count here in Maricopa County. Those are votes that need to be cured. The election workers continuing to do that but that number too low for Lake to continue to catch up. We are also hearing from a source within the Lake campaign about the reaction and that source is characterizing as, quote, a massive disappointment tonight. That the election day drop-offs that they had anticipated would break in Lake's favor simply did not happen. And I'm also hearing from sources across Arizona, Republicans who work on campaigns, these are moderate Republicans and strategists, longtime Republicans who have strong reactions to the Lake loss. John Brand an Arizona Republican who led Republicans and independents for Katie Hobbs. A lifelong Republican who raised money for a Democrat, says, quote, civility has won here in Arizona and across the country. Another Republican strategist who asked to not be named because he is an active campaign employee said, quote, Kari Lake told a legion of John McCain supporters across Arizona that they could go to hell.

      "sentences": "Yes, Max, good morning. Good morning, Bianca. Winter is certainly in the air here across portions of the Midwest, guys. We're seeing snowfall potentials beginning to build in the coming days here and the temperatures absolutely going to supported as well. Widespread coverage of 20s and 30s across the Midwest, parts of the Northeastern U.S. already into the 30s. And really a quick-moving system that'll move right across the eastern third of the U.S. in the coming hours bringing with it a shot of snow showers. The first here for a lot of the areas of the season.About five weeks away from the official start of the winter season. But you'll notice accumulations and really not a blockbuster event quite yet. But about 2 to 4 inches of coverage there across the areas of the Midwest in parts of the Northeast. So, that's we're watching from areas around say Chicago, points just to the west, areas Iowa, northern Missouri as well. Some accumulations possible there. But factor in the winds certainly going to get a lot of people's attention in Chicago. 25 degrees is what it feels like this morning. 22 degrees what it feelings like across Minneapolis. In New York City feels right around the freezing mark there at around 32. But the trend is that it's going to stay cold for a couple of days. So, Atlanta should be in the middle 60s this time of year. Will go from 51 on Tuesday to 48 over the next couple of days. And Washington, D.C. should be near 60 degrees and temps should be in the middle 40ed by this afternoon. Now when you compare this to where typically these sort of temperatures are expected, you'll notice in Atlanta, St. Louis and Washington you'll typically find these temperatures in mid-December to late January and in Chicago takes a couple more weeks before we get to these sort of temperatures. So that cold trend is expected to continue across a large area of the United States. And another shot expected into early next week as well. In fact, look at these temps drop off in Minneapolis down to the teens and single digits by early next week. And we'll leave you with this, Max, across California a Santa Ana wind event in the works here with some gusty winds and even milder temperatures in store over the coming couple of days. Winds up to tropical storm force across some of these areas.",

However, the U.N. is also warning that the growth is transient and will start shrinking soon. This is staggering when you consider that 100 years ago according to the U.N. the global population was 2 billion or under. Now it's 8 billion.",
