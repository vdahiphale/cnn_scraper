It's really an extraordinary step in the battle at the border. It is Senate Bill 4 and it gives local law enforcement the power to arrest migrants. It also gives judges there the power to remove violators to Mexico. Civil rights groups, advocacy groups call this bill anti-migrant. The ACLU has vowed to sue the governor. Our own Rosa Flores is covering all of it for us from Houston this morning. Rosa, what can you tell us?",

This bill says that all law enforcement in this state, including local law enforcement, have the power to arrest for illegal entry or illegal presence in the state.Well, what does that exactly mean? How will a police officer determine if an individual is illegally present in the state of Texas? It's going to be up to that police officer. And Democratic lawmakers tried to amend this bill to add clarifying language, to define certain terms, to set guardrails, but every step of the way they were met with roadblocks. And I want to take you inside the Texas House where this debate was happening and take a listen to this. This is an exchange between a Democratic lawmaker here from Houston and the author of this bill. Take a listen.

Are they going to look at her skin color versus mine and make a determination, surely she needs to be investigated for potentially crossing?

Witnesses say Abigail ran to a neighbor's house for shelter, was later kidnapped along with another family. Joining us now is Liz Naftali, Abigail's great aunt.
