There is a lot to talk about with Israel.But I think what Israel is trying to say today is, yes, let's talk about the issue of war crimes. Even talk about the issue of crimes against humanity. But if you want to talk about genocide, you are way off base. Because that requires the specific intent to destroy all or part of the Palestinians. They are saying that the evidence simply doesn't show that. It does not go there. And I might add, Brianna, that Hamas actually is subject to all of this. They are citizens of the state of Palestine. The state of Palestine is a state party of the Genocide Convention. Even before the International Criminal Court, as nationals of Palestine, when they confronted Israelis on October 7th and committed to truth, including, probably, genocide on October 7th, the ICC has jurisdiction over Hamas for those crimes.",

And we can go down that checklist.In terms of the merits of the case, the South African charge that Israel is actually committing genocide against the Palestinians, we could wait two to three years for that particular judgment. I might just add, one of the little kickers here is that South Africa, yes, has brought Israel to court under the Genocide Convention on the charge of genocide. But neither South Africa nor any other country has yet done what it could do, which is to bring the state of Palestine to the International Court of Justice under the Genocide Convention for committing genocide on October 7th. And that is one of Israel's main -- not that specific issue but that is what they're confronting is the double standard that relates to, what are the obligations of Hamas as citizens of Palestine under the Genocide Convention?",
