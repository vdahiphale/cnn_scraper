It was January 1943, the first time a sitting American president rode on an airplane, a trip shrouded in secrecy so that FDR could strategize with Winston Churchill, a journey fraught with danger.",

Meaning serene, La Serenissima was a nickname for the Republic of Venice. Ah, Venice, the floating city with people being serenaded and gondolas as they drift through winding canals under hundreds of walkways and bridges. But those famous canals look a lot different right now. They`re so dried up that many of the gondolas and water taxis are sadly sitting on empty waterways. And there are fears that Italy will face a drought for a second straight summer following an extremely dry winter. Now, these images are a stark contrast from those of just a few years ago. In 2019, water poured into restaurants, shops and famous landmarks like Saint Mark`s Basilica in Venice as it battled its worst flood in 50 years. Here`s reporting from CNN international correspondent Scott McLean during that time as we try to imagine the scope of issues Venetians had to deal with the last several years. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  High tide on Saturday was actually welcome relief for Venetians struggling with the worst flooding in half a century. It filled historic Saint Mark`s Square but was not enough to do more damage than already done. This cafe opened for the first time since Tuesday`s high watermark sent more than a foot of water inside enough to break the dishwasher and the fridge. This waiter told us, we are Venetians, roll up our sleeves and start working again. Venice is our lady; we will protect her. Meanwhile at Saint Mark`s Basilica, the water at the door didn`t knock before entering. But it still got their attention. PIERPAOLO CAMPOSTRINI, ST. MARK`S BASILICA BOARD MEMBER:  We have a -- we have more than this level of water.",
