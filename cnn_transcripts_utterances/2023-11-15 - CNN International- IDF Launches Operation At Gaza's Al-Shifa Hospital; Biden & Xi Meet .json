I'm Max Foster in London.Just ahead, the very latest from Gaza, where Israel has launched a, quote, \"targeted operation\" inside the biggest hospital, hunting for Hamas militants and possibly hostages. Then there's been a Russian strike on a multistory building in the Ukrainian region of Donetsk. We'll have a live report from Kyiv. Plus, U.S. President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, are preparing for a high stakes meeting later today in California. We'll have the new ideas coming out from that, from Beijing and from San Francisco. Hospitals are not battlegrounds, says a top U.N. official, but that's precisely what Gaza's largest hospital appears to have become. A local journalist says Israeli tanks and military vehicles are in the courtyard of the Al-Shifa complex, amid tense gunfire. And the supervisor of the ER department says Israeli soldiers are inside the hospital buildings. And that he's seen people handcuffed and blindfolded. The IDF says its operation is precise based on necessary intelligence. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REAR ADM. DANIEL HAGARI, ISRAELI ARMY SPOKESPERSON: Based on intelligence information and an operational necessity, IDF forces are carrying out a precise and targeted operation against Hamas in a specified area in the Shifa Hospital. The IDF is conducting a ground operation in Gaza to defeat Hamas and rescue our hostages. Israel is at war with Hamas, not with the civilians in Gaza. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He's been watching flare ups between Israel and Hezbollah, but is also someone with deep experience reporting on the conflict in Gaza. Ben, we've got, you know, we're relying on information, aren't we, from the Israeli government saying that there is a base there at the hospital, Hamas saying there isn't. And also people in the hospital saying they haven't seen any sort of weaponry within the hospital. You spent a lot of time there. You've been treated there as well. You've been a patient there. I mean, what was your experience of how it was being used and what we know?",

      "sentences": "Well, I was there in October 2000 when Israeli forces shot me in the back in Gaza. Spent several nights there. And, you know, I can tell you, we all know it's the biggest hospital in Gaza. It was first built during the mandate period under British control.But in 1983, it was renovated by the Israelis, and they built underground operating theaters and tunnels there, obviously, just for the functioning of the hospital. And I've spent lots of time in the hospital, in operating theaters, both as a patient and as a journalist spoken to many of the doctors, many of the patients there. First and foremost, it is a hospital. And having spent a lot of time there, it's not as if you see armed men going in and out or any Hamas leaders. So it's really difficult to say at this point whether there is any truth to the Israeli claims, to the American claims, that it is some sort of command and control center for Hamas. But what it clearly is at the moment, it seems if, you know, Gaza is hell, the Shifa Hospital is the center of hell. There have been dead bodies rotting outside there for days now. According to eyewitnesses who have spoken with CNN, dogs and cats were eating the flesh of those cadavers. And clearly, the staff is under stress, trying to keep people alive under the most difficult conditions without much in the way of power, medicine, running water, food. And the whole point is that in the middle of all this are caught not only the patients, the staff of the hospital, but hundreds and thousands of civilians who thought that taking refuge in, the area of the hospital would be safe, but it is clearer than ever now that it is not safe at all.

David, thank you.While diplomacy may be the goal today, behind closed doors, President Biden spoke frankly about China, saying, in his words, they've got real problems. His comments come at a -- came at a campaign donor event on Tuesday. Mr. Biden appeared to be referring to China's economy, which is facing high youth unemployment and a real estate crisis as well. Let's get more from China. We're joined by Marc Stewart. He's in Beijing. It'll be important for the global audience, this event, but Xi will also be considering how it'll play out to the domestic audience, their leader on the world stage.",

And this is a time when Xi Jinping is not only having to be strong for China, for all of the economic ailments that you listed, but he's also trying to make a point that there are other world views out there.He is proposing and actively talking about this notion of a new world order, an alternative to the West into the American way of doing things. So he certainly will likely be thinking about that as he not only meets with President Biden, but also other world leaders. Now, on the topic of President Biden and those remarks that he made about Xi Jinping, at this point, it does not seem to be derailing or delaying this much anticipated meeting between these two leaders. I mean, as you mentioned, these economic issues here are going to be paramount. And part of that solution in China's view is bringing in more foreign investment. So despite some of those words that were said, he will still likely welcome that meeting with President Biden. It is a point that came up a conversation -- during conversation today during a Ministry of Foreign Affairs briefing. Let's take a listen now to spokesperson Mao Ning. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAO NING, CHINESE FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESPERSON (through translator): I think perhaps there aren't any countries in the world that don't have problems. With China's leadership of the Communist Party, the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and everyone united, we are confident that we can achieve better development and have brighter prospects. We hope that the United States can also seriously solve its own problems and bring better lives to the American people. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

In fact, at one point, several months ago, he referred to Xi Jinping as a dictator, and that was not well received.But at this moment, Max, these conversations are happening. And as David Culver mentioned in an undisclosed location, so there is a lot of secrecy.

The court blocked a controversial plan by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak aimed at encouraging migrants -- discouraging even migrants. Sunak had wanted to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda, but the High Court unanimously ruled that Rwanda was not a safe country to send the migrants to, noting that some asylum seekers might find themselves sent back to the very country that they had fled.Clare has been looking at this. I mean, it's a very complex case. It's been running and running and running, and it's a big problem this, isn't it, for Rishi Sunak. And we'll talk later on that.

Now, human rights groups are obviously celebrating this refugee groups. The Rwandan government though is not at all happy saying they take issue with the ruling that Rwanda is not a safe third country for asylum seekers.",
