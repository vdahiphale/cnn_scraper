I'm Kaitlan Collins in Washington, alongside Anderson Cooper in New York.And, right now, voters are making their picks in the one-on-one Republican primary between Donald Trump and Nikki Haley. The former governor of South Carolina is hoping to prove her critics wrong and vowing to stay in this race. But, of course, the stakes could not be higher for her in the Granite State, as Trump's former rivals are now falling in line behind him.",

I'm going to walk you inside a little bit here just to see, and then we're going to talk to a quick voter in a moment. But this is kind of the setup here. So you see it's a little less crowded than it was in the early morning side, but they will make their way to this main table here, where they get processed, they get checked, they get their ballot. Then they make their way over here to those familiar privacy booths, where they actually go to cast their ballot for who they want to represent the GOP party or if they're writing in President Biden's name. Now, I mentioned we were going to talk to some voters. We have been talking to them over the course of the morning. And what's been interesting is, we have been hearing not just who they're picking, but also some very interesting nuances in why they're picking the candidates that they are. So, for example, hi, ma'am. How's it going? I'm Omar. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Hi. (CROSSTALK)",

      "sentences": "I haven't the slightest idea, Anderson, how I'm supposed to top that, but I will try and give you a sense of where things stand at the moment.This is the map, obviously, the vast majority of it not filled in. Only one township so far has voted, Dixville Notch, always right after midnight on primary day, six voters for Nikki Haley, 100 percent, good start to the night. Whether or not that actually holds is a big question. At least based on the polling, it looks like Nikki Haley has an uphill battle, part of the reason why maybe not setting expectations too high going into this day. However, Anderson, it is very clear, when you look at New Hampshire and the makeup of the electorate, this is the place where Nikki Haley wants to make a move. She's done it by spending more than $29 million in this state alone, almost double what Trump and his allied groups have done over the course of the same time period. They know in the Haley campaign that this is the place to make a stand. What that looks like, though, will be very dependent, not just on Republican voters, but on undeclared voters. And this is a big difference with the New Hampshire primary. Why? Sometimes, it can be not always guaranteed to end up how the polling looks. Take a look at the registration of New Hampshire voters. And I will explain why this is so important. You have 268,000 Republican -- registered Republicans, 262,000 registered Democrats. This right here is the number everybody is paying attention to. There is no question, when you look at the latest CNN/University of New Hampshire polling, Donald Trump, when it comes to the Republican primary electorate, has a significant advantage; 67 percent of those go towards Donald Trump. On the undeclareds, however, that's where Nikki Haley, very clearly, has an option to move forward. And that's what they're looking at. If you look at the most recent CNN poll, Nikki Haley at 58 percent with undeclared voters, Donald Trump at 30 percent. Here's the problem that the Haley campaign has. With Donald Trump's significant support within the Republican primary electorate, 58 percent is probably not going to be enough. It will depend on how many of those undeclared voters decide to declare to vote in the Republican primary. And of that group, how many go to Haley? If Haley runs up huge numbers, particularly in the suburbs, higher- educated parts of the state, of which New Hampshire has many more than Iowa, then she has a very real chance here. That's what the campaign is banking on. We will have to see as the day plays on, Anderson.",

And so there should be no difference in reporting the outcomes in terms of time from past elections.

It was going to be stolen again. Obviously, it was not stolen. It was a free and fair election in 2020. But that is a message that Trump has been continuing to push. And New Hampshire is actually one of the earliest states where he ever claimed there was election fraud. Back in 2016, he claimed that. And you heard the secretary of state, a Republican, I should note earlier, just talking about how concerning that is for state officials here in not a very -- not just New Hampshire, but every state, but certainly here, as he's there today, hoping to put this race to an end today, though saying -- he said he didn't care if Nikki Haley stays in the race.
