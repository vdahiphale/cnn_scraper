Police confronting protesters at the University of Arizona, also at Tulane in Louisiana, and there were wild scenes at UCLA overnight and still it's playing out this morning, rival protest groups going after each other. We've been watching it all morning and right now the LAPD is on the scene. Rows of officers, you see some video there, lined up to try and calm things down. But earlier, we want to show you a different perspective some different video this is what was happening, fights breaking out after university officials declared a pro-Palestinian encampment there unlawful and counter-protesters then showed up. L.A.'s mayor this morning is calling the violence that erupted, quote, absolutely abhorrent and inexcusable.Now, let's go to New York at Columbia University, nearly a hundred people were taken into police custody after you see that -- look at these videos -- after police moved in to clear out that academic building that been seized and vandalized by protesters for some 20 hours. Sara is at Columbia University again this morning. Sara, what do you see and what do you hear in there?",

There is a much larger police presence surrounding the university as well as barricades that weren't here yesterday. Why? Because, overnight, police stormed into the building just to my right, Hamilton Hall, from many different entry points, from windows, doors, breaking into the school to try to get the pro-Palestinian protesters who had broken in and were inside occupying the building out. They did that. Dozens of arrests here as well as at City College, up to 100 people have been arrested between the two campuses.Now, while this scene is starting to calm down here, in Los Angeles at UCLA campus, police are in riot gear, they are on the scene as we speak, because there, overnight, it appeared Palestinian protesters in the encampment were being attacked by pro-Israeli counter-protesters, and violence ensued. We now know that there are police in right here on the ground and someone. Who is there watching all of this happen, our Stephanie Elam, there live for us at UCLA. Stephanie, can you give me some sense, if you can hear me, of what you're seeing this morning as the police presence grows?",

Thank you so much to you and your photographer there giving us the scene of what is happening on UCLA, and if anything changes, we will certainly be getting back to you throughout the hour. I appreciate it.Joining me now is Anna Dai-Liu. She is a reporter for the school newspaper, the Daily Bruin. And can you give me some sense, were you out last night, or what can you tell me about what happened last night and how the violence ended up happening if it was one side being attacked by the other? ANNA DAI-LIU, SCIENCE AND HEALTH EDITOR, DAILY BRUIN:  Yes. So, the counter-protester activity here at UCLA has been a sort of constant throughout the days encampment has existed. There was some activity earlier today, but I would say a little before 11:00 P.M. last night, all of a sudden, many more people appeared. And so they began pushing into the barricades. I was out there a few minutes after this began. And I would say around 11:00, fireworks were fired, tear gas was sprayed. We have reporters who were gassed and reporters who were assaulted. So, it has been a rather chaotic day of events at UCLA. We're not quite sure either as to how it escalated to this degree. It's not something that we obviously have seen yet on campus, but it is definitely violent in ways that previous demonstrations by the counter-protesters weren't. Our sense is that we are hearing from sources on the ground that it was largely one-sided. It's a bit difficult for us to ascertain, obviously, among the chaos that is still going on, but that is what sources told us, and we're still not clear as to the exact difference that unfolded over the past few hours.",

This is between the counter-protesters and the pro-Palestinian protesters and the pro-Israeli protesters on the other side.Can you give me a sense? You said that your reporters were also gassed and also faced some violence. Which side? Were they inside the encampment or was this on the pro-Israeli side, the counter-protester side? DAI-LIU:  We were all standing on the counter-protesters side. It's currently unclear as to who released the tear gas. There's also been reports of pepper spray and bear spray. As of the moment, it's very difficult for us to confirm which sides these sprays are coming from. Although we're hearing it's more from the counter-protesters side, but we have not been allowed into the encampment since it began. So, we were all reporting from outside.",

This clinic was telling us they were scheduling two to four times as many patients over the last couple days as they normally would schedule leading up to this new law taking effect that brings the limit on abortion in Florida down to six weeks from what had been 15 weeks.Now, when we got here yesterday morning, this parking lot was completely full. Of course, it is before 8:00 A.M., so many people are not in offices yet here, but it is expected to be a much quieter day. This is going to be a dramatic shift for the state of Florida, where about 7,000 abortions took place per month throughout 2023. That's about one in 12 of abortions nationwide and one in three across the south. We spoke with a patient yesterday here at this clinic who was in the process of getting a medication abortion. She was comfortable only sharing her first name, Candace, and showing her hands on camera. She's already the mother of two. Here's what she said about the effects of this ban on her.
