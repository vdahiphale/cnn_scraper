I'm John King in Washington a very busy important day in the Republican race for President.In the next two hours two new candidates as the field grows to 10 that is Anthony, Iowa where Mike Pence will announce officially announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination next hour. And in Fargo, North Dakota right now the First Lady of Idaho is on the stage. She's about to introduce her husband, the Governor Doug Burgum. He too, will enter the Republican race for President that will bring the field to 10. We believe these are likely the final two entries in the crowded Republican field. We have reporters out on the trail to bring you the latest and let's start in Anthony, Iowa where Mike Pence again will make it official next hour. CNN's Kyung Lah is there. Eva McKend is standing by in Fargo. Eva we'll get through in a minute. Kyung, what are we going to see?",

This is the kickoff for his Iowa campaign where his campaign says they have to lean all in. This is where they will make their mark or be allowed to continue.And they plan on trying to do that by going to all 99 counties. And this is where it starts inside this room in Anthony, Iowa where Mike Pence we are anticipating he will be introduced by his brother who was a Congressman from Indiana and he's going to really lean into the connective tissue between who Mike Pence the man from Indiana is and to the state of Iowa leaning in on religion on his deep Christian faith on his beliefs of core conservatism. And he's going to harken back to Ronald Reagan. And what you're not going to hear John and that's what we're going to be listening for is what he says in regards to Donald Trump. What they are trying to do is to separate the man who was a Vice President in the Trump Administration to the man who now wants to challenge Donald Trump. So that is what we are waiting to see in his remarks which are about to take about 30 minutes the campaign is anticipating it will very much lean into Mike Pence, his own man, John.",

Eva as we wait again, the First Lady Kathy Burgum on the stage, Doug Burgum doesn't have much of a national profile. But he is a former technology executive. He's a billionaire. He's very conservative in issues like abortion, but he wants to run on that business experience saying America needs new leaders for the new economy. Tell us more.",

He really argues that these cultural battles are not the way to win the election, that that is not the most pressing issue for Americans.He is firmly conservative. He signed one of the most restrictive abortion bans in the country into law as well as curtailed transgender rights. But that's not what he's most comfortable talking about. And he's really going to lead on his business acumen. You know, he says that he bet the farm a long time ago, he invested in a technology company that went on to be bought by Microsoft for a billion dollars. But his largest task ahead and we know that he's going to use some of his millions to do it is to introduce himself to conservatives in the critical states of Iowa and New Hampshire this week. He's well known in North Dakota, he has a job ahead is to introduce himself to voters elsewhere, John.",

With me in studio on this important day to share their reporting and their insights Laura Barron-Lopez at the PBS NewsHour, Zolan Kanno-Youngs of \"The New York Times\" and Leigh Ann Caldwell of \"The Washington Post\".It's interesting day, the field if we can show will be a 10. We believe these are the final two entries in the race. You have Donald Trump as the far away front runner. You have Ron DeSantis, who is a distant second but he is well ahead of everybody else, not named Trump. And then you have the other eight candidates trying to break through. The two who are making it official today both from the heartland Mike Pence of Indiana Doug Burgum of North Dakota are both more of a traditional Reagan Bush conservative. They believe in politeness in conversation. They have very conservative views on issues like abortion, lower taxes less regulations sort of traditional farm state conservatives. Can that brand sell any more in Donald Trump's Republican Party when you have Trump and DeSantis? [12:05:00] Two guys who are very comfortable, very happy to be cultural warriors and to be combative? LEIGH ANN CALDWELL, EARLY 202 CO-AUTHOR, THE WASHINGTON POST: Yes and to be duking it out against each other as well. It's hard to tell. According to current polling, it seems like that brand is no longer selling, and today's Republican Party, but they're going to try, you know, speaking to people around the Pence campaign. They tell me that there's going -- they're going to make this campaign about contrast, not especially about personality, too. We'll see if that works. Pence, people say they want to keep looking forward. They don't want to look behind that's an apparent dig at Donald Trump who tries to re litigate the 2020 election, and all the investigations into Donald Trump. But also it's a really difficult thing for Mike Pence, who has a much nuanced campaign to run. He's trying to separate himself from Donald Trump by while also highlighting the things he thinks they're good about the Trump Pence Administration. Nuance is hard and politics.",

This is history. It's just history, a Former Vice President has never run for the nomination against a Former President and not since Grover Cleveland is that the President tried to return to the presidency.So you have many ripples of history there. You mentioned the fact that can he have the nuance? This is a launch video for Mike Pence and where he does not mention Donald Trump by name, but he does try to take some of the credit for the Trump years. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MIKE PENCE, FORMER U.S. VICE PRESIDENT: And I'll always be proud of the progress we made together for a stronger, more prosperous America. But today, our country's in a lot of trouble. President Joe Biden and the radical left have weakened America at home and abroad, but different times call for different leadership. Today, our party and our country need a leader that will appeal as Lincoln said, to the better angels of our nature. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But on paper support with evangelical -- support among evangelicals speaks their language because it's a farm state guy.Again, back to the question number one, does that Republican Party still exist? And does Mike Pence have a lane? When if you're a never Trumper he worked for Trump? If you're a Trump voter, Trump says he betrayed him. LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, I think that it's going to be really hard for Pence to show that he's willing to take on the Former President when he is -- when he's putting out launch videos like that, when we know that his campaign speech, you know, his launch speech is not going to really talk about Trump by name at all. And so sometimes he decides he wants to go there when it comes to January 6 and talk about the fact that his life was threatened, his family felt threatened. And then the majority of the time, he doesn't and so is he overshadowed by a candidate like Chris Christie, who, at least so far appears to be far more willing to go directly at the Former President.",

Let's bring the conversation back in the room with our great reporters Laura Barron- Lopez, Zolan Kanno-Youngs and Leigh Ann Caldwell.Interesting there, number one the longest of long shots and he concedes it. Number two, he thinks his history helps him. He was a longshot when he ran into primary for Governor back in 2016. I believe it was. The question is can you break through if you're anybody not named Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis? Democrats will -- he signed one of the nation's most restrictive abortion laws. Democrats will hit him for that. What he's trying to do here is say I'm a technology guy, I came up from the bottom I used to work on a farm I was a chimney sweep. Then I made a billion dollar company. I understand today's economy, I understand artificial intelligence. I understand global trade. I understand software, technology, computers, those are voices we need in the political conversation. My question is again, can you break through? ZOLAN KANNO-YOUNGS, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, THE NEW YORK TIMES: Can it break through to this GOP right? It's almost a message that you are a platform that you would expect maybe 10 years ago depicting or showing America and this kind of sunny sort of vision and portrayal, talking about this kind of rise from chimney sweep to, you know, executive at Microsoft, which would obviously, you know, resignation, given the concerns around artificial intelligence and the growing prevalence around artificial intelligence. It will be a challenge for any of these candidates to run on that message when I think Trump has shown that, you know, a base of the GOP tend to be exciting, engaged by a fighter and someone who appeals to the grievances really of the party at this point. That being said, during his time as Governor, he has also participate in some of those culture war policies restricting Trans' rights as well as strict abortion laws.",

And if you're anybody in the long shot in this race, that's where you're going to have to break through. You have to break through either in Iowa or New Hampshire. The question is, can you?
