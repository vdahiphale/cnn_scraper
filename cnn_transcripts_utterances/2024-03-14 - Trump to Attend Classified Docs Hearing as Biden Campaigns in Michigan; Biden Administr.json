And Molly Ball, she is senior political correspondent for \"The Wall Street Journal.\" Welcome.This is the kind of day, I think, we're going to be having a lot of these kinds of days. Although I guess if Donald Trump has anything to say about it, he's going to delay these cases long enough that we never actually see any of them really go to trial. Sarah Longwell, the big question that I have today is that we are firmly now in general election mode, right? With two presumptive nominees. This is not the primary campaign. Do you think that this is something that is effective for Trump, in a general election, to show up these trials when he doesn't have to? It clearly worked for him in the primary, but does it work now?",

And honestly today, most of the congressman, the senators, the folks who are also running on the ballot this election cycle have kind of fallen in line and pushed the narrative. And so the question I have is that will they continue? Or for people who are in some of these highly contested purple districts this cycle, particularly in the House, they can't totally align themselves with Donald Trump right now in the general election. Do they just try and ignore it? Do they pivot? Do they say, well -- you know, for independent voters who are saying, who have some questions, how are they going to handle it today? We haven't seen there be a crack in the wall right now. Or the Trump narrative, but I am interested in some of these more vulnerable districts, what happens?",

      "sentences": "Yes. Molly Ball, what's your sense, politically speaking, to Sarah's point about how it's kind of all muddled together right now? If we start to get any separation on these cases, which one may matter the most? I mean, I've had some strategists say that this documents one might actually be the thing that could damage him the most, because it's in some ways the easiest to understand, but I'm curious what your reporting is.MOLLY BALL, SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Well, I think the timeline matters and the fact that we think that the New York one is going to go on trial first is going to sort of set the tone, set the stage. And most people do view that as the weakest of the cases, and that could substantially muddy the waters. I do think that most people do see the 91 as this undifferentiated mass and it will be hard to break through, particularly with the proceedings that are not televised. They will not all be televised. By some of them will some of them won' t. Do people have any appetite for this, right? I think a lot of people just feel sick of it and don't want to hear about any of it. But we do hear the Biden campaign already starting to make this case in their first general election ads, that what this is about is Trump's self- interest, that they're saying that you have president who's fighting for you, and then you have this former president who's preoccupied with his own issues, his own victimhood. And that's the narrative they're going to continue to push. And I think that has the virtue of not needing people to differentiate and pick apart all the different -- all the different aspects of all of these cases, saying well, this one's about an adult film star; this one's about national security. This one's about January 6, because I think there is a weariness with just the sheer volume of this stuff. So by making this overriding argument, I think the Biden campaign hopes that -- that people can see this all as one thing and about an all as about Trump and his preoccupation so speaking of, you know, the way people view things, Ed Luce has this column in \"The Financial Times\" today. And the headline is \"Democracy Dies in Trumpian Boredom.\" And he writes, quote, \"His untruths merit a shrug; everyone else's qualify as a scandal. This dual standard is to a large extent subconscious. In 2018, Trump's then-chief strategist, Steve Bannon, described his media tactics as flooding the zone with S-H-T. The more bizarreness Trump generates, the less people notice.\" Sarar, this seems pretty on point to me. People that are running against to Trump, I mean, how do you fight back against that?",

      "sentences": "Look, I think first of all, I think that's 100 percent right. The psychology of people -- people are just not built to take this.And look, one of the main tactics of autocrats and authoritarians is to exhaust people, right? That's what they want you to be. They want you to be too exhausted to fight back. They want you to be too exhausted to sort of parse through all the noise to figure out what's going on. And so you break through by not getting exhausted, right? Like, this is the time for Joe Biden and his campaign to roll out 1,000 surrogates to go on offense against Donald Trump and say, You do not want this guy. And I agree with Molly. You don't have to talk about each individual case. You have to say, this guy's running for president to stay out of jail. He's got half a billion plus in legal fees that he's going to raise from you. Those are the kinds of things you do to sort of paint an overall picture. There's a reason that roughly 30 percent of Republicans say that, if Trump's convicted of a crime, they won't vote for him. Now that number is too high, but it demonstrates that there are people who are saying, Yes, look, get back to me when there's a verdict on something. And if he is guilty, like that matters to me.",

We have, like, the fact checkers, right? And then they discredit.And Trump has been doing that, naming the media all these different things in his first term. You cannot run away from the truth if you want to hold Donald Trump accountable. And I think you have to acknowledge that there are -- there's a component of the Republican Party that was just always going to be with Trump. But I don't know if it's enough if you do all the things like fact- check, like hold him accountable by the press. People, even in their party. Not a lot, but those who want to -- the independent voters, the Republicans who are never Trumpers. If you -- there are more of them in this country than there are the base that want to buy into allowing more people to be confused and exhausted by the narrative and to Steve Bannons. And so I think if you cede and you just say like, wow, that strategy is working, and let's pivot, instead, and let's just pay only attention. Then he kind of gets away with it. He kind of wins. So we can't allow his nonsense just to operate with free reign. Because that's his goal.",

The Biden administration could have a new plan to deal with the worsening situation in Haiti.Discussions are underway to use Guantanamo Bay as a processing facility, should there be a mass exodus of Haitian migrants in the coming weeks. The United Nations says over 15,000 people have been displaced as Haiti's government has been effectively overthrown by gangs. Priscilla Alvarez joins us now from the White House with the details. Priscilla, people are going to hear Guantanamo Bay and think one thing about terrorism. But this has often been used for migrant processing. What can you tell us about the administration's thinking in crafting this plan?",

      "sentences": "Yes. Kasie, for years, Guantanamo Bay has had a migrant center where it can hold and process migrants.This is separate from the facility where they hold terrorist suspects, and the detainees do not mix with the migrants. But a U.S. official now tells me that there are discussions to potentially expand that facility in anticipation of a potential mass exodus of Haitians leaving the country, given the situation on the ground there. Now when I asked the White House about this, the National Security Council spokesperson told me the following: quote, \"We are clear-eyed that economic, political, and security instability are key drivers for migrants around the world. We are closely monitoring the situation and the routes frequently used by migrants to reach our borders. And at this time, irregular migration flows through the Caribbean remain low.\" Now, a White House official told me that President Biden has been updated on this regularly; that he is deeply concerned about the situation in Haiti. But what we're talking about here is Haitians fleeing by sea, trying to reach the shores of Southern Florida. They do that through makeshift vessels. Sometimes sail boats that have over 100 people for a days-long journey. The idea here is that Coast Guard interdicts those Haitians at sea and then has a facility to take them to if there are large numbers. So they can be processed and potentially repatriated to Haiti or a third country. But clearly, Kasie, just growing concern within the White House about what could happen in the aftermath of these worsening conditions in Haiti.",
