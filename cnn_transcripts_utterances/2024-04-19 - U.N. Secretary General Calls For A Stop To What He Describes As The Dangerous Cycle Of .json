Secretary General is calling today for a stop to what he describes as the dangerous cycle of retaliation in the Middle East, thisafter a U.S. official says Israel carried out a military strike inside Iran. Flashes were seen in the sky and the state media reported explosions as well near an airbase in the central province of Isfahan. And an Iranian official says that its air defenses intercepted three drones. Satellite images do not appear to show any extensive damage at the airbase. The U.N. nuclear watchdog says no nuclear sites in Isfahan were damaged. Israel right now isn't commenting, but had vowed to hit back after Tehran fired drone and missiles at Israel over the weekend. Iran seems to be downplaying the incident for now, with state media showing calm scenes in Isfahan, as you see right there. But protests are erupting in the capital. Crowds took to the streets of Tehran to voice their anger at Israel and the United States. And U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken would only say that the U.S. was not involved in any offensive operations. He spoke earlier at a news conference from the G7 summit in Capri, Italy. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  The United States has not been involved in any offensive operations. What we're focused on, what the G7 is focused on, and again, it's reflected in our statement and in our conversation, is our work to de-escalate tensions, to de-escalate from any potential conflict.

His assessment, he told me from the information he had, was that he didn't expect Iran to retaliate. And here we are many hours later. And that seems to be the scene when Iranian officials say they are investigating the sound of explosions heard over Isfahan that they have now described as their air defense systems targeting objects in the sky. That language itself speaks to a government, when you hear it from a government like the Iranian government, that in essence tells you nothing to see here. And the silence from the Israeli government is also the same. Nothing to see here. I mean, I think that, you know, the fact that the most we've seen is a Twitter or expat, if you will, between two members of the Knesset, one hard right member of Prime Minister Netanyahu's government tweeting only the word lame and a Yair Lapid of the opposition saying that this was, essentially, this was damaging to Israel's interests and could be heard all the way from Tehran to Washington, neither of them actually saying what they're precisely speaking about. But it's very clear the understanding at the moment is that this doesn't appear to be about to escalate, at least in the form of direct state-to-state Iran-to-Israel confrontation. We've heard from the UAE, we've heard from Egyptian officials, we've heard from Jordanian officials, all of whom have an extremely large stake in de- escalation, urging that de-escalation.

It's not clear whether they gave the U.S., you know, a heads-up of saying, we're going to respond within the next 24 hours, or saying, we're going to respond within the next 30 minutes. That is not clear. But the U.S. had asked Israel to give them a notification prior to them conducting any kind of retaliation, and they do appear to have heeded that call. But, you know, the big picture here is that the U.S. is trying really hard at this point to distance itself from this entire thing. I mean, Secretary of State Blinken barely spoke to it this morning when he was asked about it, only to say that the U.S. had nothing to do with any offensive operations that happened in the Middle East last night. He did not address the idea that Israel carried it out, nor that the U.S. had been advising them to act with restraint. But the key message that U.S. officials are trying to send today is that they hope that this marks an end to this tit-for-tat, and that all of this will amount to kind of, yes, we have this unprecedented situation where Iran and Israel have attacked each other really for the first time, and this shadow war is now no longer in the shadows, but at the same time hoping that this is now contained. And so, right now, U.S. officials are not necessarily breathing a sigh of relief just yet, but they are hoping that at this point all parties can say, okay, you know, Israel got its kind of revenge for Iran's massive barrage last week, and Iran did the same for Israel's attack on what Iran has said is its consulate.

That took our jury pool from seven to five. And then it went back up by the end of the day to 12 plus one. And we'll get these alternates seated. This is the most extensive and yet efficient examination of potential jurors. What we lawyers call voir dire. I've been doing it for over three decades. The most extensive I've ever seen. There's a questionnaire. Normally, those are written, but no, here the judge makes every juror stand up and answer the questions so he and everyone can gauge credibility, tone and tenor. Then the judge asks them more questions. Both sides ask. It's not just one round. The sides get two rounds. Then there's an elaborate process with the judge. Anybody who feels they can't be fair is screened out at the very beginning. And we lost half of our group of 96 that way multiple times this week.

So, as someone who sits on the House Rules Committee, you know that this was a roller coaster in making, not just the past two months, but even the past 24 hours. Late last night, the Committee cleared the rule for the foreign aid package to be taken up today. But four Democrats voted yes on the Rules Committee to see that move forward. I don't have to tell you how rare that is and even what we saw take place today. The House voted to advance the bill 316-94, which tells us that 55 Republicans voted against it, and 165 Democrats supported this bill going forward to tomorrow's ultimate vote. What does that say about what is clearly a vocal and not very small minority in your party that does not want to see this aid get through to either Israel and, more importantly right now, Ukraine? AUSTIN SCOTT, U.S. HOUSE REPUBLICAN:   Well, it's an important package. And I think the most important thing is that by the end of the day tomorrow, that the aid for Israel and the aid for Ukraine will have passed and will be sent to the Senate. Hopefully the Senate will move pretty fast and then we can get a signature on it. And so, I would just tell you, Bianna, we have a two to three to four vote margin on any given day. As Republicans, it's probably going to be that way until the election is over with. And so, you may see more bipartisan rules moves. We've got to get another appropriation measure done for the next fiscal year. We've got to do something on some other key issues. And it may take that bipartisanship on the rules to make those things happen until the next election. So, I'm glad it happened.

And so, what other members are going to do, I don't know. I will tell you that I do support what Mike has done in separating the issues because I do believe that Israel and Ukraine and Taiwan are three totally separate issues. And there will be people that vote for one and not for the other on both sides of the aisle, I think. So, the most important thing, again, is that we're going to get the Ukrainians the aid that they need. We're going to continue to deliver the intelligence to the Ukrainians that they need.

The UAE is also urging both Israel and Iran to refrain from actions that might lead to further escalation. And as we've been reporting, the G7 foreign ministers are also echoing those calls for restraint. In Israel, opposition leader Yair Lapid is voicing anger after National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir tweeted a single word meaning lame or weak and what's being interpreted as ridiculing the strike in Iran as perhaps not going far enough. We're also keeping an eye on Washington, where the Biden White House is urging Congress to approve additional foreign aid for Israel, as well as embattled Ukraine. Let's bring in CNN Senior White House Reporter Kevin Liptak, who is tracking all of this for us. So, Kevin, let me get to the supplemental bill in just a minute. A bit of optimism hopefully going into the weekend that we'll finally see that passed. But in terms of what we saw overnight, what appears to be, as a U.S. source has said, was Israel's response to Iran's unprecedented barrage attack of over 300 missiles and drones last week. We heard from the Secretary of State basically saying that the U.S. hadn't been involved. Are we expecting to hear directly from the President in response to this?",

And I think this is part of a strategy to try and keep some distance between the United States and Israel's decision to counter strike. Certainly, President Biden very mindful of not wading deeper into a conflict between Israel and Iran and also mindful of not escalating this conflict further, trying to prevent a wider regional war. Now, we do understand that Israel did provide a heads up to the United States of its decision to carry out these strikes. It wasn't much of a heads up. It was hours, hours, not days. So, the U.S. not necessarily getting a lot of advanced warning, but it didn't necessarily come as a surprise to most American officials who, despite President Biden's urging to Israel to caution restraint, were expecting Israel to respond in some capacity. They had expected some sort of limited response, and that appears to be what happened. And President Biden, I think, really trying to emphasize the non-military response to this yesterday, applying new sanctions on Iran's drone program, trying to underscore that there are other ways, aside from a retaliatory strike, to respond. But certainly the real emphasis and the real imperative at the White House now is to try and prevent this from escalating any further.",

Calmer heads will always dominate, and the conversation will move on. This has occurred in the United States over the decades, as well. So, I think Israel did exactly what the Biden administration in the region wanted. It demonstrated to Iran it could touch Iranian assets that are important to the regime when it chooses to do so.
