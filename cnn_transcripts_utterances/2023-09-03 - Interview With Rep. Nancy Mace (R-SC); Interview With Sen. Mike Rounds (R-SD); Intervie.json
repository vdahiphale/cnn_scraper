The sprint to the Republican primaries is kicking off in earnest. Despite four indictments and costly efforts by his rivals to overtake him, a new CNN poll of polls shows Donald Trump has an even wider lead in the GOP primary. And in a warning sign for President Biden, a head-to-head matchup found voters evenly split between the two men. Electoral politics followed Biden Saturday as he toured hurricane damage in Florida. Governor Ron DeSantis refused to appear alongside him, though Biden said the two had been in frequent touch about relief efforts. The president is also facing voters' persistent doubts about the economic recovery. His commerce secretary just returned from a trip to try to smooth strained relations with China, as investors worry an economic slowdown there could drag down the world's economy, but it's not clear whether China will commit to taking any action. The U.S. wants them to lift restrictions on tech manufacturing. Other issues are addressing unfair trade practices and intellectual property concerns. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

You are the fourth Cabinet member to visit China this summer. You said the biggest accomplishment of your trip was a commitment to communicate more. So far, it seems like these trips have resulted in few substantial, tangible results. So, when should Americans expect to see concrete actions from China to fix the problems that they're facing across so many sectors of Americans' everyday lives? GINA RAIMONDO, U.S. SECRETARY OF COMMERCE:  Yes. Well, good morning, and thank you for having me. I think we did achieve concrete outcomes, Dana. Just to put it in perspective, I'm the first commerce secretary in more than five years to be on the ground in China. So, I think we have to be realistic about what we can and can't accomplish on a first visit. Prior to getting on the plane to head over to China, I spoke with more than 100 business leaders myself in the U.S. across a range of industries. And I asked -- and I spoke with labor leaders, and I asked them, what should I be trying to get done here? And, by far, what they said was open lines of communication so we can do the business of resolving issues. And so that's what I was able to accomplish, which I think is very significant. If you can't talk in a structured way about real commercial issues, you have no chance of solving these issues. And, furthermore, as you well know, what happens when you don't communicate is, you can spiral into greater tension and even conflict, because there's misunderstanding and miscalculation. So, I am -- I'm an optimist, but a realist. I think we accomplished a great deal, and now we will see if we can get to work with China and have them resolve some issues.",

But I think, here's the real point for me. What value is there in not talking? We know for a fact that not talking leads to escalation, miscalculation and misunderstanding, which is bad for the American people, it's bad for American workers, it's bad for our national security. I do not accept the premise that talking and communicating is a sign of weakness. I think there's potential value in direct communication. I went there to stick up for American workers and businesses. And that was a message that they heard. Now, whether they choose to take action is, of course, up to them.

The president and his team will run, I have no doubt, a spectacular campaign, tell the story, and Americans will make their decision. But I can tell you, from my own experience as a politician. I was constantly confronted with the exact same question, which is to say, I never had through-the-roof popularity, but always won elections convincingly. And so at least I'm not troubled by that, as a former politician. But more important in my current role as commerce secretary, when I look at this jobs report, increased manufacturing jobs, increased investment, more resilient supply chains, Americans are working, wages are up.

Apart from the fact that women deserve full access to the full range of health care that they deserve, businesses aren't going to want to do business in states that are hostile to women. And so I think that a very poor decision just from a business matter, right? Businesses want to do business in places where there's top talent and in places where you can get women to work in -- the best, most talented women to work in businesses.

I do want to start with Leader McConnell, that scary moment where we saw -- as I mentioned, where we saw him freeze again in public. You said that you do expect him to be straightforward and level with the Republican Conference when you all get back this coming week. What questions -- do you have for him? SEN. MIKE ROUNDS (R-SD):  Yes, I spoke with Mitch yesterday afternoon and told him I was going to be doing an interview, and I wanted to personally touch base with him before I did that. And he was in good shape. He was direct. He said he fell. He said: \"I had that concussion.\" And he said: \"They warned me that I would be lightheaded in the future and that I have got to be aware of it.\" He said: \"It happened twice.\" He said: \"It just so happens I'm doing it in front of reporters.\" But he felt good yesterday. He said he's got to watch his hydration levels. Dr. Monahan, who is also my physician there at the Senate, he's sharp. He says it exactly the way that it is. And if he says that Mitch is ready to go, then Mitch is ready to go. But Mitch will come back in front of us, and he will discuss it with the entire team. He's been busy. He's been working around his own state. But he's also been doing the fund-raising that is required of a leader. And I think that's been a big job for him as well during this break.",
