      "sentences": "So, Jessica, what we're witnessing right now play out in Charlottesville, Virginia, on the University of Virginia campus, is really just the latest example of tensions rising on American university campus control room. We may or may not have some pictures I believe of what has transpired over the last hour or so.Just to set the scene for our viewers here as we hopefully queue up some images for you so you could see yourself what's played out. Over the course of several days, we have seen pro-Palestinian demonstrators on the UVA campus assembling there for several days, although they were really maintaining more of a picnic like environment. And I say that because they weren't any clear indications that they were using tents. The university had made clear that is not something they wanted to see up. If not, that would be considered a violation of the university policy. And that would then prompt a response from the university. More recently, at least in the last 24 hours, as you can see in these pictures here, we began to see some of those signs of an actual encampment, including tents, and that, according to what we've heard from officials, is likely what triggered this police response just in the last couple of hours. So what you had recently is virtually a standoff between law enforcement and some protesters. Now, to be clear, there's indication that some of the people that are seen in that video are really more spectators than protesters but you do see people clapping and chanting in solidarity with the participants of that encampment. The UVA went ahead and declared an unlawful assembly only moments ago, specifically in the area that's known there as the rotunda and chapel area. That's where we believe these pictures are coming out of. And so officials are asking people at that location to disperse, and also asking other folks on campus to simply avoid this area. And this comes after some talks that were ongoing between members of that encampment and UVA, which is, Jessica, really just a carbon copy of what we've seen at other campuses which are these negotiations, these talks take place between some of these demonstrators and the university. The big item that continues to be a top demand really is divestment -- Jessica.",

Wealthy GOP donors and high-profile Republican leaders will be there, including some people who very much like to be his vice president.

The interesting thing is this vice president race. I mean, let's talk about who's not there. Kristi Noem, after admittingto shooting her dog in the face, somehow thinking that that was going to help her in those VP stakes. As far as I know, she's not there. Maybe she is, but she is certainly out of the running for vice president I think because even Donald Trump would have a problem with that. And so it'll be interesting to see all that. But I'm going to tell you what's going to happen is Donald Trump will spin as much time as he can trying to get these potential VP candidates to try to do more, I don't know, kissing up to Donald Trump, we'll say, so he can extract just as much juice from the turn up as he can before he has to pick a vice president.",

I mean I think there's enough people that have had enough of her antics. But in that process what we have to be careful of is, and this is just my opinion, to normalize Trump and to somehow say that Trump is the normal part of the GOP.I mean this the guy that still tried to overthrow the will of the people last election, has basically made it clear he wants mass deportations and doesn't consider anybody citizens. I mean this is a mess. So -- but if you can at least take out Marjorie Taylor Greene, Mike Johnson did the right thing by putting Ukraine aid on the floor and so that's a good thing, and I think as long as he has Donald Trump supporting him, he's not going to go anywhere. There'll be a few people that obviously turn against Johnson and somehow think they can raise a bunch of money by doing that like Marjorie Taylor Greene does, but I think he'll survive.",

I mean, look, every authoritarian movement that has come to power comes to power on the back of either a bad economy or convincing people that there's a bad economy or on the back of crime or convincing people there's a problem with crime. So this year we've had actually a record of decrease in crime but Donald Trump is running on this idea that crime is skyrocketing because when people usually give up their freedoms is when they fear on those Maslow's hierarchy of needs for just basic safety.And so yes, half of the country is normalizing him. Some of that, the Democrats have to be aware of. They have ignored the border issues or it seems that way. Even if they can come and say they haven't it seems that way. They should be attacking Donald Trump daily on the fact that he made Republicans walk away from the table on this border deal. But I don't understand kind of why that message isn't out there and it's resonating with Republicans or people that would lean Republican. I'm not sure that Donald Trump wins. I mean I think it's still 50-50 but I think it's way too close. This is just my opinion. It's far too close than it should be especially given that he's just openly talking about his authoritarianisms.",

I'm very pro- immigration, but also as a Guardsman, I worked at the border and I can tell you there's a real problem down there.I think if they lean forward on that, they're probably not going to win on the issue of immigration but certainly blunt some of Donald Trump's. Now you don't have to necessarily run for election fighting on Donald Trump's terms, but I think when we see the American people have a concern about something you do need to fight on their terms and so he -- look, he's a demagogue.

He actually meant that, like that's what he said. If he didn't win and so he didn't accept the results of the election, so that's what we have to take very seriously as again you can as he's doing with the crime issue, for instance, where he's saying crime is out of control and rising.It is out of control in certain areas, but macro it's gone down. He can point the things and convince people as he did in 2020 that an election is stolen even against all odds, even against all court cases, what, 64 court cases that rejected him. But all you got to do is convince people and he's pretty good at convincing people of some of that. So don't -- take what Donald Trump -- people said usually, you know, like don't take him literally but take him seriously. No, take him literally and take him seriously because he does telegraph what he is going to do and I think he's telegraphing this that he expects to win Wisconsin and if he doesn't he'll basically say, well, it's probably stolen again.",

I think that the Hamas will not give any ground until they have 100 percent confidence that this will lead to a permanent ceasefire and the removal of Israeli troops from Gaza.

I mean, generally we could say it would be, you know, knocking out the remaining four battalions of militants that are in Rafah, taking out the leadership which includes Yahya Sinwar, the military leader in Gaza, and then, you know, getting rid of the underground infrastructure of the tunnels as best as possible.So, if not, if they don't do those things, then Hamas is going to come out as declaring victory and we'll be right back to where we were seven months ago in many ways with Hamas in charge declaring victory, it will look like, you know, in the street in Gaza, in the West Bank and look like a victory for Hamas as well, which is not going to help the Palestinian Authority.

At a time we've got the protests breaking out in dozens of American campuses across the United States over the invasion of Gaza in response to the October 7th attacks, you're talking about this going through the summer and possibly into the Democratic convention in, what, August. So this is going to drag on politically for some time and even then it doesn't speak to the conclusion of how this all ends. And that hasn't been clarified either. You know, once they -- let's assume they go into Rafah, clear out the remaining battalions, get the leadership, accomplish everything they want to do, well, what happens after that? What's the governance structure? Is Israel in control? Is the Palestinians in control out of the West Bank? There's now talk about maybe it is an agreement among the United States, Egypt, Saudis, UAE, and others to provide some type of policing force and governance for a period of time. But even when you get through that, what is the end state? Is there a two-state solution or is there some type of other arrangement? None of that has been defined and really articulated at all. I think this drags out well into the rest of this year and arguably in the next year. It's just that complicated. DEAN: Yes. There is so much there. While I have you, I also want to talk about Ukraine. Ukraine saying this week, Russia attacked the eastern part of the country nearly 2,000 times in a single day. We know that they've been fighting for over two years now. We now have this new funding that Congress has approved after much back-and-forth and it looked like it maybe wasn't going to happen.

And the logistics of this fact is that it's going to take weeks and weeks, if not months, for really significant amounts that material and ammunition to be delivered to the Ukrainian frontlines. At the same time, Russia is going to continue to press forward.They've seized about 200 square miles of Ukrainian -- new Ukrainian territory since the beginning of this year. They're going to try and do a little bit more before the May 9th Victory Day. But then we know that Russia is going to press for a major offensive this summer as early as mid to late May but going into the summer and they're going to try and capture as much ground as they can while the weather is good, which gets back to your question. Look, I don't think Ukraine is going to be able to mass material, get the platform (INAUDIBLE), they still don't have F-16 jets, and then they have a big manpower problem. They need to conscript and train and make sure those soldiers are prepared. So I don't expect to see a Ukrainian counteroffensive really until spring of next year at the earliest. And so the question is, you know, can they hold out? Can they marshal the forces, prepare them for the spring of next year? And then what are their chances of success? Because Russia will also be building up at the same time. And then the big wildcard, Jessica, is who wins the presidential election here, and whether it's Biden or Trump. If it's Trump, will he decide not to support the Ukrainians? He could turn off that ammunition and materials picket pretty quickly.

But also there was nothing really blockbuster here for the prosecution, and nothing that was really for the defense, putting a nail and the coffin of the prosecution's case. So I think it came out of the balance. The one issue that came out I thought was where, after the fact, she testified that Donald Trump said, well, good thing -- that's a good thing that was taken care of before the election. And I think that was a moment where people are making a big deal about it. But remember, that's kind of hindsight being 2020. So I don't know that that's really going to convince folks that this was all -- you know, that they make the connection between the campaign in and this -- this payment. And ultimately, remember, you have to get to the point where -- and there's nothing tying the payments itself to Donald Trump. And none of that came out through this. You need that in order to -- more to make the case. None of that came out through her testimony. But what she did was also impugn the credibility tremendously of Michael Cohen, saying, look, he was always trying to get in the room. He was always trying to be part of the campaign. He wasn't supposed to be. They didn't want him in the room, but he kept trying to get in the room. And she also said he tended to go rogue.",

But they also talked about -- she also talked a lot about Donald Trump in getting personally involved in things, right? But in particular, anything that dealt with front-facing commentary, messaging that was going out, how things were said, that he was a micromanager involved in every piece of that. But what we didn't get out of that was that he was a micromanager on the other side of it, the business side of it, how things happened, how things were recorded -- recorded. Remember, at the end of the day, this is a business records case. And they've been unable so far to make any real tie between that business record and Donald Trump.",

And of course, full of excitement for those graduating and their families and loved ones. In fact, this was one of six ceremonies that were scheduled to be held here at FSU between Friday and Saturday. According to the university, FSU is awarding degrees to more than 7,800 graduates. Five protesters were arrested during a demonstration here at the FSU campus. But that happened on Tuesday afternoon. Two of them are current students, according to the school, and they were banned from campus for one year and it's still an open question whether they will be able to graduate. FSU said in a statement that the arrest occurred after the individuals ignored multiple requests and warnings to comply with a lawful order. Officials said that the universities rules and regulations had been explained repeatedly over several days and that the group had been compliant until the arrest happened. Now, it was also a tense week at the University of Florida in Gainesville, about two hours away from here, where nine pro-Palestine protesters were arrested Monday evening on campus. On Friday, we spoke with the leader of the same group of pro-Palestine protesters in Gainesville. He criticized Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who recently said that Florida is not going to put up with violent protesters and people who, in his words, tried to come into your college launch. Let's take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ARON ALI-MCCLORY, YOUNG DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISTS OF AMERICA: We're asking for disclosure of financial transactions of the endowment so that we can ask for divestment from weapons manufacturing and companies that are complicit in the genocide happening in Gaza. Additionally, we want the U.S. to end, of course, partnerships with weapons manufacturers and other such kind of affiliations that the university has. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
