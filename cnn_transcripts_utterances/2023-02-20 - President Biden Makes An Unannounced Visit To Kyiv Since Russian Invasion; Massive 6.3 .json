Tonight, the U.S. President makes an unannouncedtrip to Ukraine, a visit the Ukraine's president says will have repercussions on the battlefield. Then, a massive 6.3 magnitude aftershock hits Turkey, more than a week out from the original earthquake. And anger on the streets of Jerusalem. People have been protesting the Israeli government's judicial reform bill, we'll show you the scene inside the Knesset, it's almost as lively. But first, U.S. has just sent a powerful message of its support to Ukraine in the form of President Joe Biden himself. He met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv under bright blue skies and the ever-present threat of Russian airstrikes. Well, as the first anniversary of the war approaches, Mr. Biden says the U.S. wants to make it clear, there is no doubt that will back Ukraine for the long haul. Well, here's how the visit went. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SOARES (voice-over):  Air raid sirens blaring throughout the streets of Kyiv. But unlike other alerts over the past year, there were no reported incoming Russian missiles.",

They've been saying, look, this is not essentially a war of Russia versus Ukraine -- they obviously still call this a special military operation, even though even Vladimir Putin has used the word \"war\" in the past. They're saying It's not between Ukraine and Russia, it's essentially between Russia and the West, Russia and NATO, Russia and specifically the United States. Obviously, pertaining to the fact that there's so many western weapons that are coming into Ukraine now, that certainly is something where if you look at Kremlin-controlled media, they will say that this is essentially a clash between Russia and the West. And certainly, we do believe that we are going to hear more of that from Vladimir Putin, but then we'll see what exactly there is in substance in that speech, whether or not there's anything new and as far as strategy is concerned. But one thing that I think is clear, Isa, from what we've seen, since I've gotten here, back to Moscow, is that the Russians certainly showing no signs of backing down.

But it sends a very strong message to Ukraine's allies and partners, United States allies and partners, looks to support it. This is not an easy war to fight.

And you can imagine the distress and shock that people here in southeast Turkey are going through, having to relive that trauma once again. And we're in the city of Adana, which is about 120 miles away from that epicenter. And I have to say, our team felt that tremor, as did everyone in the hotel that we're currently staying in, which was evacuated pretty swiftly. But I have to say people here are still afraid to go inside, fearing another aftershock. We've seen families taking their duvets and bed covers out into the hallway, into the lobby with their children, waiting there for fear of another aftershock. And there is a real sense of concern and urgency here, we've heard from local authorities in Hatay Province, calling on people not to enter any buildings that have been damaged. We've already seen reports that some of the buildings previously damaged in the earthquake two weeks ago have now collapsed. And there is further reports of collapsed buildings in northern Syria as well. But as I said, we are still waiting for more details of the extent of the damage caused by this latest aftershock.

Now, of course, the people of southeast Turkey have already been through so much, already have lost so much, particularly in Hatay Province, one of the hardest-hit provinces by the earthquake two weeks ago. Some 80 percent of buildings there have been deemed damaged or in need of reconstruction. So there is a real sense of concern. Of course, and you can imagine the emotional trauma people have gone through. We've already seen families being evacuated out of the southeast. And in fact, last week, we were in Istanbul, we met with some of those families who have been evacuated as well as children, some of whom have been separated from their families, still missing, others have lost absolutely everyone. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BASHIR (voice-over):  Their laughter hides their loss. Pulled from the rubble, their parents still missing, the identities of some a mystery.

Now, Israeli protesters say they're fighting forthe soul of the nation, but their mass demonstrations haven't stopped parliament from beginning debate on proposals that would weaken the judiciary and strengthen the powers of lawmakers themselves. Critics say the government's plan will destroy Israeli democracy, liking it to a coup. This was the scene in Jerusalem earlier today, as protesters gathered ahead of the Knesset's first official reading of the bill. Our Hadas was among the crowd. Have a look at this. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) HADAS GOLD, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT (on camera):  This is the main road that leads not only in front of the Israeli Supreme Court, but also ends in front of the Israeli parliament, the Knesset. And that's where these thousands of protesters are heading, for these protesters today here, they believe that these judicial reforms would threaten the independence of the Israeli judiciary. Some of them believe that it's only to help Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, in his ongoing corruption trial, something he denies. The protesters here are chanting things like democracy, they're chanting things like Israel, it will not become a dictatorship. For many of them here, they have this visceral belief that these reforms are really threatening the Israeli way of life and the Israeli democracy. But for the counter protesters, and there are counter-protesters here, they support these reforms. The believe that they're very much needed. They believe that it's a long time coming, and that this is what the Israeli voters voted for in those November elections when Benjamin Netanyahu and his allies won a 64-seat majority in the Israeli parliament. But Benjamin Netanyahu is facing external pressures, including from the American ambassador to Israel, who in a recent podcast in recent days called on the Israeli government to pump the brakes, he said, he said to slow down the legislative process, and allow time for consensus, allow time for negotiations.

Now, they started really concentrated in Tel Aviv, that'swhere we saw some of those huge numbers, 100,000, 130,000. But in recent weeks, they've really moved down towards Jerusalem because the legislative action is starting, and as you noted today, was the first reading of that bill. And that's why those protesters wanted to go towards the Israeli parliament. And they believe -- you know, they don't have any belief that, you know, this one protest will absolutely change anything. But when I talked to the protesters, they believe that a sustained campaign, a sustained pressure campaign. They want people to be out there in the tens of thousands every week, putting pressure on the government, putting pressure on Benjamin Netanyahu to not only hopefully push them, but also push public opinion in general against these reforms that they see as so disastrous. Now, as I noted, there were counter-protesters there, they are much smaller numbers in terms of counter-protesters, and for many of these protesters, they say they believe that even for the people who voted for Netanyahu, they didn't necessarily vote for these reforms, and at least, not in the way that they are being pushed through. But Isa, really, a lot of the action tonight was not just on the streets, but also within the Israeli parliament itself. Because when this bill was first brought up for a debate, the opposition lawmakers, they started to essentially protest, there were protests on the floor of parliament, waving Israeli flags, wrapping themselves in Israeli flags. Now, there are rules against raising anything on the parliamentary floor, but it's very clear the message that they were trying to be -- trying to send by being forcibly removed from the floor by security, while waving Israeli flags. They are trying to send a message that they believe that these reforms are essentially destroying Israel as they know it. And not just on the floor, in the gallery above also, protesters made their way into the viewing gallery. Some of them were actually banging on the glass that they have there. And they were also removed forcibly by protesters. These actions were condemned, of course, by Benjamin Netanyahu, as well as other actions by protesters today, were condemned by opposition lawmakers. But I should note that this debate is actually ongoing. And we don't expect the vote, that first actual vote, to happen until about an hour or so from now. And keep in mind, Isa, this is the first of three votes that are needed before this could actually come into law. So, there could be several more weeks of these protesters and several more weeks of these dramatic scenes in the Israeli parliament.",

Now, it's interesting to note several of the President's counterparts, European leaders, even the First Lady, his top cabinet officials, have all made visits into Ukraine. And the President has told his team for the better part of the last seven or eight months that he wanted to make a visit as well. That visit was considered like -- unlikely because of the security risks and concerns. And just for context here, I think it's important, while U.S. presidents have regularly visited war zones over the course of the 20 years of war with Iraq and Afghanistan, this is the first time a U.S. president in history has visited a warzone of another country where the U.S. did not control the infrastructure on the ground, did not control the airspace above. And that was what added so much complexity to this. Now, over the course of the last couple of weeks, the President made clear this is a trip that he wanted to make. A very small team, unlike the usual scale for a visit like this, was put into place. White House officials, Pentagon officials, Secret Service officials, to pull this all together on Friday night in a meeting in the Oval Office. The President gave it the final green light left under the cover of darkness at 4:30 on Sunday morning, traveled first to Germany to refuel then to Poland, and then on a train into Kyiv. It's a very long trip. And we spent five hours on the ground. But I think as you heard from the Ukrainian people, and as you consider what the President's going to be trying to do when he comes here to Warsaw, it was critical to send a message not just to the Ukrainian people, not just to the American people, but really to the entire world about a war that shows no signs of ending anytime soon, a war that has tested the durability of not just the U.S. support, but the Western alliance has been put together and led by the U.S., and the necessity of maintaining that durability in the months and perhaps even longer ahead.",

And the fact that they see it as fairly open-ended at this point in time. Here's the context that's critical here. Neither Scott Perry, nor the vast majority of those who support that position that he laid out on social media, control the house, control the Senate, control the committees that control the funding, or control the committees that set defense and foreign policy for the United States of America. And they certainly don't control the White House. I think that's -- when he talked about those officials, they see it and they are very cognizant of the fact that a shift against the direction that the President has been pursuing policy-wise when it comes to Ukraine over the course of the last year would be severely problematic. They don't see it get in terms of its weight, carrying over to those who make the critical decisions. However, when you talk about the various audiences that the President will be trying to reach, not just with his visit today in Kyiv but also tomorrow in his remarks here on Warsaw, the American public is definitely one of those audiences because they understand that support is critical across the country politically in order to maintain the position that they've had it for more than almost a year.",

And the very fact that we were able to do this shows that we have a lot of trust in the Ukrainians, of course, but we also let the Russians know that with a few hours notice that the President was coming in they if they did anything, it would, of course, look bad on them in many respects. And if you put the president in danger, that could of course risk escalating this conflict. So, it was a very brief call. The U.S. military did provide overwatch over Poland, using AWACS planes and other sources of surveillance to make sure that the President was safe.

Some of that training is already beginning in Europe and in the United States for the Patriot missile. When it comes to aircraft, the British are, of course, beginning pilot training on NATO standard aircrafts so the Ukrainians will be used to some of those cockpits when they see them. I -- and at some point, I believe that they will get the chance to fly these aircraft. But it will take at least three to eight months where they can safely transition from, let's say, a MiG-29 to an F-16 Or a typhoon. And that is going to require them to, you know, be not only quite good at, you know, receiving the training, but also quite good at implementing that.

And it was also very clear to me based on, you know, how this ended up that the Ukrainians have a tremendous ability to use their terrain to not only bask themselves within that terrain in a tactical sense, but also to use the advantages that a defending force has. And they did that quite effectively. So the Ukrainians have a much better fighting force for -- per capita, if you will, compared to the Russians and the Russians are, in fact, suffering a defeat at this particular point in time. Now, of course, they won't like that to stand and they will want to do something to mitigate that perception.
