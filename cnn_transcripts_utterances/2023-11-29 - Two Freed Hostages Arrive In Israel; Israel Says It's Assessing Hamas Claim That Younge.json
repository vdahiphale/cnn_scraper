It's been women and children so far, almost entirely, with a few exceptions. We also know Israeli troops are at the \"ready, prepared operationally,\" that is a quote along the truce lines in Gaza. Should this pause expire, and military actions resume?We do have regional coverage, so let's start now with Jeremy Diamond. Jeremy, you're there in Ofakim, Israel.

When we got here earlier this evening, there were just a few people, but word spread very quickly that this first group of newly released hostages was set to come right through here, through the town of Ofakim, on their way to the Hatzerim airbase, which is right in front of me.And what we saw earlier in the last hour was these scenes of absolute jubilation as these two Russian-Israeli women, freed today by Hamas, as part of a separate agreement, it appears, between Hamas and the Russian government, arrived here on buses. We saw one of those women smiling and waving as she was greeted by the crowds here. That includes a lot of children, men and women, loud music blaring, drums sounding, really, just quite a scene to welcome these women who have undergone more than 50 days of captivity inside of Gaza. These two women are Yelena Trupanob, who is 50 years old, and Irina Teti who is 73 years old. They are the third - the second and third Russian-Israeli citizens to have been released, not as a part of the kind of overall agreement between Israel and Hamas for these now six days of a pause in fighting, but a separate agreement, it appears. We are still waiting to see when exactly those 10 Israeli citizens will be released today as part of that main agreement. We have yet to get news that they are in Red Cross custody. That is typically the first sign that we know that they are soon going to be on their way to Israel. But we will be standing by right here to see whether or not they come through this same roundabout on their way to that air base and then shortly on their way to hospitals and into the arms of their families.",

Crucially, Mark Regev, a senior policy adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on our air in the last hour, also pointed out that they believe Hamas has the numbers to make this happen. Enough women and children, 10 a day, to extend this for 48 days, two more days. And that's absolutely critical here because that's a necessary part of the agreement as it stands. We also know from Israel's prime minister's office that they have enough of a list of Palestinian women and children who could be released in exchange for those Israeli hostages, such that all the tools are in place to get this over the line for an extension in the truce. Now the sides just have to come to an agreement and it has to actually happen.",

      "sentences": "So, Brianna, we're treating this story very carefully because of what we know and, crucially, what we don't know. Israel says it's assessing the claims of Hamas, which put out a statement earlier today that in an Israeli airstrike, 10-month-old Kfir Bibas, as you point out, the youngest Israeli in Hamas captivity or held in Gaza, I should say, as well as four-year-old Ariel Bibas, his big brother, and their mother, Shiri Bibas, were killed in an Israeli airstrike. The problem is Hamas put out absolutely no evidence to support this claim, nor do they put a date on it.And we also know that Israel hasn't carried out strikes in Gaza since before the truce went into effect, which was six days ago. So there's a tremendous amount of information missing. The IDF says they have been in touch with the Bibas family as they look into these claims and continue to keep them updated as this investigation moves forward. The Bibas family pulled out a statement or put out a statement, I should say, in response to Hamas. They said, \"Our family has learned of Hamas' latest claims. We are waiting for the information to be confirmed and hopefully refuted by military officials. We thank the people of Israel for their warm support, but kindly request privacy during this difficult time.\" It's worth noting that the IDF spokesperson said just a couple of days ago that Hamas had transferred the Bibas family to the captivity or were held by another militant or terrorist organization inside of Gaza, so it's unclear where that stands. We also know, because we have been in constant communication with the Bibas family before tonight, that they had repeatedly requested the Red Cross be able to visit the Bibas family and check on them, that never happened. Hamas never let that happen, a violation of the truce agreement and of international law.",

The U.S. wants this pause to continue. Qatar, which has been mediating all of this, wants this pause to continue. We heard Oren say there that Israel is considering it.But Israel has said from the beginning, if you keep giving us 10 hostages per day, you can have another day of pause. And now the onus is really on Hamas to come up with these 10 hostages for tomorrow. And so we will know if this pause is extended later today. What we have seen over the course of the past six nights is every night Hamas is supposed to give a list of who they intend to release the next day. So, if we get that list later tonight, we can expect that this will go into a seventh day. Now, the CIA director, Bill Burns, has been in the Middle East. He was in Doha yesterday to meet with Egyptian-Israeli Qatari counterparts to really push for an extension of this deal. There is a belief that Hamas has at least two more days' worth, so around 20 more women and children who they can release. And so there is an expectation, a real hope there that that is what is going to happen. Here is what Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, had to say about all this earlier today. Take a listen.

But there is a sense that Israel really wants to focus on getting all of these women and children out before moving on to the next groups of hostages.

While the public does want to have these twin goals, 90 percent of them - a poll last week - 90 percent of them want both the hostages out and resuming fighting. But a majority really absolutely believes that they have to go at it and eliminate Hamas.So there's a lot at stake here for the Israeli government. And we have to understand that, domestically, this pressure is on them, and that is probably going to trump a lot of the pressure that the United States is putting on, this countervailing pressure, in order to extend it.",

Beth, wanted to dig in on the question of the process of getting these hostages out, because CNN's reporting is that more than 40 of them were not actually taken by Hamas, but other fundamentalist groups and even other potential individual actors, just random criminals, potentially. That has to make the process not only difficult from a negotiating standpoint, but just logistically actually getting the numbers and figuring out what their status is in the midst of the war that we saw play out in Gaza.",

There's alternative kind of surveillance, but they asked for the drones not to be there. That's to protect them from reconstituting militarily, but also because they're trying to go and find these hostages and locate them and move them without being discovered.On this question of this family, the 10-month-old, I think that there are a couple ways to look at this. It might be true that they were killed. We don't know. There are a lot of Palestinian bodies that have not been recovered as a result of bombings. But it's also true that the IDF reported that one of these militant groups was holding this family and maybe they killed them, we don't know. So there's a - there are a lot of questions out there about how this will work and the ability of Hamas to deliver. But as Oren reported, there should be enough for another two days.",

But things are moving in the right direction right now.I mean, the national average is down at $3.25 a gallon. It's down 62 days in a row, a big improvement from nearly $4 a gallon back in September. And now drivers in 15 states are seeing gas prices on average of $3 or less. That includes Texas, Ohio, Iowa and South Carolina. Now, that is a big win for consumers. Now, in another positive, this morning, we learned that the U.S. economy accelerated this summer more than previously known. GDP clocking in at 5.2 percent, that is a very impressive number, especially when you remember that a lot of economists expected the U.S. economy to be in a recession right about now. We're nowhere near there and yet consumers do give these economy low marks. If you look at consumer confidence, it has started to rebound in recent months, but it is well below the pre-COVID level. And that is a problem for the White House, because it does speak to some lingering economic anxiety. One thing I do think we should remember is that Americans are still spending money. I mean, holiday shopping season is off to a very strong start. Cyber Monday sales shattered records. So it's funny because a lot of Americans say that they don't like this economy, but they're spending like they love it.",

He said, \"A lot of things out there are dangerous and inflationary. Be prepared. Interest rates may go up and that might lead to recession.\" So a stark warning there from Dimon. But we have heard similar comments from him in the past. I do think this is a reminder that there are risks out there. We do, though, need to remember that this is a fast-moving economy.
