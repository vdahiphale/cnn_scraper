Despite his wide lead in the polls, two weeks before the Palmetto State's Republican primary, the former president is taking numerous shots at Haley and her husband. Rather than highlighting policy differences with the former South Carolina governor, Trump mocked her husband, Michael for being absent from the campaign trail while he is currently serving his country overseas in Africa, his second active deployment having previously served in Afghanistan. Here's what Trump said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Let's discuss all of that now with Republican Congressman Tim Burchett of Tennessee. He's a member of the House Foreign Affairs and Oversight Committees. Congressman, welcome back to the program. Appreciate it. Good to see you again, sir. Is that appropriate for Trump to be talking about Nikki Haley's husband in that fashion? REP. TIM BURCHETT (R-TN): I don't think it's appropriate to talk about anybody's family, Jim. I've got a family myself. And that's what I always tell my opponents when I pull them up close to me and I say in very quiet terms, I always tell them, anything you want to say about me is fine but just leave my family out of it and we're going to get -- we'll do just fine.
