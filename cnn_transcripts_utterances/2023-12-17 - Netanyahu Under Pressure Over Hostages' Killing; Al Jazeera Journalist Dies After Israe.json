(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): Without the military pressure, we would not have succeeded in creating an outline that led to the release of 110 hostages. And only continued military pressure will lead to the releases of all of our hostages. My directive to the negotiating team is based on this pressure, without which we would have nothing. (END VIDEO CLIP) WATT: Mr. Netanyahu spoke after IDF troops mistakenly killed three Israeli hostages while they were shirtless and waving a white flag. Israel's military now says it had no advance intelligence about those hostages and that soldiers did not expect to be approached by them. A preliminary review of the incident has been completed by the IDF and CNN is working to obtain that. Meanwhile, a source tells CNN that Israel's Spy Chief, Mossad Director David Barnea, has now met with Qatar's Prime Minister in Europe for talks about hostages. We're still waiting to get more details. But in Israel, the deaths of those three hostages have created a political firestorm for Mr. Netanyahu, with protests continuing into a second day on Saturday. Elliott Gotkine is monitoring developments. He joins us now from London. Elliott, I think we've got to start with this Mossad meeting with Qatar. How significant could that be?",

He is Israel's go-to guy for these negotiations with the Qataris and the Qataris of course have been dealing with Hamas. There's no direct contact naturally, so the Mossad Chief has been speaking with the Qataris who have then in turn been speaking with Hamas' political representatives in Doha.So that will perhaps give a spark of hope to the families of those 129 hostages, 21 of them believe to be dead, still being held captive inside the Gaza Strip ever since they were abducted during Hamas's massacre of October the 7th. Because there will be hopes that at least something is happening but of course it was only just last week we were there are a few developments which was that David Barnea was due to go to Doha. We learned that that trip was cancelled by the Israeli government. We also heard even from sources in the United States that Hamas just wasn't prepared to talk right now. There was no one on the other side of the negotiating table and of course it was difficult enough to get that first truce in place and get those 110 hostages freed by Hamas in exchange for Israel releasing Palestinian prisoners. Now, it's become even more difficult because Israel has to speak to the Qataris. The Qataris have to speak to the Hamas political representatives in Doha who then have to speak to the military fighters of Hamas inside the Gaza Strip who of course are doing their very, very best to avoid being detected and killed by the Israelis who are doing their very best to kill them. So it's a much more complicated situation than it was before. But certainly this meeting will signal to the families who still have loved ones being held captive in the Gaza Strip for more than two months now that at least something is being done and perhaps the government is paying heed to their demands to make getting those hostages, get them freed, get them back into Israel right now as the number one priority as opposed to seemingly having the military operations as the number one priority, Nick.

Now, President Biden has said he is open to compromise. And Senate negotiators as well as White House officials have been working around the clock to discuss some potential changes. Now, sources tell me some of the proposals on the table include, for example, raising the credible fear standard for asylum seekers, mandatory detention of migrants, as well as expanding a fast-track deportation procedure and expelling migrants at the U.S. southern border without giving them the chance to seek asylum. Another sticking point, according to sources, is parole authority, which allows some migrants to temporarily live in the United States on a case-by-case basis. But all of these issues are complicated and officials and negotiators are trying to find some level of compromise to, again, push that supplemental funding request forward. The President has repeatedly made the case that the request is not only for the national security of Ukraine and Israel, but also for U.S. National security.

Whatever happens in the 2024 election, Trump has shown there is an audience in the Republican coalition in particular for all of these kinds of arguments. You know, in polls while he was president, 90% of Republicans said Christianity in the U.S. is under attack. Three quarters said that discrimination against whites is now a bigger problem as discrimination against minorities. And in multiple polls, 55% to 60% of Republicans said the traditional way of American life is disappearing so fast that true patriots may have to use force to preserve it. So there is an audience for this. But as you note, there is also a substantial audience that has been mobilized in three consecutive elections to prevent this vision from being implemented. And we are in a position now where a majority of voters are unhappy about the economy, discontented about Biden, maybe think he's too old to run for another term. But it's a very different proposition to say that most Americans in the end will be able to -- will be willing to empower someone talking so explicitly, echoing fascist leaders from the darkest moments of the 20th Century.

This was during his team's away fixture to Bournemouth on Saturday.Now, according to his club, Lockyer suffered a cardiac arrest midway through the second half at the Vitality Stadium. Both teams were taken off the pitch, amid really distressing images as the 29-year -old Welshman received medical treatment before being taken off on a stretcher and hospitalized. Luton say Lockyer is in a stable condition. Luton revealing players from both sides were in no state of mind to continue after seeing their much-loved teammate and friend taken off. Both sets of players later re-emerging once the game had been called off, walking around the pitch and applauding fans who'd shown their support for Lockyer. The Luton Town manager Rob Edwards amid scenes of very high emotion. Lockyer underwent heart surgery in June after he also collapsed during Luton's playoff victory that sealed promotion to the Premier League. He would later tell Sky Sports that it was due to an irregular heartbeat, adding he'd been given the all-clear following a procedure. Luton Town declared their skipper was thankfully responsive, adding our medical staff have confirmed that the Hatter's captain suffered cardiac arrest on the pitch on Saturday, but was responsive by the time he was taken off on the stretcher. He received further treatment inside the stadium, for which we once again thank the medical teams from both sides. Well, wishes coming in from the football community at large, Manchester United taking to social media to declare the thoughts of everyone at United are with you, Tom. While Fabrice Muamba, who suffered a cardiac arrest during a match in 2012, showing his support for Lockyer via X, wishing you a speedy recovery, Tom Lockyer. It's great to hear you are responsive and alert, rest up, and God willing, you recover well. Thinking of you and your family today.
