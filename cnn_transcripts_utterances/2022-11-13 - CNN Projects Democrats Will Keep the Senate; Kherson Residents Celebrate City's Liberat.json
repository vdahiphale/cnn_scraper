I'm Alison Kosik in New York.And America is inching closer to finalizing the midterm elections with control of the Senate now decided in the Democrats' favor. But the House of Representatives is still depending on the outcomes of 20 undecided races in California, Oregon and Arizona. Today, however, Democrats are celebrating a hard-fought victory for control of the U.S. Senate. As new vote totals were released overnight in Nevada, CNN was able to project that incumbent Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto would be the Democrats' 50th Senate seat. Still one more race is to be decided in Georgia. But for now the Democrats know that they will control the Senate for the next two years, with the vice president as tie breaker. Here is Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer as the 50 seat threshold was crossed. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), MAJORITY LEADER:  The election is a great win for the American people. With the races now called in Arizona and Nevada, Democrats will have a majority in the Senate and I will once again be majority leader. This election is a victory, a victory and a vindication for Democrats, our agenda and for the American people. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

From Russiagate to the Zelenskyy phone call January 6th, multiple impeachments, the base sticks with him and I think that Trump still has to be considered the odds-on favorite in 2024. That is especially true if the GOP field fractures with more than one opponent against Trump and they kind of split the vote. But certainly DeSantis is trending, nearly winning by Florida 20 percentage points.

And as a result, they think that the very least Trump is owed going in 2024 is another opportunity to rematch against Joe Biden or whoever the Democratic nominee is. So the belief and the Big Lie is still resilient. And I think one lesson Republicans might take from 2022 is to say, yes, we didn't do as well. But that is because Donald Trump was not at the top of the ballot. So maybe that is becoming more of a difficult case to make and maybe his grip on the GOP is loosening.

Whether Republicans are able to do that effectively really depends on how well the party can stick together. Yes, it looks like they may have a majority in the House, although even that is not certain at the moment. But it will be a very slim margin.

The grain deal was brokered by the U.N. and Turkiye back in July, at first to guarantee safe passage of ships carrying the exported Ukrainian grain through the Black Sea.Russia pulled out of that deal and then rejoined it earlier this month. It pulled out over -- after attacks on Crimea. Turkiye and the U.N. got them to successfully rejoin the deal. And so now Turkiye's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, told a state broadcaster that he was hoping to parlay the success of that into a peace deal, saying that he had hoped to speak with President Putin at the G20 summit this week in Indonesia. Of course President Putin is not attending that summit. So perhaps that conversation can happen in a different format. The problem for Erdogan right now is that the prospect of peace talks seem pretty dead and buried. You have the U.S. privately urging Kyiv to publicly say that it is open to the possibility of renewed negotiations. But you have the Ukrainian presidential adviser, conflating the word \"settlement\" with \"surrender.\" You have President Zelenskyy saying that he would only hold talks if President Putin were no longer in charge in Russia. And Moscow is saying that, yes, it is open for negotiations but it is not possible because President Zelenskyy signed this formal decree, ruling out the possibility of any kind of negotiations after Russia illegally annexed four regions of Ukraine. So not exactly a great situation to lay the foundation for any kind of peace talks. But if there were to be talks in the future, you'd have to imagine that Turkiye could be in a good position to play a role in brokering those talks. Not only has it helped get this grain deal off the ground, it also helped broker a large prisoner swap back in September. It is looking to become sort of a gas hub, to broker gas, the movement of gas between Russia and the rest of Europe. The problem, though, is that President Erdogan needs two willing partners.

And in just under half an hour, president Isaac Herzog is set to meet with Netanyahu here at the president's residence.And we expect both men to be up on the podiums behind me. They are just preparing things as we speak, to confirm that president Herzog has indeed invited Netanyahu to form a government. It is expected to be a government that is the most right wing in Israel's history. And because of the extreme proportional representation system here in Israel, pretty much any one them, if they don't get what they want in the coalition negotiations, due to kick off in earnest today, they could effectively bring the coalition down or prevent it from forming in the first place. So there will be a lot of haggling, a lot of horse trading over the next 28 days, to see who gets what ministry and what this new government's priorities will be. We already know for example from the religious Zionism, which put on an astonishing show, one of its components, Jewish Power, its leader has a conviction for inciting racial hatred against Arabs and also for supporting terrorism. He wants to be public security minister. And so for now we're waiting for president Herzog and Netanyahu to come out here to make the announcement.",

These are live pictures from Cambodia.As the election drama plays out here in the U.S., President Biden is wrapping up his latest stop on a week long trip overseas. He has been in this meeting in Cambodia with Asian leaders at the ASEAN summit where he sought to counter China's growing influence in the region. And he is expected to leave for Indonesia shortly. Mr. Biden, who you see here, is in Cambodia after attending the COP27 climate summit in Egypt on Friday. His next stop is the G20 summit in Bali. And that is where he will hold his first in-person meeting with Xi Jinping since taking office. And we have two senior international correspondents, Will Ripley live in Phnom Penh and Ivan Watson in Indonesia. Will, I know you've been listening in on these meetings happening in Cambodia. What have you heard, what are the issues that the ASEAN members have been focusing on as far as their regional priorities go?",

For example we're not expecting a joint statement to come out from both China and the U.S. after this expected meeting on Monday here in Bali.This will be the first time that President Biden and Xi Jinping will meet face-to-face in person since Biden was elected president. We knew Xi Jinping would be coming in politically strengthened having just secured a precedent-breaking third term in office after last month's Communist Party congress. What we didn't expect is that President Biden would come in with some political wind in his sails after the unexpected results of the midterm elections in the U.S. And that is something that he alluded to directly in statements that he made recently in Cambodia. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I know I'm coming in strong but I'll need it. I know Xi Jinping. I spent more time with him than any other world leader. I know him well; he knows me. There's no -- we have very little misunderstanding. We've just got to figure out where the red lines are and what are the most important things to each of us. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "So this is how the White House is trying to frame this. They are saying that, yes, the relationships have deteriorated. The U.S. and China are competitors but they are trying to argue, let's have a healthy competition and establish guidelines to ensure that that condition doesn't deteriorate into conflict.From Beijing's point of view, the Chinese government has been promoting the narrative that China's risk is greater than it's been in some time, that it is facing security threats and has accused the U.S. of creating what he describes as dangerous cliques, basically alliances that seek to isolate China. The biggest flashpoint between these two governments is the island of Taiwan, which China views as a breakaway region of China, even though the Communist Party has never ruled directly Taiwan, this self- governing democracy. Biden, meanwhile, on record has said that he believes the U.S. should defend Taiwan if China was ever to attack it militarily. It is hard to see where these two leaders can find compromise on this issue. There are other flashpoints as well:  the South China Sea; China's ongoing kind of moral and political support to Russia in its war with Ukraine, though it seems to have stopped short of providing weapons to Russia in that grueling conflict. Again, expectations have been set low. But the White House believes that this is a good chance for the two leaders to meet face-to-face, to try to find some common ground to avoid a flare-up in the years ahead.",
