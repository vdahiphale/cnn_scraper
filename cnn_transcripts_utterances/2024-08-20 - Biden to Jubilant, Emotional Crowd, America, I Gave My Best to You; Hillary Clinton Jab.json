But while he was doing that, the cheers were saying, thank you to Joe, and he would say, thank you, Kamala, again, sort of showing that he is now passing the torch on to her, and really trying to zero in on how critical it is to get her elected.

      "sentences": "It was a great interview, John. I loved it. I do think when you look at the roster tonight, yes, President Obama is really the speaker that Democrats are looking to make the affirmative case for Kamala Harris, in part because he's one of the most popular figures in the Democratic Party alongside his wife, Michelle Obama.But also he has known Kamala Harris for quite a long time. They have a relationship going back 20 years. And of all the national politicians who are going to hear from at this convention this week, he is perhaps the one who knows her the best. You know, back in 2004, Kamala Harris was a delegate to the convention in Boston. She was inside the hall when then-candidate Obama delivered that keynote speech that essentially thrust him into the national spotlight. Back then, he described himself as the skinny kid with a funny name. Tonight, he comes on the convention stage as something of an elder statesman. He has a couple of tasks One, I think, is to make this case for Kamala Harris. You know, we're talking to his advisers. They say he really wants to make the case that she and Tim Walz represent the best Democrats going forward, making the affirmative case for their candidacy. Certainly, he also wants to honor Joe Biden. We heard plenty of that last night as well, but it will be important to hear from the man who Joe Biden served for eight years as vice president. Theirs is a complicated relationship to be sure made more complicated by the last month or so. But this is something that is very important to Barack Obama, and, in fact, he just tweeted yesterday, what I admire most about Joe is his decency, his resilience, and his remarkable belief in the purpose of our country. Those values are the ones that America needs most, Obama says. He says he's proud to call Joe Biden his president, and that he's grateful to call him his friend. Now, according to a senior Obama adviser, he does view this as an all- hands-on-deck moment. He is prepared to do whatever he needs to do to get Kamala Harris elected. And in some ways, he's returning the favor. Back in 2008, Kamala Harris trekked to Iowa before the Iowa caucuses to make the case for Barack Obama. She knocked on doors. She handed out pizzas to people in line at the caucus stations. I don't think we're going to see Barack Obama handing out pizzas to anyone this fall, but certainly he wants to help her get to the White House.",

But that is how Donald Trump responds to these.

Such activity, including thefts and disclosures, are intended to influence the U.S. election process. Now, we know Donald Trump was briefed by the FBI after some documents that were believed to come from a senior campaign official were released and were brought to different news outlets. The news outlets reported having been approached with these documents. Those documents are believed to come from and be the result of a hack of a senior campaign official on Donald Trump's campaign. And actually, they came from, first, a breach of longtime Trump ally Roger Stone's personal email account. The Iranian hackers then used that account to get access to the senior campaign official's account, thus leaking the documents after they got access to that. Look, this is part of a broader, persistent effort by Iran to sow discord and interfere in U.S. politics and U.S. elections. We've seen them do this back in 2020 and in 2016, this statement from the FBI and the intelligence community reminding us that this is nothing new. But we are seeing more ramped up activity from Iran. That's the warning the FBI and the intel community has for Americans going into the last home stretch of this 2024 election.",
