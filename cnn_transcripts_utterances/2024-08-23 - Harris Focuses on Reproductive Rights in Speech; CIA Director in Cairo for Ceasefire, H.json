Also happening today, we are following diplomacy around the world. CIA Director Bill Burns in Egypt to oversee the latest chapter of ceasefire and hostage talks. Meantime, India's Prime Minister visiting with President Zelenskyy in Kyiv, just weeks after meeting with Putin in Moscow. And the stock market. Well, the stock market here in New York set to open just about 30 minutes from now. But frankly, a lot of the attention is much further west. You see the futures there, but really all eyes on Jackson Hole, Wyoming, because, of course, the Fed Chair, Jerome Powell, set to speak there within the next hour. What could he say in that speech? Traders are going to be hanging on every word. We'll bring a little bit of a preview coming up at the bottom of the hour.

But health experts we talked with suggested it could be a different decision on timing based on people's own health circumstances. So, for folks who may be more vulnerable because they're elderly or have other underlying health conditions that could make them more vulnerable to severe COVID. They say maybe they want to get this updated COVID vaccine sooner. Other folks may want to wait till a little bit further into the fall, closer to when they might get their flu shot. Some health experts said they're going to wait until October. That's a typical time you hear for people to get the flu shot, because we do see these big waves of respiratory viruses in the winter from both flu and COVID, as well as RSV, where there are also immunizations available for certain groups, for folks who already had COVID in this most recent wave, because we have been seeing a really big surge. Health experts say you could wait about three months, because you will still have built up immunity from that infection. So, you can put it off for a little bit, but Erica, I think health authorities are really just hoping they might see a higher number of people get the COVID vaccine this year. They only saw about 15 percent of kids last year and less than 25 percent of adults. So, getting up closer to flu rates would get you up to about half of folks getting the shot.",

He doesn't need Congress, of course, toenact them, and that the inflationary impulse that they create will be short term and therefore important for the Federal Reserve and, of course, for American families. She suggested almost $4,000 for the average middle-income family, the cost of these because, remember, in the end, the costs are passed on to consumers. She's not far off. And was quoting the most extreme example, the highest tariffs across the most products which came, as you can see there from the Center for American Progress, which was around $3,900. The Tax Policy Center is perhaps the most conservative in their estimates that it would cost around $1,300. We have to see what happens if he wins the election, if he enacts these. I think part of the biggest challenge of this is most analysts think it will be inflationary. Moody's is saying it could add a percentage point to inflation next year, and that will slow the Federal Reserve down in their ability to bring rates down. So just one of the differences in policies between them, but this could be a real whammy.",

LAVANDERA (voice-over): Friendly stranger reminds us of that in a loving way. This is \"Close Encounters: Tourists in the Wild\". It didn't take us long to figure out what not to do. There is such a thing as getting too close to wildlife. Wild animals don't want to take a selfie with you, and they especially don't want to be held. This scene was captured in North Carolina. These people pulled black bear cubs out of a tree, and because of this human interaction, at least one of the cubs could not be reunited with its mother. Wildlife refuge staff were unable to locate the second cub. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
