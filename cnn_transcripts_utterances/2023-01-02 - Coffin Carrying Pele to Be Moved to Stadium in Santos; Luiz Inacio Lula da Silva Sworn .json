Any moment now, Pele's coffin will be moved from a hospital in Sao Paulo to a stadium in the city of Santos. It's on its way now, we can confirm.That's where the superstar played most of his career and where his body will lie in honor for 24 hours. Thousands of people are expected to show up and pay their respects. It's a much-needed moment of unity in a time of national uncertainty. Stefano Pozzebon reports from Santos, in Brazil. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) STEFANO POZZEBON, JOURNALIST (voice-over): How do you mourn a legend? A person who always brought so much joy to everyone who saw him? These football fans in the Brazilian city of Santos do it their own way, by laughing and cheering. This is the old guard, those who had the privilege of watching Pele play 60 years ago. Now, they're preparing to say goodbye. Some show off their tattoos. Others hold onto old tickets as if they were relics. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): In his last match, the stadium was jammed, everyone screaming, chanting. When Pele left the pitch, it all went quiet. It was silence, and then half the people left, because why stay if you don't see Pele? POZZEBON (voice-over): But in a city where everyone has a story about the legend, here was someone who knew the man himself.

But today, the country was finally able to breathe a sigh of relief.That's because outgoing president, Jair Bolsonaro, had said he was not going to accept the result of the elections if he lost. His supporters took to the streets, blocked highways and marched to military headquarters, asking for military intervention. But instead of resisting the transition of power, Bolsonaro himself left the country on Friday, leaving for the United States and leaving the door open for the new administration to focus on the future. Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva took office for the third time today, but stepping into a very different Brazil than he left when he left office in 2010. This is a country that has a sluggish economic performance, skyrocketing levels of inequality and poverty. And Lula, speaking to his supporters that went to greet him in Brasilia today, he got very emotional speaking about hunger. Food insecurity has always been a topic very close to Lula's heart. And he told a story of a man he saw in 1989, his first presidential campaign, with a sign that said, \"Help me, please. I'm hungry.\" And how that shaped his political career. Today, Bolsonaro's absence also contributed to that tone, to that emotional tone, that even for Brazilian standards, was quite high, quite emotional. Lula getting tearful many times throughout the day. And instead of being received by the outgoing president to get the customary presidential sash that we do here in Brazil, he was handed over the sash by a group of people representing Brazil's diversity. This was a very famous indigenous leader, a black woman, workers, a young black kid, all of this a nod to what the priorities of Lula's government will be for the next four years.

But the challenges you have pointed to are real. The wounds continue to be real. And you know, the memory that many people have of Lula when he was president the first couple times, at the beginning of the century, was when Brazil was in a different place, politically, economically. The global economy was doing much better. There were resources to spread around to the impoverished and that sort of thing. S So Lula has raised expectations very high.

And it really opens the door to charges that the whole thing is just politics anyway, not according to the constitution         . That gives Maduro a stronger position. Of course, he's being welcomed now, re-welcomed across the region: in Brazil, for the inauguration of the Brazilian president; in Colombia; other places, as well where he had been ostracized. So, his position to strengthen. And you know, the Venezuelan people are supposed to have elections in 2024. Maduro may even move those up to 2023, this year, to try and catch the opposition in disarray and try to receive another mandate. I would argue his other one is the one he's under now.

Back in the day at that time period, the mid-1970s, Michael, American kids were not playing soccer. We were not. You know, boys were playing, went to Little League baseball. And girls like me played tennis or swimming or whatever. So, they was no organized soccer at all. Pele came to the United States and changed -- changed that, and really brought the game to the U.S., as he did of course with this magical, beautiful style of play. And that attacking style, as you well know, that was not usual for the game at that point in the late '50s and into the '60s.",

In a tweet, he said banning women harms millions in the country and prevents critical help from reaching those in need. Joining me now, Douglas London is a retired senior CIA operations officer. He's also the author of \"The Recruiter: Spying and the Lost Art of American Intelligence.\" It's always good to see you, Doug. I want to start, actually, by quoting from a piece you authored, or co-authored, for \"The Hill,\" and I'll quote here: \"Every time Washington pushed to withdraw troops from Afghanistan, it ironically created the conditions to remain or later return. That irony now informs the current paradox that the country had never seemed safer like today under the Taliban, or likewise more dangerous.\" Briefly explain what you mean by that.",

There's a lot of irony to it.Ambassador John Bachman (ph) and I took to writing this paper where, you know, America in the last half a century has constantly been drawn into conflict in Afghanistan. But there are the conditions in which we leave Afghanistan, and trying to leave, or leaving, tend to bring us back. The United States played a major role in helping to push out the Soviets during their invasion in the '80s, only to leave that country in tatters, with a civil war among multiple warring partners, many of whom that we had financed and supported. But we basically turned and looked to try and get away from that. Nine-eleven brought us back. But as we'd try to draw down troops, we would find that, when we'd try to leave different parts of the country, it would leave particularly those provincial capitals extremely vulnerable. And also rivalries within the Afghan government itself would pop up, where the United States was playing both a facilitator and an arbitrator sometimes among divisions within its own allied government. HOLMES: Right. The West's biggest fear in leaving Afghanistan the most recent time was the return of the terror groups that brought them there in the first place. Assurances from the Taliban were given, promises made it wouldn't happen. And you write, and I'll quote you again, \"The Taliban's return has transformed the terrorism landscape into a veritable commercial jihadist enterprise, a jihadist constellation.\" How likely is it that the terror groups currently on the ground there could present a substantial threat to the West again?",

All the Taliban really has to do to support terrorist groups is to do nothing, to be passive and let them not only achieve sanctuary, but to plan and plot and organize.There's any number of members, depending on how you count them, anywhere from 10 to 24 different terrorist groups that we in the intelligence community used to consider al-Qaeda partner organizations. Those are organizations that are very much aligned with al-Qaeda and the Haqqani Taliban network, which itself is a part of the Taliban. Its chief, Sirajuddin Haqqani, is the current acting interior minister of Afghanistan, and they've really allowed an opportunity for these terrorist groups to take advantage of the labor force that's there, from those seeking sanctuary from countries they're fleeing and operating against, terrorist groups from Taliban fighters who are out of work to the form of government fighters who are out  of work. So, the opportunity for these groups to continue to form an organized and plot is very challenging when the United States no longer has the infrastructure for intelligence collection on the ground that came with having an official presence there --",
