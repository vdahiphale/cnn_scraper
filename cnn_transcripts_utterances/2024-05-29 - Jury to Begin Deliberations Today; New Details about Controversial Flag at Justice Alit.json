This is CNN's special live coverage of the criminal case against Donald Trump.And today is the day the jury gets the case. A case that began 44 days ago with jury selection. Today, the jury deliberations begin. In just about one hour, court will open here. The judge will instruct the jury. Then they will go behind closed doors. And how long it takes, we just do not know. Thirty-four counts against the former president, charged with falsifying documents all to cover up payments to Stormy Daniels to influence the 2016 election. Prosecutors say this is a case about election fraud. I do understand we're seeing pictures from outside Trump Tower. Donald Trump will leave his home there, head down here. He has been speaking before he heads into the courtroom. I do have to say, today, if he speaks before going in, it could be particularly interesting. This could be one of the last times we hear from Donald Trump before there is a verdict. The next time you hear from him, it is possible he could be a convicted felon, or the converse there, he could be acquitted of criminal charges. Either way, this is unprecedented territory. With me here, CNN's Brynn Gingras, who's been here since the beginning of the trial and will be here today to witness history.",

That is, of course, how they are meant to interpret the law as it applies to all this evidence that they have heard over the last several weeks. Such a critical part of this process. And it's right before those jurors go behind closed doors and begin those deliberations. Seven men, five women. The six alternates are going to be in a separate area of the courthouse while those main 12 jurors deliberate. What we also understand during this process, what's going to happen today, is that Donald Trump, his defense team, will also be inside the courthouse, but not in the courtroom, waiting to see, are there any notes that come forward, any questions about all that evidence that they're reviewing, or is there a verdict that comes out today? We obviously don't know that answer. But it's going to be an eventful day. Of course, you actually noted that there is a lot more security around here today.",

That defense, all about reasonable doubt and Michael Cohen, just hammering that point home. It made me think that that could be a big part of the jury instructions.And as far as the prosecution goes, they really seem to be focused on the notion that Donald Trump cause the documents to be falsified and also they focused quite a bit on what they see as the election fraud, the clear violations of election laws. Why those focuses?",

      "sentences": "Well, you're absolutely right, John, that those are the focus. And it's because they have different jobs here, right? The defense's job is just to poke holes. They don't need to go through all of the evidence at trial. In fact, they don't want to do that. They're just trying to say, listen, if you don't find this one thing that means reasonable doubt. That's why the emphasis on Michael Cohen. If you don't believe Michael Cohen, that is reasonable doubt. That's what Todd Blanche said over and over.The prosecutors have a different job, right, because they carry the burden to prove every single element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. So, in addition to answering the issues that the defense is raising, they have to go through all of the evidence and marshal it all for the jurors and tell them why they've met their burden here. That's why you see prosecutors going on longer because they're rebutting, but also putting this all together for the jurors. I mean, as a prosecutor, when you end, you want the jury to think three things really. You want them to think, wow, they really answered all of my questions. They really rebutted all of what defense said. And, man, there's a lot of evidence here. So, you kind of have to accomplish all of those things as the prosecution, which is why you saw such a long summation yesterday.",

There'll be a discussion about who will be there foreperson, who will be the lead spokesperson to the court. They'll - they'll have a moment to just kind of relax, get things in order, pull their notes out, take a restroom break. These are normal things. And then somebody will start the discussion. And it may be like, well, why don't we take an initial vote and see sort of where everybody is. And then we can begin to talk about, you know, what we thought about each side's presentation or the evidence that came into the case. And they may go around the room. If you have - I mean you've got two lawyers on this jury. So, this is something that they'll be accustomed to and they'll be thinking about needing to respect the opinions of everybody who's in the jury room. And you may see, if one of those lawyers leads, you may see them suggest that they go around the room and say, you know, tell me what you thought. What did you think? What were the strong points? You know, and these jurors, I imagine, will be repeating some of the arguments that they heard yesterday from - as it supports their various positions. And that's really what to closing argument was about, was to give them ammunition in the jury room. Those people who may be sort of your - your ambassador to the rest of the jury panel. And so they'll do that. I don't expect we'll see something to quick. I think that this is a serious case. This jury has been paying attention. They know it's a serious case as it relates to three at least. And so, you know, at some point they'll - they'll continue to take a vote and ultimately may have some questions come to the court.

The upside down flag is a symbol used by election deniers in 2020. CNN's Joan Biskupic is joining us right now with some more on this. Joan, can you walk us through now this new reporting?",

      "sentences": "Sure, Kate. It's good to see you.Let's step back for a minute and consider why we even care about this neighborhood squabble from three years ago. At the center of it is this important symbol of the stop the steal movement from January 6th, and the protests over President Joe Biden's valid win at the polls in 2020 and all that Donald Trump did - Donald Trump and his supporters did to protest that. The question was, that we all were concerned about, starting with some original \"New York Times\" reporting, was why the Alito family was flying an upside down U.S. flag that was a symbol of the stop the steal. Now, Justice Alito told \"The New York Times\" that the flag was flown in protest by his wife to some neighbors, having nothing to do with January 6th or protesting the election. So, this new timeline from \"The New York Times\" just kind of adds another piece. And again, Kate, the reason we even care about this is kind of what the justice has laid out in terms of potentially his own partisan position and the fact that right now the justices are considering two important cases arising from the events of January 6th. One, of course, is Donald Trump's claim of immunity from any criminal liability for election subversion. And the other involves whether January 6th rioters who stormed the Capitol would be liable for an obstruction of official proceeding charge. So, that's why we care. \"The New York Times\" new reporting involves a recording that was made by neighbors of the Alito's when they complained after a confrontation with Martha-Ann Alito. And they apparently called the Fairfax County Police and were talking about how she had been yelling at them about their anti-Trump signs. And one of the quotes that was in \"The Times\" report was, these neighbors saying to the Fairfax County Police, somebody in a position of authority needs to talk to her and make her stop. And apparently the police officer is heard saying, you know, it's - we can't - we can't investigate just yelling. Please call us when an event is actually taking place. But the reason this comes into play now is that that incident actually occurred, according to \"The New York Times\" report, in February 2021, not January 2021, which just raises a conflict about why was that flag even hoisted in the first place. Was it in response to these neighbors or was it more accurately conveying some political statement? Now, CNN has not verified the tape recording or this most recent reporting. And we have reached out multiple times to Justice Alito just trying to get some clarification here, Kate, about this incident that has raised so many questions about potential conflicts of interest on the part of Justice Alito.",

But polls have recently shown waning enthusiasm among this voter bloc in particular, including a shift toward his Republican rival Donald Trump. But even more concerning for the campaign is voters just not going to the polls. And so this is a stop in Philadelphia where he will be joined by the vice president to again try to stoke enthusiasm among voters and list off the accomplishments of his administration and try to outline how it has helped their communities. Of course, this is part of a month's long effort by the White House. They also commemorated Brown v. Board of Education and also did campaign stops in Atlanta. And the president gave a commencement address at Morehouse College. So taken together, you can really see how the campaign is trying to make more inroads in the black community, knowing how important this vote is going to be for them in November. John.",

This week is about doing exactly that. It's been a media circus down at the courthouse in Manhattan. All of the news media has been posted up, running visuals of that day in and day out relentlessly, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. And so we used it as an opportunity to directly address the American people about the fundamental threat that Donald Trump poses to our democracy. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
