And so what the district attorney we believe is going to say is that there should be a re-sentencing here and this sentence was life without the possibility of any parole. So that is not something that normally would go to re- sentencing, but he's saying because of new evidence and he is saying it was letter that Erik wrote his cousin, Andy, saying, I'm scared of my dad coming into the room.Well, new evidence under the law is evidenced that wasn't around at the time of the trial. And if the jury had been able to know about that evidence, they could have acquitted them. Well, a Barbara Walters special in 2015 that I found she had the letter. She had just been sent the letter from the family. She read it on that special. She also said that the trial court in 1993, it was offered as evidenced, that letter and the trial judge said, I don't see that it specifically is showing sexual abuse at the hands of the father. So we have to see if he addresses that letter and still calls it new evidence. The other is rehabilitation. He says that rehabilitation is an important part of prison and that there has been rehabilitation here. They should get out because of rehabilitation and have that re- sentencing. But Jake, how many people in prison believed they have been rehabilitated from very violent crimes and maybe some have, maybe some haven't. But that would be revolutionary for our justice system. And there was a Senate bill in California that was up to be passed in August on this very issue and they had to shelve it because there was too much controversy from victims, advocates, from district attorneys offices around the state. And so it'll be very interesting to see what he says in this presser that's just about to happen.",
