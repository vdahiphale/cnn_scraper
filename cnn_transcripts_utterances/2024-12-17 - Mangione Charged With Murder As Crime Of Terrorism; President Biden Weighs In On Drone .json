Plus, candlelight vigils in Madison, Wisconsin as we learn new information about the student shooter and the chaotic moments inside the school. And President Biden speaks about those reported drones for the first time as his administration tries to put an end to the hysteria. Tonight on \"Laura Coates Live.\"Well, the case against the suspected CEO killer just took a pretty major turn. Luigi Mangione is now facing a new charge that brands him as a terrorist. I'll explain all that in just a second. But first, I want to focus on a dramatic detail revealed today that could be critical in the case against him. It's what his mother allegedly told police the night before he was arrested. Now, you may remember, she filed a missing person report over her son to San Francisco Police. That was back in November. Authorities were able to link that report to the photos of the suspect, and then they reached out to her about it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It was released through his cousin. It says the family was shocked about the arrest.Well, today, the Manhattan D.A. said it was Mangione's desire to cause shock that warranted him getting an upgraded charge of first-degree murder as returned by a grand jury. Now, he is facing 11 charges now in New York. And that first-degree murder charge, it's pretty rare. It requires some special and aggravating circumstances. But prosecutors believe they may have that very thing here. They've tied that charge, as well as second-degree murder charges, to a crime of terrorism. D.A. Alvin Bragg says the extraordinary nature of the murder warrants the extraordinary charges. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The D.A. has charged that, important to keep in mind. All you have to show there as the prosecutor is an intentional killing.What the twist was today is the D.A. has also charged an elevated first-degree murder charge. And in order to make that stick here, the D.A. is going to have to show that Mangione acted for a very specific motive, of causing terror or panic in the general public public or of trying to use an act of violence to influence or coerce public policy, presumably here related to healthcare. So, it's going to be more that the D.A. has to prove to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt to get that first-degree charge. But I think when you look at the totality of the evidence, I think there's a strong case. And we heard the D.A., and the police commissioner laid out today, that that was exactly what Mangione was trying to do. So, they have more they have to prove. But important to keep in mind, they also do have that sort of second-degree murder as a safety fallback provision in the indictment, too.",

And that has a way of demonizing the defendants during the trial. It makes it a lot more difficult for the defense to overcome. They have to be careful, though. They can't overplay their hand if they lay him out to be a horrible, terrible person and a high-level terrorist. And it turns out he's just a troubled young man who needs some help, who didn't get his issues resolved, who has a lot of enduring qualities behind all this.

Nobody who's indicted on first-degree murder is getting bail. So, he'll be held in a New York jail. And let's get to work on getting the discovery, let's see the evidence from the case, and let that lawyer start to work with her client.

Also joining us, Democratic strategist Chuck Rocha. Glad to have you both. Isaac, what's the new information? What are you hearing about her potential future choices?EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER: Well, there's a governor's race in California in 2026. Gavin Newsom, the current governor, is term-limited, and there is a race already underway to succeed him. But Harris has been rumored to be a possible candidate in that. And the advisors and friends of the vice president that I spoke with over the last couple days said to me that there is really a divide. There are some people who feel like she should run for governor. She would probably clear the field and it would be a place for her to land. Then there are others who think that she should run for president again in 2028. The reality, though, is that she can't do both. Most people agree. So, she has to pick one or the other. One person close to her said to me that she would need to see running for governor, though, as more of a capstone than a stepping stone for her political career. And another person who is hoping that she runs for president again said to me that running for governor would be a step down, that she needs to look at it that way and not think to do that when she could be in a field again for president. But, look, in a democratic primary in 2020 on the presidential side, it is very unlikely at the moment, from how people are looking at it, that she would have an easy time of it. They would certainly be crowded. And there is this fear from the people who are very much supportive of her that it would be bad for her to follow up losing in 2024 given all of everything that happened this year with being rejected by her own party, if that's where it would go. That's the gamble that she's got in front of her.",

There was a dramatic downturn. So, I don't know if she would clear the field. I've heard the same thing. She'd clear the field. Javier Becerra is rumored to be running. There's a lot of other people rumored to be running. I don't know if she would run in 2028, but the 2028 race starts now. If I've not been called by two, I've been called already by four people who want to run for president, and she ain't one of them.

Sounds like it's from a spy movie in many respects, but it's reality.And video from a nearby vehicle shows just what happened. Two men walked outside of an apartment building. A source confirmed to CNN that one of them is Kirillov. But we don't know which. To the left, you see what looks like a scooter propped up next to a lamppost. And as the men walk by, suddenly, there's an explosion. We won't show what happened next. But the blast likely triggered by a remote control. Aftermath video that Russian media aired showed a damaged scooter at the blast site being placed in a black bag by authorities. Ukraine immediately claimed responsibility, accusing him of using chemical weapons against Ukrainian troops and spreading Kremlin-backed conspiracy theories like the U.S. had bio labs in Ukraine.
