He says, he loves and the economy that will help decide his reelection fate.Plus, past the point of no return. The president's Justice Department charges his son with crimes. Hunter Biden's attorneys respond by borrowing from the Trump political playbook. And stuck in a moment and he can't get out of it. Temper tantrums and big divides over how to pay the nation's bills up the odds that the house Speaker can't steer away Congress from a crippling shutdown. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. Up first, any moment, President Biden will try to tiptoe a very skinny line in remarks from the White House. Today, three plants in Michigan and Ohio and in Missouri, and three strikes against the Big Three. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

All eyes are on these three strikes happening at three plants, at all three automakers, and all eyes will be on the president in just moments, as both the auto workers and the automakers want to hear what the president has to say. Just a short time ago, I spoke to the CEO of General Motors, Mary Barra, about a key issue the union wants -- the key issue the union wants to get in their contract. That's a 40 percent pay increase. They also want to see a traditional pension in their contract. And they also want to see a return to a four-day work week that they have experienced in the past.I also spoke to Mary Barra about whether or not she's reached out to the president and spoke to the president. She says that she has listened to a little bit of our conversation from just a short time ago about, OK -- excuse me -- just as we don't have the sound bite that I wanted to play for you. But I want to go ahead and just lay out what's happening the rest of the day here. UAW is going to be holding a press conference with Bernie Sanders, a rally a little later today. That is what they plan on doing today. They are not going to be negotiating with the Big Three automakers something that Mary Barra has said that she hoped to be able to do get back to the negotiating table. As you mentioned the president speaking in just a short time. Mary Barra said that she did speak to the president yesterday, laying out exactly where negotiations were and saying that she really wanted to strike a deal with the union. The Big Three automakers all saying that they have offered historic offers of 20 percent and 17.5 percent for Stellantis. We do have that sound bite from our conversation with Mary Barra just a short time ago. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

What's unique in this situation is the White House doesn't have any authority to actually be party to those negotiations. But he has and his staff has remained engaged throughout the process.In the final hours before that strike yesterday, President Biden spoke with the UAW President Shawn Fain, as well as the leaders of those three auto companies to discuss where those negotiations stand. Of course, the White House has been encouraging them to negotiate around the clock to try to reach some type of agreements. But one thing that the White House will be closely watching as this strike plays out is what the economic impact could be, and whether there are any options that the White House could take to try to blunt the impact of that, the strike on not just these auto companies, but also on the supply firms that are working with them. There are concerns about what this could mean, for the supply chain. Of course, there are also political implications for President Biden at a time when many Americans remain wary about the state of the economy. There is also this fact that the president talks about. He often describes himself as the most pro union president in history. And so, it will be interesting to see whether he decides to lend any support to either side in these negotiations. Of course, a lot of this is playing out in Michigan, a critical battleground state that will be key for him heading into the 2024 election. So, we will hear from President Biden in just a short while and see whether he offers any vision, any path forward when it comes to not just the economic, but the political ramifications that this could all have.",

Nice to see all of you.This is such a fascinating situation that the president finds himself in for all the reasons that both Vanessa and Arlette laid out. I want to inject the worker, and the workers voice into this. Let's hear from a gentleman named Mark Kidd, who is UAW Toledo Local 12. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MARK KIDD, UAW TOLEDO LOCAL 12: We're all willing to take it as long as we have to. Here in Toledo, we build the world's iconic Jeep Wrangler. It never stops selling.

Let's just start with because this is Inside Politics, the political.AUDIE CORNISH, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CORRESPONDENT: I follow this very closely. The Big Three have been panicked at the way that Tesla had just pulled completely ahead. They were completely lost on the electric vehicle front. And as they started to pivot some of the things that they wanted to make a battery plant down south and non-union states to make some of these other kinds of, even just the factories themselves and non-union states, this has been a long simmering concern for the union. And I think the bet they took was that with what Hollywood is talking about. Technology is going to hurt us. They too could come out and say, technology could also hurt us in this sector as well. And even though, union membership is higher than it used to be. Union actions are 300,000 workers this year have taken labor actions, including right now in California health workers were asking for $25 an hour. So, I think that it'll be interesting to see if we in the media portray, this as a very old school auto industry fight when in fact that the dynamics are totally different.",

I want to go back to Joe Biden, and the political moment that he is in for a number of reasons, not the least of which is because of the way that he sells himself and describes himself.Let's listen to what he has said about him vis-a-vis the unions? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, 46TH U.S. PRESIDENT: My name is Joe Biden, and I'm a car guy. I intend to be the most pro-union president, leading the most pro-union administration in American history.

While trying to find a resolution to make sure that this doesn't have a broader impact on the economy. Experts tell us that you're going to start to feel this if the strike goes on perhaps in a week. If it goes on for two weeks or longer than it could really be devastating. So, we're expecting to hear the president say later today that he's sending two of his top deputies, Gene Sperling, Julie Su out to Detroit to kind of see, again, they can't be a direct part in the negotiations, but see what they can do to kind of help things along to make sure what they can -- to make sure that we could resolve this without having too much damage.",
