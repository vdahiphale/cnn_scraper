President Ruto says he'll withdraw a controversial finance bill after deadly protests in Kenya. Setting the stage, President Joe Biden and Former President Donald Trump counting down to Thursday's CNN Presidential Debate. And float, foil, and fly. The company looking to take its electric seagliders global and change travel on water. That conversation and plenty more coming up. But first, we begin in Bolivia, where the country's president is urging citizens to mobilize against a coup d'etat and defend democracy. He addressed the nation after soldiers and armored military vehicles positioned themselves around government buildings. Buildings in the capital, La Paz. They were seen in the main square where the national executive and legislative offices are located. Reports are now since they've pulled back from outside the presidential palace, though a little earlier, the president released this message on social media. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And you saw, really led by the police then how police essentially forced him from power. Police who were protesting in the army, letting -- essentially letting them do that, letting them and the furious public push Evo Morales. from power. He eventually fled into exile. There was a transitional government that was put into power. But when the time -- came time to vote, once again, a leftist was elected president in this country. The -- while it is very rich in minerals has just crushing poverty. And so, Luis Arce, you know, whether you talk to the United States or any of the other countries in the region, he -- he's widely regarded -- universally regarded as being democratically elected. And so, even though this attempted coup is certainly a hallmark of, you know, of times past in Latin America where generals just decided on a whim who was president and often received the U.S. backing. Well, times have apparently changed. Does this mean the danger is over? No. The coup leaders, the attempted coup leaders, alleged coup leaders, are not under arrest. Certainly, there is a discontent among many who do not want to see the return of Evo Morales, who feel that the government is taking them on a path that they simply don't agree with, a more radical path than they agree with. But of course, that is democracy, and you have a democratically elected leader of a country who today stood firm and was not intimidated by this show of force, that at one point, it seemed like was going to turn quite, quite violent. And so, for the moment, it seems, there is a pause in this conflict, in this attempted uprising. But of course, that could resurface at any point.",

But it is a bit of a surprise because most of Latin America really has moved on from this type of behavior. And as was reported by Patrick just now, Luis Arce was democratically elected. So, this wasn't an effort to overthrow, for example, a dictatorship or some sort of authoritarian government. There's been political chaos in the country, a rivalry between the current president and the former president, Evo Morales, which has led to some economic paralysis and some real challenges there.

The two leading candidates would be, as I mentioned,Luis Arce, the current president, the former president, Evo Morales, who still has quite a level of support among particularly Bolivia's indigenous community, where Evo Morales comes out of originally. And in fact, Bolivia has a very large percentage of its population are the indigenous community. There has been a court decision as recently as 2023 that forbids Evo Morales for running for re-election. He, of course, rejects that decision, just like he rejected the Supreme Court decision in 2019 that said he wasn't able to run. He ran anyway. He tried to steal that election. So, here's somebody who really doesn't pay much attention to the court decisions unless they, you know, actually favor him. So, that's something that's going to have to work itself out. And that has not been addressed by the issues today in the streets by the military. It still has to certainly play out. Where the Bolivian people will come out? Look, they get a chance to vote in 2025, presumably. So, they'll be able to let their voices be heard. But in the meantime, Bolivia's economy is really struggling. The debt level is high, inflation is high, investment is down, natural gas, which has driven the economy in terms of the production of natural gas is really beginning to run out. People are questioning what is the engine of growth for Bolivia going forward, and the people are starting to get frustrated. So, you know, if you can't put food on the table for your family, it doesn't really matter who's in the presidential palace, you're going to start to get anxious, and you're going to go to the streets, and you're going to protest for a better scenario. And that's indeed what we're starting to see happen. There have been marches already as recently just a couple days ago. So, I think that the situation from a political perspective remains unsettled.

With the conflict raging in Ukraine, Russia began a crackdown at home on free speech, silencing dissidents or forcing them into exile. It's against this backdrop that Gershkovich was arrested on a reporting assignment in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg. This is video from the website of the tank factory there, where Russian prosecutors allege Gershkovich acted \"on the instructions of the CIA to collect secret information.\" Although, no evidence has been made public.

And this is where the frictions internal between the MAS party are, but they also have had economical problems. They had issues with supplies, with agricultural supplies, with lack of gasoline and other basic needs for the country. We have to remember also that Bolivia, it's a little bit isolated. It's very difficult to get things into Bolivia. Expensive. They produce a lot of their produce. They do have a strong agricultural industry, but many of them for, what we see, they're choosing to export their products because they can get better money outside Bolivia than what they can get internally. So, these are the problems that President Arce is having to navigate in addition to the challenge or the intents of Former President Morales to come back and take over the party.",

They take off from ordinary waterfront docks, float like a boat, until the electric engines propel them about five to 10 meters above the water, as you saw there. The flagship model, called the Viceroy, seats 12 passengers and travels at speeds of up to 180 miles an hour with a range of 180 miles on a single charge. There are also variants with military capabilities too. Now, REGENT's development can pick up the pace with investment from MOL Switch, a venture capital firm that is part of the Japanese shipping giant Mitsui O.S.K. Lines. The investment will help bring REGENT Seagliders to market in Japan and coastal destinations around the world. The pair will also investigate scaling up the technology to drive large ocean-going vessels. And Billy Talheimer is next. The CEO and co-founder of REGENT, and he joins us now. Welcome to the show, Billy. That was a lot of information. So, hopefully, we can get into more details. But I want to start by discussing the seaglider itself and so the concept and the vision behind that. BILLY THALHEIMER, CEO AND CO-FOUNDER, REGENT:  Absolutely. Well, Julia, thanks so much for having me on the show. So, as you said, there's a lot of technical jargon there with what's going on with the seaglider. Really simply, a seaglider is a fundamentally new mode of vehicle. So, seagliders are different from, as you said, the boats, planes, trains, helicopters, even for the first time in a long time, we have a new technology that can get people between coastal locations for lower cost, higher comfort, easier convenience and lower carbon. You know, specifically, seagliders are hybrids of boats and planes, are 100 percent battery powered. And so, we get sort of the great convenience of being able to go down to a dock and hop right on the seaglider, plus the high speed of actually flying low over the water on a cushion of air. Like you see birds flying over the water. And it's that cushion of air and that efficiency that gives these vehicles their comfort and their long range.",

I'm assuming it could probably go faster too. And obviously, you've got a charge range of 180 miles. So, to your point, it has the benefit of a speed of a plane, but also is, you know, transport on water. And I assume you go dock to dock as well.",

      "sentences": "Well, that's exactly right. You know, seagliders are for maritime mobility. They're sort of leveraging underutilized waterways. Whenyou look around the world, 40 percent of the world's population lives in coastal communities. When you look at places like Japan's or through the Pacific Islands, it's actually closer to 80 percent, 100 percent in places like Singapore. And so, we're leveraging that sort of innate population by the coast to actually leverage the waterways for transportation. And so, we have 180 miles with existing battery technology. That's 300 kilometers. And then, as battery technology grows, we can expand that to closer to 500 miles or 800 kilometers over time. Again, all with zero emissions because it is battery powered and also very affordable. You know, using these all electric seagliders to the passengers, the cost will actually be about half that of an airplane ticket.",

I think your pointabout the use here and it makes sense why you've got Japanese investors certainly looking at this. Singapore, Indonesia is another obvious one. I believe you've secured more than 600 orders valued at $9 billion. So, you could correct me if I'm wrong there, but that gives me a sense of perhaps the cost of producing one of these things. Can you give us more information about cost and how quickly you can be up and running with a prototype, potentially? I believe next year was on the plan. Yes.",

They're 100 percent battery electric vehicles. That means zero operational emissions from seagliders. And so, in that full case, where 4 billion passengers a year are taking seagliders, that's over 100 megatons of CO2 a year. So, to put that in perspective, that is 26 million cars off the road every year because people are taking faster and sort of easier travel on seagliders.",

Now, we are ready to implement safety to put human crew on board. So, we'll be putting our 15,000-pound or 7,000-kilogram prototype on the water later this year with humans on board expecting flight early next year. The whole company is focused on that proof point of implementing human safety. And then, from there, we'll transition and build up our manufacturing capabilities to deliver seagliders to our customers worldwide. And so, with our commitment to safety, that means not only the REGENT engineering team committed to safety, but working with our regulators hands in hand. So, we'll be working with maritime regulators around the world, the Coast Guard in the U.S., the international flags. Also, the International Maritime Organization will be working with these stakeholders to ensure from this third-party perspective that seagliders are safe.",

All that and more topping today's \"MoneyMove.\" A sluggish summer day of trade on Wall Street Wednesday. But the major averages were all able to chalk up gains, as you can see there. The NASDAQ rising with little help from superstar performer NVIDIA who shares finished the day relatively unchanged. NVIDIA held its annual shareholders meeting during the session. Approving CEO Jensen Huang's $34 million pay package. That's a 60 percent increase from last year. Still, a substantial amount less than Elon Musk's pay over at Tesla. Just saying. The Fed also announcing, after the closing bell, that all 31 big U.S. banks have passed the latest stress tests. The Fed, however, warning balance sheets are riskier and expenses are higher compared to last year due in part to growing credit card debt. Meanwhile, green arrows across Asia, the Nikkei rallying to two-month highs, but Australia pulling back on word that inflation there has risen to 4 percent, putting a right hike firmly on the table later this summer. And in currency markets, another sizable drop in the value of the yen, its lowest levels against the dollar in 38 years, and its weakest level against the euro ever. All this raising the odds of yet more government intervention. And to the Euros now, and Georgia with the biggest upset of the tournament so far with a 2-nil win over Portugal to book their place in the Final 16. Turkey also advancing to the knockout stages after their 2-1 win against Czech Republic. And earlier, it was a heartbreaking end for Ukraine.
