That wasn't in our mind.We're mistakable that the war is very far. Now, this mistake in some minds and some heads of our colleagues, who are in Europe, they think that the war is far from, no. By the way, 800 from Kyiv to the East, to the point where the war was from (INAUDIBLE) 800 kilometers. Like the distance between our border and a lot of European countries. So, the war is very close, but we don't know about it, and don't believe in it until the war came everywhere to Ukraine. After 2022 it came everywhere to all the families. And, of course, it changed all of us, all Ukrainians, and all our families, divided families. It took a lot of lives, a lot of human losses, a lot destroyed, everything, what we value, and brought nothing -- nothing good, nothing good. So, it has changed all of us. But I think the most important if this war can change Europe, can change the world. This is very important. They have to understand that the war is close. Otherwise, if it will not change, Europe and the world. Otherwise, if the world will not understand it, we have to live in unity. Otherwise, Putin or some similar guys, you know, they can divide the world and can eat these (ph) pieces (ph) like a pie. That's why we need this unity.
