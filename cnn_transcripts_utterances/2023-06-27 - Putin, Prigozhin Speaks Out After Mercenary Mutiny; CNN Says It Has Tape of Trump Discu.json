Putin appear angry during his address to the nation. And well two days ago, the Kremlin said charges against Prigozhin will be dropped.

The Secretary of State Tony Blinken on Sunday, saying that it was clear that this insurrection revealed cracks in his regime, but asked on Monday, what the impact would be on Putin whether Putin has been weakened the National Security Council Spokesman John Kirby just wouldn't go there. There was a number of -- one of a number of questions that Kirby refused to answer and it speaks to how cautious U.S. officials and particularly the White House is being in commenting on the record about this situation. They wouldn't even label whether this was an insurrection, an attempted coup. And part of that is because of the fast moving nature of the events. Another part of it is because of what we saw, as this was all unfolding, the White House trying to avoid the perception that the West is somehow weighing in here. We heard President Biden on Monday talk about that strategy. JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: We gave Putin no excuse to blame this on the west and to blame this on NATO. We made clear that we were not involved. We had nothing to do with it. This was part of a struggle within Russian system.",

He's expected to speak once again with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy. And on Tuesday, the White House is expected to announce $500 million of additional security assistance for Ukraine. Now that's intentional. It's an important message that this White House wants to send at this moment that regardless of what happens in Russia, regardless of what happens in Moscow, the U.S. will continue to support Ukraine against the Russian invasion.

Mr. Mitsotakis is the person who has seen Greece through the end of the financial crisis. He has weathered COVID-19 crisis and also an energy crisis as a result of the war in Ukraine. He is seen as a safe pair of hands to deliver further growth. And this is very much what the Greek people seem to have voted on the economy, and very much the impact in their own pockets. Mr. Mitsotakis has pledged to deliver growth in Greece stable growth of 3 percent throughout the next decade, and he has also said that he will make big changes in education and in house. A number of other parties have also entered parliament for the first time. A number of far right parties have actually entered parliament for the first time in Greece is going to be a voice a strong voice, perhaps an opposition voice in the parliament.

You're watching CNN NEWSROOM.The president of Belarus Aleksandr Lukashenko is expected to speak publicly later Tuesday about the short-lived military rebellion in Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin broke his silence on Monday. He did not mention the leader of the Wagner Group Yevgeny Prigozhin by name. Instead he criticized the organizers of the rebellion for betraying their country. And he said Wagner Group fighters could go with Prigozhin to Belarus or join the Russian military. Prigozhin spoke earlier on Monday as well. He said his goal was never to overthrow Putin but to prevent the breakup of the Wagner Group. And he stopped the march on Moscow at the 11th hour to avoid more bloodshed. An adviser to Ukraine's president mocked Putin's speech tweeting, \"He put the final dot in his own agency. Doubts are finally dispelled. Russia is waiting for a new president.\" The weekend rebellion is taking a toll on the Russian economy, the ruble briefly hit its lowest level in nearly 15 months on Monday, trading at about $87 to the U.S. dollar before paring back some of those losses. Russians scrambled to swap their cash for dollars over the weekend pushing up the exchange rate. Then Russian currency has been surprisingly resilient for most of the year mostly because of the aggressive rate hikes by the central bank. Ukraine is hoping to parlay the problems in Russia into gains on the battlefield. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is praising the counteroffensive and claims his troops are making gains on all fronts.

In a previously unannounced visit, Russia's deputy foreign minister immediately traveled to Beijing to meet with Chinese officials over the weekend, including with foreign minister Qin Gang. It is seen by some as a scramble to reassure China that Russia is stable and that things there are under control. For its part, Chinese state media echoing that narrative even as CNN and most western media aired Prigozhin's convoy advancing in Russia, Chinese State TV showed a peaceful, calm atmosphere around the Kremlin. Interestingly though, Chinese social media, which is tightly controlled, showed some users expressing concern over what might happen in Russia and how that could potentially impact China. On Sunday, Chinese officials finally addressed the situation in Russia calling it Russia's internal affairs and pledging its support for Russia and protecting national stability. China's diplomatic and economic support for Russia since Putin's invasion of Ukraine has of course soured relations with the West, but Chinese officials have also tried to portray themselves as a neutral party and possible peacemaker to end the conflict in Ukraine. The threat of instability in Russia though this past weekend might accelerate China's efforts to resolve Russia's war in Ukraine. David Culver, CNN -- Los Angeles. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

So we looked at photovoltaic potential which basically means is there a lot of sunlight? And we look at annual wind speed which means is it windy. And we found out that some of these places that house oil and gas production are exactly the same places that can produce a tremendous amount of sunlight and a tremendous amount of wind.",
