      "sentences": "Well, Brianna, this appears to be one of the most extensive Israeli military operations in the occupied West Bank in years. What we are seeing is a pretty significant mobilization of Israeli troops, Israeli border police officers, all raiding two key Palestinian cities of Jenin and Tulkarm, as well as the surrounding area. Not only are they accompanied by D9 bulldozers that are tearing up the streets in these areas out of concern for potential IEDs, but they are also getting support via airstrikes from the air. At least 10 people are dead, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health.The Israeli military says that it is carrying out these raids for two key reasons. The first of which is they believe that Iran is trying to flood the West Bank with additional weapons. That's an assessment that we've heard from the United States as well. And they also say that a number of recent attacks against Israeli soldiers and civilians have been carried out by militants stemming from these two cities in the West Bank. This isn't happening in a vacuum, of course. We know that since October 7th, there have been near daily raids by the Israeli military in the West Bank. And there have also been a number of attacks against Israeli soldiers in the West Bank from Palestinian militants. And more recently, there was also this failed suicide bombing in Tel Aviv, an explosion that happened, but thankfully didn't kill anybody. That also appears to be part of the context for this operation. That's very much intended to show quite a bit of force from the Israeli military. KEILAR: And, Jeremy, the Israeli military says the body of a soldier abducted on October 7th and held hostage in Gaza was returned to Israel. What more are you learning?",

They are not releasing the identity of the soldier, although they say the family has been notified but has requested that his identity not be released.We know that that now leaves us with 107 hostages who are still being held captive in Gaza, about a third of whom are believed to be dead, according to the Israeli government. We heard today, though, also from one of the hostages who was rescued alive. And that was Farhan al-Qadi, who not only was rescued yesterday in a tunnel in Gaza, he emerged today also from an Israeli hospital, returned back home with his family. And while he was there, he spoke to reporters. He said that he was happy to see the light of day after so long in the darkness. And he also called for the return of the remaining hostages in a ceasefire deal that would see them come home -- Brianna.",

Prosecutors accused 47-year-old Robert Telles of stabbing Jeff German, who worked for the Las Vegas Review-Journal.Telles was a former Clark County public administrator, and his articles exposed turmoil in his office. Telles was said to be concerned about another upcoming article, and prosecutors say he wore a disguise, including a large sun hat, hiding outside the reporter's home before killing him. Telles now faces a life sentence. Former President Trump is in trouble yet again for playing unauthorized music at his campaign rallies, this time from the Foo Fighters. The rock band joins megastars including Bruce Springsteen, Celine Dion, and Beyonce, who want the former president to stop playing their songs as well, but can they actually stop him?

      "sentences": "Yes, this is certainly not the first time that an artist has spoken out against Trump and his campaign for using their music. But the latest now is involving a whole host of stars, including none other than Beyonce. You'll remember that last month I exclusively reported that Beyonce gave her sign-off for the Harris campaign to use her song Freedom, which is why many people thought it was strange when the Trump campaign posted a video of the former president, which was set to Beyonce's song.Now, Beyonce reportedly sent a cease and desist, her label rather reportedly threatened that cease and desist, and shortly after that video was taken down. Now, we've obtained a statement from Trump's spokesperson, and here's what they have to say about that video. Quote: The purpose of the post just proved the point that Democrats are all about banning things, including freedom. They fell for it hook, line and sinker. Now, that's an interesting take, and maybe there's a bit of humor involved there, but this really isn't about banning anything, Boris. This is about music rights and clearances, which are very complicated and very litigious. Now, Beyonce is not the only star to speak out. The Foo Fighters have also said that they did not give Trump their permission to use their song at a rally last week when RFK Jr. came up to join him. Now, Trump's spokesperson told me last night that they did in fact license their song, but a rep for the Foo Fighters is saying, no, we did not give permission. Now, where this is complicated, Boris, is it is possible that you license the music from the publisher or from whoever owns the rights to the music? The artist, though, the songwriter can still object to it, and depending on which state you're in, there are rights to publicity, certainly if an artist's music is used for politics where they could have protections.",
