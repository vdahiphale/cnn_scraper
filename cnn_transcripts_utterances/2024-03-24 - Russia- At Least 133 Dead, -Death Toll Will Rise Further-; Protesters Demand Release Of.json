ISIS is claiming responsibility, but Putin blames Ukraine without evidence. Israelis protest in Tel Aviv, increasingly impatient for the remaining hostages in Gaza to be freed. As negotiators work to secure a deal for their release. And the Princess of Wales says she's touched by the outpouring support she's received following the announcement of her cancer diagnosis.

And officials say they expect it to go even higher Russia has declared Sunday a national day of mourning. People have been placing flowers and stuffed toy animals outside the hall to remember the victims.Investigators say they've arrested the four alleged gunmen and seven other people. Russian state media says the suspects face life in prison if convicted. Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin is suggesting without evidence that Ukraine was involved in the attack. Ukraine strongly denies any such thing. The U.S. which warned of a terror attack in Russia weeks ago says there is no evidence whatsoever that Ukraine played a role. In fact, Vice President Kamala Harris says the U.S. knows that ISIS-K based in Afghanistan is responsible. And ISIS has claimed responsibility for the attack. CNN senior international correspondent Fred Pleitgen has more on the attacks and the aftermath. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): The burnt-out shell of the Crocus City Hall just outside Moscow, even half a day after the attacks, parts of the rubble still smoldering. The local governor surveying the places where gunman killed so many. Two here and three there, Governor Andre Vorobyov asks. Three here, they say. Hundreds of firefighters still on the scene of what Russian President Vladimir Putin called, quote, a bloody and barbaric. His security services on high alert. VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): In all regions of the country, additional anti-terrorists and anti-sabotage measures have been introduced. The main thing now is to prevent those who are behind this bloodbath from committing a new crime.",

We're seeing Putin's chief propagandists pick up that suggested connection that he made in his address to the Russian people, to Ukraine and run with it. I want to read you one quote from one of Putin's chief propagandists, the editor in chief of the RT network, Margarita Simonyan, who posted on Telegram. She said: Western special services already knew yesterday that the perpetrators resembled ISIS. That's why they decided to feed this version. Again, she says they knew who the perpetrators were before their arrest. This is direct participation. So very similar to what we see with the war in Ukraine, accusing the West of waging this war through the sort of Ukrainian proxy. A similar trope is being employed here. The propaganda machine suggesting that the West was somehow doing this via Ukraine. Obviously, no evidence of that whatsoever, but this is a critical tool that is used by the propaganda to provide this common enemy and to prevent the public ever blaming putin for any misfortune that might befall them, Anna.",

Just because for one thing, it is, I would say the most active potent affiliate of Islamic State today.And it's been able to build itself up in Afghanistan, or it's been able to benefit from a lot of things. And that includes being in a situation where it's no longer being targeted by airstrikes, by NATO, which of course left the country many years ago.

And I think that's another reason why we should be so concerned about it. And for until relatively recently, most of its attacks were taking place in Afghanistan, and in the region, Pakistan and it also carried out a few attacks in Central Asia. But now were seeing this capacity to project power and project threats well beyond Afghanistan. So it's that -- it's that resilience that really stands out and makes it so dangerous in my view.",

I think that there's tends to be this pattern of prematurely assuming that a particular terrorist group is dead and not a threatening more, this happened with al-Qaeda some years ago when number of policymakers were saying that the threat wasn't there.And now, you know, there's been this tendency I think to assume that Islamic State is not really much of a threat anymore in that indeed the parent Islamic State lost its territory and the Middle East that it had for many years. And we haven't heard as much from the group as we used to, but there is this pattern of large global terrorist organizations may be struggling, but they have affiliates, they have regional affiliates that managed to remain strong. And I do fear that this attack from IS -- from Islamic State's perspective was extremely successful and that it was a mass casualty attack. The Russians were not able to stop it. That could embolden the group. Both the parent Islamic state, as well as IS-K and it could prompt additional attacks, whether in Russia or elsewhere. Again, IS-K has been linked to attacks, both successful and foiled in Europe and the Middle East in recent months.

They had abandoned, they had to abandon that again to pass this as they have really on every major kind of housekeeping bill they have past to kind of keep the lights on to avoid debt defaults and so forth. A majority of Republicans voted against this. They needed Democrats to pass it, and it is just a measure of the chaos that has engulfed this very small house majority house Republican majority party as its majority continues to dwindle with another Republican, a young talented committee chair indicated that he is walking away within weeks, pushing up his retirement.

The border bill that was negotiated by one of the most conservative members in the Senate really had no concessions to Democrats. It was -- it was a security -- it was overwhelmingly a security bill.I mean, in previous immigration negotiations in 2013, in 2006, tougher security was balanced against a pathway toward legalization for some portion of the undocumented community. This was only enforcement and yet with Trumps opposition, it died in the Senate because House Republicans said they would not take it up. The Ukraine issue is, is the same thing. There's clearly a majority in the house to provide aid to Ukraine and Israel as the Senate did on a bipartisan basis. But in this case, Mike Johnson has been holding to the Hastert Rule of not bringing it up when a majority of Republicans would vote no. In the end, he has signaled that he had some point is willing to bite the bullet and do so, but it will again require him to pass a bill that in all likelihood of House Republicans vote against last September, a majority of House Republicans are already voted against Ukraine aid. A majority of Senate Republicans have voted against Ukraine aid. I mean, this is an emphatic closing of the door. I think on what has been an international is consensus in the Republican Party dating back to Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s, that the U.S. must be the leader of the free world. Certainly that was the view of Nixon and Reagan, George H.W. Bush, George W. Bush. You now see that as a casualty, another policy casualty of Trump's ascendance in the party.",

You know, this graphic new evidence includes videos those photos, and even Ruby Franke's hand-written journal entries detailing this horrific abuse.In one of the newly released videos, we see that moment where Franke's 12-year-old son asked for help. This is after he climbs out of a window and goes to a neighbor's house asking for food and water and asking to be taken to the nearest police station. The evidence release shows the duct tape around the child's ankles and the wrist, and we of course know that that neighbor called police and described all of this. Additional video also shows when police went to Jodi Hildebrandt's house and found Franke's nine-year-old daughter. Authorities describing the child as petrified and she was hiding in a closet, as well as malnourished. You can see in the video first responders trying to talk to her and even giving her some pizza. You know, sadly, the journal entries also detail months of abuse and it includes making the children's stand and sleep outside, making them do wall sits, shaving the girl's head anyway good at times with holding water, food, and oxygen. Now, Franke pleaded guilty to four counts of aggravated child abuse. She was initially charged with six counts, but then pleaded not guilty to two of the counts as part of a plea deal to testify against her business partner. And Hildebrandt in her own plea agreement also pleaded guilty to four counts of aggravated child abuse. They were each sentenced to four consecutive sentences of one to 15 years in prison. But it's now the Utah board of pardons and parole that will oversee the length of their prison sentence. CNN has reached out to their attorneys for comment about the newly released evidence.

In the Colombian capital Bogota, a new kind of school is thriving.
