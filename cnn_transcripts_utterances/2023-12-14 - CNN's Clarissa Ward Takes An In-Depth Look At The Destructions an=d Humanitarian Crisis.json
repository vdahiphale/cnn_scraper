Fred Pleitgen, thank you. Well, let's get back now to that U.S. intelligence assessment that reveals nearly half of all Israeli munitions dropped on Gaza are imprecise so- called dumb bombs. CNN's Alex Marquardt joins me live from Tel Aviv. So Alex, talk to us about the significance of this detail. ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Well, there are a number of significant parts of this report that there was this intelligence assessment that was obtained by my colleagues Natasha Bertrand and Katie Bo Lillis. First, the really large scale of the number of bombs that have been dropped, some 29,000. And then to find out that so many of them are these imprecise, unguided so-called dumb bombs is really quite extraordinary given what we know now about the civilian toll. But also what we know, generally speaking, about how dense the Gaza Strip is, how closely people are packed together, you would hope that as Israel goes after members of Hamas and the Hamas leadership that they would use as precise the weaponry as possible. So, what this assessment has said is that out of the 29,000 bombs that have been dropped from the air to the ground, 40 to 45 percent of them are these unguided, dumb munitions. Bianna, that means that some 12 to 13,000 of the bombs that Israel has dropped really don't have any guided systems. Now, a U.S. official spoke to CNN saying that Israeli pilots use a tactic called dive bombing, which essentially is a plane that makes a steep descent and will drop a bomb right over a target to be more precise. But of course, that is not going to be nearly as precise as, say, a GPS guided bomb or a laser guided bomb. Now, we did hear from the IDF in response to this, a spokesman telling me that the IDF uses what they call high quality munitions that are operated by skilled pilots. This spokesperson went on to say that the type of munition used depends on the characteristics of the target and that they make, of course, every effort to mitigate harm to civilians. Now, Bianna, the U.S. has been providing all kinds of ammunition and weapons to the Israelis, including thousands of dumb bombs called MK-82s, 5000 in particular, but they've also been providing them kits turn dumb bombs into precision-guided bombs. And then, Bianna, I'll just note that the national security advisor, Jake Sullivan, is here on a day at this point in the war where there's major U.S. concern about how precise or the lack of precision that these Israeli strikes are. And it comes after we know that President Biden has just said that he believes that Israel carries out what he called indiscriminate bombing in Gaza.",

But there's been a lot of time for these sort of dog-whistle votes, these play-to-the-base votes that are symbolic and extreme and degrade our democracy because they're essentially defining deviancy down. The standard of high crimes and misdemeanors that would normally connotate an impeachment is high. And you're exactly right, by the way, to point out, good memory, that Nancy Pelosi initially resisted calls to impeach Trump on the first item, which was withholding arms and aid to Ukraine unless President Zelenskyy announced a showboat investigation into Joe Biden designed to help Donald Trump politically here at home. That is so outrageous, but she resisted it until more information came out. Typically, that's how these things happen. There's evidence presented either by the press or by whistleblowers. None of that's happened. So, it really is just a further degradation of our democracy, but that seems to be a hobby for some folks on the far-right these days.",

But if momentum were to shift and the caucus is a typical place where that occurred, or New Hampshire, where Nikki Haley just received the endorsement of New Hampshire's governor, that could change things. I'll say also, because it's important, you mentioned earlier, the fact that the Congress has not moved on urgently and Ukraine, the way that aid has been politicized by folks on the far right and some folks on the far left, to their discredit.

Another big issue obviously for voters, the biggest issue historically at least is the economy and we do see the odds of a recession continue to go down. It appears we may actually see interest rate cuts next year. The stock market hit an all-time high, obviously a difference and a disconnect between the stock market and the overall economy, but perception does matter and it's something that the former president used to tout a lot.

A U.S. official says Israeliforces are testing a new strategy to try to degrade the Hamas tunnel network by flooding them with seawater. It's being done on a limited basis for now to see if the operation could be scaled up. But it also comes with risks, as CNN's Nic Robertson reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voice-over): The tunnels themselves are big, big enough for fighters and their weapons, seen here in this Hamas propaganda video, which was also posted by the Israel Defense Force. They are reinforced with concrete, too. Two years ago, Hamas claimed to have built 500 kilometers, more than 300 miles of them. The tunnels are spread all over Gaza. This map, over two years old. The IDF says they have discovered 800 tunnel shafts so far and have destroyed 500 of them. The entrances are often well-hidden, as I was shown by the IDF near a Gaza hospital, really well hidden, which means the tunnels can be really hard to find.",

There are very few details about how precisely the water is getting into the tunnels, how much water, how fast it's going in, or what you do if you suddenly discover you're flooding hostages other than the IDF say they have begun carefully testing it and that this method is being trialed on a limited, limited basis.",
