      "sentences": "Yes. This is really stunning court document that exposes Fox News as really dishonest media organization. What these documents show is that behind-the-scenes, the highest-ranking Fox executives, people like Rupert Murdoch, and the highest profile Fox News stars, they knew behind-the-scenes and acknowledged Donald Trump's claims of election fraud were bogus, that they were not true, but they continued to push or allow some of these claims to gain a foothold on the channel's air.I want to read to you just to underscore some of what these Fox stars were texting behind-the-scenes. In one case, Tucker Carlson texted, Sidney Powell is lying by the way. I caught her. It's insane. Sean Hannity, in a deposition, that whole narrative that Sidney Powell was pushing, I did not believe it for one second. Rupert Murdoch, after the January 6th attack, all very well for Sean Hannity to tell you he was in despair about Trump, but what did he tell his viewers? These messages underscore that Fox knew exactly what was going on behind-the-scenes but they were not honest with their viewers, and that was because they were afraid that their viewers were going to rebel against them if they told the truth. I think this is really highlighted in a couple more messages. I want to read to you from Fox executives. Suzanne Scott in one message said, the Arizona call, that call that Fox made declaring Biden winner of Arizona, was damaging but we will highlight our stars and plant flags letting the viewers know we are here for them and we respect them. And then, Washington managing editor, Bill Salmon, he had said, it's remarkable how weak ratings make good journalists do bad things. This is really damning admissions behind-the-scenes from Fox executives, from Fox stars, really painting a bleak picture of how this network operates.",

Oliver Darcy, thanks very much for your reporting on this.Let's discuss it all with our CNN Legal Analyst and former White House ethics czar Norm Eisen and the CNN Political Commentator and the host of the \"You Decide\" podcast, Errol Louis. Norm, let me start with you. It is one thing to disagree with something that your network airs, but do you think examples in this court filing show that something beyond that was going on?

In order for dominion to recover damages, and they are potentially looking at billions of dollars of them, they're going to have to show actual malice, that people were going on air and on Fox News and knowingly telling lies or acting with reckless disregard for the truth. And when you see these behind-the-scenes communications from Tucker Carlson, Sidney Powell is lying, from Laura Ingraham to Tucker and to Sean Hannity, Sidney Powell is a bit nuts. Rupert Murdoch, really crazy stuff, but saying the opposite on air, that is legally actionable and it's also just plain wrong. I think it will anger a jury, large potential damages here.",

And the way to stop this ongoing pattern of lies is to have a trial and force Fox News to pay damages, potentially billions of dollars in damages that could make that company sit up and take notice.I know these lawyers at Susman Godfrey who are going to try the case. I have worked with them. They are the ones who can really impose a lesson here. A great co-counsel at Clare Locke.

They've created this monster and it has now spun out of their control. There's a very interesting \"New York Post\" editorial from November 7, 2020, cited in the documents, where he pleads with President Trump -- then President Trump, to accept the results and simply move on and not tarnish his own legacy. That didn't -- it was unheeded. It was unheeded by his audience. It was unheeded by his organization. Ultimately, it led to this disastrous point where -- that they've arrived at. I think Rupert Murdoch himself understands very well that they need to go in another direction. The question is whether or not this financial beast that he has created, this organization, that is so dependent on catering to a select audience, whether or not they are willing to change and go back to basic news gathering. If they can do that, they may be able to survive this.",

Here is part of the ruling. \"The evidence presented to the superior court ultimately supports the court's conclusion that voters were able to cast their ballots, that votes were counted correctly, and that no other basis justifies setting aside the election results.\"She says that she will take this to the State Supreme Court.

But we have to go live to the White House where national security council official John Kirby has joined the White House briefing. Let's listen in.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ADM. JOHN KIRBY, NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL SPOKESMAN AND COORDINATOR FOR STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS, NSC:  Thanks, Karina (ph). Appreciate it. And thank you all for giving me a chance to come up here and talk on Friday. But as Karina (ph) just mentioned the president is very much looking forward to his trip to Warsaw next week, which is ahead, of course, of the one-year anniversary of Russia's brutal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. After he lands on Tuesday morning, he will meet with the President Duda of Poland to discuss our bilateral cooperation as well as our collective efforts to support Ukraine and to bolster NATO's deterrence. Poland, as you know, is a close NATO ally and has been a critical supporter of Ukraine over the past year. President Biden will thank President Duda and thank the Polish people for the $3.8 billion in military and humanitarian assistance that they have provided to Ukraine over the past year and for all the efforts that the Polish people have done to generously welcome more than 1.5 million refugees in Ukraine. The two leaders will discuss Poland's important logistical role as well in helping the U.S. facilitate deliveries of military humanitarian assistance to Ukraine from not only the United States but from our allies and partners. The president will also have a chance to thank Poland for how they hosted now an increased number of U.S. forces, including those that are permanently stationed and those who were deployed to Europe as part of our force posture adjustments, the ones that we announced last year following Russia's invasion, are some 10,000 American troops in Poland right now, most of them on rotational orders. On Tuesday evening local time, President Biden will deliver remarks in Warsaw on how the United States has rallied the world to support the people of Ukraine and as they defend their freedom and democracy. President Biden will make it clear that the United States will continue to stand with Ukraine, as you've heard him say many times for as long as it takes. And on Wednesday, President Biden will get a chance to meet with the leaders of the Bucharest 9, otherwise known as the B-9, and these largely the group of eastern flank NATO allies who are basically and quite frankly, literally on the front lines of our collective defense right now. And he'll do so to reaffirm the United States' unwavering support for the security of that alliance and Transatlantic unity. The leaders will discuss our efforts over the past year to strengthen NATO, which is stronger now, more united than it was -- than it has ever been, and how each of our nations will continue to work together as allies to continue our unwavering support for Ukraine. This is an important trip for the president and it comes at an important moment. It also follows days of diplomacy at the Munich Security Conference where the vice president, the secretary of state, the senior director here at the NSC for Europe, and many other cabinet members, administration officials, members of Congress are all meeting with our allies and partners to discuss our enduring support for the people of Ukraine, as well as our Transatlantic unity and our iron clad support for our NATO allies in light of all of the changes to the European security environment over the last year. And as the president believes, that security environment has changed. Not is changing, not will change, has changed. In fact, Vice President Harris is meeting with foreign leaders, including Chancellor Scholz of Germany, President Macron of France. Tomorrow, the vice president will deliver a keynote address about our support for Ukraine and the atrocities that Russian forces continue to commit against the Ukrainian people. As you all know, close coordination with our allies and partners has been a priority for President Biden since taking office and throughout the past year, as we support Ukraine. In addition to his engagements in Poland, President Biden is looking forward to hosting Chancellor Scholz at the White House on March 3rd, and the president will be speaking with a number of our allies next week on the phone, including Prime Minister Sunak of the United Kingdom, President Macron of France, Prime Minister Meloni of Italy. As we approach the one-year mark since this invasion, we can proudly say that our support for Ukraine remains unwavering and our alliances and our international coalition in support of Ukraine remain stronger than ever. With that, I'll be taking some questions. I beg your pardon? On, no. We're back to my age again. Yes.",

Certainly, in light of the Chinese spy balloon and what was a very real, certainly very sizable and tangible security threat, surveillance threat to the United States in the wake of that.So, the military fine tunes their radar parameters to see more. And of course, they're finding more. And you've got these three. And they are unidentified, they're not responding to any kind of communication. So, we don't know who owns them or what their purpose is. You know, and they are flying in sovereign U.S. air space. They are also at altitudes that could affect the safety of civilian air traffic. And based on the flight path and the prevailing winds, potentially moving over sensitive military sites. And the military leaders come to you and they say, Mr. President, we don't know what these are. We're concerned about what they could be and about where they could be going and what the purpose might be. And we recommend that you take these down in the safe -- you know, in the interests of safety and security of the American people and out of an abundance of caution. And the president acted on that recommendation because he takes so seriously his responsibilities to protect this country, our secrets, our interests, and our people. So, the short answer to your question is, absolutely not. You know, given the situation we were in, the information available, the recommendation of our military commanders, it was exactly the right thing to do at exactly the right time. Now, going forward, and you heard the president talk about this yesterday, we're going to make sure we've got some new rules in place for how we make decisions in future circumstances. That doesn't mean -- and it doesn't mean -- and you heard the president say this yesterday, it doesn't mean that there won't be additional shootdowns if he believes there is a legitimate threat to our safety and security.

So, again, I say to you, the short answer to that is no. And frankly, given the circumstances in light of what happened with this spy balloon, wouldn't that be a better outcome if it turns out they were in fact civilian or recreational use or weather balloon and therefore, benign, which is what the intelligence community thinks, isn't that a better outcome than to have to think about the possibility of greater threats to our national security?",
