Today we're asking, as Donald Trump's plans for a second term become clearer, would his return to power be dangerous for the country?Then, following President Biden's summit this week with China's President Xi, how close is too close when it comes to U.S.-China relations? And a new twist on the yearly debate that pits neighbor against neighbor, when to start decorating for Christmas. Our group is here and ready to go. So sit back, grab your coffee, and let's talk about it. First, our Saturday starter. Donald Trump isn't known for holding back, and when it comes to his plans for a second term, we're learning more every day. It's likely to be tougher than his first go-around, more radical, some even say more authoritarian. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)",

The fundamental challenge for the president, for the former president, I should say, is that the more authoritarian he seems, the more unhinged he seems, the less likely that it is that he is likely to win the next election. He needs to convince folks that he is going to bring back 2019 back again. He's going to be disciplined. He's going to be in command.

Where I disagree with Reihan is, like, if it doesn't come out of the mouth of the president, it is all speculation and so forth. There is an enormous effort from Heritage, from these other groups to live up to this ideal that personnel is policy. And all of the safeguards -- one of the reasons why the first administration is chaotic -- and I used to say, look, Trump isn't Hitler. At least Hitler could have repealed Obamacare -- was that you had people surrounding Trump, trying to stop him from doing all sorts of crazy stuff. Now the fundamental requirement, you set up these, they all have to share his ideology, and the ideology is essentially a cult of personality.

New data from the CDC shows exemptions have allowed kids to forgo state-required vaccines for diseases like measles, polio, and chicken pox are at an all-time high. For years the U.S. maintained a 95 percent vaccination rate for kindergarteners. But in recent years it has dropped and now sits at 93 percent. That may not seem like much, but doctors say even a small increase in unvaccinated kids in school leaves the country vulnerable to outbreaks of dangerous diseases. In 10 states, exemptions were above five percent, which the CDC says is the red line for greater risk of an outbreak. This all comes amid a rise in anti-vaccine and anti-science sentiment. A recent survey finds one in four Americans, 27 percent, don't really trust scientists. You can see here that has doubled from before the COVID pandemic when only 13 percent, they don't trust scientists.
