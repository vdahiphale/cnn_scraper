We are live at the CNN Weather Center with how these storms are disrupting travel. And Ukraine bracing for possible escalation ahead of the anniversary of the invasion as Russia and China reaffirmed their ties in Moscow. Plus, rising tensions in the Middle East after a raid by Israeli forces leaves at least 11 Palestinians dead. We're live in Jerusalem with the latest. Millions of Americans are feeling the chill for the massive winter storm system affecting multiple states from coast to coast. Heavy snow, winds, and ice have knocked out power to more than 850,000 customers. Even parts of California are reporting snow with Los Angeles County issuing a blizzard warning for the first time since the 1980s. Flight tracking website FlightAware reports nearly 700 flights have been canceled on Thursday so far because of the weather. Let's bring in meteorologist Britley Ritz. She is joining me now from Atlanta. This is serious disruption, Britley. Any idea how long these conditions are going to last?",

Sixty million people are under some sort of winter weather alert, including Southern California, where two to five feet of snow is expected in some of the higher elevations there. That, again, the first time since 1989.For a blizzard warning coming on the National Weather Surface Office of L.A, that starts Friday into Saturday. The whole system itself is taking its trek up into New England, now under winter weather advisories as well as winter storm warnings with several inches of snow expected to fall as well as ice, and were already dealing with that, stretching across the upper Midwest across the Great Lakes and into New England down to the southern part of the country. There are going to be few thunderstorms expected. Much warmer record- breaking heat, by the way, as of yesterday. All right, there is a snow moving through Green Bay as well as Minneapolis. Some of the heaviest snow through the overnight and early morning hours. And then moving into New England, watching that snowfall as of this morning and, again, through the afternoon and tomorrow. Preliminary, snowfall totals. Over the last few days, Battle Lake, Wyoming picked up 48 inches of snowfall, ice, which is crippling by the way, numerous power outages reported already, trees falling because of the wind and the ice. Ann Arbor has already picked up 0.6 inches of ice and more falling. You see the pink still popping here on your (INAUDIBLE) showing you through the rest of Thursday, and then it tapers back through the upper Midwest and the Great Lakes and pushes into New England Thursday night into Friday. So, freezing rain on top of the snow. It will be a bit crunchy and travel again not advised here in the upcoming days. As for snowfall totals, on top of what we already experienced in Minneapolis and into parts of (INAUDIBLE) Michigan, Green Bay included in that, where we could pick up six to eight inches of snowfall. And, of course, another half an inch of ice in some of these locations up to a quarter of an inch as we move in to New England. Christina?",

Other analysts suggest that it is difficult to see how Ukrainian defenses have so improved and Russian offensive systems have so decreased that they have the ability to carry out anything terribly substantial. Still, of course, Ukrainians are preparing for that possibility, specifically around the Kherson region, which is continuing to be the subject of attacks from the other side of the Dnipro River. So, there are measures being taken there to help protect populations, also in Kherson up by the Russian border with Ukrainian authorities suggesting people can stay at home if they feel unsafe and preparing for what they expect might be the worst. Meanwhile, we just heard there from President Joe Biden, of course, the efforts to beef up Ukraine's counteroffensive continue. In the part of western leaders, we have a surprise this morning here in Kyiv on the part of the Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, meeting with President Zelenskyy, vowed to send six Leopard tanks of its own, expected to arrive here in Ukraine by February, March. Training periods have been completed. But as ever here in Ukraine as we look ahead to that one-year anniversary, Christina, there is a case of hoping for the best, but as ever over the course of last year preparing for the worst.",

First, you have the suspension of Russia's participation which probably confirmed on Wednesday in the New START treaty, that last remnant of the post-Cold War nuclear arms reduction architecture with the United States.That really just sort of confirmed the status quo. Russia wasn't allowing inspections anyway. The U.S. also believes -- U.S. officials telling us that Russia tested in ICBM earlier the week, the intercontinental ballistic missile. That test apparently failed, but all part of the same theme. And now, on the defender of the fatherland day, which is marked every year on the 23rd of February in Russia, Putin released a comment saying that they are going to give particular attention to strengthen what he called the nuclear triad, that sea, land and airbase nuclear weapon. They have been modernizing their nuclear weapons for decades. This doesn't really change anything. But it does show this kind of posturing.

Indeed, these are not new threats because, as you remember, Russia already since the beginning of the war in Ukraine was mentioning such kind of possibilities of use of nuclear weapons. And each and every time, they were met with very strong condemnation.This is what we have to do right now because Russia, even if it is in war against Ukraine, it is a permanent member of the Security Council, and it has special responsibilities as an owner of nuclear weapons. So, this kind of threats is inadmissible and they have to be strongly condemned. At the same time, we've seen before such kind of threats. They were not followed by any kind of action. We should know and we are able to know as an alliance, I am speaking on the behalf of NATO right now, that we can spot whenever there is certain preparation for the use of nuclear weapons. So, with this rhetoric, for the time being, I think this comes at the moment of marking the one-year commemoration of the start of the war in Ukraine, and Russia has no results whatsoever to the contrary. I think it's a sort of a need for the Russian officials, including for President Putin and other allies of Mr. Putin, to mention such kind of things which create a lot of emotion at the international level.",

The Security Council debates -- and General Assembly debate where we are supposed to adopt with hopefully a large majority or a solution regarding the comprehensive, lasting and justice in Ukraine. So, I think it is important that all member states of the United Nations or the international community condemn very strongly what Russia is doing in Ukraine and ask for an immediate stop of hostilities, an immediate withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine, and the start of a peace process. Of course, this depends on Ukraine. The definition of victory depends on Ukraine.

So, all of this represent a combined set of measures. Command and control aspect, which are also very important.

There were many people out shopping in the open market in the old city of Nablus. Israeli security forces went in to try to arrest three militants who they say were responsible for killing an Israeli soldier. They say that they invited the militants to surrender. They refused to do. One fled. He was shot and killed. The other two were ultimately killed as well. As you say, in total, 11 Palestinians were killed after this raid by Israeli security forces. We know that some of them were civilians. More than 100 injured. And according to the Palestinian Red Crescent, some of those injuries were as a result of live ammunition and that there were bullets, in their words, that were flying everywhere. The spokesperson for the Israeli defense forces can see that things did get, in his words, very messy. We've seen that there's been condemnation from the Saudis, the Jordanians, the Egyptians, and from the Emiratis as well as a result of that raid yesterday. The United States State Department said that it is extremely concerned, in its words, by levels of violence in Israel and the West Bank. And we've also heard from the United Nations special coordinator for the Middle East peace process, saying that he is deeply disturbed by the continuing cycle of violence and is appalled by the loss of civilian lives. Now, Palestinian Islamic jihad, two of its commanders were killed in that raid yesterday. It has come out and said and warned of an explosion of violence and an escalation.

The Turkish government has launched an economic relief plan and banned layoffs in 10 provinces as authorities move to demolish damaged buildings.The justice ministry says at least 160 people out of nearly 600 suspects have been arrested, and many more detained over unsafe construction. CNN's Nada Bashir joins us now live from the Turkish port city of Iskenderun. Nada, this appears to be an effort for accountability by the government given the understandable anger that has followed such a tragic loss of life. But how much are the government themselves implicated in the failings of those they're seeking to investigate and arrest here?",

They've already launched an investigation. More than 500 people identified as potential suspect, more than 160 so far arrested over allegations of construction negligence. And I say there are also reports that some contractors were offered or provided amnesties when it came to buildings that didn't adhere to the necessary safety requirements. And there have been questions on whether the government has done enough to implement those safety measures, particularly across the southeast region. Take a listen to what the presidential spokesman, Ibrahim Kalin, told CNN yesterday in response to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I mean, take a look at the destruction behind. Me you can see some of these buildings are barely still standing. Others have completely collapsed. These are people's homes. Their belongings. Their entire lives gone following this earthquake. And this is just one neighborhood.We are in Iskenderun, which is in Hatay province, among the hardest hit by that initial earthquake. And also, particularly damage following that aftershock on Monday. There are some 900,000 people currently living in tents across southeast Turkey. Some of those that we've been speaking to in one of the camps just across the street from where we are, almost three weeks on, still don't have a tent. They're sleeping in the streets. So, for those that have lost loved ones, for those questioning where the accountability lies, these lessons that the government says they are learning, these plans to rebuild within a year, for some, feel like empty promises.
