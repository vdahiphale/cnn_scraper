We're going to get to the latest that happened in March Madness over the weekend, but we're going to start this morning in Moscow.Just moments ago, the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, arrived in the Russian capital for his three-day high-stakes state visit with President Putin. Later this morning, he's going to meet directly with the Russian leader one-on-one. Beijing is calling this trip quote a journey of peace, where Xi is supposed to help mediate peace talks over Ukraine, but western leaders are understandably very skeptical and wary of the two autocratic leaders growing cooperation. CNN's Matthew chance is live in Moscow. Matthew, obviously, this meeting is going to be happening in just a few hours but it's incredibly symbolic for the fact that it's Xi's first time in Russia since they invaded Ukraine and the questions about this partnership and what it looks like coming out of this meeting.",

It's not just symbolic because it's the first time since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but it's just a few days after Vladimir Putin was indicted by the International Criminal Court for war crimes in Ukraine as well. And so we're going to have a situation where Xi Jinping, the ruler of China, is going to be standing side by side and having face to face negotiations with an indicted war criminal.And so that's something that will send a very strong message, I think, both to Russia, that China stands by its friend and ally, but also to the rest of the world as well, that even though China has said it wants to play an impartial role in brokering a diplomatic solution to the crisis, as Russians call it, inside Ukraine, the fact is that, you know, it is very much showing a strong level of support for the Russian leadership. What I think many people will be watching for, though, is that what -- how far will that relationship extend. That strong political support, yes, diplomatic support, yes, but, will the Chinese provide much needed military aid to the Russians? So far, they haven't crossed that line but there is concern if they choose to do so, Kaitlan. COLLINS:  Yes. And, obviously, the U.S. is watching this closely. I have been talking to officials all morning who are saying they're looking to see if there's any tangible agreements coming out of this. I think one thing they have also been warning about, Matthew, and I'm wondering what you're hearing on this, is whether or not you're going to see China call for some kind of a ceasefire in Ukraine, which obviously they believe would benefit Russia here.",

And that's one reason I think that they have probably been cautious so far in providing weapons to the Russians. The problem is the Russians don't have other places to turn right now.

And they think the United States did this from the end of World War II in 1945 through to just a few years ago. And that's why it was so important to them to play this role between Iran and Saudi Arabia and would be important to them to do this now.And, of course, the United States not only doesn't want to give up its position on that, but it also is suspicious that China is not the neutral player that it pretends to be.

Good to see you, thank you so much.So, in other news now, it could be an eventful week here in Manhattan with a possible indictment looming over Donald Trump. The former president says that he expects to be arrested as soon as tomorrow in the Stormy Daniels hush money case. But the timeline remains unclear. Sources telling me that if and when the indictment happens, Trump is expected it expected to surrender, he'll have his mug shots and fingerprints taken, just like everybody else. Trump's legal team is making a last minute push to discredit the district attorney's star witness, who is Michael Cohen. At their request, Cohen's former lawyer is set to testify today before the grand jury, and we're told that he came forward and offered evidence to contradict some of Cohen's claims. So, let's discuss more now. I want to bring in CNN's Kara Scannell live outside the courthouse in Manhattan this morning. Good morning, Kara. What will we see, if anything, today?",

He has represented numerous Trump allies, including Rudy Giuliani and Steve Bannon, and at one point, Michael Cohen. Several years ago, he was representing him in connection with this hush money investigation.So, a source tells us that Costello had reached out to the Manhattan district attorney's office and attorneys for Trump saying that he had information that would contradict the testimony of Michael Cohen. You'll remember, Cohen pled guilty to federal charges, saying that he made these hush money payments in coordination with and at the direction of former President Trump. So, Costello expected today, Trump's attorneys asked the D.A.'s office to bring him in. They think he's being brought in for the optics of it. But he will have the opportunity to go before the grand jury. Now, the D.A.s office has asked Michael Cohen to appear today as a possible rebuttal witness. Cohen saying on MSNBC over the weekend that he was asked to come in. He wasn't sure if it was to go before the grand jury or to meet with the D.A.'s office. So, we're going to have a lot of activity today behind me in this building where the grand jury sets and where the D.A.'s office meets. Now, over the weekend, with Trump's calls for protests, saying that he expects to be arrested and charged this week, the D.A.'s office sent an email to staff saying that they will not tolerate any attempts to intimidate them.

And here, it appears the D.A. is looking at potential election interference and election fraud.Now, you reported they're considering conspiracy. That's a loaded word. But all it really means is an agreement, a meeting of the minds between two or more people to commit a crime. And then if you go up to racketeering, now this is a really powerful tool that prosecutors use. What you have to do is show two things. First of all, the existence of what we call a racketeering enterprise. That can be a mafia family, that can be a drug trafficking organization but it can also be a corporation or a political entity. And then you have to show they engaged in what we call a pattern of racketeering activity, meaning that they committed two or more crimes in an organized fashion, which brings us to this other new piece of information, there's a third phone call. We already know about, of course, the infamous phone call to Brad Raffensperger, I just want to find 11,780 votes. There's also a public recording of Donald Trump talking to this investigator, Frances Watson, when he tells her, when the right answer comes out, you'll be praised. Now, we know Trump also called the former Georgia speaker of the house asking him to convene a special session. Now, Don, as we know, we have heard from some of the grand jurors, special grand jurors who have come out. They've told us that they've recommended indictments for more than a dozen people. Now, Fani Willis, though, will ultimately get the decision. That special grand jury cannot indict. If she wants to indict, she'll have to take the case to a regular grand jury. Now, when is that going to happen? She told -- the D.A. told a judge 55 days ago that her decision was imminent, 55 days ago. So, I guess imminence is in the eye of the beholder.",

European markets open slightly lower amid fears for the overall banking sector. In the opening minutes, shares of Credit Suisse tumbled as much as 62 percent. UBS shares were down 8 percent.UBS is Switzerland's largest bank. Now, it agreed to buy Credit Suisse to try to ease the financial panic triggered by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. This is the first rescue of a global bank since the financial crisis of 2008. Credit Suisse had been losing the trust of investors and customers for years. Authorities were very worried about the fallout, if it failed. And this also comes as The New York Times has some fascinating new reporting on Silicon Valley Bank, quote, SVB's risky practices were on the Federal Reserve's radar for more than a year, an awareness that proved insufficient to stop the bank's demise, the Fed repeatedly warned the bank that it had problems.

Can you believe that this happened to Credit Suisse, this fire sale, and then just completely overriding any say of shareholders, the Swiss government stepping here in saying this must happen? It's stunning.",

      "sentences": "It is stunning, but Credit Suisse was in pretty awful shape to begin with. It was limping along. And you know that old saying from Warren Buffet, when the tide goes out, you see who's swimming naked. Well, the tide ran out very fast, indeed, and there was nowhere else for Credit Suisse to go.When you look at this particular deal, it's a shotgun marriage, to be sure, but there are some very odd intricacies, particularly relating to bondholders who have also been wiped out, and the feeling is that this itself could cause more turbulence when New York opens in just a few hours from now. But for the moment, Poppy, they had no choice. Credit Suisse was going down, and as a systemically important bank, they couldn't allow it to take anybody else with it.",

      "sentences": "Firstly, the bigger banks, the main banks are much better capitalized. They've got tier three credit and reserves and assets way beyond what's necessary. And the second reason, the regulators themselves. They wouldn't have another Lehman moment. They are well aware now of the contagion risk and would move in -- well, they have moved in fast, Signature, SVB, Credit Suisse, the radar is like this at the moment. Because, Poppy, what this has shown on the downside is that there are banks potentially in trouble. And so the regulators are now on notice. We will move fast to deal with any crisis even before it gets going.",

      "sentences": "You're so right about that famous Warren Buffet quote, when the tide goes out, you basically see who's naked, you see who's most at risk.Jeanna, let me bring you in here, because what's fascinating is that although the problems at Credit Suisse are so different than what happened at Silicon Valley Bank and Signature, the collapse of those banks is really what accelerated this or made this sort of a vortex that Credit Suisse collapsed into. I was fascinated by your reporting over the weekend about how many times the Fed, the San Francisco Federal Reserve, which has purview over SVB, warned them, six citations over the last year, that they had, quote, matters requiring attention and the SEC new that there was no interest rate hedge. So, why did nothing happen?",
