More than six feet of snow has fallen in some areas, a historic amount for a region that is used to major winter storms. The extreme snowfall making travel on some roadways nearly impossible. Driving bans and state of emergencies are in place to keep people off the roads. CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar is tracking this dangerous storm, and CNN's Polo Sandoval is in the thick of it there in Buffalo, New York. So Polo, to you first, what are you seeing?",

We've seen areas about 13 miles south of here, that's where they logged a little over six feet of snow. Smaller amounts here, but nonetheless it has really done quite a number on the streets. And that's why officials in the city of Buffalo have been working just nonstop since the overnight hours to clear out these roads.Just to give you some perspective, in the last hour we were standing here -- I was actually standing right here. The snow was almost below my knee. We have seen folks out here shoveling this, at least clearing a path for pedestrians, because drivers, hopefully, are still choosing to stay home right now. We should mention that a travel ban that has been in place for most of Buffalo, most of that is being lifted in this hour. We're talking northern, central, western, eastern parts of the city. The southern, however, that travel ban will remain in place, meaning that unless it's essential, folks there, it's recommended they simply stay home. Really, the big priority right now is trying to keep those streets clear. That way the plows can do their work. And also snow removal operations. One thing is to just sort of shovel it out of the way, but there are communities outside of Buffalo where that's not enough. They have to, they have to actually remove it. I want you to hear directly from one of the county officials who describes the main message, or at least sends the direct message to the residents. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DANIEL NEAVERTH JR., COMMISSIONER, ERIE COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY AND EMERGENCY SERVICES: Make sure that you're not the reason why ambulances or fire apparatus or the plows can't get through. Stay off the roads. It's Saturday. There's absolutely no reason to be out there today. The only people who need to be out are public safety individuals. So stay off the roads. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Just days after Donald Trump announced he is running for president in 2024, U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland has announced that he is appointing a special counsel to oversee the ongoing federal investigations into the former president. Trump is lashing out at that announcement, calling it an abuse of power and saying he won't partake in the probe. Jack Smith, the former head of the Justice Department's Public Integrity section will lead the department's investigations into the former president's possible mishandling -- excuse me. Boy, excuse me. I'm losing my voice here -- the possible mishandling of classified documents and key parts of its January 6th investigation. Renato Mariotti is not going to do most of the talking.

In fact, if you or I had top secret documents in our closet or our basement, we would already be in very serious hot water, because it's a very straightforward crime, more like a drug crime I used to prosecute when I was a junior prosecutor. Those cases are straightforward. If you have heroin in your closet, you're guilty. And so maybe you could try to make some arguments. But here theJustice Department demanded the documents, they issued a grand jury subpoena, actually made a personal visit to the former president's estate, and he still didn't return the documents.

He encouraged some who live outside of San Francisco to fly in to make it in person if they could.

One thing, though, that they have continued to say is that they believe this was targeted. They gave no reasoning behind this explanation, but they say that this is likely a targeted stabbing.

Then they went to a food truck at 1:40 in the morning. They were all believed to be home at around 2:00 in the morning. And so authorities, what they think happened is that the attack was happening sometime in those early morning hours. We know that the call reporting these stabbings came in at noon. They reported an unconscious person. And then authorities at the moment not even saying who called 911. They are saying, though, that the two other roommates who were at the house here behind me are not considered to be suspects at the moment.

But a separate date will be set to determine restitution, a possible $800 million. Holmes was convicted in January on four counts of defrauding investors but found not guilty of defrauding patients. She had at one time been an icon in Silicon Valley for being a young female entrepreneur, starting the company Theranos and claiming her technology could use just a few drops of blood to conduct a variety of tests. But that technology didn't work.Prosecutors said when faced with failure, she chose fraud. A separated trial earlier this year found Theranos's second in command Sunny Balwani guilty on 12 counts of fraud. Holmes has to turn herself into custody next April, and that may have to do with the fact that she is currently pregnant. Her pregnancy and her one-year-old child with partner by Billy Evans were brought up by some of her supporters when they wrote to the judge stating how one must consider very young children growing up without their mother. There were more than 100 letters written in her support. Holmes had a chance to speak for herself on Friday before the judge read her sentence. She was emotional in telling the court, quote, \"The people I tried to get involved with Theranos were the people I loved and respected the most.

Actually, we cover in our series \"World Corrupt\" that the Kafala system, which is the abusive labor practice system that you find all across the gulf, is actually a legacy of British colonial rule. So that is something we talked about, and we should be cognizant of. But it doesn't mean we should look away when those practices are continuing right now.He also compared having red hair to the treatment of migrant workers. It was one of the most absurd speeches I have ever heard. And I guess I shouldn't be surprised, because Gianni Infantino is the same man who told Vladimir Putin back in 2018 that we all fell in love with Russia when they hosted the World Cup in 2018. So it's clear that he's either a bit of a dupe or his praise is easily bought. I don't know. I'll let your viewers decide.",

And I think that's really important, because a week ago Qatar's World Cup ambassador told a German TV crew that homosexuality is, quote, \"damage of the mind.\" This was a couple days ago. So I do think it's important to show that solidarity. I do believe the U.S. team also met with migrant workers so they could hear about their treatment directly. So they are doing what they can.What's frustrating about this is we put so much pressure on these players to be moral leaders on top of being leaders on the field when FIFA is the problem. It's a corrupt institution that awarded this tournament to Qatar despite having no infrastructure and no history of playing soccer. There was no reason for them to ever get it. They created this mess, and now players have to clean it up. It's not fair.",

But again, what I'm watching is Saudi Arabia and Egypt are making a bid for the 2030 World Cup.

I'm sure they all are blindsided and frustrated when they look and say look at Saudi Arabia, look at the way they treat workers. Look at the UAE. There's a lot whataboutism happening. And so the U.S. will do what it can to exert constant ongoing pressure on friends, allies, partners, enemies to do better when it comes to human rights. But the U.S. only has so much control. It is the emir of Qatar whowill make all the decisions about reforming their labor practices and everything else we're talking about today. So the kind of onus is on them. The U.S. can only stand up for our values. But we have some pressure. We have a U.S. base there. There's a military base there that we can use as some sort of leverage, but not a lot.",
