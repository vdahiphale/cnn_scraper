I'm Fareed Zakaria coming to you live form New York.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ZAKARIA (voice-over): Today on the program, President Biden threatens to halt arms shipment to Israel and pushes for a ceasefire as Netanyahu seizes a vital part of Rafah. What will it take for Israel to end its operations against Hamas and what would a ceasefire mean for Palestinians? I'll ask two former foreign ministers, Israel's Tzipi Livni and Nasser al-Kidwa of the Palestinian Authority. And Xi Jinping traveled to Europe for the first time in five years to meet with the leaders of -- get this -- France, Serbia, and Hungary. Can China drive a wedge between Europe and America? Then there are less than six months to go until election day in America. The historian Robert Kagan says this could be the country's last free and fair election. Hyperbole or fact-based fear? I'll ask him. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

But I believe that this is a matter of tactic. As long as we all agree about the goals of the war, meaning the eradication of Hamas, topple the regime of Hamas and release of the hostages.So I do hope that these tactical questions will be solved between Israel and President Biden. And the most important thing that is missing right now is not the question of what the Israeli forces would do directly in Rafah, outside of Rafah or other cities in Gaza, but the real question is, OK, and then what? What's the end game? Who's going to replace Hamas in Gaza? Because topple the regime is important, but you cannot just topple the regime without replacing it. And this is a question which is in dispute between the Israeli government, between Netanyahu and Biden, and I do believe that this is the master key for different issues that are now on the table.",

So they are a damage not only to the Israeli-U.S. relationship, but it's a damage to Israel itself from different aspects. And this is only one of it.",

He is the former foreign minister for the Palestinian Authority and represented the PLO at the U.N. He is also the nephew of the late Yasser Arafat.Nasser, welcome. Let me ask you whether from your perspective the Biden administration's recent public distancing itself from Israel on the issue of Rafah and a full-scale ground operation there is welcome news? Do you think that it's been effective? How do you view what the Biden administration is doing right now? NASSER AL-KIDWA, FORMER PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY FOREIGN MINISTER: Well, to be frank with you, I think the administration is saying the right thing. They say that we don't like what we see happening in Gaza. However, when it comes to action, it's different story. So do I like it? Yes, I like it. Do I think that this was enough to change things and to change the course of events? Unfortunately not. And unless we see serious change, unless we see some clear positions taken, some actions taken, I think we'll stay in the same situation.",

Do you think it's being achieved?AL-KIDWA: No, it was not achieved and it's not going to be achieved, and that emphasizes the fact that what's Mr. Netanyahu is doing now on Rafah is catastrophic. He is taking the situation to a new level, a new catastrophic level, a criminal level, I would say, and without any specific results because he -- remember, he said the same thing before Khan Younis. He said the same thing before even the city of Gaza, and before attacking the Shifa Hospital and the result was the same. So this is a situation that cannot be solved by military means only. This is the situation that requires also some political consideration and some political understanding of the situation that then will take us all to ending this catastrophe and move forward not only to solve the situation in Gaza, but to hopefully solve the overall political situation as well.",

I mean, given the trauma of the last few months, you know, if you were to hold an election in Gaza tomorrow, am I wrong in thinking Hamas would probably do better than it would have done before?AL-KIDWA: I wouldn't agree with you, Fareed, on this one because I think one of the results of the catastrophic situation now is the fact that the population feels hopeless. And they feel that the party who brought them here in this situation was at least partly Hamas, irrespective of the atrocities of the Israeli -- of the Israeli side. So I don't think so. Nevertheless, let me say also that unfortunately elections tomorrow is impossibility because of the fact, not the least of the existence or the presence of about two million displaced Palestinians. You cannot say -- you cannot tell a displaced person, come and vote. You have to take care of his needs or her needs first and provide them with the necessary tools to survive and then move forward and go for political solutions and change internally democracy, including elections.",

      "sentences": "And we are back with the former Palestinian Authority foreign minister Nasser al-Kidwa.Nasser, let's talk about the day after and what it would look like. You heard Tzipi Livni say the Palestinian Authority should take over but lots of people say in the United States and Israel, frankly in the Palestinian territories as well, that the Palestinian Authority is corrupt, it's compromised, and particularly that Mahmoud Abbas, Abu Mazen, who heads it is too old, too compromised a character. What do you think? AL-KIDWA: Well, I don't disagree with that. But let's talk about the day after, in general. And here, I think, several very important things need to happen. One, first and foremost, this catastrophic war needs to end. I mean, this bloodletting, the agony of the population, the crazy ideas such as collective deportation, and shrinking the territory of Gaza and things like that need to stop. And then we need to ensure that there is Israeli withdrawal, a withdrawal without return and without any attempt to impose conditions on the Palestinian people that the people don't -- don't accept, such as the siege. Then, of course, we need to reach a solution on an exchange of hostages and prisoners. In a way that would end this -- this -- this drama and in the right way. After that here, I agree, again with you, what you said at the beginning, that we need to have a drastic and seriously reformed Palestinian authority, not the kind of gimmick that we saw with the current government when Mr. Abbas brought that government. I mean, this did not change anything and cannot change anything. We need to change the system, in general. We need to change the ability of Mr. Abbas to govern at will and to do whatever he wants through maybe an empowered government that can rebuilt Gaza, which takes us to another thing that needs to happen. We need to have an effective government, free from corruption, and capable of rebuilding Gaza. And prepare the situation -- this part of the country, in addition to the West Bank, prepare it for elections after a while when the situation permit it this time (ph), because after all election is the only possible solution, real and drastic solution for all the ills of the Palestinian situation. And finally, we need to have a conference of donors that would provide for the financial assistance necessary to rebuild Gaza. Before that, I think, we need also to have some kind of an Arab security presence that would provide for a temporary situation whereby it can take over from the Israelis and hand over to the Palestinian government, the new Palestinian government. I think this is something that the Arabs will be willing to consider if, number one, there is an Israeli commitment for full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. And number two, if there is an Israeli commitment for a political solution that provides for the two states, Israel and Palestine, with the mutual recognition between the two of them by a certain date that is agreed upon.",

They have already created buffer zones. They're creating corridors to make it hard to move from north to south Gaza.When you ask people in Israel about a two-state solution, it seems to be at its lowest -- the lowest levels of support for it in decades. How would that -- do you anticipate this changing? It seems difficult. AL-KIDWA: Well, it is difficult, but it will -- it will change. Once, I read an article for an Israeli author who said that there will be a political solution, not out of magnanimous attitude and enthusiasm but out of desperation and the failure of both sides to annihilate the other side.",

Although, he's not giving Russia any military equipment, per se, he is supporting the military industrial complex in Russia, and maybe facilitating what will later be a Russian offensive which is something that really is a core interest of the Europeans and the United States that Russia does not win the war in Ukraine.And I think that perhaps Xi Jinping really doesn't understand that.

And I don't really know where all of that is going to lead, but I know that Xi Jinping must be very worried about it.I mean, look how rarely he has traveled abroad recently. He has been very preoccupied with China's domestic problems, especially its economic problems. But also, he's there having restored a more dictatorial form of communism that resembles Mao, and he has got to know, I'm sure he knows, that many of the other members of the elite don't agree with his policies particularly in his kind of bromance with Putin. The Russia position of Xi Jinping is among the most unpopular of his overreaching especially among the elite which, I think, is a very important context for this trip to Europe.",

He will -- he will seek vengeance. But the thing to understand as I think most people do about Trump is -- the problem is not that he has a careful plan for becoming a dictator. I don't think he has any such plan. He will be a dictator by virtue of the fact that he wants what he wants when he wants it, and how he wants to get it. And if you listen to him talk about his second term plans, a lot of it involves militarizing various elements of society, using the military on immigration, using Homeland Security as a force.

If Mike Pence had not shown the backbone that he did at that moment, Trump might conceivably have stolen election that had gone against him. And at that point, he would be ruling as a dictator, not as a democratically elected president. He was completely willing to do that, if not eager to do that. I would ask voters in America, what more do you need to know about a presidential candidate? We don't know, you know, what Biden is going to be like in a second term, but we know what the parameters of what Biden are going to be like in a second term. Trump has proven that for him there are no parameters. He has said he's willing to go against the constitution. And so, we don't know for sure what he's actually going to do.
