Why it wasn't safe for the family and they felt they couldn't live in these circumstances any longer. What struck me is the intimacy of the portrayal. There are scenes where Meghan Markle is in her bathrobe and a turban with no makeup on, clearly emotional, in her own bedroom recording herself and how she's feeling. They talk about their first date, their first kiss, sharing a tent together. It's an insight we've never had into figures in the royal family before. It also works on numerous levels. There's clearly the family element -- the impact that this documentary and the revelations within it will have on the relationship between Prince Harry and his brother, Meghan and the rest of the royal family, and the situation for their children. But also, on a royal international level because there are several references to Britain's history of slavery and the part that plays into racial discourse. And also the fact that Brexit was going on when Meghan became engaged to Harry, and the fact that historians suggest that may have added to the discourse around her race and the possible resentment of having somebody from her background marry into the royal family.",

You realize that you have heard five of Meghan's anonymous friends talk about the relationship. You've heard Meghan's lawyers talk about her relationship with her dad. But you've never heard her talk about it.And I think that there is a sense where you can tell she started to really resent how much -- you know, courtiers were telling her how to deal with her own family and how much it was about optics and not about the fact that she had a difficult childhood growing up. She -- her parents divorced when she was really young. And I think that there is a lot of trauma around that for her, and I think this is her taking the opportunity to finally clear that up. So the first three episodes -- I don't know about what's going to happen next but definitely, the first three episodes -- they are about Meghan Markle's relationship with her family and the way that the media interfered in that, and Harry's relationship with the media.",

They're relying on the independent state legislature theory -- the idea that state legislatures should have unchecked power to control election procedures and that state courts and state constitutions have no role in checking that power. It's a concept that was first raised by Chief Justice William Rehnquist in the Bush v. Gore decision. And while four conservatives on the court have previously expressed interest in the issue, Justice Brett Kavanaugh seemed to push back on it as too broad of an expansion of state legislative power. JUSTICE BRETT KAVANAUGH, U.S. SUPREME COURT:  Your position seems to go further than Chief Justice Rehnquist's position in Bush v. Gore where he seemed to acknowledge that state courts would have a role interpreting state law. SCHNEIDER (voice-over):  Some Trump supporters seized on the theory in 2020 to argue state lawmakers in battleground states had the power to override the will of voters and choose presidential electors who favored Trump. The Supreme Court's ruling likely would not extend the issue of electors, but some are warning it could be a slippery slope if the court finds in favor of the Republicans here.",
