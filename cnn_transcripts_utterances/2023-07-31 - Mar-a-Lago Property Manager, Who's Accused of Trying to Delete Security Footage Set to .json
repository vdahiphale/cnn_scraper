His name, Carlos De Oliveira, is the third person indicted in the classified documents case alongside former President Trump and his valet, Walt Nauta. Prosecutors say De Oliveira met up with Nauta in June of last year to scope out the surveillance cameras around the storage room where the documents were moved in and out. Prosecutors also say De Oliveira then asked a different employee, quote, what are we going to do about, quote, the boss' request to delete that footage?

Trump facing additional charges for mishandling classified documents, maintained his innocence on social media, claiming his legal team voluntarily handed over the tapes to the special counsel and that he never told anybody to delete them.

I mean, the fact is, she is -- there is no other vice president in the history of the United States of America, in the history of the United States of America that looks like Kamala Harris. And with that, there's been a double standard in the way that she's been covered.I actually criticized the president of the United States for the portfolio that was given to Kamala Harris at the very beginning, and now you see her actually getting out on the campaign trail, showing the talent that brought so many of us onboard during her presidential campaign. Not only did she go down to Florida about abortion, but she went to Tennessee when we had the expulsion of the three lawmakers. She's been going around the country. And when she goes around the country, you hear the beltway talk about the fact that she's not popular or whatever or people don't like her. Yes, that's just in Washington, D.C. When she gets outside, which is what many of us have been asking the White House to allow her to do, when she gets outside of the beltway of the United States of America, people look at her in awe. I mean, it's fascinating to see. And now you hear the rhythm of her words and she's speaking to the heartbeat of this country. Yes, I just think that right now, this vice president has found her footing and she is doing a very, very good job in a very, very tough position because she's not being held to the start of Mike Pence. She's not being head to the start of Joe Biden. She's not being held to the Saturday of Al Gore. She's held to a standard that far supersedes that and she's meeting that bar, as we see her out there on the road today.",
