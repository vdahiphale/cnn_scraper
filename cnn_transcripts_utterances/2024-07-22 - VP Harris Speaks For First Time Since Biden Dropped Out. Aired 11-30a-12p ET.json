Several prominent Democrats have come out in the wake of that endorsing her as well. But the party and others in leadership like House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi and the top Senate Democrats as well as the top House Democrat, Hakeem Jeffries, and Chuck Schumer, also have stopped short of providing an explicit endorsement of Harris.Of course, she's been serving as vice president for the last three and a half years. But this morning's event will serve as something of an audition for American voters as they consider her through a new lens, one as President of the United States, where they will have to make a choice in November. Of course, much of the messaging for the campaign up until this point has focused on the choice between Trump and what the Biden-Harris team has viewed as democracy, rule of law, and a good economy. And we'll see how Harris distills that message for the audience here today while an official event at the White House focused on the athletic achievements of hundreds of athletes from all over the country, schools, small and large from states -- from sea to sea. We'll see exactly how she distills that message and how she fine-tunes it. Because, of course, there is an audience much bigger than the audience that's gathered here on the South Lawn to see how Harris -- how she seizes this moment, Wolf.",

And everything she says and does is now very newsworthy.It was even when she was just serving as vice president under President Biden. But now, her words really matter because the Democrats are behind the eight ball for this election. And so, when she speaks, she's speaking for the party. And I'm assuming she'll get the nomination, even if she has some opposition, which is unlikely. So, Democrats are depending on her to turn in her A-game every single time. Maybe it's not possible, but she's got to try to do it because there's ground to make up.",

      "sentences": "Yes. And I was a little too young for the 1968 Convention, which is probably the closest thing. But even then, Lyndon Johnson, the incumbent president, got out in March.I mean, look, this is a moment that Democrats understand is fraught with risk. But I think the overwhelming consensus in the party became that the risk of inaction was greater than the risk of action. Harris's floor might be lower than Biden's. This might not work out. She wasn't a great candidate in 2020 but I think the view -- overwhelming view among Democrats is that a potential ceiling is higher, that Biden was kind of dealing with frozen or cemented perceptions, an approval rating that was stuck at 40 percent or below since the summer of '23. 70 percent or more voters saying they doubted he had the capacity to do the job for another four years. And Harris is much more of a fluid situation, you know. Democrats I've talked to say that impressions of her positive or negative are pretty shallow at this point. And that gives Democrats an opportunity to kind of reset the board. Now, Republicans are rushing in to fill that, you know, space themselves, defining her as a California liberal on crime and as weak on the border. But she -- and she will have to bear the same process that Biden did in terms of discontent over inflation and his record at the border. But what she offers Democrats in the views of almost everyone I've talked to, is the ability to take the offense more than Biden. She will be on the defensive over the -- defense over the same issues, but her capacity at this point to press the offensive case against Trump, the Democratic case on rights centered on abortion, values, and democracy, is clearly much greater. People, Wolf, often cite the contrast between her remarks at the ESSENCE Fest in New Orleans when the Supreme Court gave its immunity ruling, the blank check to Trump, and Biden's own remarks two days later to give a sense of what the difference might be on the campaign trail in the weeks ahead with her rather than Biden as the nominee.",

There's no question that in 2020, she -- when she launched her campaign, it was a very different time.The same way that people are saying that Joe Biden is not the same person he was four years ago. Well, neither is Vice President Kamala Harris. She has grown leaps and bounds. And for those of us who have been -- who have been seeing her in our communities since she became vice president, she was part and parcel of the reason why Democrats did so well in 2022 and why the red wave never appeared. Because she was out talking to college students in black universities, Latino universities, universities all across the country, to young voters, to communities of color, to the people who really understood what was at stake with Roe v. Wade in 2022 And she has been doing it since then, talking about what's at stake in 2024 in terms of the contrast between what Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and now Harris for president and whoever she chooses as her VP and Donald Trump.",

And there's an opportunity.Last night, you saw members of the base -- when we talk about the coalition she's going to need to build to win this election. You saw members of the base, black women super excited around her. Well now today, she has an opportunity to talk to all women, to talk to America, to say to young girls you know, you can be a national champion and be here either because you're the first president, is first vice president, or because you're just really great at sports. And so, really tell the story of what is possible in America. And if she -- this is not a political event. This is an official event. So, she probably won't lean into much. But there's an opportunity for her to reintroduce herself and say I can be the president for all. And that's important because when people think about 2016 and Hillary Clinton, we think about the 53 percent of white women who did not go out and support Hillary Clinton and voted for Donald Trump. Today is a day she can talk to those 53 percent and say there's a place for you in the Democratic coalition, and I'm going to open the door for you.",

And to Ashley's point, I'm excited for my daughter and all young women that are going to be able to grow up and see their full possibility.But I'd love to say I would love to sort of take a step back to something Ron said. I think what's going to be interesting here now is the Republican attack lines are actually going to be her strength. They're going to attack her on being a woman. This is a current environment where the Republicans have an all-out assault on women. They've undermined Roe. The head of their party is a convicted rapist. You know, I know very well because I work for Speaker Pelosi, Donald Trump becomes unhinged when a woman actually challenges him. So, that's going to give her an advantage. But in addition to that, to Ashley's point, she is every woman. And so, women of color -- her being a person of color now is going to work to her advantage. If we were seeing sort of a lag among enthusiasm among black people, we don't see that anymore today. To Ashley's point, there was a call with 47,000 black women on the phone last night. In three hours, raised seven million dollars. So, there's huge enthusiasm around the vice president. I'm excited for her. And so now she gets to really put herself on you know, full display for the nation to see how great and brilliant she actually is.",

So, I think she's going to you know, absolutely prosecute the case. She's done it effectively very well in states and among key constituencies. That broad coalition that Joe Biden built to win in 2020. She's doing that now.But here's the other thing I would say. I would challenge her not to do what Democrats typically do. We like to win the argument and not the debate. Don't argue him point for point. Stick to big themes. He's a liar. You can't trust him. You know, he's a threat to American democracy.

But using some broad language talking about going for the gold, being a winner, and being supported by a team, it's hard not to sense the metaphors and some of the parallels in what she was saying as she embarks on this journey of her own to try to retake the narrative for the Democratic Party and trying to rally members of the party nationwide and to galvanize voters behind her candidacy.
