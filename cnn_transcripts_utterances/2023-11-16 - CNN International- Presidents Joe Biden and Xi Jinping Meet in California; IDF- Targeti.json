And perhaps President Biden knows something that we don't. But at least according to what's been publicly presented, the evidence that's been publicly presented that it is not a fact. There is nothing that shows -- at least at this stage -- anything resembling this kind of sophisticated tunnel system or command control and center underneath of the hospital. The Israelis say that there is more evidence yet to come. And even this morning the IDF spokesperson justified Israel's actions thus far by saying this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. COL. AMNON SHEFLER, ISRAELI DEFENSE FORCES SPOKESPERSON: We have already found 300 shafts that go into those tunnels, most of them booby trapped. And including in the vicinity of that hospital.

And of course, there was a lot of scrutiny on Israel, and there will be a lot of pressure on Israel to prove that the allegations that they have made thus far are in fact true.International law is complicated. And of course, like law is up for legal interpretation as well. But broadly speaking, hospitals are protected. They only lose their protected status if they are used to commit acts that are harmful to the enemy. And even if that is the case, Israel, under the Geneva Convention still has to warn them to stop doing what they're doing or give people time to have -- actually evacuate the hospital before they move in. And the Geneva Convention also says this. I'll read it. It says: The fact that sick or wounded members of the armed forces are nursed in these hospitals or the presence of small arms and ammunition taken from such combatants which have not yet been handed to the proper service, shall not be considered to be acts harmful to the enemy. Now, of course, this will be widely debated. But the bar here you can see is high. I also spoke to an expert about the Geneva Convention and hospitals not long ago. And he said look, Israel also has to take into account a range of other factors, including proportionality. And the difficulty here, Max, is that what is proportional to Israel may not be proportional to someone else. So all of this -- there is a lot of gray area surrounding all this. But the bottom line is there is certainly a lot of pressure on the Israelis to prove that they can actually find something that resembles what they've alleged.",

They're continuing to be on the site and maybe it's more complicated than what they've presented thus far.But yes, there's going to be pressure ramping up over the hours and days that come. The longer Israel goes on without presenting evidence, the more pressure that there's going to be on them. Not only on the Israelis, not only on the IDF, but I think on the United States and the West as well. Which, you know, if you look at, say, many leaders across the Middle East, including President Erdogan, they say that the West is really embolden Israeli actions by sort of giving them carte blanche to do whatever they like. Obviously, leaders like Biden have said that they need to be careful and so on and so forth.

Activists refute that account, saying the protests were peaceful, but police attacked them with pepper spray. Some house office buildings on Capitol Hill were temporarily locked down during that protest that that you see. Now, when Hamas militants broke through the border fence and began the terror attack on October the 7th, many of them were wearing GoPro cameras to document that assault. Some of these videos were then shared as Hamas propaganda, but not all of them. CNN has obtained video from one of these cameras from the Israeli military.

A number of Republicans, particularly people on Speaker Johnson's right flank, were concerned, were critical, highly critical of his decision not to include spending cuts in his plan. That's because if he included spending cuts, Democrats in the Senate and the White House would not go for it. Therefore, Johnson decided to essentially pick a fight with his right flank. And now members on that hard right bloc are warning him not to do it again. REP. CHIP ROY (R-TX): Well, I mean, I think that's sort of like strike one and two and the swamp won.

Under Speaker Johnson's very brief tenure, there are three annual spending bills that essentially had to get pulled from the House floor because of divisions within the ranks. So the question is, when Johnson has confronted these issues early next year, how does he was -- how does he resolve it? And will his fate be similar to what happened to Kevin McCarthy, who had to push along short-term stopgap bill without spending cuts, lead to the end of his speakership? That's a concern potentially down the line for Speaker Johnson as Congress decides to punt on this issue of government funding, avoiding a shutdown, but only for now. Manu Raju, CNN, Capitol Hill.
