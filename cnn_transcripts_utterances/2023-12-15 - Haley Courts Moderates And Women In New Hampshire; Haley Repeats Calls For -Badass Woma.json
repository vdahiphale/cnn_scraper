Just one month until caucus day, Republican candidates beginning their final push to winover voters and try to take down frontrunner Donald Trump in the Hawkeye State. Plus, polls show many Americans simply don't want a Biden-Trump rematch, and they're looking harder than perhaps they usually do at independent and third-party candidates. One of them is Robert F. Kennedy Jr. He will join me live for a wide ranging interview on set in just a few minutes. Good day, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt to our viewers watching in the United States and around the world. It's 11 a.m. here in Washington, Friday, December 15, one month, just 31 days from the Iowa caucuses, 325 days from Election Day. This is today's State of the Race. Welcome in. Right now, as we've said, just one month away from the Republican caucuses in Iowa. Donald Trump's challengers are still scrambling to figure out how to make any sort of dent in his massive polling lead. Nikki Haley heads back to the Hawkeye State this weekend after she picked up the endorsement of New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu. She is hoping to appeal to women and moderates, and that hopefully he can make some movement in the polls. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The tone at the top has been damaging. We see it in the extreme things that we're seeing in the Republican Party. We see it in extreme things we're seeing in the Democrat Party. There are no saints in D.C. right now. Right? But, that's why I think you need a badass woman in charge at the White House.

JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Look, a lot of eyes are on Nikki Haley. She had a good endorsement this week from Governor Chris Sununu. But, one thing I've noticed covering her rallies over the last couple of months, there are a lot of women at her rallies, women bringing their daughters. And it's interesting because it's something that she never talks about overtly. We heard her say a badass woman in charge in the White House. That's the only time she has really mentioned, and that was in response to a question about why are so many politicians getting arrested and charged from George Santos and Donald Trump's?

So, I thought that was really interesting, because the more these ideas get out there, I think we'll see whether or not that 20 percent and 16 percent actually holds. The other thing I would just remind us is Jill Stein who got on the ballot in just a handful of states that actually ended up costing Hillary the election. So, when we talk about him getting on a -- as Jeff just said, a couple of states and kind of making trouble, that's the kind of trouble we're talking about.",
