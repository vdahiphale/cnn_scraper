The agreement means ABC, ESPN and other popular networks are back on the satellite provider. The company said the deal included new offerings for customers, including new combo packages for their streaming services with Disney Plus, Hulu and ESPN Plus. Home Depot will pay almost $2 million to settle a lawsuit for overcharging customers. The complaint alleged that customers were charged more at checkout than the listed prices.

The chair of the board will be accompanied by members of the board. There's a total of six, all with specific expertise in marine affairs, engineering, technical aspects, legal requirements. There'll be a court recorder. The chair of the marine board will swear in all the witnesses. So all of the testimony. Is under oath witnesses are allowed to be represented by council.

It's not that the Coast Guard doesn't have experience with submersibles, the Coast Guard became involved with them actually, all the way back to the mid-80s. When the first U.S. based submersibles started operating in relatively shallow water in the U.S. Virgin Islands and the Coast Guard has published certification guidance for submersibles beginning in the early 90s. And that type of guidance covers things like design construction. operation, licensing, emergency procedures, things like that. But the fact remains that there are far fewer submersible than surface vessels. The Coast Guard does, about 5,000 investigations in a typical year, and most of those are very small. They don't take a lot of time. They're almost all surface vessels of some type, but only the most significant incidents are designated with a Marine Board of Investigation, as is the case here. So, in part, it's unusual because it's a submersible, but also because it was in very deep water. Almost 1,000 miles to see from New England.

Last week, local and state election officials wrote a letter to the U.S. Postalmaster, General Louis DeJoy, listing systemic issues with election mail over the past year, including ballots that were mailed on time, being delayed, or lost. While others were wrongly marked as undeliverable.Joining us now is Amy Cohen, Executive Director of the National Association of State Election Directors. One of the groups that sent that letter. Amy, thank you so much for joining us. Let me actually start with reading a portion from that letter. And here it goes, in nearly every state, local election officials are receiving timely postmarked ballots well after election day. Election officials in multiple states report receiving anywhere from dozens to hundreds of ballots 10 or more days after postmark. Amy, with the way that things are right now, is your organization saying that there will undoubtedly be voters whose votes won't be counted come November through no fault of their own?",

So, if you're planning to vote by mail, and it's still an option that a lot of people are going to leverage, but if you're planning to do that, you need to return your ballot early, request it early, if that's something that you need to do where you live, and leverage tools available where you live, like ballot tracking, both to you and back to your election office.And if you're within, say, seven to 10 days of the election, I would look into what other options are available to you to return your ballot. Those options vary by state. Some states have drop boxes. Some states, you can return that ballot in person, but voters really need to be proactive to make sure that their ballots will be tabulated.",

That's the one that's starting to spread into the Carolinas, but from an entirely separate system.Now, both of them have the potential to cause some flooding. That's why you've got flood watches, flood advisories, coastal flood warnings in effect for both of those particular regions. You also have the flooding potential from coastal flooding, from all of that water being pushed inland. So, you've got rip currents, high surf advisories, all of this up and down the coast, especially because Tuesday comes the full moon. So, you're going to see more exacerbated flooding concerns along the coast as we make our way through the next 48 hours. And that spreads even all the way up onto Coastal portions of Virginia. Now, that secondary system, this is it. So, it's still offshore, but it's really expected to start to surge a lot of that moisture inland over the next 24 to 48 hours. Now, that system itself has about a 50 percent chance of becoming the next named tropical system. The next name on the list is Helene. The concern really is it's expected to make landfall in the next 24 to 48 hours. So, can it strengthen quick enough to really produce that -- to get that next name on the list? The system, once it moves inland, will then slide up the East Coast, impacting heavy rain for areas of the mid-Atlantic and eventually into the southeast.",
