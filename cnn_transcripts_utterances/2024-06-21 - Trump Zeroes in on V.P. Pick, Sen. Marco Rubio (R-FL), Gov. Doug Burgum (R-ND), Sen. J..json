Tonight, family, friends, and MAGA countrymen are all playing the ponies, except the horses are men, three men. New CNN reporting shows the constant cajoling and lobbying and pleading from people in Donald Trump's orbit to pick their guy to run alongside Trump atop the ticket. The short list is seemingly shorter now, Marco Rubio, J.D. Vance, and Doug Burgum. They are all reportedly at the top of the list of Trump's choices to tap. Now, that doesn't mean that the others are ruled out, including Tim Scott, Elise Stefanik, Byron Donalds, Ben Carson, who will join me later on this show. All of them, CNN is told, have received some level of vetting paperwork. And the Veepstakes power rankings are in constant flux, according to our sources. Why? Well, it depends on Trump's mood, of course, and it depends on how Trump thinks everyone in his V.P. casting call is performing on television, quote, their standing really depends on the day, who he speaks with, and who he sees on T.V. Let's bring in CNN's Senior Data Reporter Harry Enten. Harry, so walk us through it. We've got three contenders. What are the pros and cons of each of them?",

      "sentences": "Yes, we'll walk you through the three of them. We'll start off with Marco Rubio from the state of Florida. All right, what are the pros for Marco Rubio? Well, we know that Trump wants to outreach. He's doing better with Hispanic voters. Marco Rubio could help with that. How about foreign policy chops? Marco Rubio can help with that as well. Donald Trump, of course, the businessman, not necessarily known for his foreign policy chops. Marco Rubio can help there.What are the cons though of Marco Rubio? Well, he lives in Florida, Trump's home state. So, you know, you can't have a V.P. and a pres being from the same state. So, he'd have to quit the Senate, maybe try and move somewhere else. So, that's a whole issue. And of course, there's this 2016 failed presidential bid where, of course, he and Trump went after each other quite often. So, there are pros and cons with Marco Rubio. How about Doug Burgum, who's, of course, a governor from North Dakota? Well, what are the pros? Well, he is no drama. I mean, there's not really a whole heck of a lot you could kind of throw onto Doug Burgum. More than that, you know, Donald Trump, not exactly known as being establishment friendly. Well, Doug Burgum is pretty well liked by the establishment, specifically the business establishment. What are the cons for Doug Burgum? Well, first off, who is Doug Burgum? Most folks have no real idea who he is. He wouldn't exactly be an exciting pick for the base. And, of course, he failed in his own presidential bid earlier this year, so he doesn't exactly have that great of an electoral track record, nationally speaking. Finally, let's go to the state of Ohio and J.D. Vance, all right? Pros, well, he's a populist, just like Donald Trump. I think he could really excite the populist base of the Republican Party. Also, if you're looking for someone who might play decently well in swing states, like Pennsylvania and Michigan, well, Ohio, if you know your map, is pretty close to both of those. How about the cons? Well, he's untested nationally. Who knows how he'll actually do when the lights are shined upon him. And, finally, there's 2016 opposition to Trump. He was very much against Trump. It'd be very interesting to see some of those tapes played if, in fact, he was chosen, Abby.",

Actually, that would describe a lot of folks. This time around, because he served as president, I don't think that he needs someone with governmental experience. I just think that he needs someone who gives him an edge, somebody who's going to bring something to the table.

Because each one of these three, and in particular, you'll remember, of course, Marco Rubio, all the things that were said between them, it got vicious, right, when they were opponents on that state back in 2016.
