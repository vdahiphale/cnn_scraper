      "sentences": "OUTFRONT next, as we await Chris Christie's formal announcement that he's running for president which will be bringing to you, we have breaking news right now in the Trump investigation. Mark Meadows was testifying. Trump's former chief of staff has now testified, we understand before a federal grand jury investigating Trump, and we are learning the special counsel is now using a grand jury in Florida as well. We've got a lot of details for you tonight breaking.And disaster in Ukraine, now a dangerous blame game of who is behind the destruction of a crucial dam, a breach unleashing deadly floodwaters, and now threatening the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. Plus, the PGA Tour sells out to the Saudis. Is professional soccer about to be next? Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, the breaking news, Trump's former chief of staff testifying. CNN confirming that Mark Meadows has testified before a federal grand jury investigating Trump. Meadows is a key figure in the two investigations related to the former president. The probe into Trump's efforts to cling to power, and to overturn the 2020 election results, and the investigation into Trump's handling of classified documents. Now, you may remember, according to the January 6th Committee, Meadows was helping to lay the groundwork for Trump's big lie. He received this text message from a lawmaker on November 4th, the day after the election, saying, here's an aggressive strategy, why can't the states of Georgia, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania and other are controlled state houses, declare this is B.S. And then the explanation, where conflicts and elections not called that night. Just send their own electors to vote, and have a go to the SCOTUS, Supreme Court. Well, you know, it's interesting that was sent, right, because so much of that plan actually did go into motion. And Meadows was there with Trump through all of. He knows so much when it comes to material seized at Mar-a-Lago. He was with Trump in the final days of his presidency. He was also formally appointed by Trump to oversee presidential records. So, on every front, from January six to the efforts to overturn the election, to the classified documents. He is front and center. And this major development comes as we are learning the special counsel is now using another grand jury based in Florida, as part of its investigation into Trump's handling of classified documents. The Florida grand jury has heard testimony from multiple witnesses, and according to \"The New York Times\", the grand jury in Washington appears to have actually stopped hearing witness testimony. So this is a significant development. Now you've got all of this going on in Florida, what does it mean? And we understand that testimony, according to \"The New York Times\", includes 20 members of Trump's Secret Service security detail, in that Florida grand jury testifying. Twenty. I mean, 20 people, we did know and about anything yesterday. So much to get to tonight, as all signs point to the special counsel's investigation into the classified documents portion of this, at least, wrapping up. Evan Perez and Kristen Holmes are both standing by, they have new reporting here. So, Kristen, I want to start with you. You obviously have the significant breaking news on Mark Meadows. What do you understand happened, and what did Mark Meadows do as he testified before the federal grand jury?",

And so, the fact that they've gone back there, and they've gone back there recently for a number of witnesses. Sources are telling Kaitlan Collins that there is a witness, we know of a witness that's going in as soon as tomorrow in Miami. That's the southern district of Florida, and that there is another witness who at least who is also scheduled to come in after that person.So, it's not clear exactly why the prosecutors have chosen to start using this grand jury after spending months use in the grand jury here in Washington. We know that they've had a grand jury that has been hearing testimony on the Mar-a-Lago documents. That grand jury here in Washington hasn't met since about this time last month. And so, it's certainly a very dramatic turn of events for them to be bringing these witnesses here to provide testimony, rather before a grand jury down in Miami. You know, a couple of reasons could occur to us for why this could be, and one of them could be that simply, they have perhaps someone who they want to charge, who is accused, or they believe committed a crime in that jurisdiction. And they can't bring it here in Washington. So, that might be one reason to have somebody below the level of Donald Trump, who may have they believe, committed a crime down there. And so that's the reason why they want to bring those witnesses in that jurisdiction. Again, these are, all of the impressions that we have, that we hope Jacks Smith is going to be able to provide some answers to in the coming days and weeks.",

So, Ty, you've been saying for a long time, in our conversations we've had, that you believe that Meadows is cooperating. Now we know he has appeared before the grand jury, what do you say tonight? TY COBB, FORMER TRUMP WHITE HOUSE LAWYER (via telephone):  So I believe that he testified shortly after the judge issued the order in March, rejecting Trump's claims of -- executive privilege. But I also believe that, it's possible he's testified more than once, given the vast knowledge that he has, as you highlighted, in your introduction. The process throughout has been one where either there is a lot of news, early on about Meadows, his cooperation with January 6th, with contempt referral. And when justice abandoned the contempt referral, that was an indication that there was a possibility that Meadows had initiated cooperation. And certainly, the information that you have today, again suggests that he has cooperated. It is conceivable that he's being forced to testify, and only given qualified immunity. I doubt that -- I believe Meadows has been given full immunity, and has to deal with the Justice Department, and that will be very -- in terms of debunking many of the claims we've heard out of the White House about what happened in those important hours, as people tried to prevent democracy from proceeding as it is supposed to, post-election.",

I appreciate your perspective on these breaking developments tonight.And let's go now to Ryan Goodman, former special counsel of the Defense Department, along with Karen Friedman Agnifilo, the former chief assistant district attorney of the Manhattan D.A.'s office. Thanks to both. So, Ryan, okay, we obviously don't know exactly what he said. You heard tie believe he's got full, would've been giving full immunity, and therefore would have chosen to answer questions. How significant do you think this development is? RYAN GOODMAN, FORMER SPECIAL COUNSEL AT DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE:  I think it's hugely significant. We can just recalled at one of the staffers to the January 6th Committee on CNN, Dan Riggleman, said that Meadows was the MVP, because he provided the playbook for the efforts to overturn the judge the efforts of January 6 to overturn the 2020 election, and that's just Meadows text. So then he stopped cooperating. Now, if he's fully cooperating with the Justice Department and providing testimony, he has a wealth of information. I'd say the keys to the kingdom, on the efforts to overturn the 2020 election, what Ty just talked about. He was key with the false slate electors. He, according to Cassidy Hutchinson's testimony, he accumulated charts of all of the electors. He had multiple dozens of meetings, and phone calls about it. So he was -- president Trump in that instance. And then he's also central to the efforts to use the justice department to try to overturn the election in Georgia, and elsewhere.",

But, you know, it's been very clear that Trump did not know what was happening, that he's gone very quiet into the Trump team.And so I think this really shows that he has testified -- I will go a little bit further than even what Ryan saying, you know, his lawyer, Mr. Terwilliger, made a statement today about meadows testimony, that without commenting on whether or not he testified, he's maintained a commitment to tell the truth, where he has a legal obligation. To me, that suggests that he testified rather than invoking the Fifth. So, if he's in there giving testimony, and telling the truth where he has a legal obligation. And as Ryan, says he has the keys to the kingdom. I think there is no doubt that there will be charges forthcoming in the January 6th case in particular, because that is where Meadows I think is key.",

They would give him immunity because he could go -- he could give them access to the star suspect. That's the reason that you would give somebody immunity who otherwise has a lot of criminal jeopardy on his own. That's the deal, and so that's enormously significant he's cooperating.",

I should say, no known activity in about a month. What does all of that say? GOODMAN:  It strongly suggests that that part of the case is closed, and that they are finished. And that they're -- the next step would be, in all likelihood, based on the evidence we have, reading the tea leaves, that Jack Smith will go to attorney general garland, recommend an indictment, so that they would then return to the grand jury to propose an indictment. What would be the final step before that? Meeting and allowing a meeting to take place with Trump's attorneys to give an opportunity to try to say why they should not indict their client.

He appoints three Supreme Court justices. He defends religious liberty, stands up for the sanctity of human life. There's a lot of things that he did that people are going to applaud him for, but I think that poll is indicative of that.

Massive flooding quickly inundating villages on both shores of the mighty Dnipro River, impacting areas controlled by Ukrainians and by the Russians.

An angry Ukrainian president saying that the Russians are trying to de-real Ukraine's current battlefield gains. It was mined by the Russian occupiers, he says, and they blew it up. This once again demonstrates the cynicism with which Russia treats the people whose land as captured. The destruction of the dam comes as Ukrainian forces have been making gains on the battlefield, with what some believe may be the early stages of Kyiv's long awaited counteroffensive, even though the Ukrainians have not confirmed that. Russia's army denies playing up the dam, instead blaming the Ukrainians. Aiming to prevent the offensive operations by the Russian army on the section at the front line, they keep regime committed an act of sabotage or other a terrorist act, the defense minister said.

I think there are two things that our viewers need to be aware of. On the one hand, those floodwaters are racing extremely quickly. We were on the ground there today for a short period of time, and the water went up considerably. And the other thing is that the Russian army is close to this place. There is constant shelling going on here. In fact, as I'm speaking to you right now, I'm hearing those studs in the distance. This comes after Ukrainian officials believe that more than a thousand houses are underwater just in the Ukraine of territory of the flood zone -- Erin.",

So, we cannot confirm or deny that this would have been the direction at the counteroffensive but the fact that it definitely diverts efforts from the military side to the humanitarian aid, which has also been provided from the military personnel on the south right now, that is definitely can be confirmed.
