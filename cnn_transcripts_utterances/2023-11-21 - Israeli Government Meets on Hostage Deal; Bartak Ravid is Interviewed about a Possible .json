And the word also now from two Israeli sources. A hostage deal could be announced as soon as today. There seems to be a lot of moving parts and a lot of things happening at one in this moment. This is the latest on the urgent and painstaking work to get 50 of the 200 plus hostages released. Innocent civilians who were kidnapped on October 7th by Hamas terrorists and have now been held in Gaza for some 46 days. Here's what John Kirby said from the White House about all this.

Overnight, the political chief for Hamas claimed that they are, in their words, close to reaching a truce agreement with Israel, however much weight you want to put on anything a Hamas leader says.Let's start at the White House right now.

      "sentences": "Well, Kate, a deal is very close. We are told by sources that an announcement on a deal is on the cusp of being made, and that Hamas would release 50 hostages, women and children, that they are holding in Gaza, in exchange for four to five days of a pause in fighting and that three Palestinian prisoners would be exchanged for every hostage that is released. We are also told that during the pause Hamas would stop flying surveillance drones over northern Gaza for at least six hours a day. And the hostages, we are told, are of various nationalities. U.S. officials are hope that one of the 50 hostages that are initially released will be three-year-old Abigail Edan. She is the youngest- known American hostages whose parents were killed by Hamas. Again, officials are hopeful that she will be among the hostages released.And Hamas is going to gather up, the idea is, additional hostages, women and children, during the period of four to five days that the fighting is paused. And if they are successfully able to do so, that pause could be extended for a period of time. Now, as we have been reporting, Hamas has insisted that hundreds of aid -- trucks of aid will be able to go into Gaza. This, of course, has been very contentious because a big part of what they are looking for is fuel. Fuel which is used for its military operations, like ventilating its underground tunnels. So, we will have to see when and if the deal is announced, where things stand in terms of the number of trucks that are able to go in. U.S. officials, of course, and others have been pushing for as much humanitarian aid to go into Gaza as possible. But again, Kate, we've been reporting on these negotiations for a number of weeks. But this morning we are sensing really a different level of optimism with sources saying that this is a deal that could be announced as early as today. Kate.",

      "sentences": "There is a process in place until Israeli law for what it takes to approve a deal like this and for it to approve the release of Palestinians prisoners from Israeli jails. And from what we're seeing here, from a statement from the prime minister's office, that process set to begin here in just a couple of hours.It is 4:00 p.m. local time. The war cabinet here, which is a very tight-knit circle around Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a small circle, will meet at 6:00 p.m. to discuss an issue. And I'll quote their wording here, \"in light of developments on the issue of the release of hostages.\" Then shortly after that, the security cabinet will meet an hour later, at 7:00 p.m. local time. And then the full government at 8:00 this evening. We would expect Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would, at some point, make a statement, making clear what this is all about. But given the topic, given the issue - given what we're seeing in the schedule and given what we're hearing from multiple officials on the U.S. side and on the Israeli side, this could be the beginning of the process to release Palestinian prisoners in exchange for Israeli hostages held in Gaza. As MJ said, the first tranche would be 50 - 50 prisoners held by Hamas, women and children. And it's worth noting that that might include citizens from other countries as well who have been taken hostage, in addition to Israelis, in exchange for three times as many, so 150 Palestinian women and children, held in Israeli jails. If that works, there might be an extension of the pause in the fighting and a greater release of hostages held in Gaza, but that would take time. Hamas would have to round up other hostages who are not necessarily held only by Hamas, to see where they are, to find out where they have been, and to bring them out of Gaza. Meanwhile, we had a chance to speak with the families of the hostages who are frustrated that they only, last night, had their first meeting with the war cabinet. They have demanded answers. And, crucially, they have demanded that the number one priority for the war cabinet is securing the release of the hostages One man we spoke with who was in that meeting said there was quite a bit of anger when the government wouldn't acknowledge that the war cabinet wouldn't say that issue was number one. Instead they said it is on equal footing with the defeat of Hamas. That is absolutely not what those families want to here, even if an announcement on the release of some of the hostages is imminent. JIMENEZ: And even with this announcement, obviously there are still delicate procedures to play out. It's expected at this point. And I can imagine, as we look at multiple parties, not just in Israel, not just on the Hamas side, not just on the United States side but in Qatar as well, everybody is trying to make sure that this actually goes -- basically moves through to fruition. And that's why we have CNN's Becky Anderson with us now from Doha. So, Becky, can you explain to us what Qatar's involvement is here, and what more are you learning on that end?",

Again, Israeli officials think that Hamas knows exactly where those hostages are.But Hamas says, you know, we don't want you to spy -- spy on us, and then seen where the hostages are, and then just go and get them yourselves and not as part of this deal.

But they're not going to stop the war.And what I hear from every Israeli official I spoke to in recent days, this is going to be a pause. This is not going to be a cease-fire. And the Israeli military already approved plans for operations in southern Gaza, in Khan Younis, in Rafah, in areas that they did not operate so far.

If after those two days Hamas comes again and says, oh, you know what, I have another 20, they'll get another two days. But I don't think it's going to be much more than that.And, honestly, I find it hard to believe -- I hope I'm wrong, but I find it hard to believe that we will see, in the immediate term, a phase two of this deal.
