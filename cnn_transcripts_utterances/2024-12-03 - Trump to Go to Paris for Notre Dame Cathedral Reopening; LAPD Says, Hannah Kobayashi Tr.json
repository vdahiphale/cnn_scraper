With his second inauguration still weeks away, he's headed to France this weekend for the grand reopening of the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris five years after that horrible fire. French President Emmanuel Macron extended the invitation to this, what is going to be a star studded VIP event and also in what will be Trump's first foreign trip since winning the election.Macron's invite is also the latest move by foreign leaders, especially European powers, trying to position themselves as Trump's go-to European ally. If they're making nice on one hand, on the other hand, Donald Trump is very clearly trying to put them all on notice with his trade war threats, his NATO hesitancy, his isolationist tendencies when it comes to Ukraine. Donald Trump isn't waiting to reenter the Oval Office to jump back into foreign policy. Overnight, he laid down another new red line, warning that there will be, quote, hell to pay in the Middle East if Hamas does not release hostages from Gaza before inauguration day. Let's start with CNN's Steve Contorno. He's joining us now, tracking all of it for us. Steve, what is Donald Trump saying about this trip?",

He said that Macron has, quote, restored -- done a wonderful job ensuring that Notre Dame has been restored to its full level of glory and even more so, putting that Trumpian flair on his Truth Social post there.And as you mentioned, this is coming at the end of a three-week stretch where Trump has already inserted himself back into foreign policy to a really unparalleled degree. He has threatened Canada and Mexico with tariffs. He has met with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at Mar-a-Lago to discuss that threat. He has spoken to the Mexican president about closing the border. He has spoken with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy. He has said there would be, quote, hell to pay if hostages in Gaza are not released. He has hosted the Argentinean president at Mar-a-Lago, and he has threatened a 100 percent tariff on a group of countries, including Russia and China, if they start to try to create a currency to rival the U.S. dollar. So, just a really unprecedented step back out onto the world stage for Donald Trump, and now this first foreign trip will really be the icing on the cake.",

      "sentences": "Yes. I mean, Hegseth has really been blitzing Capitol Hill trying to meet with as many lawmakers as possible as he tries to defend himself against some of these questions about his past actions. He has a really important meeting today on Capitol Hill with Representative Shelley Moore Capito. She is a Republican woman from West Virginia. And we asked her last night about what she wanted to hear from Hegseth. And, you know, she said a lot of these issues she expects are going to come up, that they're going to have the conversation about them.You know, when lawmakers get out of these meetings, it really depends on sort of how close they are with Donald Trump, whether or not they talk about these meetings. But we heard yesterday from Tommy Tuberville. He came out and said he had a really strong meeting with Pete Hegseth. Meanwhile, others are also expected to continue meeting with senators as part of their confirmation process, including Tulsi Gabbard, as well as Pam Bondi are going to be on Capitol Hill this week. But there's really a mounting question right now that is happening where you have Republicans who are sort of torn about whether or not they need to see these FBI background checks as part of this vetting process. Yesterday, I talked with Senator Susan Collins of Maine about Kash Patel, whether or not she thought he was a good pick. This is what she said. She said, quote, I don't know Kash Patel. I had heard his name, but I don't know his background and I'm going to have to do a lot of work before reaching a decision on him. And she made clear that background checks should be a part of that vetting process. Then you had Senator John Thune, the incoming Republican leader, saying this, quote, my job is to make sure the nominees have a thorough, fair process, and, ultimately, you know, our members will decide. Historically, the best place to get this done has been through the FBI, Thune said. Now, there are others like Senator Mike Crapo, who is a Republican who will lead the Finance Committee in the new year. He said it's really up to the president to decide whether or not he needs those FBI checks. But, obviously, senators have a lot of questions on some of these nominees and their backgrounds. And as Thune said, the FBI background checks are traditionally the process to get that information the most quickly to lawmakers. John?",

They say that they have been kept in the dark about this situation, and we spoke with them over the weekend to her sister, Sydni, who said that she was frustrated with the way that this investigation was conducted.

      "sentences": "Well, good morning, John. Look, this is a case of campaign promises colliding with reality. Wall Street does not believe that the looming immigration crackdown under Trump will live up to the hype.So, Goldman Sachs surveyed more than 500 economists, and they do expect immigration to come down under Trump. But look at this, just 6 percent say immigration will go negative under Trump, and that's basically what would have to happen in order for him to keep his promise of deporting millions and millions and millions of undocumented people. The vast majority, over 70 percent, say that immigration will still be above 500,000 per year under Trump. For some context, pre-COVID, the pace was around 1 million per year. So, again, slower, but not nearly as big of a crackdown as Trump has promised. Why is this? Well, Goldman Sachs economists say there's two big reasons, one, because there are legal limits and, two, because there are logistical limits to executive action and those limits will likely slow down the pace of deportations. Now, this will come as a relief to business owners who warn that deporting millions of people could starve them of workers. Look, I mean, undocumented people are a key part of this economy, right? They are cooking meals in restaurants, building homes, and they're picking crops on farms. The USDA found that a plurality of farm workers in America, 41 percent are on unauthorized. And experts have warned that if you deport all of these crop workers, they're going to send grocery prices even higher. John, we should note, just because investors are saying that the immigration crack down isn't going to live up to the hype, it doesn't mean they're right, but I do think this helps to explain why investors are basically shrugging off all these inflation warnings about the Trump agenda. They don't believe that mass deportations are going to happen.",

But investors think that's not going to happen. Only 10 percent of investors polled by Goldman Sachs say that Musk's commission will be able to cut more than $400 billion a year.Of course, John, the problem is that so much government spending is tied up in areas that you really can't touch, right? You have to pay interest on government's mountain of debt. You can't touch that. That's almost a trillion dollars. You have defense spending. That's nearly a trillion dollars. And then there's all those entitlement programs, Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare. That's $3 trillion there. All of this explains why former Bush economist Glenn Hubbard said it's just mathematically impossible to find $2 trillion. So, again, that's just think spending coming down but probably not to the degree that Musk has suggested.",
