Tonight, we start at the G7 Summitin Italy where any moment now, U.S. President Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will hold a joint news conference to announce a major security pact between the two countries. Now, under the deal, the United States would train Ukraine's forces for ten years. Earlier, Mr. Zelenskyy described the agreement as unprecedented. A senior administration official tells CNN the group of seven leaders agreed to a $50 billion loan package for Kyiv that would be financed from the interests from the frozen Russian investments. We'll bring you those remarks from the two presidents as soon as they begin. For now, we're joined by CNN's Kevin Liptak at the White House and senior correspondent, Melissa Bell in Paris. Kevin, let's start with you. What are we expecting to hear more from the president? I would imagine specifics on this ten-year as President Zelenskyy noted, ten-year unprecedented joint pact between these two countries.",

      "sentences": "Yes, and this deal is really meant to signal long-term American support for Ukraine, it includes provisionslike helping Ukraine modernize its arsenal, helping Ukraine train some of its soldiers. I think the big question that's hanging over this deal is whether it will actually last ten years or whether it will last ten months until the potential end of President Biden's term if President Trump were to return to the White House. There's no guarantee that he couldn't just rip up this agreement, and he is obviously known to be a skeptic of support for Ukraine. He is a skeptic of NATO, so, I think what you're seeing President Biden trying to do is demonstrate certainly American support for now, try and put into writing some of these provisions that he thinks are important for long-term support for Ukraine. But certainly, there's no guarantee that, that will be stuck to by the American President going forward. I think when you look at it from the Ukrainian perspective, certainly Zelenskyy is saying that this is unprecedented. It does stop-short of the Ukrainians ultimate goal of joining NATO. This is something that certainly falls well short of that. There's no collective defense part of this agreement, it would not require American troops on the ground to come to the Ukrainian's defense. But it is something that I think President Biden can point to along with the other G7 leaders in trying to demonstrate this solid, a western support for Ukraine at a moment when some of that is being questioned, at a moment when Russia seems to have gained some of the momentum on the battlefield in part because of the delay in American support that was caused by Republicans and Congress. And I think President Biden, when he comes out here to speak alongside Zelenskyy, will want to show and want to demonstrate that he's committed in the long term, but certainly, some of those promises are not really his to make if this election were to be won by Trump in November.",

The United States initially had been trying to get all of it basically to pay for rebuilding Ukraine.

So, finally, some much-needed funding this year going to Ukraine that's been desperate for it for many months now. Thank you so much Melissa and Kevin, we appreciate it. We're pleased to welcome in Kurt Volker; former U.S. ambassador to NATO, along with CNN politics reporter Stephen Collinson, welcome both of you. Ambassador, let me start with you because this ten-year security agreement that we're expected to hear more details about from President Biden and President Zelenskyy. Yes, they say it's unprecedented, but it's clear that the elephant in the room is trying to Trump-proof any sort of future alliances and commitments between the United States and Ukraine and to a lesser extent, Europe, and Ukraine as well, given the results of some of the parliamentary elections that we've seen, a lot of these leaders in the G7 nations now are on shaky ground, to say the least. I want to tell you or tell our viewers and have you respond to how Jake Sullivan; the current national security adviser described the security pack. He said \"it would send Russia, a quote, 'signal of our resolve if Vladimir Putin thinks that he can outlast a coalition supporting Ukraine. He's wrong, he just cannot wait us out.'\" Now, take that and then I'd like for you to hear what one of your former colleagues, national security adviser Ambassador John Bolton told me in the last hour in response to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN BOLTON, FORMER U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER:  Nobody should have that under any illusions if Trump is inaugurated at noon on the 20th of January next year by about 5:00 afternoon, he could -- he could have dissolved this agreement in its entirety. So, if you can't bind a future president who doesn't want to be bound, and that includes getting out of treaties, which this isn't even a treaty. I think there may actually be a bit of a downside here when Trump hears about this and concludes they're trying to lock him in, that will just make him more irritated. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And we just need to look at the substance. The substance here is that the one thing that Vladimir Putin knows, respects and doesn't mess with is NATO. He knows not to attack NATO countries. And what we're doing with his bilateral security arrangement with Ukraine is trying to find a way to give them some assurance about our support for them without letting them into NATO. And this is something Vladimir Putin has got to notice, and he's going to say, OK, so, you're not giving them a legally-binding commitment, not committing to guarantee their security. You're not letting them into NATO. So, what does this really do? And I think he's going to test it. Now, I understand the difficulties of a NATO invitation right now, but we've got to be signaling, just as Jake Sullivan said, I think his message over there was right. The message we want to send to Vladimir Putin is that he cannot win, we have the resolve, this will never work out in his favor. Unfortunately, I just don't think a bilateral, non-legally binding, non-treaty commitment, security, you know, arrangement like this is going to do the job.",

That did not happen. What we saw instead was national politics played out in preferences in the way people voted in the European parliamentary elections. So, in the case of Germany, Chancellor Scholz, very unpopular, that led to a resurgence for the center-right party in Germany, the CDU. The AFD, the far-right, they also did well, but the CDU did better. If you look at the overall EU parliamentary result, the European People's Party, the stable center-right, Ursula von der Leyen's base of support, they did better than they were in the previous election. So, it wasn't this wave of far-right-ism. However, you did see a few specific cases. In the case of Italy, Giorgia Meloni's party, which has been a pro-trans-Atlantic rightist movement, they did very well. In the case of France, President Macron, he did very poorly and the anti-Europe, anti-NATO, far-right in France, they did well. Not so much in Germany, the center right did the best there. And when you look at the U.K., the trend is exactly the opposite, the Tories are about to lose power, and you're going to see the Labor Party, the center-left coming to power in the U.K. So, this wave of populist, far-right-ism in Europe, that was supposed to happen in these European elections, it didn't happen.",

And then the Biden administration saying that, that conflicts with a federal law, which requires doctors in emergency rooms to take all necessary precautions in order to prevent serious injury to a woman. And the Biden administration argues that includes abortion, they're saying it conflicts with the state law, so, the Supreme Court will have to decide if Idaho's law really severely restricting abortion can stand in the face of this federal law.

I think we'llsee a further justification as we did at the D-Day, 80th anniversary commemorations last week. about U.S. support for Ukraine, the importance, as the ambassador was talking about, about stopping Russia's advances in Ukraine and not allowing them to go further. And it will be -- not to introduce a domestic point here, but it will be the first time that the president has held a press conference since the conviction of his son, Hunter Biden, this week on gun related charges. He became the first child of a sitting president to be convicted of a crime. This has been something that's been weighing very heavily on the president. So, I don't think it would be surprising if a member of the U.S. White House press corps were to throw in a question about that as well, to try and get some reaction on camera, because this is obviously a very personal and political moment for the president. And everything that he says will be refracted back through this domestic lens, because he's in the middle of a very intense election campaign, as we've been saying with Former President Donald Trump. Everything he does is used by his campaign in some way or another to turn the focus against Trump, to argue that the former president is unfit for a return to the Oval Office. So, there are multiple dimensions politically and diplomatically going on here in this press conference.",
