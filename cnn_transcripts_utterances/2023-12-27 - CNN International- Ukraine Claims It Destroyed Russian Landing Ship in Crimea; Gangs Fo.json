      "sentences": "Welcome back to CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Bianca Nobilo. And if you're just joining us, let me bring you up to date with our top stories this hour.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas are expected to meet with the Mexican president today as thousands of migrants have joined a caravan headed for the border between the two countries. South Korean actor Lee Sun-kyun, known for his role in \"Parasite\", has been found dead and police say that suicide is suspected. His agency says the funeral will be held quietly with family members and colleagues. The Ukrainian military claims it destroyed a Russian navy landing ship in Crimea in an overnight strike on Tuesday. You can see that massive explosion there. CNN has not been able to independently verify that it was destroyed. The Russian defense ministry doesn't say the ship was destroyed but does admit that it was damaged in the Ukrainian attack. Meantime, Ukraine's top general says Ukrainian forces have now withdrawn to the outskirts of Marinka, a strategically important village in the eastern Donetsk region. He compared the fighting in Marinka to the battle for Bakhmut. For more now, CNN Portugal's Helena Lins joins us live from Kyiv in Ukraine. Helena, obviously this explosion in Crimea could be a huge success for the Ukrainians and it's distracting, but let's focus on what's happening on the battlefield. So, the Ukrainians have retreated from Marinka, which marks their most significant retreat, Russia's biggest gain really in the last six months.",

      "sentences": "Hello, Bianca. Yes, nice to see you again.As you were saying, it seems that Russians are downplaying this attack to the navy ship in Crimea. But for Ukrainians, this is a big achievement. And reportedly, this ship was being used to transport Shahed drones, which have been largely used to attack Ukraine. Just overnight, there were around 46 drones launched to Ukraine. Russia launched around 46 drones to Ukraine, mostly in the south, in Kherson and Odessa region. The Ukrainian air defenses were working for about seven hours and the Ukraine air force says they managed to shut down around 32 of those drones. But yet some of those drones were not shot down and therefore there are some sites that have been damaged. For example, a shopping center in Kherson, also some buildings and in Odessa. A drone that was actually shot down, fell on houses in the suburbs and there is at least one person dead and a few people injured. But as you were saying, on the frontline, the news that comes from Marinka is also a highlight of this war, especially at this time of the year. It's almost two years since the war in Ukraine started, since Russia invaded Ukraine and for the past few days there has been some dispute whether or not Ukrainian troops were still in this village. Well, now Ukraine says that the troops have withdrawn, that lives have to be saved and that there is pretty much nothing left of this village.",

I mean, you're right, ChatGPT, but also other large language models like text generating models, but also image generation tools such as Midjourney. You know, these are really taking off and they're getting baked into existing products -- existing software, sorry -- in a way that, you know, I couldn't have predicted a couple of years ago. It really has been truly exponential in the true sense of the term. And indeed, it's moving forward into new mediums.So, for example, text to video is getting very sophisticated very quickly. That is typing in a prompt and getting full, fully fledged video content off the back, as well as what we're seeing with what are called auto agents. This is kind of using AI not just to kind of generate content that you then use, but actually asking it to execute kind of goals or tasks. And regulators are really kind of struggling on one level, although I do think the deepfake problem is something they have had to get to grips with, because of course they are kind of uniquely vulnerable in their positions. But legislators around the world are kind of really grappling with this. We obviously saw the U.K. host the AI Safety Summit this year. We saw Biden issued the executive order. And the EU AI Act has been kind of finalized, although it's not been enacted. But there is still a discrepancy between kind of how society and legislators understand this technology and how we understand the impacts of a lot of these technologies. They're moving very, very fast. But a lot of the kind of impacts may not necessarily be obvious until they become really embedded and have had time to kind of seep into everyday life in a way that, as I said, I think is already happening. But you're right, in 2024, I think we're going to see it on a whole other level.",
