Today, Trump campaigning in the battleground state of Wisconsin, hoping to flip that state after narrowly losing it to Biden in 2020. Meanwhile, the Harris campaign is kicking off a weeklong media blitz with high- profile interviews and campaign events in Arizona and Nevada. Let's go now to CNN's Harry Enten, who's at the magic wall, for a deeper look at the state of the race. What is the state of the race, Harry? Let's start nationally.",

There's no movement going on here.So this is the Harris versus Trump margin. You look where we were a month ago, it was Harris by three. Look at where we are today. It's Harris by three. Simply put, this race hasn't moved. It has been continuously very, very tight. And one way you can get an understanding of that is I want to take you through history, all right? Campaigns were any candidate held a lead of at least five or more points in the polls. We're going to go all the way back since 1964. Most campaigns, most campaigns, at least one candidate has led by five points or more, at least three weeks. In fact, all 15 of them from 1964 to 2020. If you look this year, there have been zero days, count them zero days, where either Kamala Harris or Donald Trump has been ahead by at least five points in the polls. In fact, you could go all the way back when Joe Biden was going to be the presumptive Democratic nominee and even back then, no candidate led by at least five points in the polls. The bottom line is, this is a historically close race and it's a historically consistent race -- Jessica. DEAN: Let's talk about swing states. What are we seeing there?",

And of course, let's take a look at what I call the core seven battleground states. All right? This is again your Harris versus Trump margin. And look at these Great Lake battleground states, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin.Look, you see some blue on this side of the screen, right? These are a little bit more friendly to Kamala Harris than the sunbelt that we'll get to in a second. But look at this, a one-point advantage in Pennsylvania, two points in Michigan, two points in Wisconsin, all well within the margin of error, too close to call. You come over now to the sunbelt battleground states, you got a little bit more red here. Trump up by a point in North Carolina, Arizona, Georgia, Nevada. Harris holding on to a one-point advantage. But again, very, very tight. So what does this mean for the electoral map? All right? So let's take a look and say, OK, imagine if the polls match what ends up being the results perfectly, right? That's probably not going to happen but for the sake of this exercise, let's do it. What we see of course is Harris carrying -- let's get some green font here. There we go. Carrying all of these Great Lake battleground states, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania. And then she also carries Nevada but you see again Trump, Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina. Look at this. Kamala Harris gets to exactly 276 electoral votes, slightly more than the 270 she needs to win. Donald Trump right behind at 262. But the bottom line is, Jessica, at this hour, this race remains incredibly tight. We've done these segments over the last month. This battleground map, simply put, really hasn't changed. Maybe a slight advantage to Kamala Harris, but one a race that remains way too close to call.",

Chuck, I just want to start with you. It seems like we are reaching the point in these campaigns and 30 days out, it makes sense where the surrogates are out.

And at the end, it's all about that little bit of vote, not that's undecided, but that you need to turn out.That's where we are today. They spent a year going out and identifying Democrats and Republicans who are going to vote for them or for the other candidate in Pennsylvania, for example, and now they've got to go get those that were in the middle that they have to ID and then persuade to turn out. So you see surrogates, you see star powers, you see all kinds of stuff going on about getting out the vote, GOTV in our world. And Harris was exactly right. In these battleground states, it's going to be every vote that will count and it will probably come down to folks that have newly registered who weren't even eligible to vote in the last election because they were too young, because pollsters aren't talking to them because they don't have a voter history so they're not a likely voter.

I get text messages almost every day from people I know on the ground, the different states, telling me what they're hearing at the doors.I had really great conversations, too, just like I said yesterday with some people who've been out canvassing and they said what they were struck by is that people who are not the typical Republican voter are leaning towards supporting President Trump. And it's because of the number one issue for them is the economy. And when you talk about the economy to these voters, they may not have voted before, or maybe they voted differently in previous elections. But they know the economy was better for me under President Trump. So I'm going to get out and vote for him this time. So we're seeing a lot of shift on that one issue in particular, in the demographics and the traditional candidates who say, OK, that's not going to be someone who votes for Republican. They're looking to vote Republican this time. And I couldn't agree with Harry more. GOTV. That's the world I come from. That is the name of the game right now. You have to not only get out the voters who you know will vote for you, but it's the people who you've ID'd that they would vote for you. You're aligned ideologically, but they just don't vote very often. So you'll hear from the left, you typically (INAUDIBLE) like the newly voters in the Republican politics.

It comes down at the presidential level on who you like and who you trust. Everybody who cares vehemently about an issue or an issue, one issue, pick your issue is the thing, they've made up their mind. There may be 1 percent or 2 percent. I think that's even a lot offolks that are undecided who really care about an issue. So when you talk about trust, and who you like, that's why getting very personal in these podcasts is really matter because again it's about motivating people to vote. At this point, Democrats are worried about folks showing up and not voting, not voting for Donald Trump. We've got the votes we need to win. We're worried about folks who stay home, who are working two jobs, who may be too busy. And that's what this comes down to.

So she's desperately trying to distance herself from President Biden because look at all the polling data.The overwhelming majority of Americans do not believe we're headed in the right direction. They don't approve of President Biden's performance in office. So she doesn't want to be tied to an unpopular incumbent president, even though she was his vice president. I think the Trump campaign is doing the job of tying her to that and making sure people remember that the economy we're currently living in, which like I said, is the number one issue for voters, is directly resolve the Biden-Harris policies. So Harris saying earlier, you know, you're worried about the people who don't go and vote because maybe they are working two jobs and they're busy, well, are you working two jobs because you're trying to make ends meet in the economy that was created by Biden and Harris, so you're going to go out and vote for Harris?

That exceeds the definition of rapid intensification. It's sitting 800 miles west southwest of Tampa as it continues to sit in these very warm ocean temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico intensifying.Because the ocean temperatures are so warm, we are expecting it to rapidly intensify again. That's how it gets to a category four hurricane with 145-mile-per-hour winds by Tuesday afternoon. Now as it gets towards the coast, some of that intensity could teeter some and we could be borderline either a high-end category three, maybe that low-end category four as it heads to that west coast there of Florida. Again with some of that intensity getting shaved off a little bit. But notice the cone still goes from Cedar Key to Naples. I mean, we're still needing to kind of pin down a little bit better where that eye goes, but regardless, it's going to be pretty large storm where we'll have the outer bands and the damaging winds and the heavy rain across the entire peninsula. Here the ocean temperatures I was talking about, right? That's why we know we're going to get it to rapidly intensify again when it's in the Gulf. But here's that spread that I was talking about, you know, where that exact eye can go. We're still watching this very closely. And the reason why there's still some uncertainty there is because there's a front that's sitting just to the north and that's what's kind of pulling in Helene into -- I'm sorry, Milton. It's pulling in Milton into Florida. That front depending on where it goes will either pull it farther to the north or kick it south. This front is also what's giving it some of that wind shear which can pull down some of that intensity as it gets closer to the coast. So, again, continuing to intensify across the Gulf of Mexico, it heads towards Florida there by Wednesday when we're looking at landfall. We'll find some of the outer bands coming in already by late Tuesday, landfall of that eye on Wednesday. No matter what the winds do, what the intensity does, it's going to string out incredibly heavy rain, some 48 inches of rain, some totals up to 10 to 15 inches possible on already saturated grounds -- Jessica.",

We know we're going to feel the effects here in Hillsborough County here in Tampa, Florida. So my advice is heed the warning.If you want to gamble, there's plenty of avenues to do that, but don't gamble with you and your family's lives.

We have some water that still hasn't receded from the last storm, from our daily rainstorms. It's been a busy rainy season, and now we know, regardless of where this hits, if it comes to Tampa south or north, we're going to feel the effect.Yes, the wind is going to hurt because all the trees that will fall down, a lot of our residents will lose power, but it's always storm surge, that's the killer. The storm surge and you think, OK, listen, I can ride this out and then it comes a little higher and it comes a little higher, and then it's too late. And we've lost too many residents because they thought they'd be OK. And once you have that moment, that you realized that it's not going to be OK, then sometimes it's too late. We've conducted over 1,000 rescues this last storm with our amphibious vehicles, our marine assets working with our Hillsborough County Fire Rescue, 1,000 rescues. That's 1,000 rescues that the men and women were happy to do. But it's just unnecessary rescues if you heed the warnings. So to answer your original question, yes, these mandatory evacuations are going to come. I foresee them being issued tomorrow. We've already issued the closure of schools Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, and county buildings and will continue to spin up from there, the airport and everything else, as we continue to get closer and feel the effects of the storm.",
