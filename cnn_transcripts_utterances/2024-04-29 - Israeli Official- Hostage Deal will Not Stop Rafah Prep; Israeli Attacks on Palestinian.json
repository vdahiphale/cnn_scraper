But aid to Gaza and the situation in Rafah also priority issues. The U.S. wants to see a concrete plan from Israel on how civilians in Rafah could possibly be protected in the event of a ground operation. An Israeli official telling CNN, the IDF will continue to prepare for that operation, even if there is a hostage deal. Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will travel to Israel and Jordan after his trip to Saudi Arabia, where he's due to arrive on Monday. Blinken expected to discuss aid to Gaza, as well as how to achieve a, quote, \"lasting peace\" and a pathway to a Palestinian state. The Saudi foreign minister weighed in on that on Sunday.

Senior U.S. officials have been traveling to the region over the last several months to try to advance these talks.

Low levels of sea ice, driven in part by climate change, are threatening their breeding grounds and calling -- causing colonies to die off.CNN's Lynda Kinkade with more on that.

The world's largest penguin species, Emperor Penguins, are severely threatened by climate change. Scientists from the British Antarctic survey say tens of thousands of Emperor Penguin chicks may have died as the species battle to survive record low sea ice in 2023.",

And we're starting to see these losses in Antarctica now.Our models are quite dire. KINKADE (voice-over): Dire because these penguins also lay their eggs and raise their chicks on sea ice. But with the ice melting away, the chicks may fall into the sea before they get their waterproof feathers, leaving them to freeze to death or drown. Despite the recent losses, 2023 wasn't as bad as 2022 for the Emperor Penguins. Scientists say it's because some colonies adapted to the worsening conditions by moving South to find better ice, or to more stable ice shelves or icebergs.",
