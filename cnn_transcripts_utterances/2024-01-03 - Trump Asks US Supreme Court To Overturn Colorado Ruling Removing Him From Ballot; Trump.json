The former president tells the Supreme Court there is no 14th Amendment case for keeping him off Colorado's ballot and says the capital attack was no insurrection.Also breaking tonight, we've just gotten court documents expected to reveal the names of nearly 200 people connected to the late sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. We'll tell you what we're finding so far. And what US officials are saying tonight about who might be responsible for the bomb blast in Iran that killed more than 100 people at a memorial ceremony for a notorious terror mastermind. Good evening. Thanks for joining us. We begin with breaking news in a story that, as we sit at the top of last night's program, could reshape the presidential campaign and a whole lot more, including how a truly central part of the constitution is applied. Late today, attorneys for the former president filed his US Supreme Court appeal of the Colorado Supreme Court decision barring him from the state's 2024 primary ballot. Now, they're filing underscores the state of the case, describing the Colorado ruling as, quote, \"the first time in the history of the United States that the judiciary has prevented voters from casting ballots for the leading major party presidential candidate.\" CNN's Evan Perez joins us now with more. So what more do we know about the appeal that they've made?",

They say he is not, that the January 6th attack was not an insurrection, and that the former president did not engage in insurrection.They also say that the Congress, not state courts, should be the ones that determine the eligibility for the presidency. They also say that the 14th Amendment, the letter -- if you read the 14th Amendment Section 3, it doesn't mention the office of the presidency, and it doesn't apply, they say, to the former president. I will read you a little bit more of what they argue. They say that this Colorado ruling, if allowed to stand, will mark the first time in history of the United States that the judiciary has prevented voters from casting ballots for the leading major party presidential candidate. And, obviously, that's what is at stake here, Anderson. You have, perhaps for the first time ever, the Supreme Court is going to take up what exactly that language means in the 14th Amendment, whether it does apply to the presidency.",

So it's really sort of a kitchen sink approach, as we were talking about.I think the thing that is most, I think, compelling and that the Supreme Court most -- might find most persuasive is a reason to take it up is this argument that he has presented before that if you allow the states -- all 50 states -- to make their own determination about whether or not he is qualified to be on the ballot for president, that that really invites chaos, and that the Supreme Court should step in and really settle this question of whether or not actually the states even have the authority to make these determinations pursuant to the procedure set forth in state law.

What I think they try to do is reach some point of unanimity or near unanimity over one of these questions over, for instance, is the president an officer of the United States? Is the president -- does he take the same oath as other people bear for? Is he exempt from the provisions in the 14th Amendment that would apply here? Because of how fraught, and complicated, and politically sensitive this insurrection question is, and very difficult legally to sort out, I think they just avoid it altogether. And, frankly, it's probably more of the president's interest just -- and the course to just say, well, look, he's -- forget insurrection, he's a candidate for office.

And so, their petition, the only petition presented to the US Supreme Court wouldn't be asking the court to actually review the determination of the Colorado Supreme Court, affirming the ruling of the district court that Trump did engage in insurrection. Now, I suspect the court will not grant cert on that question, that they will probably resolve this question on the issue of whether he is an officer under Section 3 and whether or not the section is self- executing. But if they were to rule against Trump on those two legal questions, and they actually would have to reach the question of whether he engaged in insurrection, I suspect that he raised those issues on appeal because he also wants to be contesting those determinations.

He agreed to pay a, quote, \"substantial amount to a charity of her choice,\" but he has denied any wrongdoing. But also, so far in the document, we looked that references to Bill Clinton. He is someone whose name has come up as someone who has flown on Epstein's private jets. Now, Giuffre is not accusing Clinton of any wrongdoing. He, in the past, had said, yes, he did fly on Epstein's planes, but he never went to his island in the Caribbean that he owned where a lot of this sexual abuse had taken place.

Her own exclusive circle included the former first daughter, Chelsea Clinton. Eyewitness accounts say Maxwell was not only invited to Clinton's wedding, but also given access backstage at the Clinton Global Initiatives Summit back in 2009. Maxwell was also photographed in 2000 with then future president Donald Trump. Alongside him, Melania, who he was dating at the time, and Jeffrey Epstein. And there's this picture, too. That's Maxwell in the background of a photograph of Prince Andrew, which shows him with his arms around the waist of a young woman named Virginia Roberts, who today is Virginia Giuffre. She has alleged she was trafficked by Epstein with the help of Maxwell, then forced to have sex with his friends, including Prince Andrew, when she was 17. The prince emphatically denied all of it. In 2022, Prince Andrew settled with Giuffre for an undisclosed amount, and a US district judge agreed to dismiss her lawsuit against him. Weeks earlier, Buckingham Palace stripped him of his military titles, and according to a royal source, told him he could no longer use his royal highness in any official capacity. Ghislaine Maxwell seemed to disappear from the public eye after Epstein was arrested. But in July of 2020, while in New Hampshire, she was arrested. She was later charged with six federal counts, including sex trafficking children, enticement of a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, and transportation of a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity. She pleaded not guilty, but at her 2021 trial, a jury convicted her of five federal charges, including sex trafficking of a minor. Ghislaine Maxwell was sentenced to 20 years in federal prison.

There is also the possibility of internal resistance groups.We have heard earlier this evening, Iran's President Ebrahim Raisi, he pointed the finger of blame squarely at Israel, warning that the response from Iran would be severe and regrettable. Now, CNN has reached out to the Israeli military, no comment from them on this. We did hear earlier today from State Department Spokesperson, Matt Miller, who said that the U.S. has no independent information, asserting that the U.S. had no involvement, and also saying the U.S. has no reason to believe that Israel was involved. But, of course, this does come at a time of heightened tensions between Israel and Iran, and indeed between Israel and Iran backed groups like Hezbollah in Lebanon, of course, mounting concern around the potential for those tensions to escalate more broadly.
