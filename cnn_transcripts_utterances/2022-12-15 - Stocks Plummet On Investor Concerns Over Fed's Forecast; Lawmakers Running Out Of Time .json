I mean, markets are essentially betting against the idea that the Fed can tame inflation without causing a recession. Yesterday, Fed officials made clear that they're not done slamming the brakes on this economy. Inflation might be cooling but not enough to get them to stop raising interest rates.And then, today, there's new evidence that there are some real cracks showing in this economy. Retail sales unexpectedly tumbled, some new manufacturing reports were weaker than expected, jobless claims were strong but too strong if you ask the Fed. And so, if you put it all together, I think Wall Street is growing more worried that the Fed is going to slow this economy right into a recession. That's why you see the Dow closing down 2.3 percent, 764 points. The Nasdaq down more than 3 percent. Investors are clearly pricing in the growing risk, not certainty, but the growing risk that there could be a recession here -- Jake.",

Another idea being discussed is a threat to a rules package if it contains some of the most hard-line demands the McCarthy critics are seeking. And finally they're threatening to team up with Democrats if they can't elect a speaker to find a consensus candidate.

Now, it's interesting, Jake, court documents do provide some insight into his overall mental state.
