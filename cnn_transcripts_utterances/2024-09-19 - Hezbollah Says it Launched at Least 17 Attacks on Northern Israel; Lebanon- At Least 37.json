Hezbollah says it has now launched at least 17 attacks into northern Israel in a new escalation that is bringing fears of a wider war closer to a boiling point. Israel's military is saying that it hit dozens of Hezbollah targets inside of Lebanon today, including infrastructure sites and a weapons storage facility.This follows, of course, days of intense threats from Israel and Hezbollah. The Israeli defense minister vowing that the terror group will pay an increasing price, while the militia's leader warning, quote, the reckoning is coming. Right now, Lebanon is on edge after two days of attacks on wireless devices. The booby-trapped devices detonated in a series of complex explosions that killed dozens of people and injured thousands more. Let's go now to CNN's Senior International Correspondent, Ben Wedeman. He is live for us from Beirut. Ben, what can you tell us about these volleying attacks?",

Well, Boris, as we have seen in previous instances, these threats of retaliation are specific enough that we can be sure that there will be some retaliation, but vague enough that we don't know exactly what that retaliation would be. And, moreover, we're not yet at the point where we can conclude that this latest round of escalation will spill over into what hopefully neither side wants, which is an all-out war that could rope in the United States and Iran and Lord knows who else.So I think that Nasrallah is leaving himself enough room to take a couple of retaliator steps back, see what happens and then make another decision. And that's why I think you see a lot of regional leaders, including Secretary of State Blinken, who is in the region, and the Egyptians, and et cetera, trying to intervene to stop this thing from spiraling out of control. And, you know, if that can't be done, if the escalation ladder continues to proceed, Israel could be facing an enemy that's a hundred times more powerful than Hamas, which could rope in the United States and Iran and that's a risk that nobody really wants to take. But we'll have to wait a couple of days or a couple of weeks to see how it plays out.",

That's one possible goal.The other way that they could go is a ground force invasion, which would be sort of how this - the regional war sort of kicks off. Now, we know that the U.S. administration, including Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, are warning the Israelis in public and private not to do that.

It's really interesting because on the one hand, you have a huge split inside of Israeli's politics and Israeli society over whether or not president - Prime Minister Netanyahu should strike a deal soon to release the hostages and have a ceasefire in Gaza or continue to fight Hamas in Gaza until, I guess, it's over and avoid the deal.But there's very little sort of, at least from what I can tell, disagreement over the idea that the problem in the north needs to be dealt with one way or the other that the Hezbollah attacks, such as they are, need to be stopped. So, of course, they're related. And, of course, what Secretary Blinken is saying is that if you continue to escalate in the north, then there'll be no way to strike a ceasefire in the south. The problem is that it's not clear that the Netanyahu government wants to strike a ceasefire deal in the south anyway, and it's certainly not clear that they care at all what the Biden administration is saying.",

And just moments ago, Speaker Johnson, for the first time today, talked with reporters as he made his way around Capitol Hill. And he said, I'm not making any announcements today in terms of what path forward he has chosen. He goes on to say, now we go back to the playbook and it divides another one.He mentions, he says, we have got time. We'll get it done. We're having thoughtful conversations right now. But very clear that he has not chosen a path forward and that's what's concerning and frustrating many members up here. He had that big defeat in the House last night on his spending bill that, of course, included those voting provisions that former President Donald Trump wanted and extended it through early next year. That was defeated. So the big question is what will Speaker Johnson do next. There's a growing sense on Capitol Hill that the Speaker needs to embrace a clean continuing resolution, a clean spending bill, get through the elections, get through potentially the holiday season to sign another one, but leave those fights for another day after the November election. But, as of now, Brianna, he has not chosen a path forward. Now, meantime, in the Senate, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, he took some procedural steps this afternoon to kind of put the ducks in a row should the Senate need to move before the House. But that's all to say right now on Capitol Hill, Speaker Johnson, again, reiterated that he's not chosen a path forward, whether he will accept a clean continuing resolution. Brianna?",

      "sentences": "Oh, absolutely. I mean, this is obviously not the first time we've seen Donald Trump, you know, try to influence what is happening on Capitol Hill. Remember earlier this year, a lot of Republicans actually were very angry with Donald Trump because he helped to sink that bipartisan border bill deal that they had come up with and prevented it from happening.And now you've heard Manu Raju, who's been interviewing a lot of people on Capitol Hill for us, hearing similar things now from Republicans as well, that they are frustrated because a lot of people do not want a shutdown. And now, as Sunlen walked through, I think it's important to keep in mind what exactly Donald Trump is asking for and we saw him post about this. He's posted about it a couple of times now, but yesterday, just hours before that House vote, the former president went on Truth Social and said, Republicans need to pass the SAVE Act, every single ounce of it or not move forward with this continuing resolution. But remember, the SAVE Act is about having non - keeping noncitizens from voting in elections. But that is illegal in every single state already. So a lot of people are kind of like, why is this such a big problem? And that's why you're hearing Democrats push back on this effort. I think one interesting thing that I've been paying attention to is that this is actually the same issue that House Speaker Mike Johnson went to Mar-a-Lago for in May. He did that joint press conference with Donald Trump to talk about this bill. And part of that was because he recognized at the time his speaker gavel was on the line. And that's really what a lot of this, I think, is coming down to. Donald Trump is still such a kingmaker, not only in Republican politics, but very much on Capitol Hill. And what he says is absolutely influencing their decisions.",

And then later, he's going to be addressing the Israel American conference, as you mentioned, the largest kind of gathering of these pro-Israel supporters. And a lot of this is him trying to court disaffected Jewish Americans, especially ahead of November, particularly those who are not exactly happy with the way that the Biden administration has been handling the war between Israel and Hamas.Now, I do want to note that, of course, Donald Trump often refers to himself as the most pro-Israel president that they have had in recent American history. But at the same time, we also know that he's made a lot of disparaging remarks about Jewish Americans. Many that people have argued are anti-Semitic. He said that people aren't exactly Jewish if they're voting for Democrats, things like that. So I think it's important to keep that in context when we hear from Donald Trump this evening. But this is definitely a move by him and his campaign to kind of pull as many voters in that camp as they can, as they look forward to November 5th.",

Dr. Mathew, based on what you've seen as a primary care physician, do you agree with the findings of this report? DR. SAJU MATHEW, PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN &amp; PUBLIC HEALTH SPECIALIST: You know, unfortunately, Boris, you know, we are the richest country in the world as you just mentioned there, but we have the poorest outcomes and that is absolutely true. We spend all this money, we pay more, but we get less. And, you know, there's so many different reasons for this, but ultimately it's also what you mentioned in the opening, we don't have a universal healthcare policy. Now, I tell you, when I talk to patients and other doctors, most people agree that we do need some type of a universal healthcare. The problem is how do you pay for it, and that is where we get lost in conversation after conversation. And ultimately what happens is if you are rich, if you have a good healthcare plan, you're probably good to go, especially if you're healthy. One of the biggest problems is healthcare inequity, where minority populations are affected the most with decreased access to healthcare and using the system more at the very end when they are really sick versus when they are healthier.",

CHRIS T. PERNELL, DIRECTOR, NAACP CENTER FOR HEALTHY EQUITY: Yes, Brianna. On an average day across the United States, what we see is that far too many Americans experience a tale of two Americas. And what I mean by that is you have certain populations and groups that disproportionately don't have primary care physicians available. They don't have the health insurance to have access to those primary care positions. When they do have health insurance, it may - they may be underinsured or they're using their emergency room for issues that would be better served in an outpatient setting. And then finally, you have a host of social conditions or those social determinants of health as we define them that are impressing upon their health outcomes and they're living sicker and they're dying sooner.

And there's a fair amount of investment around safety, knowing how best to take care of people for, say - for instance, when they're in a hospital to prevent infection.So while that is a bright spot, I cannot underscore. The reason that we can perform well in that area, but bottom out amongst all of our peers is because we don't make the right comprehensive investments.
