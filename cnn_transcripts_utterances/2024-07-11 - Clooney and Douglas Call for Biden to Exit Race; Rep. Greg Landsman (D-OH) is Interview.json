By stars we mean the Hollywood heavyweights who, one by one, seem to be starting to bail on the president. The actor, George Clooney, calling on Biden to step aside just weeks after headlining a star-studded fundraiser for his re-election campaign. And it was that fundraiser the gave him this. Clooney wrote in an op-ed in \"The New York Times.\" It reads in part, quote, \"it is devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at that fundraiser was not the Joe 'big f-ing deal' Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\" Clooney apparently not alone.

And he would go down in history as a selfless champion of democracy. And I think he risks his entire legacy by holding on as tightly as he's trying to hold on right now.
