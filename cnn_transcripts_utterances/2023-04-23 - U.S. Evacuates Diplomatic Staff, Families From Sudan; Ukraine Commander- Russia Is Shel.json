      "sentences": "Yes, that's right. I mean, the State Department has evacuation plans for its embassies around the world, but what we saw over the course of the last few days, Fred, was the US military and the State Department working together to actually put the pieces into place to carry out this evacuation.Now, earlier in the week, one of the top State Department officials told Congress that the situation on the ground was just too violent for them to carry out this evacuation, but of course, with the approval of the Secretary of State and President Biden on Saturday night, they went ahead with this operation. It was quick. They went in and there were about a hundred Special Forces who flew into Sudan on the ground for less than an hour. Getting out, as Sam said, less than a hundred people, most of them US diplomats and their family members, a few other diplomats from other countries and then they flew them out to Ethiopia on these US military helicopters aircraft out of the country. What this means that there are no US diplomats in the country anymore and the US Embassy has temporarily suspended operations. It is effectively closed for now. Of course, the State Department would like to reopen it when conditions allow for that. But obviously, we don't see that happening right now. When it comes to those Americans who are still in the country that you guys were discussing earlier. There are a number of them who have reached out to the State Department to try and get some sort of help from them, as they look at options to try and get out of the country. With that main airport, obviously shut down to commercial flights, it is not easy with the streets full of violence. What the State Department is saying right now is that they don't foresee a plan, a US government plan to evacuate those citizens right now or in the coming days. Of course, we'll continue to watch that space as it evolves. If there is more demand, if they can do anything more. But right now, what they're saying is that they want to help US citizens, provide them with some sort of support as they look to routes to get out of the country, and there are some convoys that other countries are leading. The State Department is channeling US citizens to say, hey, look to these options, but telling them to do so at their own risk.",

That is not something that the US routinely does. And they've also made the point that the US State Department has given American citizens ample warning that it is not safe to remain in Sudan. It has warned against travel there for several months.And so they say they will do what they can, but they cannot provide a sort of this -- the type of evacuation that you saw last night for American diplomats. Of course, President Biden did monitor that from Camp David, that is where he is spending the weekend. He did spend the last several days sort of looking for the right moment for this evacuation to begin, and one of the things that he wanted to do was to have all of the diplomats assembled at the diplomatic compound there in Khartoum, at the embassy, it's on the outskirts of the city. It has been described as a fortress, that in itself was quite an undertaking. The roads in Khartoum are quite unsafe. It wasn't really just a matter of hailing a taxi and going to the Embassy. They had to get the diplomats there before they could get them out of the country. Once they were out, the President did release a statement announcing the operation, saying in part: \"I am proud of the extraordinary commitment of our Embassy staff who performed their duties with courage and professionalism and embodied America's friendship and connection with the people of Sudan.\" And the President went on to say and this is important: \"I am receiving regular reports from my team on their ongoing work to assist Americans in Sudan to the extent possible. We are also working closely with our allies and partners in this effort.\" And so the President in there, making the point that they won't be able to do everything that they can to get these Americans out, but they will do what they can going forward -- Fredricka.",

The eruption of retail, large box retailers in general has been happening for a decade, particularly the perfect storm we've seen over the last three or four years. You had COVID and you had supply chain issues, the incredible growth of Amazon and online shopping, changes of immediacy of shopping.

And it's just you know, these stores, these brick and mortars just can't compete with the kind of convenience, the ease with which retailers would you know, prefer to shop -- shopping online.",

I think e-commerce is not a business model, it is a channel of shopping that adds to the entire consumer experience, but I don't think it's about purely e-commerce. I think it's about relevance.I think today, the consumer calls the shots about what they want to buy, what brands, where, how, and when. And the things for Bed Bath, I mean, Bed Bath used to be this incredible destination for back to school. You could see the sort of incredible assortment you could buy at the last minute before school started. I mean, with all of these things, there are other places you can get this at last minute now at prices as good or better. And remember, Bed Bath also adopted a private label strategy over the last couple of years and many retailers, private label in theory, if you do it well, it might give you a better margin, a profit margin because you're buying directly from the factory and you're sourcing it yourself. On the other hand, it also means you own your inventory destiny. There is no supplier like an All Clad a Ralph Lauren for bed products, or Calvin Klein for sheets to supply you with inventory, and if you have supply chain issues, you own those. If you have too much inventory, it's your inventory. If you have too little, you can't get it and going into holiday, your Bed Bath was out of stock on nearly half the key items that they needed and they didn't have the brands that people were shopping for. And I think you combine that with the other elements we're talking about, this was a tough path for them.

The concern is when you get that snow melt rapidly, all of that water ends up flowing into the rivers, creeks, and streams.And right now across the Midwest, we have several river gauges that are already at moderate and even major flood stage across the upper Midwest, but we're going to start to see a lot of that spread farther south, States like Iowa, Illinois, and even into Missouri, where those river gauges could potentially get up to moderate and even major flood stage by the end of the week. One specific gauge we're looking at is the Mississippi River at St. Paul right now sitting at about 17-and-a-half feet, that does put this at major flood stage. It is expected to crest Friday, maybe perhaps Saturday of this week at just shy of 19 feet. And while that will cause some local concerns, it's not expected to get to the record crest, which was just over 26 feet. The reason behind all of this melt is all of the snow that is still on the ground across areas of the Midwest, especially after in some cases, a pretty epic snowfall for just specifically the month of April. All of this is going to end up warming up, melting and flowing back into those rivers, creeks, and streams. But in addition to that, we also have the potential for some rain by the end of this upcoming week. And while it may not seem like much one, maybe at most two inches, is just going to exacerbate a lot of the already ongoing issues for some of these areas where they are already dealing with swollen rivers, creeks and streams. And temperatures right now are on the cool side averaging 10 to 15 degrees below average. That's a good thing. That is allowing for this to be a gradual rise of that water across the rivers, but if these temperatures begin to warm back up at the end of the week, or into the weekend, we could potentially start to see those rivers rise a little bit more rapidly.",

All three are heading to the White House tomorrow to discuss gun violence and discuss what can be done with President Biden.

I think that we need an emergency response when we're facing a crisis situation. And that in States like ours, we need help from our national leaders. JUSTIN PEARSON (D), TENNESSEE STATE REPRESENTATIVES: I think there's a really a holistic approach that has to be taken that isn't just addressing guns, but is addressing how we prevent gun violence and how we support communities that are suffering because of the inaction of people like the Republican Party in Tennessee. GLORIA JOHNSON (D), TENNESSEE STATE REPRESENTATIVE: Now the reality is in my district because I'm a teacher, I taught for 27 years. I was in a school that had a school shooting, gun violence has always been a big issue for me and I have run Red Flag Laws in the past, but we hold in my district in Red Knox County and overwhelmingly the majority of Republicans in my district support Red Flag Laws.
