I'll ask a key member of the Biden camp what the president needs to accomplish in his State of the Union Address tomorrow night. And a terrifying close call for the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, a Russian missile striking not far from his convoy and killing five people. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. Tonight, the path is clear for President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump to do battle again, an unprecedented and likely very divisive rematch that both of them have been expecting, and many Americans have made it clear they don't want. Here is CNN's Jeff Zeleny. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Tonight, the curtain finally goes up on a historic presidential rematch, Joe Biden and Donald Trump, emerging from Super Tuesday primaries as the effective nominees of their parties. But there are warning signs in winning, with both men facing distinct challenges of rebuilding their coalitions. Nikki Haley, the last standing Republican rival, suspended her campaign without offering an endorsement.",

Biden easily swept away long-shot rivals like Dean Phillips, but a series of protest votes made clear he faces the task of uniting Democrats too, like in Minnesota on Tuesday, where uncommitted received 19 percent of the vote.

(END VIDEOTAPE) ZELENY (on camera): Now, the sequel between Biden and Trump is cemented, but it will play out in a vastly different political climate. The race is filled with so many wild cards, Trump's criminal cases, Biden's foreign policy challenges, and, of course, the fitness for office of both candidates. But there is no modern day historical guide for the eight-month campaign to come, the stark contrast of which will come into sharper view in the State of the Union Address and response tomorrow night.

      "sentences": "But not with any olive branches or anything if you looked at his post earlier today right after Nikki Hailey announced that she was exiting this race, he talked about how he believed most of her supporters was the term he used were far left radical Democrats. It wasn't exactly what someone maybe who's politically savvy and looking at the numbers would necessarily say and compare that as the Haley campaign as to what Joe Biden said in his statement, where he was making this appeal to them saying, yes, we disagree on the issues themselves sometimes but we agree on the principle of democracy itself. It was a very different tone from the two of them.And I can tell you that's what the candidate is doing. But the campaign itself and what they're looking on Trump's side, Wolf, here are the number. And, yes, Nikki Haley only one two of these nominating contests, but out of that, she got over half a million votes, close to 600,000 in some of the battleground states. Look at North Carolina alone. She got 250, 000 votes there. Trump lost, the margin in 2020 in North Carolina was only about 75,000 votes. So, Trump's campaign is certainly looking at these numbers. That doesn't mean all of the Haley voters obviously are going to go to President Biden's side and vote for him come November, but the campaign itself is looking at those numbers. And I think what you can tell in that by the evidence of that, Trump's speech last night. He did not attack Nikki Haley the way he has been so horribly online and he instead focused on the issues that could appeal to her voters.",

Yes, they want to expand the electorate and the MAGA base, but they also understand, because it's not just Haley voters, it is a mythical thing, what she represents, independent voters, Trump-resistant Republicans. They need those as part of the full tier as a game of addition.If you look in the Virginia exit poll last night, we asked folks, are you going to vote Republican in November regardless of the nominee? Now, this is among Haley's voters in Virginia. 69 percent say no, it's not an automatic vote for the Republican.

And so that the key is who has the most enthusiasm, and we're seeing many polls showing that Donald Trump has the enthusiasm to get voters out, and Joe Biden is going, to be struggling with that. And on top of that, Biden has had the luxury of being the incumbent president and has a tremendous war chest. Now, Donald Trump, with being the presumptive nominee, he has the tools of the RNC to help with joint fundraising agreement, election integrity units and the communication shop from the RNC.

I think he pretty much does that every single day of his life, even if it's not on Twitter necessarily now. With the debates themselves, not a surprise if you've been talking to sources in Trump world. They have said all along, even when he was against the Republican primary debates and refused to go against any of his challengers, that the general would likely change that if he was the Republican nominee.The one thing is he cannot stand the non-partisan committee that puts on those presidential debates. So, that's the big question here. The group that I should note has been doing this since 1976. I think part of what's driving Trump is that he feels incredibly bullish about how he would perform against President Biden in a debate. But I'll remind everyone that back in 2020, when they had -- you know, it was supposed to be a series of three debates, they only did two, we heard the exact same thing from all of our Trump sources that they felt very confident going into that debate. Essentially, none of them said that afterwards. They thought that first debate went terribly for them, and they thought they improved by the second one. So, I think --",

He is going to have to convince the American people that the money we're donating or contributing to these areas is being well spent and it's in furtherance of democracy.

And so under the circumstances, not surprised to see the jury come back with a guilty, because, clearly, had she inspected the bullets, they would not have been in the gun. They would have been removed. Now, on the tampering charge, that relates to her handing a baggie of white powder to someone on set during the investigation. However, that powder was never tested. So, the defense said it's impossible to prove whether or not that was drugs, as the prosecutors had alleged. So, given all of the circumstances of this case, and given those jury instructions, new off the critical factor, the bullets were not inspected prior to handing that gun over to Alec Baldwin, and the rest of it really wasn't relevant.",

It wasn't foreseeable that the armorer, the person who is responsible for the safety, maintenance and care of the firearm and the ammunition, it was not foreseeable that there would be a real bullet in that gun. And, Wolf, his defense team had been in the courtroom. And, today, during closing arguments, the prosecutors made a statement during their rebuttal argument where they said, it's expected that the actor is going to go off-book. It's expected that the actor might mishandle a firearm. That's all for the purposes of convicting Hannah Gutierrez- Reed, but they had a fine line to tow.
