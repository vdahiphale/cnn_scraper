And that could be key in the classified documents case that is dogging the former president.The New York Times reporting, citing sources familiar with the matter, says, quote, \"In complete sentences and a narrative tone that sounded as if it had been ripped from a novel, Mr. Corcoran recounted in detail a nearly monthlong period of the documents investigation.\" And it also goes on to report that the recordings include recollections of a May 2022 meeting that Corcoran had with Trump. This was about that DOJ subpoena for the return of all classified documents. He also, in this recording, talked about his June search of Mar-a-Lago for classified documents before the FBI came there. CNN previously reported the special counsel Jack Smith has obtained dozens of pages of Corcoran's notes memorizing -- memorializing conversations with his client after the former president received the subpoena last May. It was at that time that Trump asked whether he could push back on the subpoena. That's according to sources familiar with the notes taken by Corcoran and later handed over to investigators. Joining us now to talk about the implication of this recording, in particular, is assistant professor of law at Brooklyn Law School, Alexis Hoag-Fordjour. Great to have you. ALEXIS HOAG-FORDJOUR, ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF LAW, BROOKLYN LAW SCHOOL: Thank you.",

And it really just requires that Trump has retained documents willingly. That he has withheld documents upon request from federal agencies. I'm glad you brought up Nixon. So we're working within the parameters of this Presidential Records Act (PRA) and it was passed right after President Nixon tried to destroy records following his presidency in 1974. So this legislation was passed in 1978. We have Trump claiming oh, the Presidential Records Act allows me to have these documents. And, in fact, the Presidential Records Act says that a president cannot retain documents after the presidency. They belong to the public. They go to National Archives. So we have National Archives requesting these documents and Trump saying we don't have them. They're slowly trickling out.

And every single one of them as soon as you bring up -- whether they're Republican or Democrat, as soon as you bring up guns are the number one killer of kids and teens you will start to hear stories. Yes, my nephew lost his life to suicide via firearm; or yes, my daughter was at Columbine; or yes, my child was right outside of the Aurora school shooting.So even when our children survive these traumatic events you still have to realize -- everyone talks about mental health. Of course, mental health is engrained in this. If we're worried about mental health can you imagine the trauma and the PTSD that this is causing from lockdown drills to everything surrounding gun violence, to our youth right now, to adults right now. If mental illness is an issue right now imagine what it will -- what it will be in five years, one year, 10 years.",

Because 64 percent of Americans -- 64 percent of Americans, according to USA Today -- they want gun reform. That's more important to them than preserving the rights of guns.
