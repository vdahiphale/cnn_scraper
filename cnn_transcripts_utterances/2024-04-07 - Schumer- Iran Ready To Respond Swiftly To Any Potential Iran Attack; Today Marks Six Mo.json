I'm Fredricka Whitfield.All right, new this hour, US Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer says the US is ready to swiftly respond to any potential Iranian attack. CNN has learned the US is on high alert and actively preparing for a significant Iranian attack that could come as soon as this week, targeting Israeli or American assets in the region. All of this follows an airstrike in Syria last week that killed top Iranian commanders, an attack which Iran blames on Israel. White House correspondent, Priscilla Alvarez is in Washington for us. Priscilla, what exactly is Schumer elaborating on?",

They have also been in close touch and knowing that this could happen and going so far as to say that they see it as \"inevitable.\" Now, we are not clear on how this attack would unfold nor when it would happen exactly, but officials and dissipate that it would target us or Israeli assets in the Middle East, and so Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, making clear that the US is preparing for any outcome here. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): I know the president and his team are working hard to prevent escalation and we are prepared to defend any attack and respond swiftly if necessary. Tensions in the Middle East are very high, that's why we want to pass the National Security Supplemental. It is critical, and we are all urging Speaker Johnson to put it on the floor of the House.

After months of intense fighting, Israel says it is withdrawing its ground forces from the southern city of Khan Younis. Israel described the area as a major Hamas stronghold, and we are also learning that Israel's planned reopening of the Erez Border Crossing in the north of Gaza is being delayed. It would have allowed for more aid to flow into Gaza, and it all comes as Israel marks a grim milestone. It has been exactly six months today since Hamas attacked. The Gaza Ministry of Health says more than 33,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war. Nic Robertson is in Jerusalem for us, Ben Wedeman and Beirut. Nic, let's go to you first.

So this was a very big division. The 98th Division that has pulled out. We were on the border today. We saw strikes still going into Khan Younis. We saw the dozens upon dozens of tanks and dozens upon dozens of armored fighting vehicles now out of Gaza, parked up in their field. In the fields, troops were stripping equipment out of them, repairing them and the IDF is saying that the troops now will get recuperation and preparation for their next operations and the IDF is leaving very clearly the door open for an operation on that major place where Palestinians living in the south of Gaza, Rafah, but also saying they are leaving significant forces in the north both of Gaza, 162nd division and another brigade of tough combat troops there. So, the message is clear. There is a drawdown, but the war is not over, and I think we've got a sense of that from General Herzi Halevi, the army IDF chief-of-staff, saying we still know that there are Hamas commanders who are hiding out, and the clear implication is they will reach out and target them as the opportunity arises.",

The English statement just talks about readiness for the transition from defense to offense. The Arabic version, however, as translated came out as preparing to move from defense to attack, so that set off alarm bells certainly here in Lebanon.Now, over the last few days, we've had a series of developments that certainly indicate the tensions are rising. Yesterday, there were as many as 10 Hezbollah strikes on Israeli positions and also yesterday, Hezbollah was able to shoot down up a Hermes 19 Israeli drone in Lebanese airspace. That is a very sophisticated drone that has the capacity to fire missiles, as well as collect and relay information back to base. Also a few days ago, we heard that the Israeli military has canceled all leaves for combat units and was recalling reservists for air defense units as well. So certainly tensions rising and it is not made any better by the fact that everyone is anticipating some form of Iranian response to the attack on the Iranian consulate -- the Israeli attack on the Iranian consulate in Damascus. Now the other your day, we did here the secretary general of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah saying that the Iranian response is inevitable, but it will be an Iranian response, not via any of Iran's proxies or allies in the region -- Fredricka.",

They are making a virtue out of necessity.I am not sure they would argue that there is a need for a heavy-duty military response using ground forces and comprehensive airstrikes. I think they are shifting perhaps to a more selective use of military force to try to target senior leaders, try to hold to some degree the areas that they cleared and of course, to continue to look for intelligence with respect to where Hamas senior leadership is hiding and almost certainly surrounding those leadership or the 134 hostages, 31 of whom are Israelis, I think believe were either killed on October 7th, their bodies taken to Gaza to trade or they died in captivity.

We will have a couple of showers and storms possible early in the afternoon, just south of that path of totality, and then we will find the storms really flourish after that. So later in the evening, if you're traveling out of Dallas, that is where we will have the pretty intense storm. So, you're looking at some clouds mostly cloudy conditions as Dallas hits that totality at about 1:40 in the afternoon and then the eclipse ends at three o'clock, and the storms really fire up after that. Nationwide, you've got some of these showers that really kind of line that path just to the south there, so we will have some clouds in the Ohio Valley. It looks a little bit clear up in New England. As far as those clouds go, here is a look. Look at all the clouds across the Southern Plains from Texas into Arkansas, some more clearing over the Ohio Valley and then you've got some clearer skies up in New England. So, for a place like Indianapolis, right? We have just talked about all the clouds in Dallas and you can see them there, hour by hour, Indianapolis looks like you get a little bit more clearing.

They are back down to one forty now that they're trying to recover that power for some people, but the energy company has again preemptively shut off the power.Look at some of these wind gusts. White Ranch, 96 miles per hour; Buckeye, 91 mile per hour wind gusts in Colorado; Rocky Flats, 88 miles per hour. Even parts of Oklahoma has seen some gusts over 60 miles per hour. We still have some high wind warnings in effect for parts of Colorado and Nebraska, and Kansas as well, but they are continuing to be dropped as we go through the day today because those wind will really start to relax. So you can see, we can still find some gusts, twenty, thirty, forty miles per hour from North Platte back towards Denver, Garden City there, but they do kind of calm down, relax, and ease up the wind conditions should be better as we continue to go through the day today and into tomorrow, so that's some good news for people that are still in the dark. Now, we also have some dry air in place with these incredibly gusty winds and what that does is that sparks fire conditions when you have the dry air, the dry ground, an incredibly gusty wind, so again, not great news for people in Texas that have already dealt with significant fires earlier this year.",

However, they have been putting out statements, talking about how this will give them the funds to carry them through this election cycle, and Donald Trump on social media yesterday saying: \"It is the biggest night in fundraising of all time.\" He went on to compare his fundraising haul to the amount of money one that President Biden brought in in his recent star-studded fundraiser with Presidents Biden and Clinton -- excuse me Clinton and Obama.
