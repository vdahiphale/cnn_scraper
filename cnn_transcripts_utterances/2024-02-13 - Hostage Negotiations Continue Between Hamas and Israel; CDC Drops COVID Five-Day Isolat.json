So we have got my two friends back here. These snowmen have a snowman one, snowman two. Their names are Joe and Jeff, by the way. They have really dotted the landscape here across Central Park. A lot of kids, including all of New York public schools, were moved to remote learning today. And I think a lot of people taking advantage of the snow day the best that they could, and getting out and sledding. So, yes, we like to see that, but this was an impactful storm. We know that over 1,000 flights were canceled up and down the Eastern Seaboard, snowfall totals still being calculated, although just within the past five minutes, the winter storm warning, which was 744 days in the making for Manhattan, where I'm located, has now been canceled. So did we get the most snow in the past two years? Well, we're waiting for that update from the National Weather Service, but one thing I can tell you, Hartford, West Hartford, Connecticut, the big winner out of this snowstorm as it draws to an end, 15.2 inches of snow. That's a significant and impactful nor'easter, to say the least, other totals above a foot in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, even portions of New York near Chester as well. But look at the radar. You can see just how quickly the storm entered into the equation, has now exited the East Coast, with the exception of Rhode Island and Eastern Massachusetts, where things are still coming down at quite a pace, about one to two inches an hour across this location. But, clearly, into Philadelphia and New York City, things have come to an end, and this snowstorm will start to move away very, very quickly. Nonetheless, it is a winter wonderland, snow globe in real life, and it's made for a beautiful scene. People in New York are coming out, enjoying it. They're on skis, some of them actually out running in shorts as well. So that's just the reality of the situation -- Jim. (CROSSTALK)",

But our own CNN's Miguel Marquez at another location caught up with Tom Suozzi in Westbury, which is not far from here, making a series of campaign stops. He asked Suozzi whether the snow helps him, and he gave a thumbs-up. That could be in part because of the more than 80,000 early and -- early and in-person -- early in-person and mail-in votes that have been cast. More of them were cast by Democrats. And so, for the Democrat, having banked more Democrat votes would be a good thing. But they're hoping that as this storm moves out, as we just heard from our weather reporter, that people will start coming out. I can say that we have numbers from Nassau County showing, as of 12:00 p.m., about 15,000 people had voted in Nassau County. I can tell you that, at this particular polling location, it's been incredibly slow. Same for the earlier location we were at, the middle school. You can see not a lot of people in here. I have spoken to each of these desks, which represent a different district. Each of them at around 12:30 had seen roughly 40 voters, which is a fraction, maybe 10 percent of what they would usually see by the hour, six hours, 40 voters. Usually, they see something like 400 voters an hour during the weekday when they were having early voting. But people are paying attention and coming out from this race because they can't avoid it. There has been a massive amount of spending on ads that have blanketed the airwaves, mostly talking about immigration when it comes to Mazi Pilip, hitting Tom Suozzi, saying he's soft on the border, Suozzi trying to paint Mazi Pilip as someone whose views aren't well-known. We caught up with two voters who just cast their ballots. Take a listen to what they said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So I think the voting was very slow this morning, but the snow has dissipated, the temperatures are rising and the streets are clear. And I expect that there will be a lot of people coming out to vote now that the weather's gotten better. And I think it bodes well for Mazi Pilip. I think she will win.
