I know you just flew in from your district in Massachusetts. What are you hearing from your constituents? I know you spent the week there, of course. It was July 4th recess.REP. JAKE AUCHINCLOSS (D), MASSACHUSETTS: The president is right that 14 million Democrats, including many in Massachusetts, voted for him to be the Democratic nominee and they knew he was old and that he wasn't getting any younger. He's not Benjamin Button. And so the party should walk humbly in asserting any will contrary to the will of the voters. I do think there are concerns. There are concerns about the debate performance. There are concerns about his ability to beat Donald Trump in what is an existential election in November. And ultimately, while there's going to be a lot of focus on Beltway conversations this week, there's going to be a dynamic discussion in the House Democratic Caucus. The opinion that really matters right now is Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, where the president is in worse shape right now than he was four years ago. We, as a party, have to acknowledge that. And we need to make a strong case collectively with unity about how we are going to outperform current expectations. And ultimately, I don't think it's a question of who is the best Democratic candidate. The answer to that is that Donald Trump is the best chance we have of beating Donald Trump because he is historically unpopular. And voters do not like his agenda for Project 2025, where we're going to see undermining civil military relations, where we're going to see the politicization of basic services and attack on women's reproductive health care. That is the case that we have to make as a party.",

They're trying to defund the FBI. They're nominating a convicted felon. Democrats have a strong case to make on law and order, but we have to make it in a sharp fashion.",

We were right. And they deleted and destroyed all of the information. They should go to jail for that. If a Republican did that, they'd go to jail. (END VIDEO CLIP) MJ LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: I mean, this is the issue that the Biden team would like to be talking about the most. They want to be constantly talking about how Donald Trump is reckless, is dangerous, is a threat to all democratic norms and wanted that to be a standout moment from the debate last month. And instead, they've spent the last 10 days questioning whether President Biden is even going to remain in the race. And by the way, I mean, we're not even going to remember this at this point, but when the Biden campaign was doing their best to spin the results of the debate the night of, this was one of the issues, the January 6th issue. The issue of Donald Trump making these kinds of threats was one of the issues that the campaign did say fared the best, was among the best moments for the president. But, of course, again, we've not spent really any time talking about that because his performance was so terrible. PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CHIEF DOMESTIC CORRESPONDENT: Can I make a couple points here about why this moment for the former president is very different than in 2016 or even during his four years in office, where he was repeatedly, despite what Marco Rubio said, he repeatedly raised in private meetings, according to multiple people I spoke to, the potential prosecution of Hillary Clinton. He repeatedly raised the potential prosecution of John Kerry. He repeatedly raised the potential prosecution of James Clapper and other intelligence officials. So he did actually raise this.
