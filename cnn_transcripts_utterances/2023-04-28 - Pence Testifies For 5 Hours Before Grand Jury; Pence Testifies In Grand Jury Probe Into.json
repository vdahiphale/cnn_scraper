The Pence's testimony marks a pivotal moment in the special counsel investigation.Plus, taking a stand. Conservative lead legislators in South Carolina and Nebraska say no to stricter abortion laws. It's the latest whiplash moment as Republicans wrestle with their Roe era promises to one day ban abortion in the post-Roe world where they actually can. And a heavyweight Senate showdown now brewing in West Virginia. The Republican Governor Jim Justice announces his run for Joe Manchin's seat. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. JIM JUSTICE, (R) WEST VIRGINIAN SENATE CANDIDATE: How in the world do you think we're perceived with our allies? I mean, look what happened in Afghanistan. Look what's going on at the border. Look what's going on with inflation. Look what's going on with energy. It's just all over the park. We're going to have to do something about it. And we're going to have to elect somebody that has done it. My dad would say, son, you're done, done it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That's how long the former Vice President Mike Pence spent yesterday before the federal grand jury investigating his former boss and his potential 2024 rival, that would be Donald Trump. Pence in the witness chair after a lengthy court battle over the scope and limits of his testimony.Pence in the witness chair after a judge said, he could be asked about direct conversations with then President Trump, who we know repeatedly pressured his vice president to help him find a way anyway, to ignore Joe Biden's 2020 win and to stay in power. It is an unprecedented moment in the American legal system, and perhaps assigned the sprawling special counsel investigation is nearing decisions time. With me in studio to share their reporting and their insights, CNN's Dana Bash, CNN's Evan Perez, and our CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig. Evan, let's start with you. We know the special counsel is looking into Trump's effort to overturn the election results. How that effort might have resulted contributed to the January 6 attack at the Capitol? The fake electors plot. You're trying to essentially defraud the United States government is one of the questions there. Did they commit wire fraud by defrauding donors, by raising money off people saying it was to contest an election that they knew they had lost. The vice president was in on so much. Oval Office meetings, not just around January 6, but from election day up to January 6, publicly, he says the American people deserve the truth. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And what's fascinating is obviously the context here is that Donald Trump, well, none of us and certainly Donald Trump, more importantly, they do not know what Pence said during those five hours with the grand jury.And that's key because if there's been a lot of suspicion in Trump world, that the former vice president and certainly his aides had been a lot more helpful to prosecutors than, you know, that defiant tone you've heard from Pence where he said, you know, he didn't want to help the Joe Biden Justice Department. And of course, his lawsuit where he was trying to limit some of the testimony on the Speech or Debate Clause, right? Once he is behind those closed doors, it's only him and he can be as helpful as he wants to be, or as not helpful. And the suspicion in Trump world is that he's been a lot more helpful, partly because you've seen sort of this evolution with Mike Pence where he's now much more comfortable saying those things, that you know, after all, he was the victim of a crime that day, right? [12:05:00] Those people were there, shouting to lynch him. So that's what's fascinating about what happened yesterday.

The conversations between Mike Pence and Donald Trump, Donald Trump is not going to be testifying in this grand jury. And so, he's the only person who can really give it to you.

That's not admissible in court, you would have to call Mike Pence as your witness. Same thing with his book. Yes. He's written to some extent, his own carefully selected extent about those crucial conversations in his book, but you can't read the book to a jury and a book is only an inch deep. So, he is the only one who can give those answers and he can give us Trump's intent.

And what Elie said, is so important that, you know, most of us don't know what it's like to testify before a grand jury, but to know that he is there alone, his lawyer isn't there. There's nobody there to say I'm sorry, you know, object, objection or anything like that. He's just -- he's on his own. He's obviously a very confident guy in the kinds of questions that he wants to answer. And he clearly did some prepping, a lot of prepping, I'm sure with his lawyer. But you're exactly right. What he says behind closed doors, is anybody's guess, his aides will say, and have said since yesterday. Well, he's got nothing to hide, suggesting that he answered all the questions, and that everything is in his book.

Republicans have stood in the way. We had two states on Thursday, both failed to pass that severe abortion restriction legislation, both of them by just one vote. In Nebraska, it came down to trying to stop a filibuster and it failed by one vote, because there were two senators who abstained from the vote, John? One of those was actually a sponsor of the original bill, an 80-year-old Republican senator who attempted to put in an amendment after he said that he had fought on the process more to make it a 12- week restriction. That amendment didn't get a vote. So, he abstained from the vote. Both of them are likely dead for this legislative session. But that doesn't mean abortion is necessarily dead, John, especially in South Carolina where the Senate did pass a six-week abortion ban, but the House would have to take it up.

Florida, the Governor DeSantis six-week ban, but it's still in process. The courts have to review it. So, it's still a 15-week stay. And you see the orange states, where the six weeks just one state, there're the state of Georgia. But this is a test. You have these now conservatives in South Carolina and Nebraska standing up and saying well, we're going too far.

They for years said, if you only repeal, if the court would only repeal Roe, we would do this. Now they have to face a choice. BASH: Right. It's the cliche that we heard since Roe was repealed, which is they are the dogs who caught the car. And they're trying to figure out still what to do with it in every single state because it is a state issue. But I think you're right. Yes, there are more and more Republicans in in the states, like Dianne was just reporting about. Speaking out saying, wait, wait, wait, we've gone too far. But there are others because this is not just a political issue. This is a fundamental philosophical issue for so many Republicans, that they just oppose any abortion at all. It's not that simple to make a political calculus for a lot of these Republicans, particularly in the legislatures, particularly in the most conservative of states. They say, you know, many of them if -- they had their druthers, they would completely ban abortion, because that's effectively what a six- week ban is.
