      "sentences": "In 2024, Russia`s war against Ukraine is as brutal as it ever has been. Both sidesare still taking heavy casualties and the battles are ferocious. The action has somewhat shifted though, from the south of the country, more towards the Southeast and the east of the country. The Russians have unleashed another massive aerial campaign against sites here in Ukraine using drones, ballistic missiles, and also cruise missiles. The Ukrainians, though, now also fighting back, hitting some targets in Russia, like for instance, the Belgorod region, where there have been some evacuations. Western military support for Ukraine will continue to be essential for the country, but it is far from a certain thing, especially aid from the United States where U.S. Congress still has not okayed further military aid for Ukraine. There is the European Union where a decision on further military aid was blocked by the Hungarian. So it`s unclear when exactly that could come through, even though the countries themselves, the single countries could continue to give Ukraine military aid and are continuing to do so. The Russians certainly seem to have replenished their ranks after taking heavy losses in 2023. The Russians also appear to have new tanks and armored vehicles. One of the other things that we`re seeing is that the Russians are firing a lot of artillery on the frontline and a different picture for the Ukrainians, especially ammunition is something that they`re having a lot of trouble with. They certainly need those replenishment. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Pop quiz, hot shot. Which of these words is associated with pigs. Boerboel, bovine, pachyderm, porcine?If you pondered porcine, put your hooves up. While boerboel is a type of dog. Bovine relates to cattle and pachyderms are thick skinned, hoofed animals like elephants, rhinos and hippos. Porcine relates to or suggests piggies. For our next story, we turn to a controversial solution to an ongoing health dilemma. One for which pigs may be the answer. We`re talking organ transplants. Now, each organ inside our body has a specific function, right? And sometimes due to disease accident or other reasons, it doesn`t work properly and needs replacement. So during organ transplantation surgeons carefully remove a healthy organ from a donor and place it in the body of someone in need. It can be difficult to find a matching organ as there is a big gap between supply and demand for organs needed to save lives. But the company eGenesis is working on a solution that might end organ shortage in the future. On their research farm, they`re raising pigs that could become organ donors in the future. CNN Chief Medical Correspondent, Sanjay Gupta got a first look at a facility few other people have seen before. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): These pigs could one day provide a nearly endless supply of organs to save humans. Mike Curtis is my guide today. He is CEO of eGenesis. That`s a company devoted to raising pigs to try and solve the organ shortage crisis.",

GUPTA (on camera): And I should just point out that I walked into a room, turned on a filter, essentially clean the air for five minutes before I could then go shower. That`s why my hair is wet. I`ve -- I`ve washed myself. I put on everything new here, including underwear, socks, shoes, everything is different just to be in this room, gives you an idea of just how clean it is in here and how important that is. (Voice-over): It`s more than I typically do to prep for the operating room, all of it to protect the pigs from us. (On camera): I got to tell you, I did not know what to expect. It`s powerful just to be here with these pigs. (Voice-over): This pig has 69 different gene edits making it among the most genetically modified mammals on the planet. They do all of this with the help of CRISPR, the gene editing tool that allows scientists to manipulate the cell`s DNA, knocking out or adding in genes. In this case, to make a pig`s organs more compatible with the human recipient.",

I mean the culmination of all these Nobel prize discoveries, but it comes with its ethical challenges as well. How much should we be manipulating the genome and of another species? How much should we be relying on animals to preserve and protect human life? I mean, these are ethical challenges and even the facility that you just saw there, we couldn`t tell you exactly where it was located because there have been security concerns. But at the same time, this is happening. And as you heard, it`s happening pretty quickly, perhaps over the next couple of years, we`re going to hear more and more about animal organs being transplanted into humans. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And the idea is surgeons go into somebody`s skull, open up their dura and their brain, put the device in there, make sure the electrodes go down a few millimeters into the brain. So everything back up and there`s a battery pack in it. It will recharge wirelessly and it will communicate wirelessly with an outside device that can control, say a computer cursor or an iPad.
