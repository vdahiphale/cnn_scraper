As McCarthy watched ballot after ballot after ballot fail, he sat there in the House chamber, at times laughing, looking amused or whispering to a senior aide sitting next to him.But while McCarthy appeared to laugh off - laugh it off in front of the cameras, he is facing a real threat from the divisions within his own party when it comes to this second bid for House speaker. The last time McCarthy wanted to be speaker, he bowed out before the voting had even started. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA) (October 8, 2015): We should put this conference first. And I think there's something to be said for us to unite. We probably need a fresh face. I'll stay on as majority leader. But the one thing I found in talking to everybody, if we are going to unite and be strong, we need a new face to help do that. So, nothing more than that. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
