KRISTI NOEM (R-SD): Prior to this week, we already knew that President Donald Trump was a fighter. He is the toughest man that I have ever met. Nobody has endured more than what he has gone through. They've attacked his reputation. They impeached him. They tried to bankrupt him, and they unjustly prosecuted him.

So, I think it was Trump's party, and it's a party that feels confident enough that they can try to make inroads into the Democratic coalition, which in fact, polling shows that they are in position to do and that is the main reason why he's in a stronger overall position than he was at this point in 2020.",

Obviously got turbocharged. Now, you know, we don't know anything about the motive of the -- of the shooter, what we do know, you know, does not accord with the narrative that somehow this is the left targeting Donald Trump. In fact, you know, neighbors were telling Pittsburgh television, they saw Trump signs in front of the house, but I think at the least it does that. Second, it does complicate for Democrats, the democracy argument, you know, what you saw the president today kind of struggling in his interview with Lester Holt to figure out exactly how to talk about, you know, Donald Trump and his relationship to democracy. I mean, Donald Trump is still the same person who said his opponents are communists and Marxist and fascists and live in this country like vermin. You know, that is still Donald Trump, the Republican platform still talks about mass deportation. So, everything that was true about Donald Trump before the shooting is true after the shooting, the challenge of how you express that in this environment, I think is going to be an issue for Democrats. But I also think that, you know, any more than the debate, I'm not sure this fundamentally changes the dynamic Trump is ahead, because voters are dissatisfied with Biden's performance, and two thirds of them think he is too old, Biden has an uphill climb if Democrats stick with him, but I'm not sure this fundamentally puts the race out of reach as some Republicans are saying, particularly if Democrats do switch their nominee which looks less than less likely.",

State and local law enforcement is primarily positioned within the middle perimeter and the outer perimeters and the Secret Services responsible for identifying those risks, like direct line of sight, elevated buildings, similar to where the shooter positioned himself to carry out the attack.

      "sentences": "A federal judge in Florida on Monday dismissed the classified documents case against Donald Trump. It's a surprising ruling that for now, clears away one of the major legal challenges facing the former president. It was a 93-page ruling from Judge Aileen Cannon and she said that the appointment of Special Counsel Jack Smith violated the constitution because he was not confirmed by the U.S. Senate. And she didn't rule on the specifics of the charges that Trump faces for allegedly mishandling classified documents. Now, it is a ruling that goes against rulings by multiple other judges in and other similar cases which have upheld the legality of special counsels. Cannon wrote, \"In the end, it seems the executives' growing comfort in pointing regulatory special counsels in the more recent era has followed an ad hoc pattern with little judicial scrutiny.\"The special counsel's office says that the Justice Department has approved plans to appeal Cannon's ruling. They said, \"The dismissal of the case deviates from the uniform conclusion of all previous courts to have considered the issue that the attorney general is statutorily authorized to appoint a special counsel.\" Now, Smith had charged Trump last year with taking classified documents from the White House and for obstructing the government's attempts to retrieve those materials. He has pleaded not guilty. The former president also faces charges brought by Smith in Washington, D.C. for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. A judge there had rejected the same Trump claims over Smith's appointment. Evan Perez, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

This federal judge appointed by Trump in 2020 has dismissed Trump's classified documents case and in her ruling, Judge Cannon said the clerk is directed to close the case, any scheduled hearings are canceled. Her reason was that the appointment of Special Counsel Jack Smith violated the constitution. Explain why.MOSS Yes. So the crux of the challenge that Donald Trump was bringing in this particular motion was the idea that the appointment of Jack Smith as special counsel, through the special counsel regulations, was unconstitutional in the sense that it violated what's known as the appropriations clause and the appointments clause. Specifically, what Judge Cannon focused on was the idea that Jack Smith was improperly appointed, that the Justice Department doesn't have the authority, absent some kind of delegation from Congress, to create that role and specifically not for someone who is at that time a private citizen. This ruling rather controversial in the sense that it flies in the face of decades of precedent, institutional precedent, case law, policy, as recently as the Mueller probe during the Trump presidency, this very same issue was litigated with someone who was at the time of private citizen and it was upheld. This flies in the face of everything that had previously existed. It will automatically be appealed, but it's going to take time and delay is Donald Trump's best friend. KINKADE: Yeah. As you say, we've seen so many administrations do this in the past. In terms of the appeal, the Justice Department has already said it's going to appeal. On what grounds?",

It's over against Donald Trump and his co- defendants. It's all based on the idea of whether or not the government had the authority through Jack Smith to bring the case itself. So they're going to bring this now to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals to review the legal appropriateness of Judge Cannon's ruling. The Eleventh Circuit has already previously twice ruled against Judge Cannon in this matter. That was during the pre- indictment phase, when she tried to point a special master, they rejected her on that. It's almost certain that they will reverse her here. But if they do, no matter who wins or loses at the Eleventh Circuit, the loser will appeal to the supreme court.",

That whole report that was issued, all of the subpoenas that are coming out from Congress, trying to get tapes from the Justice Department, according to Judge Cannon, the Robert Hur investigation would be unconstitutional, illegal as well, and that whole report is apparently a nullity because that would have been an improper appointment. This is what happens when judges -- these random rogue district court judges, issue these rulings flying in the face of established precedent and established policy.
