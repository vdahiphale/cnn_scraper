A tentative framework has been reached, but the two sides have yet to sign on.Yesterday, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met with the Qatari Prime Minister to push the process forward. And this week, Secretary of State Antony Blinken will return to the Middle East. Now, this visit comes as Axios is reporting that the State Department is going to start a review that could open the door to the United States recognizing a Palestinian state. Barak Ravid of Axios broke that story and he joins us now. Barak, walk us through what this review entails.",

So I think that something like a week or two weeks ago, Secretary Blinken ordered the State Department to start a series of reviews around the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. And as one U.S. official told me, since the war in Gaza broke, all of the old paradigms and old policies are up in the air and there's more willingness to review all of them, including the issue of whether the U.S. should recognize a Palestinian state this way or another, directly or indirectly, bilaterally or through the U.N. And this work is being done right now at the State Department and its results will be presented to Secretary Blinken, I think, in the coming weeks.",

Hundreds of thousands of people no longer have a home. Many have resorted to eating grass and drinking polluted water. And hospitals are buckling.Doctors Without Borders recently got access to al-Shifa Hospital, Gaza's largest medical facility, for the first time since November. And their conclusion is that it's barely functional. We're joined now by the Executive Director of Doctors Without Borders, USA, Avril Benoit. Avril, thank you so much for being with us. What more can you tell us about what your colleagues witnessed at al-Shifa and just more broadly, the hospital system in Gaza?",

It was a very, very harrowing journey, trying to pass through not only difficult checkpoints, but also thousands of people surrounding the convoy that was transporting only fuel, people who were desperate for food and water just to survive, and incredibly disappointed that they weren't bringing food and water.By the time they reached the hospital, where some doctors from Doctors Without Borders have been continuing to volunteer for some time, they found a hospital that was filled with around 50,000 people sheltering in there. Hardly any materials to be able to treat the wounded that continued to come in. Barely any electricity to be able to monitor vital signs of severely wounded people. Operating rooms hardly functioning at all, but yet trying to do the best they could with what little they had left. So a harrowing situation with a lot of desperate people.",

And this has to do with these allegations by Israel that appear to be quite credible, that 13 staffers were involved in the October 7th attack. UNRWA obviously, it partners with a lot of non-profits as well. Are you seeing yet the effect of that pause in funding? BENOITstart to really slow down. But let's remember that this really is a lifeline. This is the only organization that is being able to do the big convoys, the transportation, doing the best they can alongside their various partner agencies, such as the World Health Organization that we work with. We're extremely worried. I mean, the consequences of a reduction of capacity of the United Nations will be catastrophic and will have a direct impact on the suffering of people in Gaza, who, of course, are experiencing this collective punishment with a total siege.",

And especially without a ceasefire, this is one of the things we've been calling for from the beginning.We are working in hospitals, such as Nasser Hospital, hospitals in Khan Younis, hospitals in the south, where people were told to flee. And as our medical teams are working in these hospitals that are full of patients, 300 percent capacity, beds overflowing, call ways overflowing, discharging patients who are not really ready to be discharged just because you have to make more room. We hear explosions all around. Our team in Nasser Hospital, for example, is there with a lot of patients and their families, unable to even evacuate to follow the orders because there's so much insecurity right around the hospital. There's just no way you can move so many hundreds of people safely through that. And so the ceasefire is what we really need to be able to deliver aid properly to those who need it most throughout the Gaza Strip.",

And for sure, we make a point of never working in a hospital that's become militarized, that's being used to launch rockets, that's being used to harbor weapons or troops.I mean, this is not something that we would ever accept, because it increases the risks to that medical facility. There shouldn't be armed people inside a medical facility, and that's a message to everyone. And it's important for us to always uphold that, because we believe very firmly that a hospital facility, and also an ambulance or a clinic, should be a sanctuary, a place where people can find safety. Unfortunately, the conduct of this war is such that no place in Gaza is safe from the constant bombardment, attacks, orders of evacuation amidst all kinds of insecurity and threats around these hospitals. So again, the ceasefire is what we're calling for. It's essential to be able to maintain the humanitarian assistance and to deliver it properly within those medical spaces that should be protected at all times.",

And so, they were found on December 4th in the early morning hours on a mattress. You're looking at this video right now. This is body cam footage. That's James Crumbley in the blue there. They're allegedly woken up. Prosecutors are trying to say that they were awake when this happened, but they are arresting them right then and there. And they are going to be taken back to Oakland County authorities. But that was the beginning of those formal charges for the Crumbleys. Now, what we believe may be the last text that they had with their son, because remember, they haven't seen their son since this happened. But they had text to him that day of November 30th. Ethan, don't do it. Father saying, call me and somebody else saying, hey, did you get shot? So those are the communications from Ethan's phone.",
