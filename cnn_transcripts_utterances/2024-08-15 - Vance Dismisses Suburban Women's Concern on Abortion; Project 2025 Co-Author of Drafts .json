She obtained footage that was obtained by a non-profit that showed Russ Vought, who was a member of the Trump administration the last time around. Has been talked about as a potential chief of staff. He's caught on video talking about drafting hundreds of private documents to lay the groundwork for a second Trump term.And in that video, he talks about this proposal that Trump has talked about, the largest deportation in history as they describe it. And he -- and Vought says in this video, once you start that, there's going to be, he says, a debate along the way about what that looks like. And he says, that's going to cause us to get off of multiculturalism. He also goes on to say, are we designed to be a Christian nation or are we allowed to ask about Sharia law? What do you make of some of those comments and Trump attempting to distance himself from Project 2025 when a key supporter of his, Russ Vought, has been pretty heavily involved in it?",

And every American needs to be fully informed of what's inside that terrifying document and understand that under a Trump-Vance administration, that will mean that every aspect of our lives is controlled, especially if you are a woman in America, but also what it means for our economy and immigration, because those two issues are completely linked together, immigration and the economy.Donald Trump has talked about a massive deportation operation, something similar to what happened during the Eisenhower administration. I want to remind Americans, especially Latinos that under the Eisenhower administration 60 percent of the people who were deported were U.S. citizens and people who were here legally. Under Trump's Project 2025, they lay out the fact and they make very clear they intend to deport legal immigrants as well. But this new development and Trump trying to distance himself from it, he cannot distance himself from it. In fact, J. D. Vance wrote the forward. His vice president wrote the forward to the document, and they're trying now to keep a lot of this under the cover of darkness. We have to shine the sunlight on all of their plans. So, not only would it be just an absolute return to a very dark period in American history, but the impact on the economy would be devastating. In fact, that's part of the reason why 16 Nobel prize winning economists have called Trump's plans on an inflation bomb.",

That is from the Associated Press, citing a law enforcement source. CNN Correspondent Omar Jimenez joins us now. Omar, this was a concern for weeks now that perhaps there might be some arrests coming, that there might be something going on other than just Matthew Perry dying from an overdose.

      "sentences": "Yes, Jim, not surprising. I think it's a very important responsibility of law enforcement to get at the nature of how someone may have gotten their hands on a substance like this. Was it prescribed? Was it not prescribed? Did a doctor supply it? We don't know. Speculation. Were there friends involved? Were there other associates that might have been involved to get it to him? And so, I think those questions are really unearthed by law enforcement through search warrants.What law enforcement does, and in this case, sure, no different, is you look at computers, you look at phones, you look at any other types of devices that could have a trail. A trail with respect to who's supplying it? How'd you get it? When did it come into your hands? How are you using it? Was it a non-controlled environment? And so, I think that through the press conference that will -- it'll be revealed, Jim, what particularly those sources were and what the basis for this arrest was. Who was this individual that was arrested? What connection did they have to this? How did they supply him with it? What role did they have in that regard? And then, of course, we know that could lead to significant criminal culpability, and it may not be just one, it may be several people that were involved. And so, I'll be looking in that press conference for all of those dynamics, and we'll see what specifically investigators and prosecutors released and what they hold back.",

      "sentences": "Yes, that is the major question. I want to jump off of one thing that Joey said as well, is that there's a question, of course, where Matthew Perry would have gotten the ketamine that was in his system. And at the time, he was reported to be receiving ketamine infusion therapy for depression and anxiety, but one thing that the autopsy notes as well, that the last known treatment was a week and a half prior to his death. So, that's well beyond the time it would have still been in his system if we are going for that particular treatment.So, again, that source of where this actually came from is, we do again from what law enforcement had said previously, that was likely going to be the center of any potential criminal investigation. And so, that will likely be the center of what we find out today. And again, we know at least of one arrest. But the DEA and the Postal Inspection Service had also been involved in the investigative side of things as they typically do for federal law enforcement. They are -- have been especially tight lipped on what their involvement or the range of their involvement was over the course of this. But if they're involved, that's likely means they're looking outside of the scope of just a particular city jurisdiction. So, we'll see what ends up coming, and if we get new details on that side of things about what federally investigative wise may have come from this.",

It shows the prisoners of war lined up in along the road. This comes as Putin is pulling troops out of Ukraine to shore up defenses at home in an attempt to counter Ukraine's surprise assault.Ukraine now claims to occupy nearly 400 square miles of Russia. It marks the first-time foreign troops have entered that country since World War II. Joining me now, CNN Global Affairs Analyst Kim Dozier and former NATO Supreme Allied Commander Wesley Clark. General Clark, I'm sure you've been watching all of this and finding it just as fascinating as Kim and I have been fascinated by this. We were talking about it during the commercial break. What is your sense of what's happening right now? What I read is that Ukraine is not doing this for the purposes of capturing territory, this is basically a defensive operation. What's your sense of it? GEN. WESLEY CLARK (RET.), FORMER NATO SUPREME ALLIED COMMANDER:  It is a defensive operation in the sense that it will create a buffer zone. It also moves their drone capability deeper into Russia. It also provides potentially bargaining material. And it draws Russian forces away from other efforts elsewhere on this thousand-kilometer front. So, it has multiple purposes. I think the Ukrainians are still trying to advance, so we haven't seen the end of this.",

They've heard no such escalatory language, and that sort of takes away the excuse that White House officials had used with Ukrainians over and over and over.I talked to European officials, Ukrainian officials who say, look, every time we asked to use U.S. weapons inside Russia, we got back this pushback that it might trigger a nuclear response. That hasn't materialized, even with Ukrainian troops taking a large chunk and so far, holding it and putting in the kind of fortifications that make it look like they're going to stay a while.",

They have pulled in reserves, which has benefited our defense forces in other areas, because it's become easier to work there.

The Ukrainians have done a good job with electronic warfare. They've done a great job with drones, but the U.S. is still withholding the longer- range assets on some of these missions. And this is a moment to really leverage the Ukrainians advance not only for what it could do for Ukraine, but what it can do to deter China, which is watching closely American actions.",
