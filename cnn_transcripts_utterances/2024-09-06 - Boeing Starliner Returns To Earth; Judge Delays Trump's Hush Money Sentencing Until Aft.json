NASA just gave it the final go ahead. So, if all goes well, we'll see it land back on solid ground in New Mexico within the very hour. I'll be your pilot for live coverage here on CNN as it all happens before us.Now remember, the capsule is coming back empty, un-crewed, in NASA speak. And yes, you're remembering it correctly, this is the capsule that wasn't supposed to be un-crewed. It was supposed to have two astronauts coming back home in it, Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore. And they are staying put on the International Space Station. As you know, in fact, they'll be there until February. NASA made the decision to keep them there for their safety after lingering issues popped up with the capsule. NASA simply couldn't risk a disaster. Remember, the astronauts got to space on Starliner back in June. It was supposed to be a quick eight days or so. But now, it's going to be more like eight months in space. The return, though, is still a high-pressure moment for both NASA and Boeing with, frankly, billions of dollars on the line. Let's go right to CNN's space and defense correspondent, Kristin Fisher, who's at Johnson Space Center in Houston. Kristin, good evening. Take us what we're going -- through what we're going to see as the Starliner returns to Earth tonight.",

We're going to watch and see what happens here. Kristin Fisher, stand by for us. We're going to check back in with you in a few minutes when they get ready to start moving towards that re-entry phase that you just described.Well, in political news tonight, New York Judge Juan Merchan postponing Donald Trump's sentencing for his hush money criminal conviction. Mind you, it has been rescheduled not once, but twice. In fact, this time, Trump and, frankly, the rest are going to have to wait until after the November election to know what that sentence may be. Judge Merchan seemed eager to avoid any partisan backlash in the final stretch of this unprecedented presidential campaign and stressing in his decision, saying -- quote -- \"The public's confidence in the integrity of our judicial system demands a sentencing hearing that is entirely focused on the verdict of the jury and the weighing of aggravating and mitigating factors free from distraction or distortion.\" I want to bring in former U.S. attorney and deputy assistant attorney general, Harry Litman, and former Miami-Dade County court judge, Jeff Swartz. So glad to have both of you on tonight. Look, judge, I'll begin with you. Judges normally can turn with what they call hints of impropriety, right? A conflict of interest. They might know somebody, a litigant or otherwise. Now, it seems that you got to worry about perceptions of political bias. Should they be thinking about this? Do you agree with his decision to factor that in? JEFF SWARTZ, FORMER JUDGE, MIAMI-DADE COUNTY COURT:  I don't agree with the decision, to be very honest with you. A judge only has one constituency, and that's the law. It does not represent people. It doesn't have a party -- they don't have parties. They're there to enforce the law and the rules against everybody the same. And my feeling is that his position should have been the delays in this sentencing, the delays in this case are by you, sir. They haven't been by the government. They haven't been by the state. And you put yourself in this position. And now you're going to have to listen to the sentence. And if there are consequences, they are consequences that you created. I've been in that position before where I had to make decision against, in this particular case, a very powerful insurance company who didn't like what I was doing. But I followed the law. In the end, it cost me my seat on the bench. But I left the bench with my head held high, and I didn't really care that much because I was that proud of what I had done. I got treated by my colleagues completely differently than I really anticipated I would be, in a good way.",

Can you reconcile why, and these are obviously different judges, different jurisdictions, different cases, all that is quite apparent, but can you reconcile the way of thinking for Merchan versus, say, Chutkan here?HARRY LITMAN, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY, FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL:  Well, look, Chutkan, as she has done the entire time, said no, I'm not thinking about the election. Merchan had the same stance through the trial. I and the judge actually sat close to one another during it. And this came as something of a surprise. And you could almost feel Merchan's kind of loneliness and going back and forth.

Until there is a conviction, that is in the hands of the jury. And then sentencing, the case belongs to the judge at that point, right, to decide all these factors. And so, the waning influences, that goes down.Let me just (INAUDIBLE) on the screen for you, guys. I think that the actual timeline of this case is particularly fascinating on where we are because it was moved not just once, but now twice. You've got in there -- of course, the Supreme Court immunity ruling being a part of this as well. And just look at the original date, would have been July 11th. If you look at July 13th, that was the day of the attempted assassination of Donald Trump, followed by the RNC that following Monday. Just looking about this calendar all the way to November, I think gives really interesting context for the people of the United States to see how this has been conducted so far. But we're still waiting on the big answer, Harry, right? I mean, do you think that there is a chance for a sentence that would include jail? And how would it be carried out, especially given the complications of Secret Service protection and, of course, an election looming in November?",

I think the courts, the Supreme Court, if no other court would find a principal (ph), you cannot put the sitting president of the United States in the pokey. They can't meet with Putin there, etc. But if he's not, I do think he's in hot water. It does in some ways release this burden that was obviously heavy on Merchan's shoulders. And this is the kind of -- it's a judgment call. Many of the of these convictions don't end -- result in jail time.But Trump's conduct, remember, he violated the gag order there over 10 times, he was a generally obstreperous defendant. My best guess, you know it's up to Merchan. My best guess is he will see a short incarceration (ph) sentence for a couple months, anyway. And then parole. You know this as well as I, as the judge.

So, something to watch for.NASA says that there's enough redundancy, there's enough backup thrusters, that it should be okay. But still to have one of the thrusters not firing during that test after other thrusters were having so many issues on the service module as it was approaching the space station back in June, that's part of the reason why NASA said there's just too much uncertainty, there's just too much risk, we don't want to risk putting Butch and Suni on Starliner.

So, I think it helps with the Nikki Haley voters, it gives permission. And I think as many Republicans as Kamala Harris can win over, the better for her, right? I mean, she's an unknown figure right now. People are still trying to figure out who she is. So, she gets some credentials.

And Harris's fundamental choice, she needs to reassemble that Biden coalition. A lot of those people had buyer's remorse after they pulled that Democratic lever. These were the double haters. I think they have another fresh look at Harris. And having that permission structure that you mentioned, Laura, is important.

The charges against him include four counts of involuntary manslaughter, one for each person his son killed.The faculty are saying those numbers, they could have been a lot higher if not for the silent panic button system, the one that alerted police to the horror happening inside the school. You know, it was implemented just one week before the shooting. And it's got many people asking, why isn't this same technology everywhere? Well, it turns out there is an effort to get it into public schools all across this country. You know, several states have now passed legislation that is known as Alyssa's Law. It's named after Alyssa Alhadeff. She was just 14 when she was killed in the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida. Her mother, Lori, has been pushing to get the law passed nationwide. Lori joins me now. Lori, thank you so much for being here with us and for the advocacy that you have been involved in.

In a few minutes, we're going to see a communications blackout between the ground and Starliner for about four minutes due to all the plasma, the really hot plasma that builds up due to friction from the Earth's atmosphere on re-entry. So, this is without a doubt a very critical moment for Starliner. It's the moment that the capsule's heat shield is finally put to the test.But, you know, Laura, the other really big test that NASA, in particular, was so concerned about, Starliner has already passed the flying colors and that was the deorbit burn. You know, NASA was really worried that some of those -- all those issues with the thrusters and the helium leaks might cause some problems with Starliner during the deorbit burn, which is essentially when those thrusters have to fire to perform a braking maneuver and slow the spacecraft down so that it can drop out of orbit and re-enter the Earth's atmosphere. And so, since Starliner had issues with thrusters and helium leaks, they were worried at that moment that it may cause problems during the deorbit burn. But everything performed really, really well during the deorbit burn. And now, we're entering into that other critical moment. So, we should be entering that comms blackout pretty soon. And then, Laura, if all goes according to plan, we'll see the drogue parachutes deploy, then the big main parachutes deploy, and hopefully, a very smooth landing just after midnight Eastern time in White Sands, New Mexico. If all goes according to plan, Laura, it should, I mean, very gently touch down in a breezy four miles per hour. Thanks to those parachutes and thanks to some airbags that are underneath or will be underneath Starliner to really make sure it has a nice landing.

You've got Boeing and SpaceX who doled out these contracts in 2014 to ferry NASA astronauts to and from the International Space Station. So far, only SpaceX has been able to do it.

This spacecraft was launched, quite frankly, with -- this thruster has a known issue, and both NASA and Boeing signed off on that. And so, they're going to really want to get to the root cause of those problems before they put people back in this vehicle again.",

You've got the two astronauts who are still there, Butch and Suni. You're talking, you know, next year, they'll be able to return. They've seen the success of touching down.

There's added risk because there's a problem with the thrusters and we understand it but don't understand how to make sure we can -- that we want -- that everything can go correctly. And so, was it the safest option for bringing them home? No, it wasn't.So, I don't think anyone is shocked to see the successful landing here. And I think it was disappointing for them not to be able to climb in knowing they'd probably be safe on the ground, but it wasn't the right thing to do. So, I'm sure there's a lot of mixed feelings up there in terms of actually just being in space and spending longer. I can't see Garrett's face, but I think if you ask Garrett and I -- (LAUGHTER) -- we'd be up there. And, you know, they've been -- they've been the shepherds of this spacecraft for a long time, for a couple of years now, and not going on flights. And then they were going to come up for eight days. And now, they get to spend months. They're a fully trained crew. They're so good on orbit. And in these past two months with having so many people up there, it's literally a different space station with that to-do list like knocked out of the way. So, I think there's mixed feelings, both on the ground and up in space, but we're always learning. COATES:  That's an important thing. It's kind of like that mindset of I don't have to do it, I get to do it. That's probably the best way to approach that over the next several months for them in particular. And, of course, living your whole life with this passion and now being able to be there must be very exciting under all the circumstances. Eric, we're looking at the success of this particular endeavor, but it's not that Boeing will be left without a black eye in all this.",

At the time, Boeing was really the gold standard in human spaceflight. Everyone at NASA felt that way. SpaceX felt they were kind of taking a flyer on.And now, 10 years later, for SpaceX to have to fly up and bring Butch and Suni back eventually because NASA didn't feel Starliner was safe enough for its crew, that is really a devastating blow to Boeing and its position in spaceflight. So, it's important to see how they recover from this.",

But both can learn from the successes or failures from the other.And in the end, I mean, Kristin, let me go back to you. You have been covering this so closely. You have been our eyes, our ears, our mind on the ground to see this finally come to fruition. This is really fascinating and exciting.",
