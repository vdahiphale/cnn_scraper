      "sentences": "Hello again, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me this Sunday. I'm Fredricka Whitfield.And this just in to CNN, President Donald Trump's former attorney, Michael Cohen now says he has been asked to be at the Manhattan District Attorney's office tomorrow morning as a potential rebuttal witness. The testimony would be part of the probe centering on Trump's alleged role in a hush money payment made to adult film star, Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. Cohen has already pleaded guilty for his role in the payment and served a three-year sentence. These developments come as Trump is calling for mass protests, claiming he expects to be arrested Tuesday over the alleged payment to Daniels' case. In a statement on social media, he urged his supporters to \"protest to take our nation back.\" Trump dialed up the rhetoric with a follow-up post saying, I'm quoting now, \"We just can't allow this anymore. We must save America. Protest, protest, protest.\" The posts are alarmingly similar to his calls for protests prior to January 6, 2021, and have New York Police officials bracing for whatever may happen. CNN's Gloria Pazmino is joining us right now from Manhattan. So Gloria, what more do we know about preparations for the week?",

      "sentences": "Well, Fred, here behind me is New York Criminal Court where on any given day hundreds of people are processed through the criminal system. And next week, former President Donald Trump could be potentially one of those people creating a security and logistical challenge for the City of New York here in Lower Manhattan, one of the most congested areas of the city.What we know is that law enforcement agencies, everyone from the NYPD to Federal officials to the Secret Service, as well as Court officers who provide security inside the Courtroom have all been working together to come up with a plan should this indictment come down next week. Again, it is going to create a logistical nightmare of sorts to ensure that the whole thing can happen securely if the President is in fact facing a possible indictment. Now, needless to say, this would be a historic event, not only a former President but also a current candidate for the White House. You mentioned Donald Trump's social media post yesterday, saying that he would be arrested on Tuesday and asking people to protest, that is adding another layer of security challenges here for the area because should people come in and protest or demonstrate in any way, local officials here will have to ensure that all of that can happen safely. So local authorities are working together. You know, it is going to, if it happens be an indictment unlike any other, but we do understand from our sources that it is possible the former President's indictment would be somewhat expedited. He would be quickly presented in front of a Judge, that's after he surrenders, after he is booked and fingerprinted here in Manhattan Criminal Court. Now, because of that social media post asking for people to protest, District Attorney Alvin Bragg issued a memo to his staff this weekend ensuring them that he is working with local authorities to make sure safety is a priority. I want to read a part of this of that memo, which we obtained saying that he \"... does not tolerate attempts to intimidate our office or threaten the rule of law in New York. Our law enforcement partners will ensure that any specific or credible threats against the office will be fully investigated and that the proper safeguards are in place so all 1,600 of us can have a secure work environment,\" just underlining the fact that even with a potential indictment of a former President, this is still very much a place that will need to continue to operate processing everything that they do here, and it certainly seems like that is going to be a priority for the District Attorney. But all law enforcement agencies working together, monitoring social media as well for any possible threats and looking ahead to this potential indictment next week -- Fred.",

Because they're not doing all this for a misdemeanor, it's going to be a felony.So perhaps the other crime will be a campaign finance violation, but that's a problem because that's a Federal offense. Remember the campaign that Trump had was for President. These are State prosecutors. Can State prosecutors piggyback on a Federal campaign violation? We don't know. It's an unsettled area of the law and we are dealing with an unprecedented action against a former President. So a lot of question marks. I think there could be some surprises, Fred. There could be perhaps a financial crime added to it. Now, that would be a serious felony. It's what happened to Allen Weisselberg, it is what happened with the Trump Organization.

Then it will be up to the Judge to decide the terms of his pretrial release, whether he is allowed on the internet, for example, pending trial. That's where this kind of stuff could be relevant, but I don't think it's going to lead to a charge against Trump or incitement unless something more happens from here on out.",

And you know, they have to go when the evidence and the law requires it, and Manhattan is ready.Now, I think of the four cases, Fred, this is probably the least of the four -- the other ones, the documents at Mar-a-Lago, the Fulton County case, with Fani Willis, the January 6th insurrection -- all of that present better cases than this one, but look, as long as the evidence is there, and the law is there, a prosecutor can go.",

For some Black men, that's simply not enough money for those who want to be the breadwinner for their families, for those who want to build generational wealth, they just simply want to make more money than that. Also, for some Black men, returning back to the classroom just brings back some of the negative trauma they face even as students. There is research out there that says that Black children are disciplined at higher rates than their White classmates. They are referred to law enforcement at higher rates than their Black classmates. Given these racial biases, some Black men do not want to teach in that same environment. Retention also remains a huge issue here. Schools are not equipped or even making the effort to try to retain Black men once they become teachers in the classroom at all.",

Investors and customers pulled their money out of Credit Suisse over the past several days as turmoil swept the global banking industry. Credit Suisse lost 25 percent in shares over the course of the week despite an emergency $54 billion loan. Joining me right now is CNN's Anna Stewart and Ryan Patel, Senior Fellow at Claremont Graduate University. So glad you could both be with us. Anna is on the phone. Anna, let me go to you first, what more are you hearing about this purchase? ANNA STEWART, CNN REPORTER (via phone): Well, we're just learning a little bit more about some of the details behind this takeover, and let's be fair, I mean, all of last week, some of the share price moves we saw in terms of Credit Suisse were extraordinary. The Central Bank of Switzerland tried very hard to restore confidence by extending a 50 billion Swiss franc loan, that's over $50 billion to Credit Suisse, but that wasn't enough. And actually, what was so interesting is liquidity hasn't really been the issue with this bank. This bank not only faces the pressure that the whole sector has faced following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, but also this is a bank that was in the midst of a turnaround. It wasn't doing a particularly good job of it. It has lost a lot of investor confidence already. And there was impatience, you know whether that transformation plan was ever really going to right itself. And looking at the share price on Friday, which dipped again, having taken that massive loan from the Central Bank, it was quite obvious that this weekend, something was going to happen. And one of the options on the table was certainly a takeover. This is huge. UBS, the rival bank in Switzerland is paying three billion Swiss francs. So that is about $3.25 billion for Credit Suisse. It's a lot, but actually, that's about 60 percent less than the bank was worth when markets closed on Friday. The statement we had is bleak. It says Credit Suisse and UBS have entered into a merger agreement with UBS being the only surviving entity. And this was very much done with the intervention of the Swiss government, the Swiss Central Bank, the Swiss market regulator, FINMA. And what's really interesting is that Swiss National Bank is pledging a loan of up to 100 billion Swiss francs. That's double the loan from last week, that's over $100 billion to support the takeover, i.e. they are throwing the kitchen sink at this to ensure that the joined banks survive.",

Let me be clear, emergency rescue, to ensure that there is some stability in the global banking system, this is why it occurred.And just think about how fast the transaction happened, that you had to go through all these skipped steps that they skipped on getting all shareholders approval.

They were already having problems, Credit Suisse already doing that.And so when we start seeing, this guess what happens? The trust from consumers asking questions about banks, should they be taking their money and then all of a sudden, things that -- the risks that many of these executive teams on banks look at, they didn't come up with this, they didn't think there was going to be run or sprint to get their money out of the banks. They were not able to cover it and then it starts to put holes in many of these balance sheets and this is what happened.",

I can tell you right now that we are getting a lot of comments from the likes of the President of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, also the Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and the Fed Chair Jay Powell and honestly the statements are almost identical.

Well, Henry also suffers from a rare neurological disorder, which is a severe type of AHC, in which patients are referred to as a human time bomb. At any moment, Henry can stop breathing on his own, sometimes for up to 15 minutes. He can also have up to 30 life-threatening seizures a day. But Henry can even become paralyzed, which can last for days at a time and there is no way to know when it will happen or if he will survive. No treatment or cure exists for AHC, which affects one in a million people globally. But last year, Henry's parents, Mary and Anthony Saladino launched the nonprofit foundation for Henry to raise $3 million to develop a genetic treatment. And if it works, this type of therapy could be the first to treat AHC as well as several other neurological syndromes, including a rare type of Parkinson's disease. Well, Mary Saladino joins me right now from Burlington, Vermont. Mary first off, you know, how is Henry doing? MARY SALADINO, HENRY SALADINO'S MOTHER: Thank you so much for having us to share Henry's story, and to really shine the light on AHC. Henry is having, I would say a good morning, which is all we can hope for and we never take it for granted. As much as he wished he could pop in to say hello, simulation can be triggering, so my husband is taking care of him, but he says \"Hi, and thank you to everybody.\"",
