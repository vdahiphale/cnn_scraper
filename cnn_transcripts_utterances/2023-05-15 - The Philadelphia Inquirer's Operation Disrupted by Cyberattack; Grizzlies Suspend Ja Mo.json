Alejandro Mayorkas reporting about a 50 percent decrease in that since the expiration of Title 42. But nonetheless, that is providing some of the folks on the ground an opportunity to get their head back up above water to try to catch up with the demand in terms of processing these individuals, because there are overcrowding issues, according to several authorities here in some of those processing facilities responsible for actually getting some of these migrants through the system under the new policy here. And then, of course, the shelter system that provide a moment of respite for these men, women, and children after the processing wraps up and before they continue with their journey. And all you have to do is look behind me. These are human beings, these are migrants that are sleeping under the cover of Red Cross blankets just outside one of the local shelters here, because they're certainly at or near capacity. So with at least temporary sort of respite, so to speak, it's giving an opportunity for them to offer some of those services to those people that were processed before the lifting of Title 42. The reality is, the number that is certainly going to continue to rise is the asylum seekers arriving in cities throughout the country. I have heard from many of these individuals telling me that they hope to make it to Denver, some to Chicago, Los Angeles, and certainly to New York City where I've been covering that for that last year, with these busloads of migrants arriving at Port Authority from 200 to 300 a day.

But for Ja Morant, this is clearly somewhat of a pattern of behavior and it is not that he is breaking the law in Denver. He wasn't charged with anything in that nightclub.

This gun was not brought to the arena, this gun was not pointing to anyone and was not flashed to a teammate at an arena.

Because I know what the reaction was back in March when he was suspended for those eight games. I mean, is there a sense of frustration from what you think?  CHARANIA:  So in March, his teammates came out pretty defiantly in the aftermath and supported Ja Morant. We have not heard from any of his teammates, there have been no tweets. There has been nothing of support since this latest incident. But when it happened the first time, there were conversations even before the incident among his teammates. Steven Adams, who is a veteran leader on the Memphis Grizzlies team, he really approached Ja Morant in that locker room and said, we have to stop going out. We have to stop doing off court behavior that could impact our on court play, a couple of weeks, a week later, Ja Morant has the gun incident in Denver. Now, it is the offseason. So we're not clear how much real communication there has been. There has yet to be any support for Ja Morant in the aftermath. This is a teammate that they're going to lose for a period of time if the investigation proves that this was this was a gun that was displayed over the weekend.

And he, I'm sure can imagine saying on our show, yes, the surge has peaked and then suddenly the surge gets higher and there are even more of an influx of migrants coming to the southern border.So look, this is a very much a fluid situation and there is absolutely no clear answer. And this has been the case for, you know, a decade- and-a-half, maybe even two decades. I've been covering this particularly very, very closely when I was covering Congress full time. There will not be until there is a legislative fix to a very broken immigration system and this is about the biggest political football that there is on Capitol Hill and that's saying something.",

We'll see if that changes as some senators are trying to push something through.Dana, as I was watching yesterday, what I was struck by was Mark Green, who is the Chair of the House Homeland Security Committee, a Republican when you asked him about what Trump said last week to me when he refused to rule out if he is re-elected reimplementing that zero tolerance policy at the border that led to those devastating scenes of families being separated.  This is what Mark Green said about that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
