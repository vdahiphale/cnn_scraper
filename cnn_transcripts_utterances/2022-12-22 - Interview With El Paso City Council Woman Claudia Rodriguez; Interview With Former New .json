I speak to one ofthem, Emmett Lewis, and the director, Margaret Brown, about her documentary, \"Descendant.\" Welcome to the program. I'm Sara Sidner in New York sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. No end in sight for the crisis unraveling at America's southern border as dangerously cold temperatures set in there. Thousands of migrants are gathered at the border, some eagerly awaiting the end of the Trump era border restriction called Title 42. That policy barred asylum seekers from entering the United States on public health grounds and was due to expire yesterday until a last-minute intervention by the U.S. Supreme Court. On the ground, beyond the fences and wall of steel, humanitarian workers describe scenes of intolerable suffering, with families living on the streets and sidewalks, and children sick and hungry. This is just three days away from Christmas as frigid temperatures arrive threatening to increase the suffering. The Biden administration says that it wants the policy to end, just not yet. In the border City of Brownsville, Texas, Correspondent Rosa Flores spoke to a family of migrants from Venezuela about their harrowing journey to the United States, and what awaited them when they finally arrived. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ROSA FLORES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voiceover):  The anticipation building on the Mexican side of the border on the day Title 42 was set to be lifted. These videos shot by a migrant and provided to CNN show migrants in Matamoros using rafts to cross the Rio Grande. Some in the crowd provide commentary, saying, they're tired of the long wait. And that U.S. immigration authorities are watching it all happen. FLORES (on camera):  I'm in Brownsville, Texas. The river is right behind me are drone cameras capturing a similar scene. A large group of migrants on the Mexican side, a large law enforcement presence on the U.S. side. Our cameras were rolling as a group of migrants, including a child, crossed into the United States and turned themselves into authorities. All this contributing to what one law enforcement source says is up to 1,200 migrants turning themselves into border authorities every day in this part of South Texas. FLORES (voiceover):  Border Patrol is dropping off hundreds of them in respite centers, say advocates. Most of them travel out the same day. But local shelters are starting to see an uptick of migrants who can afford to. FLORES (on camera):  So, migrants from all over the world?",

My motherand my father are immigrants, my grandparents. My husband. I'm also have dual citizenship with Mexico. So, this year in El Paso, to have immigrants on a daily basis is a normal thing. However, what's going on now is something that I would say is unprecedented. It's something that we've never seen before. People are sleeping on our streets. People coming in, in droves. And it's freezing in El Paso. I think that also adds to the unprecedent of it. And, you know, we are scrambling to do everything that we can. We are very a hardworking community. We are -- we feel very overtaxed. Having to use money from our general fund to fund what is ultimately the responsibility of the federal government is a very unfair situation for the people of El Paso and for the migrants themselves. I mean, they are being told to come here and we are having to figure out how we can house them, how we can feed them, how we can keep them warm. And right now, we currently have our convention centers set up by FEMA to do a tent city, I guess, and also -- our shelter, I'm sorry. And also, one of the local school districts has stepped up and decided to open up one or two of their old schools that they are no longer using as shelters. We're doing everything that we can. The community is very stressed about it. Our local law enforcement is very stressed out about it. And we feel that, ultimately, this is the responsibility of the federal governments. And instead of sending us millions of dollars, you know, which we're still waiting on, we need them to come here and set up an operation and they need to deal with this directly themselves.",

And WIN, we are the largest provider of shelter and permanent supportive housing to homeless families with children in the city. We, right now, are housing 270 asylum seeking families. In those families, there are 700 children. We expect that number of families who are coming to New York to continue to rise, maybe even again in the thousands. The -- one of the problems is that our shelters system was very full before this happened and it's even more full now, because it's very hard to help these families find permanent housing because they are not eligible for benefits, which means that when these families come, they will be put in hotels, which do not have the services or the trauma informed care that shelters do. And I worry how those families will make out. You know, when you say, all he had was a shirt on his back, that's the reality of these families. When they get off the bus and they have the just the cloths on their back and usually flip-flops, and they're coming to a place where it snows, we've had to provide everything they've needed, including three meals a day, because they don't get qualified for food stamps. To date, we have spent -- and we will continue to do it. But today, we have spent a million dollars more than we are budgeted in our budget because of the complex needs of these families and how they aren't being given status that they qualify for, and that would change everything for us, for them, and for the city.",

He is where the buck stops. And so, I'm curious what you think keeps America from moving forward and having a really clear immigration policy so that the rumors that we just heard from one of the migrants, he thought that the border was literally open and was disappointed and heartbroken when he realized that it wasn't and he brought his whole family and sold everything they had.

The most notable is of him to get Vice President Pence to effectively cancel certain electoral votes. But he also endeavored to try to use some new legal theories that would allow for states to substitute a state legislature's judgment for the electorate's judgment. We got together, a group of us, Republicans and Democrats, and decided that we wanted to rewrite the way that we count electors, the way that we conduct the Electoral College to make it much less likely that any candidate can manipulate that vote, to make it much less likely the wrong president, essentially, is chosen at the Electoral College. And we did that. We came together, wrote a bill that makes clear that the vice president is ceremonial, really cuts down any of the chances that state legislators can substitute their judgment for the electorate. Raises the threshold by which Congress can overturn the judgment of a state's decision. I think it's a really good piece of legislation.

The second thing we should take a look at is the safe storage of firearms. A lot of the shootings are accidental. A lot of the shootings involve a kid taking a weapon from an adult. And that's an area where there might not be as much politics, right, because the gun owners, even NRA members, generally agree that storing weapons safely, locking them up, is important and part of your responsibility.

But, you know, in the last two years, it wasn't just the gun safety bill, it was the chips act. Restarting the American manufacturing industry for microchips. It was the bipartisan infrastructure bill. It's the electoral count act that we just talked about. There are a bunch of Republicans who are willing to work in the Senate. And I think that all springs forth from this sort of desire to show that American democracy is not worth throwing out.",

That's not how it played out. What has happened is, you know, the good paying jobs, the sort of blue collar, aristocratic jobs that used to populate all these small cities in Connecticut left, and the jobs that replace them weren't as good. We also sort of lost our local identity, right? I mean, we don't go to our local butcher or our local grocery, do all of our shopping online. And that sort of identity that we attached to our place that we lived in was healthy. It's been replaced by identity, sometimes political identities that are much less healthy. So, yes. I just think we need to have a really concerted policy of economic nationalism, bringing industry back home, better paying jobs that are things that are available today, but also rebuilding and subsidizing the health of our communities. That means, you know, local small businesses, churches, civic clubs, newspapers. I actually think it makes sense to spend money on those things so as to rebuild our culture and place that has been kind of gobbled up by this antiseptic one size fits all global economy in which our place-based identity is erased and replaced by things that are much more toxic.",

This is happening all over the country, on planes, at airports, people are just, right now, on a very thin wire. I think the consequences certainly sort of leached into our politics, when you have candidates who trade on anger, like Donald Trump did, when people are lonely and thus, more angry, they tend to sort of run a little bit faster to candidates whose bases, whose foundation is built on division. So, yes, I think there is more anger in American culture today. Anger is driving our politics. And it's just no doubt that there is a connection between loneliness and anger.
