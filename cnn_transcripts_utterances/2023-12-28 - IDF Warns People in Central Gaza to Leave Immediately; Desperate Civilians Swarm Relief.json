And in that kind of situation in the past, Israeli governments have gotten entrenched in whatever their current policy is, refusing to change, and that is the last thing that the White House needs the Israelis to do right now when it comes to the campaign in Gaza. KEILAR: We hear from Israeli officials, Kim, they'll say, you know, Israel's not the one getting in the way of getting aid into Gaza. What is the reality of the obstacles of getting much needed aid into Gaza as people there are on the verge of starvation?",

Israel has spoken time and again of using its IDF forces to bring in aid that it's tried to deliver to hospitals, to schools, to various parts of the Strip where it's operating, only to have that blocked by Hamas. Now this is an Israeli claim.The U.N. says that Israel, because of its security checks, is keeping aid from moving fast enough into Gaza through the couple of borders that are open. But Israel says, hey, we've already let a bunch of trucks through, even though we know that some of that aid has gone to Hamas to keep their war effort going.",

And Israeli media are reporting that the intelligence chief is about to present to the war cabinet one of those new Qatari proposals. But the problem is, Israel has been willing to do even up to two weeks of a ceasefire in exchange for a trade of the women and elderly that Hamas still holds. For Palestinian prisoners, including those with, quote- unquote, blood on their hands, those who've been convicted of murders. But so far, Hamas's response has been, we will not stop fighting until Israel agrees to entirely lay down its arms and completely ceasefire.So, at this point, they're at an impasse. Just as Israel gets to what is going to be a really challenging and even more dangerous phase for Palestinians, the more it reaches the south of the Strip, that's where all of the Palestinians have fled to. It's already a densely populated area. So, in some ways, Israeli military analysts are predicting that the most tough part of the fighting is to come.",

He, as a result, walks with two canes and he also uses a special chair to ease discomfort when he sits down. Well, it was that special chair that he tried to set up in the disabled section of the theater and then he was confronted by theater staff. They told him he couldn't set it up. Eventually, police were called and they tried to get him removed, saying that he was trespassing. Ultimately, the reverend left voluntarily and no charges were filed. But he said he was deeply disappointed at how AMC staff handled this. And look at what he had to say. There was somebody there recording the aftermath of this incident. The reverend saying that he tried to offer grace to the staff, but they just refused to do the right thing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REV.

So, he went out there to midfield with the rest of the captains, and he made the call on the coin toss, and he got it right, called tails. But then he said, we want to play defense. Now, by saying that, that means the Packers would have had to play defense to start the game and to start the second half. You're supposed to say, we defer, meaning you want to receive the ball in the second half. Now, luckily, Packers coach Matt LaFleur had already told the officials their plan wanting to defer.
