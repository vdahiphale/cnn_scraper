(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) XI JINPING, CHINESE PRESIDENT (through translator):  We will continue to strive for peaceful reunification with the greatest of sincerity and the utmost effort, but we will never promise to renounce the use of force and we reserve the option of taking all measures necessary. This is directed solely at interference by outside forces and a few separatists seeking Taiwan independence. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And he has proven himself to be the man who can make it happen in the last 10 years.Now, from their perspective, he said all the right things, including a promise to renew economic growth by focusing on innovation. But critics have long said innovation has been stifled under him, precisely because of his government's sweeping crackdown on the private sector, especially on the tech industry. And, of course, the sharp economic slowdown here is also, in large part, due to his insistence on that zero-COVID policy you just mentioned, despite mounting evidence it is not working. But if you listen carefully to what he said, one term he used time and again was to struggle, to fight. He talked about fighting COVID, fighting corruption, fighting separatists in Hong Kong and Taiwan -- and without naming the United States, fighting hegemony. So it's very clear he is unlikely to back down from any of his hardline positions and policies, including zero-COVID, including on his desire to reshape this U.S. world order. So that, of course, will have long-term implications not only for China but also for the world because if there is one thing we are clear in this very opaque political system, that is he is here to stay --",

JOSH ROGIN, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST, COLUMNIST, THE WASHINGTON POST (via Webex by Cisco):  Well, good morning, Christine. I think, as Will just laid out so expertly, we're facing a period of heightened tension with -- between the United States and China on Taiwan and it seems like Xi Jinping is determined to reunify one way or the other. And the biggest question in Washington is will the U.S. come to Taiwan's aid. Now, our official policy is that we don't say, but President Biden has said four times that we would, and that could be confusing to a lot of people both inside the government and around the world. And what I found out by talking to a lot of top U.S. officials is that actually, what has happened is that U.S. policy has changed and the President of the United States made that decision himself, and the staff is forced to go along with it. But the bottom line is that we don't know whether or not that will be necessary because we don't know what Xi Jinping plans to do.",

Now that they have abandoned that, that's a whole new game. So I do think that the onus on the escalation falls more with the Chinese side. But, of course, they don't see it that way.

We're in the middle of that tech war. So not only are we going to try to outcompete the Chinese by going faster, we're going to try to slow them down. That's a policy that has broad implications. It's going to lead towards a broad decoupling of the U.S. and Chinese tech sectors, and that affects almost every industry. And that has costs and risks that's not an easy thing to do and it's never been tried before.

Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen picking up right where they left off on Sunday. Down three late in the fourth quarter and Allen showing his flexibility, going airborne here -- hurtling over a defender to earn a hard-fought first down. It was that kind of day. And then his arm would be on full display just a couple of plays later. A dime to Dawson Knox in the end zone to give Buffalo the lead. Patrick Mahomes would get the ball back with plenty of time left. And Bills fans and the team's secondary remembering that crushing playoff loss in this stadium nine months ago thanks to some late-game heroics from Mahomes. But not this time. An interception with just 51 seconds remaining, sealing the 4-point win as the Bills improve to 5-1 on the season making a statement atop the AFC standings. The Eagles are the only unbeaten team in the NFL, but this one did not come easy against their division rival, the Cowboys. Dallas cutting a 20-point halftime deficit to just three in the fourth quarter last night. Quarterback Jalen Hurts responding by marching his team down the field on the 13-play scoring drive to put the game away as the Eagles get the win -- 26-17 the final there. And after attending his old (INAUDIBLE) wedding this weekend, Tom Brady made the trip to Pittsburgh. But there was nothing to celebrate there. Brady chewing out the offensive line. The Bucs' offense was abysmal in the red zone against the Steelers. Mitch Trubisky coming off the bench in place of the injured Kenny Pickett and delivered in a big, big way. A touchdown to Chase Claypool put them up eight. Brady and the Bucs had the chance to tie it with a 2-point conversion but Devin Bush knocking it away as the Steelers snap a 4-game losing skid with a 2-point win over the Bucs. The Bucs are now 3-3 -- not exactly how Brady drew it up, so far. It's a good time to be a New York football fan, though. The Giants won and the Jets upset the Packers by 17 at Lambeau. Jets rookie Sauce Gardner celebrating by wearing the famous foam cheese head. Green Bay fans not amused by this and neither was Packers' receiver Allen Lazard, knocking the cheese off as he ran into the locker room. Sauce got the last laugh, though, and he also got the cheese. He carried it with him, as a souvenir, to the team bus. I feel like there is a sauce cheese joke somewhere in there. It's too early for me to even put it together. So we'll move on to playoff baseball. Winner-take-all tonight between the Yankees and Guardians. Harrison Bader coming up huge for the Bombers on Sunday to avoid elimination. The trade deadline pickup slamming his third home run of the series to give New York the early. And Gerrit Cole would do the rest, striking out eight over seven innings to get his second win of the series. So the Yankees win 4-2 to force a decisive fifth game. The team is back at Yankee Stadium tonight at 7:00 eastern on TBS. The National League Championship Series opening tomorrow night in San Diego as the Padres host the Phillies. And lastly this morning, the SEC fining Tennessee $100,000 in response to the fans who stormed the field after this thrilling win over Alabama on Saturday. Look at this scene. So, the fans -- in case you missed this -- they tore down the goalpost and threw them in the Tennessee River, OK? And then the Vols Twitter page said that they loved that moment. But there is one problem with this moment and that is that they need to play next week and they need new goalposts now. So they set up a fundraising page hoping to raise 150 grand for the new posts and they have raised about half of that amount already. This is why you love college football. So the donations had 16 bucks, right? That's the number of years since they beat Alabama. Don't tell Kaitlan Collins about this --",
