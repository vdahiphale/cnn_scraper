They laid out a timeline. They say they can try to go to trial in October, and they say it's going to be a four month trial with about 150 witnesses. The judge immediately showing some skepticism about that plan because he said, you know, there's a lot of litigation between now and then that could make that impossible.Of course, the reference there is the fact that Mark Meadows, one of the 19 people who is indicted in this racketeering case, is trying to remove his case. He wants to move his case out of state court into federal court, and that decision is pending by a federal judge. And what that judge rules could have a lot of implications, not only on the former president, of course, but also on other defendants. Here's the judge laying out his views of what this schedule and the difficulties of that schedule are. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

That happened in the Watergate trials. That did happen when the former chief of staff, Haldeman, the former top domestic advisor, Ehrlichman, the former attorney general, all of the -- those involved in the Watergate cover up were tried together. I think there were seven of them in the courtroom. I, again, was a witness for two weeks in that proceeding. But you know, there is an advantage to the prosecutors having them there.
