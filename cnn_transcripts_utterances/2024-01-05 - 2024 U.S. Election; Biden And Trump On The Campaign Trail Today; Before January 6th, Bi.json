He's heading to Pennsylvania, where he plans to deliver a major speech that will try to portray Donald Trump as a threat to American democracy itself. And in back-to-back CNN Town Halls last night, Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis both took on the frontrunner, Donald Trump, as Trump headed to Iowa looking to maintain his massive lead ahead of the caucuses. Plus, tomorrow is the third anniversary of the January 6th riot and attack on the Capitol. I'm going to speak with Army Colonel Earl Matthews, who claims he's been retaliated against for accusing two generals of making false statements about the delayed deployment of the D.C. National Guard that day. Good day, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt. To our viewers watching in the United States and around the world, it's 11:00 a.m. here in Washington, Friday, January 5th. There are just 10 days until the Iowa caucuses, if you can believe that, and only 330 -- excuse me, 304 days until Election Day. This is today's STATE OF THE RACE. Welcome in. The 2024 race, in many ways, the general election version of it is kicking into high gear today. President Biden will launch his reelection bid by arguing Donald Trump is a serious threat to democracy. While Trump is back on the campaign trail in Iowa just 10 days before the caucuses. Biden will mark the third anniversary of the January 6th Capitol attacks with remarks near Valley Forge where George Washington famously commanded his troops during the Revolutionary War. The president is expected to strike a grave tone and frame the 2024 election as being a question of whether democracy is still a sacred cause in America. That message is at the center of his new campaign ad. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  There's something dangerous happening in America. There's an extremist movement that does not share the basic beliefs in our democracy. All of us are being asked right now, what will we do to maintain our democracy? History's watching. The world is watching. Most important, our children and grandchildren will hold us responsible. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Stay warm.We're going to dive into all of this with today's panel. CNN Political Commentator Kate Bedingfield's here. She's a former Biden White House communications director. CNN Political Commentator Kristen Soltis Anderson, Republican strategist and pollster. And Margaret Talev, a senior contributor for Axios. I'm so grateful to have all of you here. And you know, Kate, let me start with you just to, kind of, give us a little bit of insight into how the White House is thinking about this. Obviously, the president's going to be taking off here in the next hour or so to make this speech about January 6th. And, you know, I think there were a lot of questions, especially heading into the midterm elections, about whether focusing on democracy and the idea that there is an existential threat to it was the right move. There were a lot of Democrats who were saying kitchen table issues, even Nancy Pelosi was saying kind of a version of that yesterday. But it does seem like it resonated in the end in 2022 and clearly that's where the White House wants to be and the Biden campaign wants to be here on what is basically day one of their general election campaign. Do you think that's the right approach and why are they looking at it this way?",

      "sentences": "Yes, well, I think we've seen a lot of evidencethat it is. Obviously, you referenced 2022, this was a core piece of Biden's argument running into the midterms. He made a big speech in the weeks -- the -- 10 days before the election in 2022 that reinforced this, and we obviously saw the outcome in November of 2022. You know, there was also a poll a couple of weeks ago, I believe, a \"Washington Post\" poll that showed that 80 percent of voters have concerns about threats to democracy and believe that there is some effort to strip away our democracy. So, you know, there are a couple things about this argument I think in terms of the way the White House thinks about it. One, it is fundamentally something that Joe Biden really believes. I mean, he got into the race in 2019, talking about what we saw in Charlottesville, hate speech, political violence. It really -- I can tell you as somebody who was there alongside him every day, it really motivates him in a personal way. So, you know, your candidate is always going to be more effective when they're talking about something that they feel passionately about.",

What do you make of that argument and what the president's doing?KRISTEN SOLTIS ANDERSON, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR AND U.S. REPUGLICAN STRATEGIST AND POLLSTER:  Well, one, I think the more that Biden takes a really strong stance against Trump on these democracy issues, in some ways, the more it forces Republican primary voters to rally around him, although that's not Democrats concern per se, but it's definitely making it easier for Trump to say, look, look how much they hate me. Look at how much you need to renominate me to his Republican base. But I do think in terms of the general election, the -- Biden is, sort of, boxed into focusing on this issue because the other issues available to him, he does not do as well in polls with voters. So, those kitchen table issues, things like the economy, Donald Trump has a pretty sizable advantage. When you ask voters who they trust more to handle that issue, who do you think would make you better off or made you better off in the case of Donald Trump? Things like the border. Things like crime. These are issues where Republicans are perceived as being the party, perhaps more able to bring about stability, prosperity. And so, it is on democracy where that there is the greatest weakness there. So, in some ways, it makes perfect sense that the Biden campaign would want to touch on this issue because it's their greatest strength. But from the Republican perspective, it's because perhaps there's other issues that are really core to a lot of voters' decision making. Democrats don't have as much of an advantage.",

I'm honestly interested in just what you are learning and pickingup as you have been on the campaign trail there in this, kind of, final days before Iowa. Whether you think President Trump is correcting the mistakes from 2016, and whether you think either one, Nikki Haley, Ron DeSantis, do they have any hope of reaching him? Are we going to see any change in this race? JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT:  All good questions, Kasie. And the final answers, of course, will come in 10 days. But a few clues towards those answers may be. We did hear a sharpening of the argument about electability, about that Donald Trump just didn't quite get the job done. He didn't live up to his promises. Both candidates have been making the argument. DeSantis really has been doing it more than Haley, but not in a prime-time way like that. Not on a big stage. So, clearly, it's crunch time for them to begin -- you know, it's all or nothing now. If you're not going to do it now, when are you going to do it? And Governor DeSantis has really been answering some questions from voters. Saying, why aren't you going after Donald Trump more? I've seen that twice this week. So, I think that's one of the reasons last night. He was really sharpening his attack. So, at this point, I'm standing here in Cumming, Iowa, just outside of Des Moines. There's going to be a DeSantis event here. Nikki Haley had an event earlier this morning. The big event here today, Donald Trump is coming back to Iowa for the first trip of the year. He'll have a couple events today, a couple tomorrow. The big question probably is, what is his ground game? It seems to be much stronger than 2016. The reason that matters is he has to get all those supporters, people who tell pollsters actually out to vote. So, is his organization as strong as it may seem? That's one of the questions, sort of, hanging over this. So, it just feels a little closer than those polls would indicate. And it's been a little while since those polls were taken. So, I think all of us will have our eye on the next Iowa poll in the Des Moines Register coming up in the final days before the caucus rather than the last one.",

The president's running for reelection because the fate of democracy depends on it. And in just a few hours, President Biden is going to give a major speech linked to the third anniversary of January 6th. And the attack on the Capitol by Donald Trump's supporters stunned the nation, proving the peaceful of transfer of power does not seem to be a given. And rioters who believe the election was stolen assaulted dozens of police officers as they battled their way inside the Capitol building. It took hours for the National Guard to get to the scene. They were very, very long hours, as someone that was there waiting for them. We do have here today with us a former lawyer for the D.C. National Guard who has accused two top Army officers of lying about that delay. Colonel Earl Matthews says he's now facing retaliation. An Army spokesman did respond to these allegations, telling CNN, \"While I can't comment on an ongoing action, I can say, as we have before, the Army's actions on January 6th have been well documented and reported on, and General Flynn and Lieutenant General Piatt have been open, honest, and thorough in their sworn testimony with Congress and DOD investigators.\" \"As the Inspector General concluded, actions taken 'were appropriate, supported by requirements, consistent with DOD's roles and responsibilities, and compliant with laws, regulations, and applicable guidance.' The Pentagon says, \"We stand by all testimony and facts provided to date and vigorously reject allegations to the contrary.\" We are joined now by Colonel Earl Matthews and his legal counsel, Andrew Bakaj.

What they did was they came up for reasons why the guards were delayed. And the reasons they provided were not true. And I can, sort of, explain. So, the D.C. National Guard on that day, we were supporting the D.C. government initially before the riot commenced. We were doing traffic control duty. We were at 30 -- 36 different locations around the city. So, the question was, could those forces around the city at the traffic control points and metro stations be diverted to the Capitol to support Capitol police and the MPD? Well, Piatt and Flynn said, no, because -- they said that those forces didn't -- had no riot control gear. You know, the shields, the batons, the face masks, the shin guards. The things they would need to respond to a riot. He said -- they said that those things were located at the armory. But that was not true. Actually, our forces had riot control gear dispersed around the city, and it was readily accessible. It could be easily distributed to the guardsmen who were on duty. So, that -- again, that was -- that's a misstatement of fact, a material misstatement of fact. They testified in June of 2021, five months after the incident. They knew or should have known that the D.C. Guard had that equipment out there and they lied about it to Congress. And, you know, Kasie, don't believe me. I encourage folks to go to C-SPAN, pull that hearing, look at the hearing. And I will tell you this, almost every word that General Piatt and General Flynn stated in that testimony is inaccurate and untruthful. And I'm a lawyer, I -- you know, I -- you know, so I -- I'm just telling you that every single word they -- almost every single word they utter in that testimony is inaccurate, untruthful and it's borne out actually by the January 6th Committee findings.",

And that's part -- and it's part of the reason why, you know, they come up with several different reasons. I can give you another example. It's the Quick Reaction Force. So, we had a 40-man element at Andrews Air Force Base, Joint Base Andrews. These were Air Force security personnel who were trained. They had done two days of training in civil disturbance here. They were fully kitted in civil disturbance. They were ready to respond. They could have been sent directly to the Capitol. Now, Pyatt and Flynn, in their testimony, falsely claimed that that element was not actually a civil disturbance force. That was a lie. That was incorrect.

Florida is a pretty red state these days, but activists who are pushing to have a ballot measurethat would set abortion rights at, sort of, the 24-week limit have acquired enough signatures to try to get a constitutional amendment on the ballot in November.
