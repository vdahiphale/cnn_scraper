Is it possible that a stranger driving by saw these young -- they're very blonde girls walking, laughing, going into that particular house, and he was in murder mode, and decided, I'm -- there is my victim? But that's possible, but it's improbable. It happens, but it's rare. It is far more likely whoever did this had some knowledge of the victims.

Luke, good morning to you. Thank you so much for being with us this morning. We can't understate, right, Nancy Pelosi's influence in America. She is the most influential lawmaker in American politics, or at least among them. We know she is tough as nails. She did quite an effective job at least keeping her party together, including all the different factions. Talk to me about just what kind of mark she is going to leave on America and American democracy. LUKE BROADWATER, CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT, \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\": Yes, Nancy Pelosi is a historic figure in American politics. There has never been a woman to lead a chamber of Congress before she did it, and she did it twice. Never been someone to do it in the Senate. And I think she will still continue to be an influential figure on Capitol Hill. There's talk of her being sort of a congressperson emeritus where she would have a nice big office on Capitol Hill. She's still represent California, but she just won't have the status of just another congressperson. She will be mentoring younger lawmakers, including the new leadership team that's up for a vote at the end of this month, and really play a large role in guiding the Democrats' agenda on Capitol Hill still, and opposing whatever things Kevin McCarthy and the Republicans are trying to accomplish in the next Congress. So, yes, she has quite a lengthy list of historic accomplishments, but she is not done yet, and I do expect her to play a significant role in the next Congress even if she is out of leadership.",

They are a more diverse team. It's the Pete Gguilar will be the highest ranking Latino ever in Congress, Hakeem Jefferies will be the first black person ever to lead one the parties in Congress.And in some ways I think Hakeem Jeffries will represent a similar model to Nancy Pelosi, but potential with a new younger flavor and maybe even at times a bit more aggressive.

This is the chance now. Speaker Pelosi has decided to do this, and, frankly, the Democrats are doing it pretty seamlessly.

If you look down the street here, except for that one emergency vehicle, not a soul, a person in sight, with the exception of a couple of snowplows that have been making their way around.Officials here asking residents to keep off the roads. Several people had to be rescued overnight. Not only they had to be rescued, but some people got tickets for not obeying the ban that is in effect. Mayor Byron Brown speaking with CNN earlier today said he believes it's going to be at least until early next week until the city begins to feel a little bit back to normal.
