But I think there's also tremendous concern because of the uncertainty in the public realm, in the media, discussions around this. And when this happens, the role of leaders is therefore to demonstrate strength and solidarity, at least with words. But you're absolutely right to point out that the practicalities of it, the dollars and cents, are potentially issues in what are already fragile economies moving forward. And I think that in some contexts, the will for increased political conflict, tension and engagement is problematic. But I do think that people on the ground in Europe recognize that the Russian threat is very real.
