      "sentences": "A new set of polls is raising fresh concerns for Ron DeSantis' presidential campaign.Among likely South Carolina Republican primary voters, the Florida governor is now polling behind former governor Nikki Haley, sitting some 35 points below former President Trump. And if you take a look at Iowa, DeSantis is trailing Trump there by 30 points among likely caucusgoers. Tim Scott, as you can see, just behind the governor. Both polls, put out by Fox Business, are fueling new scrutiny about DeSantis' standing in the race. Joining us now to discuss, politics reporter at Semafor, Shelby Talcott; national politics team leader at Bloomberg, Mario Parker; and CNN political commentator, Errol Louis. Nice to see all of you with us this morning. So when we look at these numbers it is something. We've talked about what the concerns are for the DeSantis campaign. Is it the media? Is it the money? I mean, the numbers, Errol, should probably be raising a concern or two. What does this tell the campaign? Are they going to, do you think, take it in? ERROL LOUIS, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, COLUMNIST, NEW YORK MAGAZINE, HOST, \"YOU DECIDE\" PODCAST:  Oh, they've got a real problem and they've recognized it. That's why they've had this campaign shake-up, right? They are burning through the money, right? They're spending 40 cents on every dollar that they raise. That's one problem. And then the immediate problem is if you look at the polls, they've spent millions of dollars and he's fallen further behind. He started out in decent position as in, sort of, striking distance of Donald Trump. Now, depending on the poll you're looking at, he's 30 points behind. He's 40 points behind in the latest Harris poll and he doesn't seem to be closing that gap. And so, if you spend a lot of money and you end up in a worse position, you've got an immediate problem. And then the larger problem, of course, is that you can't figure out which state Ron DeSantis wins in order to get --",
