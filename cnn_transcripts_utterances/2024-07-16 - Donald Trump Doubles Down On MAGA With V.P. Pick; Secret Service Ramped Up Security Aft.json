But again, talking to the people around them, even talking to some of his supporters who were in the room last night, when he walked in with that bandage on his ear. The first time so many people had seen him in public since that assassination attempt. They said he looked different, that he looked emotional. And that is -- that is what I am hearing from his senior advisors as well that he is taking this event, this assassination attempt on his life very seriously. Obviously, that is playing into a lot of the themes of this convention.",

      "sentences": "Kristen Holmes, thanks so much for the reporting.Trump's pick for vice president is seen as a doubling down on the MAGA agenda, partly because on some issues, Vance is even farther to the right than the nominee. Take abortion for instance, earlier this month Vance said that like Trump, he believes the issue should be left up to the states. But he's previously urged Republicans to support a national abortion ban. In November of last year, he told CNN that while he expects states to adopt their own bans, there should be a \"minimum national standard.\" And in his own state of Ohio, Vance supported keeping a six week ban without exceptions for rape and incest. However, after that was repealed he criticized Republican messaging on the issue. On the issue of Russian aggression in Europe, Vance has been a leading opponent of U.S. support for Ukraine. He's unsuccessfully tried to block military aid and once said, \"I don't really care what happens to Ukraine one way or the other.\" Vance has also been highly critical of the criminal cases against Donald Trump going so far as to call for a, \"Takeover of the DOJ.\" And at one point, suggesting Trump fires civil servants and replace them with \"our people.\" It's the issue of the 2020 election, though where Vance may mirror Trump the most. Like Trump, the Ohio senator says it was \"stolen.\" He falsely claimed that there was large scale voter fraud and referred to January 6th rioters as political prisoners. Plus, in a moment, the Biden campaign says is key. Vance declared that if he had been vice president on January 6th, instead of Mike Pence, he would not have certified the election results. We're joined now by CNN's Senior Political Analyst Mark Preston. Mark, great to be with you. So, Mike Pence brought some would say temperament to the ticket in 2016, as well as evangelical support. In your eyes, what does J. D. Vance bring?",

I got to tell you, I don't recognize a lot of these faces. But what that says is that Donald Trump has successfully taken over the Republican Party and J. D.

And that raises a lot of questions about how security was responding there. But just knowing that an ad hoc situation was able to almost succeed, raises questions about what a state actor might be able to achieve, and knowing what we now know about this Iran plot, what kind of notes they or another entity that is an enemy of the U.S. what kind of notes they might be taking.",

There's been warnings about Iran, and the fact that they do want to strike back against the United States, obviously, the 2020 assassination of Qasem Soleimani on Iran -- sorry, in Iraq, the top general there in Iran, has prompted increasing concerns about specific officials inside the U.S. government who could be targeted, including the former president, but also Mike Pompeo, John Bolton, we've all seen these people being, you know, protected to a greater extent than you might see former officials usually protected. So, we've seen all of that visibly.And so, the questions you're asking are exactly the ones that I think everybody is on everyone's mind. Because we know, for instance, that the Justice Department has arrested people who did have tried -- they did try to come up with plans to go after John Bolton and so, all of that information, I think, makes you wonder, you know, why the events happened on Saturday the way they did. I should reach -- I should note that we did get a statement from the Trump campaign. And they said we do not comment on the President Trump's security detail. All questions should be directed to the United Secret -- United States Secret Service, which of course, is the big question, right? They're going to be facing hearings, they're going to be facing very important questions from members of Congress who already are asking, you know about exactly what went wrong here.",

      "sentences": "Well, as I've said, Boris, this campaign officially is not commenting, which is not that surprising. Instead, they said we don't comment on the president's security detail and divert us to Secret Service.But I can tell you a couple of notes that I have, one, from things that I have witnessed, and two, when I have spoken to what I've learned from advisors and aides, one of them is that there was a notice that there had been increased Secret Service protection by a lot of these aides and advisors. They were not sure why exactly. And this is from the people that I have spoken to, again, and it's unclear what exactly, what levels of the campaign might have known about this plot, who was briefed on it, if they were briefed at all. But from the people I've spoken to. They believed that this was in part because of the fact that he was about to become the nominee. He was a former president before, that they likely needed to ramp up some of the security around him. I can also say from attending numerous rallies of former President Donald Trump's, we did not notice any kind of heightened security presence. But one thing we did notice is that at times, it did appear to take longer to go through some of the security lines, we did hear people complaining about it, but still not clear if that was actually related to this plot or not. The other part of this is that I have personally firsthand witness some of these kinds of clashes between the Secret Service and the campaign at various events, one of them being his arraignment in Washington, D.C., I saw an agent trying to rush Trump one way that campaign was having him go another way. But to be clear, the campaign does differ to Secret Service when it comes to his protection. One of the things that Donald Trump did a lot starting last January back in 2023, he started having off the records or OTRs. And essentially, that is when he shows up at a location and nobody knows about it ahead of time, the pool, the traveling with them doesn't go -- they don't know about it until you arrive at the destination or they're not allowed to share that location. And it's kind of a surprise for the people who are in that room. Most of them or all of them are not swept by Secret Service, as most people who come into contact with Donald Trump are. There was a period of time in which they started doing these off the record events, but everyone had to be swept before and then they stopped doing them at all. Partially I was told because of Secret Service, because of the security threat. So, it's not just these conversations about outdoor rallies. They were people who were concerned within the agency that Donald Trump showing up at a location where people weren't swept was going to cause a problem. Again, this was a while ago. So, clearly, you can see that there has been conversation around his security for some time. Now, about this specific plot. It still remains completely unclear what or if anyone within the campaign actually knew about this. One thing to point out here, the reason why they would notice an increased security presence, Donald Trump has traveled with a very close group of Secret Service agents, that is called his detail. These are the people who keep him safe on a daily basis. And we know that he has a very close relationship with them. They like him a lot. He likes them a lot. There's actually been conversations around the fact that they serve as almost an entity with Donald Trump, not necessarily a communicate -- not necessarily just with the Secret Service back in Washington D.C. because they spend so much time together. So, obviously, for the people who spend every single day with him, they would notice if this detail was growing. But again, from whom I've spoken to, they didn't know why, they just assumed it was because one, there's potentially something going on with the fact that he was going to be the nominee. And because he had been a former president, maybe he had less security before becoming the nominee.",

      "sentences": "Well, Boris, it's not surprising to me at all that the former president is really still on the Iranian's radar on a personal level, because he was president when the United States took out the General Qasem Soleimani. The head of the IRGC Quds Force, an a beloved, almost iconic figure in Iran. [14I wrote a piece at the time suggested that that debt would -- they would try to get have that debt paid off at some point, this was not something that was going to go away quickly. They would, you know, dedicate themselves to trying to avenge his death, whether it happens today, or 10 years from now. So, he is still in a significant target for the Iranians on that reason alone. Plus, of course, they've got no love for the United States, generally, particularly now with U.S. support to Israel. So, the opportunity to strike back against the United States in the United States would be a really, you know, significant accomplishment for them, it's easier to strike out at a former president than it is at a current president because of the vast difference in the security apparatus around them. That being said, if this threat was communicated to the Secret Service, which I've no doubt that it was, it makes the potential mistakes and missteps that we've all been talking about, for the last few days, even more glaring, because when you receive threat intelligence like that, credible threat intelligence, which that's what this has been reported, that is the time to step up your game and make no mistakes to go to add additional resources, which it looks like they did, and to make sure that every assignment is covered assiduously. So, it does -- if there were mistakes made on Saturday, which it seems like there were, it raises even more significant questions about how that could happen under the current threat environment.",

Right? And right now, they don't feel safe, because there's a lingering question as to was this a one time series of issues that led to this incident happening? Or is there a problem with the mission with the -- with the application of protection that the Secret Service is doing? This is why a mission assurance review needs to be conducted immediately, and then communicated out to the public so that they know that this is a safe election, that our political leaders while they may be operating in a threatened environment are safe. Now, we have to look at why did this individual get up onto an elevated shooting position within 130 yards of, you know, former president and the leading Republican candidate and get shot. That is unacceptable, but we have to find out why that happened, and ensure that it will never happen again. And that needs to be -- that needs to come from the top. It needs to come from DHS. It needs to come from the Secret Service to reassure the public that this election is safe.

So, it comes down to communication and how the Secret Service detail, the Secret Service leadership sits down and discusses exactly what the threats are, what is within the world of the possible that they can do to work with a campaign to help them achieve their mission, but also provide an elevated level of protection. And that level of protection can come from, you know, just additional physical resources around the former president, but it also can come in the form of technology, it can come in the form of additional resources for advanced protocols, for you know, types of surveillance and counter surveillance measures that are out there. So, a lot of things can be done. But what is really important is that communication between all the stakeholders so everyone is aligned, you don't have to divulge exactly what the threat is and what the potential consequences are. But you have to at least work with the stakeholder group to ensure that you can apply this level of security and then it's additive not detracted from what needs to be done.",
