There is a sense just watching him of overpreparation in terms of talking about the statistics and talking about the economic numbers rather than the actual performance of the debate.But never mind. People were watching one question above all -- is President Biden, was President Biden going to show that he has the strength and stamina to ease the questions. And he did not do that. So I cannot recall a time that really in his presidency where there have been so many supporters. We're just talking about Democrats now. Never mind the Republican criticism. This is Democratic criticism that no one is really rallying to his defense here. This is on him. I've heard the words like \"ego.\" This was his choice to run again.

You don't usually have a debate between presidential nominees before they're actually nominees.This could now become a problem, a vulnerability for Biden, or depending on how you look at it, the party's opportunity to take a way out. It is unprecedented. Highly unlikely. You can already see as Jeff Zeleny just pointed out the rumblings of kind of a return to the safety of the partisan heard because it's so unprecedented.

In reporting in my husband's piece in \"The New York Times\" this week about Biden's presidency, the thing that really struck me was that there was no apparent real process for making this decision.

And I think what you saw last night was a pathological liar in Donald Trump who lied about his record, who has dangerous ideas about where he wants to take this country. I'll admit, I'll be the first to admit that that was not a good look in that debate last night. But it doesn't change the fact that there are really stark competing differences in this race. And I think what the American people have to do now is make a decision. Do we want to go back to a dark time that Donald Trump promises where we have less freedom, where the middle-class gets screwed, where there's fewer opportunities in our community, or do we want to try and continue on with high employment where we want to continue to produce more energy than ever before in this nation, where we want to keep taking the fight to China and beating them as we are now?

Listen, John, I've got a unique position in that as both attorney general here in Pennsylvania, now as governor, I've had the opportunity to work with both men.

NAFTALI: Last night after President Biden's shocking performance, I went back to look at 1944 and 1984. In 1984, let's start with '84, Ronald Reagan had a terrible first debate. We don't even remember the first debate. We always talk about his wonderful line about age in the second debate. In the first debate, he rambled. He seemed not only off his game, but Nancy Reagan, the First Lady thought it was a disaster. She couldn't even recognize the Ronald Reagan who was in the first debate. But the Reagan team had two weeks to correct the impression of the first debate and the second debate against Walter Mondale is when we remember and Ronald Reagan was eight years younger than Joe Biden is today and was much more physically vigorous. In 1944 is a different parallel. In 1944, we had a beloved president who was physically diminished. He had -- and I am not a doctor, but it appears from his doctor's notes from that period, he had congestive heart failure. The American people did not know how ill he was, although party elders in the Democratic Party, had a sense that he was not well, and that is why they changed the vice presidential candidate removing Henry Wallace and putting in someone who could lead the country if Franklin Roosevelt did not finish his fourth term and that person of course was Harry Truman. The president in 1944 hid from the American people the extent of his illness and because he had such a deep well of support and because the war was moving in a positive direction and in Europe, it looked like the war might even be over by Christmas of 1944, the American people rallied and gave Franklin Roosevelt a strong, although not landslide, but a strong victory in 1944. So I wonder about 2024 when presidents cannot hide their condition. When we live in an era of hot takes after all and reels and social media inputs, can President Biden right the ship? Can he deliver a series of public events that will answer the questions that his performance yesterday raised? This isn't 1944. It isn't even 1984 and that is the real question on my mind. The context here is that presidents in a diminished capacity have been able to win re-election, but those were different eras. And last night's performance was so shocking by the president that it leads many people, I think fairly to ask whether there is more wrong with the president than a cold. Is it simply a cold? Is he walking the way he walks simply because he was too vain to put on a boot when he broke his ankle? These are tough questions, which the Bidens have to discuss together and then share with the country.",
