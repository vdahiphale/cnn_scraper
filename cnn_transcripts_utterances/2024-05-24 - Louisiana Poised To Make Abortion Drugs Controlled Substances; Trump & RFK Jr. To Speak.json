But now, it could be even harder for anyone there to get access to the two drugs commonly used in medication abortions, misoprostol and mifepristone. State lawmakers sent a new bill to the Republican governor there, Jeff Landry. They sent that yesterday, and it could upend abortion care in that state.CNN's Dianne Gallagher has been covering this. Diane, what exactly does this new bill do, and do we expect the governor to sign it?",

And though his office has not responded to CNN's outreach, Governor Landry is responding to Vice President Kamala Harris on X and her criticism saying just about an hour ago that he is proud to stand with the legislature on this bill.Now, Louisiana is poised to become the first state in the nation to classify mifepristone and misoprostol, two drugs that are commonly used to endorse -- induce abortion as schedule four dangerous controlled substances. If it does become law, this would make just the possession of these drugs without a valid prescription, a felony that is punishable with up to five years in prison and hefty fines of up to $5,000. If you're charged with the intent to distribute, it would be triple the penalties there. Now, the legislation does not apply to pregnant women who are found to be in possession of these drugs for their own consumption. They would be exempt. Supporters say this would protect expectant mothers. The overall aim of the bill was to make it a crime to give somebody an abortion drug without their knowledge or consent. The bill's sponsor says that his sister was given misoprostol by her estranged husband without her knowledge and against her will. Other supporters say that, look, doctors can still prescribe these for, quote, \"legitimate reasons.\" But look, people who say doctors, especially in Louisiana, Dana, they say that this is going to add -- it's going to add all sorts of issues to them trying to prescribe this. Hurdles, confusion, stigma, and they note that neither one of these drugs are addictive, nor do they have any sort of potential for abuse or harmful side effects. They also point out that they are used for other things besides inducing abortion, including miscarriage management, as well as stopping hemorrhaging, inducing labor, and even treating stomach ulcers, Dana.",

He often says he doesn't trust the agencies and neither should anyone in the American public. And so, he believes that he can slowly persuade some of these voters to his camp, especially because at this point, no one in the Libertarian Party has emerged as the prominent candidate.

After all, he does have vast personal experience with bankruptcy.\"LEIGH ANN CALDWELL, EARLY 202 CO-AUTHOR, THE WASHINGTON POST: Yes.

Both Donald Trump and President Biden are taking RFK Jr. very seriously. They know that he is doing well in the polling, considering in the double digits and most polling.

We're going to bring you the video she says the world needs to see. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [12:48:11] BASH: Now to a sobering development in the Middle East. Today, Israeli forces discovered the bodies of three more hostages in Gaza. Hamas terrorists killed them the day of their barbaric raid on Israel on October 7th, and took their bodies to Gaza. 30-year-old Orion Hernandez Radoux, who was attending the Nova music festival, 42-year-old Hanan Yablonka, a father of two who was also at the music festival with friends, and 59-year-old Michel Nisenbaum, who was on his way to pick up his young granddaughter. 121 other hostages are still being held in Gaza. 230 days later, and this week, the families of some of those hostages were released a horrifying video showing how five Israeli women were kidnapped that day. The families wanted you to see what's happening to their loved ones. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) (Speaking Foreign Language) (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And remember, as you noted in the introduction, that Naama is being pulled out of that jeep so aggressively, her -- by the hair, her pants blood stained, really started the conversation in the investigation and the focus on sexual crimes and violence committed by Hamas against Israeli women that day. Now, there is no confirmation or proof that Naama Levy herself was raped or sexually violated. But, of course, any mother seeing those harrowing images and then once again, seeing them just a few weeks ago in this new video and hearing those chilling words from the Hamas terrorists, she said, it's just another reminder of why it's so important for her, for the world to see it, for those who are leading the negotiations to see it, for her own government officials to see it. And she also responded to -- in the video, you can hear Naama Levy saying I have friends in Palestine. I have friends in Palestine. And what she meant by that is that Naama had always been a participant in youth movements that really encouraged and fought for peace between Israeli and Palestinian teens. There was an organization called Hands of Peace. So she was speaking the truth when she was trying to talk to these Hamas terrorists by saying, I have friends in Palestine. Here's what her mom said.
