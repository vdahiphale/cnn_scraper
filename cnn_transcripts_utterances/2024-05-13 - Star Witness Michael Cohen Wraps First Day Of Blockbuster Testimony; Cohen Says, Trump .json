The longtime Trump fixer and lawyer telling jurors his former boss was only concerned about the impact on his 2016 presidential campaign and that Trump, and I'm quoting now, wasn't thinking at all about his wife, Melania.For the next hour, we'll take you inside the courtroom from gavel to gavel with new transcripts, breaking down all of today's most important developments and looking ahead to what's next. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer with a special report in the Situation Room, the Trump trial today. Let's get right to the breaking news on today's high stakes testimony against Donald Trump. Michael Cohen, zeroing in on what Trump knew about the Stormy Daniels hush money deal and the alleged criminal cover up. Cohen insisting more than once that Trump had an urgent motive to protect his 2016 presidential campaign. CNN's Kara Scanell is outside the courthouse in New York for us. Kara, the prosecution is cutting to the heart of its case with Cohen on the witness stand. KARA SCANNELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Wolf, Michael Cohen on the witness stand for five hours today. He was measured, he was deliberate, he was controlled as he explained to the jury the hush money deals that he said he was involved with at the direction of Donald Trump, telling the jury that if the news had come out, it would have been catastrophic to the campaign and also saying that he was repaid. And he recounted to the jury a moment when he was in Trump Tower in Donald Trump's office with the chief financial officer. They were discussing the repayment. It would be made over 12 months. And it was then that Michael Cohen said that in that room, Donald Trump approved his repayment of the hush money deals. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

He claimed Trump was not thinking about his wife, Melania, saying this was all about the campaign. Cohen reached a $130,000 deal with Daniel's attorney to kill the story.

But before heading to the bank, Cohen said he had two phone calls with Trump to ensure that, once again, he approved what I was doing because I require approval from him on all of this.

Did you know who Stormy Daniels was at that time? Michael Cohen says, I did. Hoffinger, how did you know who she was? Cohen, because it was referenced back to the 2011 scenario that I dealt with previously with David Pecker, the publisher of the National Enquirer, on -- I'm sorry, with Keith Davidson, Stormy Daniels attorney, in order to have a story removed from TheDirty.com. That's a blog. And so, hearing now, after the Access Hollywood tape release, that her story might come out again, what?

So, it gets them further evidence on that front.What we have yet to hear, like a lot about, at least so far, and obviously Cohen is still testifying, is what exactly Trump was told during the process of sort of falsifying these records. You know, in an ideal world, we'd want to hear Cohen say, oh, I told them we were going to do it this way because the DOJ might find out, or the FEC might be asking questions.

I wouldn't expect her to, just given the nature of the details of this case. And that doesn't maybe play well with the jury. When you're seeing other family members of his show up, we had some U.S. senators today show up and be by his side. But the most important person who could show up and be by his side is his wife.

For the most part, he was very, very focused on answering those questions carefully. Meanwhile, Donald Trump literally did not react the vast majority of the time.

One of those moments when Trump had mentioned -- excuse me, when Cohen had mentioned Melania Trump, we saw Trump make a face about that. When Cohen was testifying and said that he was disappointed that he wasn't considered for the chief of staff job at Trump's administration, Trump shook his head. And then another time when Cohen was describing that he was angry, unusually angry, even for himself, when he learned that his bonus had been cut by two thirds.

And we just got more of the transcript from Cohen's testimony today, including when the prosecution asked Cohen if Trump seemed concerned about his wife, Melania, in regards to Stormy Daniels.Let me read part of the exchange, the official transcript exchange. Prosecutor Susan Hoffinger, did you bring up at the time the topic of his wife, Melania, in one of those conversations with Mr. Trump? Cohen, I did. Hoffinger, what did you say in substance to him? Cohen, I said to him, and how's things going to go with upstairs? Hoffinger, were you concerned about that? Cohen, I was. Hoffinger, and what if anything did he say to you about that? Cohen, don't worry. He goes, he goes, how long do you think I will be on the market for? Not long. Hoffinger, what did you understand that to mean? Cohen, he wasn't thinking about Melania. This was all about the campaign. Let's get some reaction right now from Trump's lead defense counsel during his second impeachment trial, David Schoen. David, thanks for joining us. How much does what we just heard strengthen the prosecution's actual case against him? DAVID SCHOEN, LEAD DEFENSE COUNSEL, TRUMP'S SECOND IMPEACHMENT TRIAL: Well, you know, I think, you know, part of the issue here is they're using Michael Cohen to sort of touch every base. And so they'd heard some testimony that maybe President Trump's concern was about his wife and not the campaign, which would undercut one of their theories for the target crime 17152 to promote or prevent an election. And so they want to lay everything on the campaign. I think, you know, you reached too far. I don't think it's going to be believable to the same jury that heard from an earlier witness how important the relationship is between Trump and his wife. But, you know, Michael Cohen is Michael Cohen. I think that they, they feel he's a make or break it witness. And I think in real terms, he probably is.",

I think that it's possible to make out a case that Michael Cohen could be believed in full and that they haven't even, the state hasn't even made out the misdemeanor in the case.Remember, for the misdemeanor, they have to prove that the business records were falsified with the intent to defraud and then to make it a felony that that was done with the intent to commit or conceal another crime. Part of the problem with this case is, and I think why the indictment is defective, they've never identified what that target crime is. But the talk of the day is the 17152, trying to interfere with an election, cover up bad news about the candidate. First of all, based on Mr. Davidson and other witnesses that we've heard about this being a settlement, not hush money, and even from Cohen himself, the part of the money paid was a bonus, I'm not sure that they can make out the case that this was improperly booked, and certainly not criminally booked, reflected in the records criminally. Beyond that, candidates are entitled to prevent bad facts about themselves from coming out. So, again, best case scenario for the government, or for the state, if Cohen is believed, a lawyer who keeps his eye on the ball and gets the right jury instructions still wins the case. But, of course, this case is going to turn in large part on the cross-examination of Mr. Cohen, and that ought to be a dream for a halfway competent lawyer",
