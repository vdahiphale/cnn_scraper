What you are not seeing, because police have said this is a secure area now, what you are not seeing is the signs of an active shooter, which is the good news from this morning.

We're going to hear that news conference any second. We will jump in the minute it starts. In the meantime, CNN senior national security analyst Juliette Kayyem here and CNN senior law enforcement analyst Andrew McCabe is with us. Juliette, let me just start with you.

There's not a lot of ambulances. There may have been some, but we don't know if there were people in them. I haven't seen ambulances with sirens. Those are the kinds of things you look at. So, that's the first thing. The second is just never -- I feel we're on this enough and I'm texting with your producers and I'm -- is this a big deal or is this not a big deal? It's based on the numbers, but we should never forget that it should be a big deal whatever the numbers are in terms of those hurt that we have guns and school shootings. And it's hard for us to even manage the numbers now, as we're seeing this as the fourth in 2014. There's not even that many days of school shootings. So, those are the two different pieces that get merged because we do focus, of course, on the numbers.",

It is that evidence that enables you to reconstruct what happened, understand not just who committed this act, but what led them to committing that act? Like, how did they enter the building? Were they carrying weapons that they brought into the building? Had they secreted those weapons inside the building in a locker or a closet ahead of time? Where did they move first? Where did they shoot first? How many rounds did they shoot? These are all important things. Even if there is no prosecution to come of this, if the shooter has been neutralized on the scene, we still want to know exactly how this happened, so that we can possibly learn from it to try to protect this school and other schools better in the future. So that also leads to a more broad investigation about the motives and the intentions of this offender. And, again, we don't know if that person is alive or dead at this point, but it's still important to us as law enforcement, as security experts, but to society in general, and certainly to this community, to understand why this person did what they did. We don't always get the answer to that question, but understanding as much about it as we can is important. So they will look at social media, they will look at journals, writings. They will interview friends and family members to understand what might have been going on in this person's mind that led them to this point. So, all of that work is really in front of this small town right now.",

This morning at approximately 7:37 a.m., we had a Sears (ph) radio activation at the high school, which indicated an active shooter situation. Our officer first arrived within seven minutes of that activation and located multiple gunshot victims. We're still unclear of exactly how many are injured or what the extent of those are, but we're working on that right now. There is no further danger to the public. The community is safe. We're just now working backwards, trying to figure out everything that happened and make notifications. There will be another update later on today. We're still very early. This happened at approximately 7:37 this morning. School didn't start yet, luckily, so there was very few students and faculty in the building, which I think contributed to a good outcome in that sense. But we will have more information later on this afternoon. We will not be releasing any more information in the meantime, so please be patient with us, so that we can talk with these victims and their families and try and figure out what happened. We won't be answering any questions today either or right now.

But one of the things that I would be looking at from this perspective is someone who was focused on a particular place or group that was meeting at that time. So that would either be employees or some student group, because -- if that is, in fact, what their purpose was. And just consistent with what Andy was saying, that the -- when the sheriff said that they needed to talk to people who were injured about why it would be -- it would seem that they have some understanding that this was a focused target for the shooter, and that is consistent with the timing, that you would do it before school. And the timing obviously now discloses why we're seeing pictures like this. I was surprised we didn't see any kids, and I thought that they might still be under lockdown. And, basically, they weren't there at this stage. I mean, look, this is a small community. It is dealing with whatever the numbers are, an absolute tragedy in a high school that is presumably the only high school for the community. So that's going to be impacted for a couple of days. I mean, this is a -- these are the social consequences of the violence itself. Whether you have one dead, 10 dead, whatever these horrible numbers are, the ripple effects for these communities, in terms of closing of schools, the closing of the community college nearby, commerce and other things, are impacted as well. And we don't have a way to measure that, at least not now.",

We have talked about it on air recently previously. This town is a very small town, less than 8,000 people. Des Moines is the capital of the state. It's about 30, 45 minutes away. And so those facilities would -- I imagine would be the nearest -- nearest by. And as I was driving up here, as I said earlier, as I was driving up here to cover the Vivek Ramaswamy event, just in the last couple of hours, we saw EMTs, ambulances driving away from Perry, Iowa, towards Des Moines.
