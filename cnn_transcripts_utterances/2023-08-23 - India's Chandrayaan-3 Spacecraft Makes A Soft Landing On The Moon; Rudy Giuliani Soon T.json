A huge achievement there by India that's been hailed by millions of people. The last time I checked on the ISRO which is the Indian Space Agency website on YouTube, if you click on the link there were more than 37 million views. It is indeed a historic moment and people across not only India but the world gathered to watch that one minute just before the landing and the moment of landing known as a soft landing on the moon which means a controlled gentle landing on the moon. Mission Impossible was in 2019 that you referred to because that's when Chandrayaan-2 failed to reach the moon. It crash-landed and four years later, it's euphoria inside the mission center and across India where you've seen people cheer, waving the Indian national flag. Emotions were running high, especially the place where we were witnessing a watch party. What a moment it was. And then you had the Indian Prime Minister hailing this huge historic moment.

They have been protracted complaints by the opposition, a citizens coalition for change, about possible rigging, about shenanigans, in particular relating to the voters' role. They say they only didn't, they didn't get an updated voters' role even on the eve of the election. Now, the Zani Pierre Ruling Party which has been in power since 1980 in Zimbabwe has said that it is just complaints and there's no evidence of any of these issues. Zimbabweans, for their own part, have been dealing with rampant inflation, a struggling economy. That's the ruling party blames that on sanctions and outside influence.

And Emerson Mnangagwa's ruling Zani Pierre Party has had a hold on power, as David was just saying, since 1980, so basically more than four decades. In 2018, less than one year after authoritarian leader Robert Mugabe was deposed by the military, current eight-year-old incumbent known as the crocodile, eked out the narrowest of victories in a disputed ballot. During that time, there was a prevailing sense for optimism that new leadership might lead to desperately needed democratic and economic reforms. But today, the atmosphere could not be more different. Zimbabwe has one of the world's highest inflation rates, and more than 40 percent of the population lives in poverty. The outcome of these elections are monumental. Zimbabwe's chances of resolving its debt crisis and accessing international loans are at stake, with foreign lenders requiring a free and fair poll as a precondition. Time now for The Exchange and my conversation with Hopewell Chin'ono. He's a human rights activist, an award-winning journalist, and a documentary filmmaker, as well. He joins us live now from Zimbabwe's capital, Harare. Hopewell, thank you so much for being with us. You've described these elections as one of the worst elections in post-colonial Zimbabwe in terms of what you witnessed, so far. Walk us through what you meant by that. HOPEWELL CHIN'ONO, JOURNALIST AND FILMMAKER: You see, the problem is that this is not an election at all. I will start with the morning. The election is supposed to start at 7 A.M. in the morning. Right now, as I'm speaking to you, there are many polling stations in opposition strongholds that have not opened the polling stations. They do not have voting material. Certain areas in our area have been told that their election material, that is, the ballot papers, are being currently processed and printed. So, how can you have an election where the ballot papers are printed on election day? And then the second aspect of it is that ZANU-PF, through certain elements of the secret service, has been setting up desks outside polling stations, asking citizens to provide their IDs and their names where they are written in a book. The idea is to intimidate, especially the rural folk, that if you do not vote for ZANU-PF, we would have known which citizens voted in this particular polling station and then will come after you. And we will also deny you food relief, which is given out from donor agencies throughout the next five years. So, that is what I meant when I said that this is one of the worst elections. I mean, Robert Mugabe was terrible, but he never lowered the bar to what we have seen today. They have sunk from the gutter into the sewer.",

Obviously, the economy aswell as a massive factor here when it comes to just how many Zimbabweans live below the poverty line. The rate of inflation in Zimbabwe is obscene. Also, the fact that you have so many Zimbabweans who have been crossing over, looking for work in South Africa, and that's caused tension between the two countries. Assuming that ZANU-PF ends up with another five years here, what does life look like for ordinary Zimbabweans? CHIN'ONO: Well, at the moment, ninety-five percent of our potential job workforce is out of work. So, our unemployment rate is 95 percent. And we have got the highest inflation in the world. Millions of our people are in South Africa. Most of them are there illegally. So, what will happen is, if ZANU-PF emerges again, is the winner of a rigged election, you're going to see a lot of more people crossing into South Africa, both legally and illegally. And what that means is there are going to be flash points of violence and clashes, as we have seen in the past 15 years in South Africa. South Africa has got an election in 2024. And as we saw in their midterm elections, the ruling party in that country, ANC, got less than 50 percent for the first time. And a lot of the fringe political parties are campaigning around the issue of immigration. So, if you have more Zimbabweans going into South Africa, it's going to create more problems for the region. So, one would have thought that South Africa and SADC, which is the regional body, would make sure that there is a free and fair election in Zimbabwe, which whose dispute or rather whose outcome is not disputed. But that is not the case. In fact, the Secretary General of the ruling party in South Africa went on the record and called the opposition leader in Zimbabwe, Nelson Chameleon, an American puppet. So, that doesn't instill confidence that our neighbors want to see a clean election in Zimbabwe but they will suffer the consequences -- is because Zimbabwe is no longer a foreign policy issue in South Africa. It's a domestic issue because Zimbabweans are living there. They are using social services in South Africa.

His state will help settle a larger debate,whether it's a rematch between Biden and Trump or not. I don't think anything's inevitable. History is full of folks who, you know, were ahead early and then didn't end up the nominee in both parties. It's an open question if history will be the best guide for the 2024 campaign. But one thing is clear, talking to voters here in Wisconsin, many do have open minds. Some are eager to turn the page beyond Trump. Some of course are loyal supporters. But one year from now, next summer, the Republican Party will nominate their candidate right here in Milwaukee in this building right behind me here. Will it be Trump or someone on the debate stage? That of course is up to the voters. Jeff Zeleny, CNN, Milwaukee. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And there's concern that it could spread to a national park. The city's -- the capital city rather, is blanketed in ash and smoke. The flames are exacerbated by extreme heat and dry conditions which are expected to last through Friday. Our Eleni Giokos is seeing it for herself first-hand. Just how intense these flames are. She joins us live now from the Greek capital. Eleni, I've been watching you all morning. Some of the images behind you are utterly devastating. These blaze have left a path of just pure devastation in their wake, and we're seeing images of homes being burned, cars being burned, reports of people having to flee their homes on foot. Eleni, take us through it.",

And then we saw it just erupt enormous flames. It happened so quickly, Zain, that we were told to leave, we ran basically, and anyone else that was with us, the locals that were living in these houses were also told to leave and they left reluctantly. They did not want to leave their homes. Some people were telling us that they built their homes themselves, that this is their livelihoods, they were dousing their houses and their gardens with water in the hope that the fire would just pass through and miraculously, actually, some of the people that did actually stay till very last minute. Those are the homes that basically did get through this. This is Parnitha Mountain. It's the forest, one of the most important forests in the whole of Greece actually. It's known as the lungs of Athens. It's an important carbon basin. And some of the images that we've seen are absolutely dystopian. So traumatizing to witness this and also the pain, the anger, the fear, the uncertainty of the people that live in this area.",

HANCOCKS (voice-over): Attaliah Shah is one of six students rescued along with two teachers, Tuesday, from a cable car hanging precariously 900 feet in the air, held up by a solitary cable. SHAH (through translator): We were going to school around seven in the morning. When the chairlift was halfway there, its rope broke. It was dangling. And I was terrified. HANCOCKS (voice-over): Local villagers rushed out of their homes, most with children who have used their cable car for their school commute across the mountainous terrain. The nearest road is four hours away. The uncle of another student rescued tells us the entire village started beating their chests. His mother was distraught, crying. For 14 hours, while our child was up there, we couldn't eat or drink. And only when the children were rescued did we feel alive again. The rescues were daring, a special forces officer hanging from a helicopter carrying one student to safety. Pakistan's military said the mission was complicated by strong winds. and a fear of the helicopter's rotor blades destabilizing the lift. When nightfall grounded the helicopters, makeshift stretchers on a zip line were pulled by soldiers and locals to save the rest of the students and teachers, some suffering from nausea during the 14-hour ordeal, reports of others losing consciousness. AITABAD ULLAH, LOCAL 1122 RESCUE WORKER: We got here at 9 A.M. then the military arrived. The local rescue teams and police, we all worked together. And the operation ended in success by 11 at night.",
