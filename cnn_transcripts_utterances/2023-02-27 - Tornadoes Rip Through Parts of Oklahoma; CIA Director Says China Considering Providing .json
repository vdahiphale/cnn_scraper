This driver actually had to climb on top of his Porsche after it became swamped and he was left stranded. Just north of Los Angeles, several RVs were swept into a river when the riverbank eroded and gave way. More than seven inches of rain fell in Ventura County, that's northwest of Los Angeles. A helicopter crew had to rescue a driver from a jeep, as you see here. His car got stuck in these fast- rising floodwaters.Ed Lavandera is live on the ground in Norman, Oklahoma.

And this is what the neighbors -- the residents in this neighborhood are dealing with. Trees, about a foot in diameter, snapped in half. Take a look way up there in the tree, about 30 feet high, a giant piece of plywood stuck in the branches there. That is rooftop that has been shredded off people's home. You can see, it gives you a sense of all of the debris that was flying around here so wickedly.And here in this backyard, really gives you a sense, you can get in here because the fence has been completely blown out, but this particular home, fortunately, the owner of this home was in Tulsa at the home, but this was -- you can also get a sense here of when you're inside your home and the tornado is coming, just the force that these storms and the wind brings. About 70 to 80-mile-per-hour winds were being registered throughout the evening as these storms were approaching. In the Texas panhandle in a little town called Memphis, there were wind gusts of 114 miles per hour recorded last night. That is where the beginning of this storm really kind of generated. And this line just moved through Oklahoma incredibly quickly, but the force of this tornado that touched down here in the Norman area blowing out windows, ripping off homes -- the rooftop of homes, as well. The good news, Kaitlan, is that much of this is very isolated. So as bad as this looks, if you go just about a half-mile or so east or west, it's a completely different picture. So that is some of the good news. Last we checked, there were close to about 30,000 customers here in the Oklahoma area without power this morning. And those numbers have been dropping rather quickly. But it was an intense night of storms racing through the state of Oklahoma. And this storm system stretches from Texas all the way up through the central plains. A very dramatic site for this February, Kaitlan.",

It certainly didn't change Putin's calculations on invading Ukraine. Their hope is here by saying, hey, listen, we know you're considering this now. Here's how you're going to pay for it. And beginning to hear from folks like Janet Yellen and others to say there's going to be an economic cost to this.But big picture, I always look at this, why should folks at home care about China entering this war? This is already the biggest war in Europe since World War II. It's bloody, it's long, there's no sign of it ending. You already have two superpowers on opposing sides, in effect. Russia invaded the U.S. supporting Ukraine. If China were to provide lethal assistance to Russia to help it in this war, this would enter another superpower, not directly into the conflict, no Chinese soldiers or war planes, but China as sort of a proxy here, right. China involved in this conflict and supporting one's side. It just expands the potential for escalation and just the broader tensions here between the superpowers, which are already, as we keep reporting every other day, right, with balloons and so on, already going in a very dangerous direction.",

Medication abortion accounts for more than half of all current legal abortions in the United States, and this is the most consequential abortion related case since the Supreme Court overturned Roe vs. Wade last May. And this case rests in the hands of a US District Court Judge, a Federal Judge, Matthew Kacsmaryk. He is a Trump appointee. He was opposed by Republican Senator Susan Collins and all Democratic senators. He was opposed by her over his record on LGBTQ+ and reproductive rights. Back in 2013, though, then Attorney General Eric Holder presented him with the Justice Department Award for his work as a US attorney. He has critics and they are not surprised that he got this case. He has presided over 95 percent of the civil cases brought in the Northern District of Texas. One Democratic senator says antiabortion advocates are gaming the system. Here is Ron Wyden.

You know, I'm not a defender of Senator Wyden's position here, but I think it's understandable why folks would think that one response to the kind of norm busting of handpicking Judges and not subjecting lawsuits to random assignment would be norm busting in the other direction, that's part of the problem here is that it's a race to the bottom, where what we really need is a more sensible approach to this kind of nationwide litigation.",

Now, Poppy, those Judges might have been generally more sympathetic to California than to President Trump. But again, I think that's the difference between forum shopping and Judge shopping. But either way, even if folks don't think that's a distinction with a difference, where it really underscores is that we ought to revisit just how comfortable we are with having outlier Judges at either end of the political spectrum, who have the power to basically bring in nationwide policies, in this case, one that's 23 years old, to a screeching halt whether Congress should revisit exactly the ability of litigants to shop in that respect.",
