GEORGE BIVENS, PENNSYLVANIA STATE POLICE:  So there are a lot of things that need to be followed up yet in this investigation. Certainly, there were a number of items that were found on his person in his backpack that have been inventoried, and we've begun to do an analysis of some of those. There were written documents. There are electronic devices that are in the process of being downloaded, search warrants are obtained. And so over the next hours and days, those efforts will continue and we're going to take a closer look at all of the information that we can glean from that regarding his activities up until and during the time of the homicide, his flight from New York. And we know that he has been in Pennsylvania, excuse me, for several days. And so, part of that investigation will also focus on trying to retrace his steps. We've already identified businesses, for example, that he frequented in this area and activities that he engaged in that led us to more evidence. And so, all of that is becoming kind of a mountain of evidence that has to be analyzed and looked at. I'm confident we'll have a much better idea of his activities over the past, you know, number of days in New York and in Pennsylvania. Additionally, we're also trying to determine that we don't have another actor or an accomplice out there. And so, this information will be used to help us prove or disprove whether that exists and whether there were any other intended targets. So a lot of questions that are out there that are unanswered yet, but we have a lot of information that we can examine that hopefully will give us some of those -- those pieces of data that we need. You asked or someone asked about the interview. He was initially cooperative. He is not now. And so, he has been arraigned and transported and will be securely housed pending the filing of additional charges in New York governor. (CROSSTALK)",

Governor Josh Shapiro there in Pennsylvania, just wrapping up a press conference where you heard from officials from Pennsylvania state police, local police in Altoona, Pennsylvania, as well as the NYPD talking about the arrest of the suspected killer charged in Pennsylvania for having the gun, which they are reporting was a 3D printed gun that they found in the backpack, talking about the ammunition that they found that there was still ammunition, a full magazine of ammunition of nine millimeter ammo, saying that he was very cooperative. He immediately pulled his face mask down.Very interesting though, as we get to Danny Freeman, who has been covering this all day on the scene from when that customer we just learned at McDonald's first called 911 that police, Danny, are saying they asked him. At first he was cooperative and then they asked the suspect. They said to Luigi Mangione, were you recently in New York? He didn't directly answer the question, but became very physically disturbed. They said physically nervous and started shaking. And they said at that point that was all they needed to know. At this point, no statement yet from the suspect. So we are waiting, saying they do not yet have any more information on motive. Still looking on accomplices. We've got new video obtained by NBC which shows the suspect arriving in court. Danny, you actually saw him? You were there and saw him going in. You know what -- what was he like there?

He was wearing a blue shirt, blue jeans. He was, of course, handcuffed, and he looked, even in this court appearance visibly distressed. But he kept his brow furrowed through the duration of this arraignment hearing. And I should say what was interesting, though, Erin, as you said, we haven't heard a statement from the suspect. He did actually speak inside of that courtroom to the judge and to all the folks who were in there. But it was on very selective issues and I'll just kind of go through what we heard. The judge asked Luigi Mangione a number of questions first, about his identity. So Mr. Mangione confirmed that that is his real name. He initially said that his residence was in Maryland, but then the judge actually pressed him on that. And then he said, actually, I have lived at various addresses before then ultimately giving an address in Honolulu, Hawaii. Then he also said that he has worked for three years as a data engineer up until about a year ago, and he also told the judge that he has no drug or mental health problems, that the court needs to know about. But, Erin, one of the most interesting parts of that particular hearing was actually his statements after the conversation about bail. The prosecutors basically stepped up there and made the case. Why they believe that this man should be held without bail. They mentioned that he is awaiting potentially an arrest warrant coming from New York City as one of the major reasons. But they also said that prosecutors noted that they found him with $8,000 in U.S. cash, $2,000 in foreign currency, his passport, and also a faraday bag, which is basically a bag designed to stop transmission of cell service or other sort of things, like that. At the end of his speech, the prosecutors speech, Luigi Mangione said, I actually want to address two of the things that you said. He said I don't know where that money came from. I'm not sure if it was planted. And then he also said that that bag was waterproof. And the term that the prosecutors used when discussing the faraday bag, the ghost guns, the 3D printed silencer was the prosecutors used a phrase saying this is criminal sophistication. Luigi Mangione said, I don't know about any of this criminal sophistication when addressing that, but it's just interesting, Erin, that of all of the things that were mentioned in that court appearance, the two that he noted or took issue with was the currency, and then that bag -- Erin.",

As far as those schools we know, he graduated in 2016 from Gilman High School, which is an all boys school. He was valedictorian of his class, where he gave his speech at his graduation. Then he went on to University of Pennsylvania, where he also graduated with a bachelors and masters degree, computer science, as well as mathematics. Extremely smart, told his newspaper there that he wanted to learn how to code because he wanted to make his own video games, extremely smart individual. As far as the family is concerned, we know that his grandfather was a real estate mogul in that area in Maryland, and that his family owns a bunch of nursing homes. They also own a bunch of other country clubs. So all -- really interesting pieces making up the framework of who Luigi Mangione is. We also have found a good reads account where he talks about the Unabomber, Ted Kaczynski, and essentially says that he's a political revolutionary.

The Putin- backed dictator's regime vanishing in just 11 days after 60 years of the Assad family plunging the country, the Middle East further into turmoil and Russia to.Assad's presidential residence is plundered after he fled the country as the rebels seized the capital and his palace. Giant crowds now flooding the country's notorious prisons after rebels freed people held there. Russia tonight is silent on Assad's exact whereabouts after granting the deposed dictator and his family asylum, the Syrian embassy there raising the rebel flag following the fall of Damascus and the Assad regime. It's an incredible story in Moscow. And Fred Pleitgen is OUTFRONT there with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over):  As Syrians celebrate the end of the Assad regime, ransacking the former leader's luxurious palaces, but Russian leader Vladimir Putin was handing out medals to Russian soldiers, marking heroes of the fatherland day in Moscow. The Kremlin confirming Putin personally granted Bashar al-Assad asylum here. Naturally such decisions cannot be made without the head of state, the Kremlin spokesman said. It is his decision. The Russians refusing to comment on Bashar al-Assad's exact whereabouts or whether his wife, Asma al-Assad, once described as a rose in the desert in a controversial article in \"Vogue Magazine\", is with him. Moscow says Assad was granted asylum on, quote, humanitarian grounds, even as Syrians storming his palace in Damascus discover the lavish life the former dictator was leading, finding a huge collection of luxury cars, including Ferraris and a Lamborghini. The full brutality of the regime also coming to light as people stormed the notorious Saydnaya prison, infamous for torture and killings, desperately trying to free those incarcerated here. Syria's transition also on display in the Russian capital. As of this morning, the flag of the Syrian opposition flies above the embassy here in Moscow. The Russians, formerly the biggest backers of Bashar al-Assad, say they understand there is now a new reality in Syria. Russia's air force played a major role in helping Bashar al-Assad turn the tide at the height of Syria's civil war and push rebel forces out of much of the country, also making Vladimir Putin one of the most influential players in the Middle East. And Moscow maintains not just a major air base in Syria but also its only port in the Mediterranean Sea where Putin's navy conducted large scale exercises just last week. But the Russians acknowledge the future of their military presence in Syria is now uncertain, and their capacity to influence Syria's future appears limited. Putin's foreign spy chief, seemingly acknowledging. The situation, is obviously complicated, he says. The thing is Syria is a country composed of many diverse parts, and whether various factions represented in the opposition are able to reach an accord will in many ways define the fate of the Syrian people and Syria as a state. The Russians say they are in touch with the armed groups now controlling Syria and while Moscow says it currently does not see the security of its bases here threatened, its forces have been placed on alert.
