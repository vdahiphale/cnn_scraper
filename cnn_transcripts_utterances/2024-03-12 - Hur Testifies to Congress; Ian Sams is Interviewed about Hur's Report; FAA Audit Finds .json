At the top of the hour, that is when this begins. And lawmakers will be questioning her on his decision to not recommend charges against President Biden over his handling of classified documents. And Hur will also face questions about his decision to describe the president in his final report as an elderly man with a poor memory. We're also now learning exactly what Biden said when that special counsel, Bob Hur, interviewed him, including a section in which the president appeared to forget what year his son passed away.CNN's Evan Perez, he read that transcript. He's joining us now. Evan, talk to us more about what you saw in this transcript and what it shows.",

      "sentences": "Well, Kate, you know, that -- that episode, that interaction between Rob Hur and the president is the one that really made all the headlines from that 388 page report that was released a few weeks ago. And what we got to see from - from looking at this transcript is a bit of the context of how this came to be.And so what we know is that there was a discussion between the president and the interviews about where he kept papers that he was working on when he left the vice presidency and as he was trying to melt -- he was mulling his future, including any political future. And he is the one that brings up -- he says the time frame is 2017 and 2018. And then I'll read you just a part of what he says. He says, \"remember, in this time frame, my son is either deployed or dying.\" Again, he's the one that brings up Beau Biden. And then he says, \"what month did Beau die? Oh God, May 30th.\" And then someone -- multiple people in the room remind him that it was actually in 2015 that Beau Biden, his son, died. Again, it's one of those interactions that really stands out because we know the death of Beau Biden was something that is of immense importance to the president. It's a big part of what has gone on in the last few years. And the idea that he didn't remember is something that really stood out. But the context, I think, really shows you a little bit more about that interaction. We also have another interaction where the president is being asked about how materials get moved. I'll read you just a part of that transcript. It says, \"OK, do you have\" - Rob Hur asks the president, \"do you have many idea where this material would have been before it got moved into the garage?\" This is his garage at his Wilmington home. The president says, \"well, if it was from 2013 - when - when did I stop being vice president?\" A White House lawyer in the room says \"2017.\" And President Biden says, \"So I was vice president. So it must have come from vice president stuff. That's all I can think of.\" What you see repeatedly, obviously, is the president, he doesn't pay a lot of detail -- attention to detail about who handles these classified documents, these papers. He knows he has aides who handle them. He describes a process whereby if he wanted to see something, he would ask for it to be brought to him. He says he didn't pack any of these boxes that got moved from the vice presidential residence to his -- to his homes after he left the -- left office. So, you know, I think that's going to play a big role of today, which is, you know, the idea of his memory and what that means for Joe Biden, of course. Kate.",

And what people are going to see in the transcript that now I heard Evan talking about having access to, and I believe the Justice Department has produced to Congress this morning, the transcript is going to show that the president had very clear and detailed testimony to the special counsel that he did not know he had these, that he was unaware. We've said that from the very beginning of this case that as soon as these documents were discovered, we fully cooperated with the Justice Department to ensure that they were returned.

One that you have not been pleased with. I want to read you - again, this is from the opening statement that he's going to deliver to Congress. Hur will say, \"the evidence and the president himself put his memory squarely at issue. We interviewed the president and asked him about his recorded statement. I just found all the classified stuff downstairs. He told us he did not remember saying that to his ghostwriter. He also didn't remember finding any classified material in his home after his vice presidency. And he didn't remember anything about how classified documents about Afghanistan made their way into the garage.\" Again, part of Hur's opening statement. What issue do you have with that?",

Yes, well, I guess it's not that surprising that he might not remember something that he testified repeatedly he didn't know he had, he didn't intentionally take and that he relied on staff members, like most principals do, especially someone at the level of the vice president, he relied on staff to pack and move his papers and boxes.I think also on this issue of the memory, it's been selectively chopped up and edited and sent around because of the confusing way that that report was written. But also in that report -- and again I wrote this down. Later in the report he says explicitly, quote, \"we expect the evidence of Mr. Biden's state of mind to be compelling.\" He said that he provided, quote, \"clear\" and, quote, \"forceful testimony.\" These are things that he says in the report. And in the transcript he says - at one point he praises the president's, quote, \"photographic\" memory. And so there's a little bit of a distinction here and a little bit of picking and choosing which issues to criticize the president's memory on. But I think that, at the end of the day, it's because the facts and evidence don't support this case. Nothing else, nothing about the president's testimony. It's a fact -- the facts and evidence over 15 months of investigating prove that there is no case here.",

      "sentences": "The president was, in fact, asked about his work on his book about his son's passing, about his work after his vice presidency on the Biden Cancer Initiative, something that was so deeply motivated by Beau's illness and passing. These are deeply personal and emotional issues for the president. And he's talked openly about those to the American people for years about how he overcame that grief and how he worked through it and how he hoped to find purpose beyond this grief. And that was what he was being asked about.And so anybody who has even a familiarity with the president understands the personal nature of this and that he would talk about his son, Beau, and the impact that he had on the work that he was pursuing after his vice presidency on the book and on the cancer work. And I think that the American people can see clearly that the president doesn't need a reminder as to when his son died. He says right there, May 30th. This is something that the president carries with him every single day, the memory of losing his son. Families across this country understand the power of loss and grief and the way that that impacts someone. And this is a president who's taken that loss and grief and turned it into purpose. And I think it just goes to show again how outrageous it was for that to even be included in this report. And don't take just my word for it. Former attorney general, former deputy attorney general, former Justice Department prosecutors, senior officials, all came out in the aftermath of this report and said, this is totally inappropriate. You can make the point without talking about that. So, it just shows how outrageous it was for that to be included in the final report.",

Important to note, he was confirmed by unanimous voice vote in the Senate. There was no opposition to him from Republicans or Democrats. And then Merrick Garland appointed him as special counsel about a year ago, in January of 2023. Now, let's just talk about what that means that he came -- became special counsel. That means Merrick Garland gave Robert Hur the powers of any DOJ federal prosecutor. But special counsel has a bit more independence. The regulation say he's not subject to the, quote, \"day-to-day supervision of the AG.\" And the other important feature is, the special counsel, at the end of his case, has to write a report.

And Rob -- what Robert Hur seems to be trying to say is, there was evidence, some evidence, but not enough to charge him with a crime. That's an important distinction.
