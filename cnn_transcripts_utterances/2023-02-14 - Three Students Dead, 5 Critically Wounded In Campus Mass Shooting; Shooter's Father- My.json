And so they have talked to the father, they've talked to friends, they've talked to the sister, but we here at CNN as well, have talked to his father as well.And certainly, the dad is painting a picture of someone who was very troubled. And he points to the fact that his mother died just about two years ago. And that since then, the government has not been the same. But this doesn't really give any more clarity as to the motive here. But let me tell you what the dad has been telling reporters and certainly law enforcement and that he describes that his son at some point became isolated, and evil and angry, and that he was getting more bitter, angry and bitter, and that he let himself go. And sort of indications of that was that his son stopped cutting his hair, stopped taking care of himself. He even said that his teeth started falling and falling out. And so he lived with the dad, but certainly the dad is painting a picture of someone who was very troubled. Other indications of whether or not the dad may have known that something like this or that the son was thinking of something like this is really unclear and what steps he did to alert authority to any concerns over his son. And also the fact that it appears that he had at least three guns on him at the time, you know, and were any steps taken to let law enforcement know that this man possessed these weapons. So these are all questions certainly that law enforcement is going to try to answer but I just want to highlight that none of this even though we know that this was an individual who was troubled and was having, you know, some difficulty in life does not give really any explanation here as to the motive yet.",

An alert telling us that there was an active shooter on campus. And to be really candid at the time, what I thought was that this is probably, you know, nothing all that serious, but I decided I was going to leave campus anyway. I will tell you, Kasie, as I left campus, it was unlike anything I've ever seen. It only takes a couple of minutes to get off campus. And by the time I was at the edge of campus, the law enforcement officials from several jurisdictions had converged on campus. And it was clear to me at that point that something serious was happening. Like a lot of folks, you know, I got back home and began to listen into scanners to try to understand what was going on.

They come from different backgrounds, and they have various motives.But, you know, the note -- and as Shimon Prokupecz stated earlier, the comments by the father around how this had the suspect, you know, you let himself go, those are all indicators, those are all behavioral indicators that law enforcement is looking at, right? Think about it this way, it is not normal to wake up, walk into a location and actively kill somebody, right? People just don't do that. There has to have been some red flags, some behavioral anomalies that precipitated this event. And that's where we, as a community, need to get smarter, and be able to quickly identify those behavioral anomalies, especially if someone has access to weapons, you know, weapons, guns, long guns, handguns, they're all the common denominator here in these these mass attacks.

There are millions of people in this country, millions of firearms. Most people are responsible gun owners, but guns still fall into the hands of the wrong people.

Now, this question is, does Mike Pence count under the law as, quote unquote, a member of Congress when he seated at that dais.

And I think Nikki Haley, with her campaign video today, and her expected announcement tomorrow in Charleston, is to some extent dealing with a similar problem, which is that at first she was completely against Donald Trump. Then when he became president, she joined his administration, served as as U.N. ambassador, then said she wouldn't run if he ran, then was against his handling of January 6, and said he was too tainted, but then said if he ran, she wouldn't run. But now she's running again.

She's making a generational argument. If that's not an argument against Trump, I don't know what is but that said she won't say his name, like how can she be effective if she won't do that?",

      "sentences": "Well, look, I also think whatever ever she frames her argument, her entry into the race is on balance, a gift for Donald Trump. The fundamental, the core divide, the key dynamic in the Republican race is the difference -- the divergence between Republican voters with and without a college education. Each about half of the primary electorate almost exactly half.And in 2016, Donald Trump dominated among the non-college Republicans, but he won only about a third, Kasie, of college educated Republicans, even as he, you know, marched toward the nomination. His situation I think, in 2024, is not that different. He is still much stronger among non-college than college Republicans. So anything that splinters the vote among those college Republicans who are the most resistant to him, and who I think would have to be the foundation of a DeSantis candidacy benefits Donald Trump. And Nikki Haley, like Tim Scott, like Chris Sununu, like Larry Hogan, like Glenn Youngkin are all candidates who are likely to draw more of their support from the college side of the party than the non-college side with the risk that those voters again splinter among too many candidates to power a true alternative to Trump strength among the blue collar side of the party.",
