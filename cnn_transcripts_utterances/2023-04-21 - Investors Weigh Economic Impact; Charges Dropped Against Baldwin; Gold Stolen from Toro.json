And this morning there are also growing concerns about how the debt ceiling crisis could also affect the economy. CNN's Vanessa Yurkevich is tracking all of us, and she joins us. So, Vanessa, we have seen signs that the economy is slowing, which is, of course, good news for the Fed, but certainly a debt ceiling crisis is not good news for the Fed. It's certainly not good news for many Americans. How would this impact most people watching at home and ordinary Americans?",

Right now we have extraordinary measures in place that allows the Treasury to move money around to buy Congress a little more time. But what is at stake for the American people are significant cuts to payments that they receive every month. So we're talking about impacts on Social Security payments. Millions of Americans rely on these checks every single month. We're talking about payments to veterans. These are people who serve the country that now also rely on a lot of these services. And we're talking about increased borrowing costs for everyday Americans. So mortgage rates, auto loans and credit cards. And also federal employees' salaries, that's at stake. And also Medicare.So, it's important to note that as Congress is kind of playing with fire here, they're playing with some of the most vulnerable Americans livelihoods as well.",

The bottom line is, this happened in October of 2021. He was charged in January of 2023. Should you not have evaluated that weapon, made an assessment on that weapon with respect to whether it was modified, whether it was not. What was the chain of custody around that weapon? Was it operable? If there were things that could make it fire without pulling the trigger, that should have been said. It was tested by the FBI and apparently they concluded that it could only fire if you pull the trigger.But wait, there's new evidence that suggests that this modification means it can fire without pulling the trigger. Which one is it? I'll tell you more. Prosecutors also charged him in January with a crime that was not a crime at the time that it was committed. What do I speak of? I'm speaking about the enhancement charge where you get five years if you discharge a weapon. Well, that went into effect in March of 2022. The action was engaged in, in October 2021. What are we doing here? And so I think from the very beginning it was problematic. And also, if I can continue, you go and you prosecute him. You don't consult the union with respect to what an actor's role should be. Should they be firearm experts, right?",

What duty or responsibility do you have to now examine it yourself as an actor on the set?What -- now we know this new evidence suggests there are two things that are critical as to why prosecutors really had to do this. Number one, you're suggesting through the involuntary manslaughter charge, just to be clear, that suggests that you acted negligently or recklessly with respect to the dealing and handling of the firearm. Well, how do you establish that if the gun is modified and could have gone off on its own? Number two, you now lose the issue of causation. In order to establish a manslaughter, you have to establish that the party caused the death. How do you prove that as a prosecutor. Final disappointment, and that is in their statement. The prosecutors are saying, well, we can refile, recharge. What are you talking about? Just suggest, or at least tell and level with everyone that you blew it from the beginning, you shouldn't have charged from the very beginning, you should have seen if the weapon worked, right, when you had the 14 months to investigate.

There's a lot of focus on that body right now, especially with everything that's happened in the last month. You could understand now when you think about an ethics concern, you had two members who went down to the floor, made some noise about gun control, and they were thrown out. But then you had a member who was also under investigation for this workplace violation where he might have been talking to, as he said, two employees outside of work in what he said was consensual.
