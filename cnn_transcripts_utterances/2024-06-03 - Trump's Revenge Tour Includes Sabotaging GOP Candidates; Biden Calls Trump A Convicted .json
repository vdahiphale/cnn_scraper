The polls that are measuring how Americans actually think and feel in the immediate aftermath of this Trump verdict, well, just take a look at what they found. Americans think that the jury actually got it right. The Trump should have been convicted of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. And 49 percent say that Trump should end his campaign.But the virtue most important to the Republican Party is fealty. So, they are happy to swim upstream against public opinion and against recent history. Hogan's very public statement means that he's likely headed for a public breakup with MAGA, if that wasn't already the case. And, frankly, Trump doesn't have a great track record when it comes to picking candidates in truly competitive races. Remember, Trump backed Hershel Walker in the Senate race. Walker's campaign ended in a loss to Democrat Raphael Warnock. Remember Dr. Oz? Well, Trump backed him over a McConnell approved Senate choice. Oz lost. Blake Masters, he was a Trump favorite, too. Not a favorite of the voters, though. Adam Laxalt, Trump thought that he would win. He lost. In 2017, Republican Roy Moore got the Trump endorsement despite accusations that he sexually abused teenagers. Alabama, yes, Alabama picked a Democrat. The lesson here, that revenge is a dish that you are supposed to serve to the other guys, not to force feed to your own political party. Joining me now is former Montana Governor Marc Racicot. He's also the former chairman of the Republican National Committee. Governor, thanks for joining us tonight. When you hear Donald Trump's daughter in law, Lara Trump, who's now the head of the RNC, saying that Larry Hogan doesn't deserve the respect of anyone in the Republican Party, what goes through your mind? FMR. GOV. MARC RACICOT (R-MT): Well, it's incredibly, it's contemptuous, it's rude and inappropriate. Larry Hogan is for anybody, any conversation anywhere, but particularly when you're talking about politics and our democracy. Larry Hogan is a distinguished officeholder. He was elected in a Democratic state, strongly Democratic state. He was widely respected by virtually everyone he worked with. So, you know, at the end of the day, the only thing I can think about is that it was immature, it was contemptuous, and it was rude.",

And so in a week where the Republican Party has raised anywhere between $52 to $141 million, depending on who you're talking about, now is the time I think for Democrats to think about how are we going to pull numbers? How are we going to pull the same amount of money? And one of the ways that you do it is by tapping in.You know, I love that Michelle Obama phrase, when they go low, we go high. But we have all seen how that has worked out. It has not worked out.

But he's been attacked with death threats and ad hominem arguments, all of which have now crossed the line.Joining me now on all of this is the former director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, Dr. Rick Bright. Dr. Bright was fired because he cast doubt on hydrochloroquine's effectiveness as a COVID drug. That remedy had been embraced by then- President Trump. Dr. Bright, thanks for joining us. You heard earlier there Dr. Fauci put the responsibility for the invention of the six-foot social distancing guideline on the CDC. He said he didn't think it was right to blame another agency publicly. Do you buy that? DR. RICK BRIGHT, FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE, HHS: You know, watching the play, and thanks for having me on, but watching that replay really invokes a lot of PTSD. And it's really difficult to see people in Congress behave this way when we have so many issues that we need to address to make sure that we are better prepared for a next outbreak. You know, at the time, and as we are seeing now, we don't have all the information about the outbreak. We don't have all the answers, and we have to do what we have to do that we think is best to protect people at the time, and we will additional data as the time rolls on. And sometimes those guidelines or those things that we think we know change as we learn more data, and I have a feeling that many of those decisions made at that group level were made based on the best information we had at the time. However, I disagree with Dr. Fauci in saying that you shouldn't challenge a sister agency. I think, as scientists, we always challenge the science. And if we believe that science or things that are happening are wrong or incorrect or not in the best action, we should speak out. And there're consequences in speaking out, as I know dearly, for speaking out against chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. But If the truth needs to be told, we need to tell it and we need to save lives regardless if it's against a sister agency or any agency around the world.",
