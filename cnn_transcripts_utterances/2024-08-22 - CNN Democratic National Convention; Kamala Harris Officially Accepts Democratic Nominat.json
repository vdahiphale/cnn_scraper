She has not started any sort of sound check. If she does, I'm sure I will shut up and let you listen to that. Jubilant delegates have been eagerly awaiting tonight's grand finale. The nominee herself will close out their four-day party. Hello. I'm Jake Tapper. Welcome to THE LEAD. We are at the Democratic National Convention. As you see, the place has been hopping all week with lot of joy. Former President Clinton last night dubbed Kamala Harris, the president of joy. Oprah implored Americans to choose Joy in November. What about policy, though? Will Americans get specifics from Vice President Harris tonight when she delivers I think it's fair to say the biggest speech of her career? In just hours Harris Chris will formally accept her party's nomination and make the case directly to American voters. Why they should elect her, the 47th president of the United States. A distinct challenge given the unusual nature of her path to the nomination with no primary or caucus process or interviews or press conferences or debates or votes. Even the party platform is a relic of five weeks ago from President Biden. Biden was still the presumptive nominee. It still refers to the platform a second Biden term. Now, several aides involved in Harris's preparation tells CNN that she has refined the text different speech extensively over the last few days. And it will have three overarching objectives. One, sharing her story and her record with voters. Two, contrasting her vision with that of Donald Trump. And three, rooting her vision in patriotism. We're also going to hear Harris point out the, quote, dangers posed by the Project 2025 agenda. That is the conservative blueprint for a second Trump term that the former president is now trying to distance himself from, though we should note Trump aides and allies wrote all of it. CNN's Kaitlan Collins tells us that Mr. Trump has been furious about all the references to Project 2025 at this convention, including from Harris's running mate, Governor Tim Walz, last night in his primetime debut.

We're also going to be watching for how Harris addresses the crisis in the Middle East this evening. Last night, the anguished parents of Israeli-American hostage Hersh Goldberg delivered an emotional plea for their son's return. He is in Hamas captivity. They also acknowledged the pain on all sides of this ongoing conflict.

I can promise you, it's because  Pink is on stage and she's rehearsing and it's kind of been this moment every day where the delegates are starting to make their way into the convention floor, where the musical act is often bit on stage.Stevie Wonder was here yesterday, John Legend, John -- James Taylor on Monday. Now, it is Pink who is up here rehearsing. Obviously, everyone's getting ready to see that as well. But the main event tonight, of course, is vice president Harris. We have heard from everyone about her or her allies in the U.S. senate, her colleagues from California, her husband are running mate. But tonight, it is going to be time to hear from the candidate herself, in her own vision, in her own words, laying out her view of this campaign and what the next 70 or so days are going to look like. You know, most candidates months to prepare for a moment like this, went to speak at their own convention. Vice President Harris has had, one month and she was tweaking her speech yesterday. We did not actually see her here at the convention. She was watching the speeches from her hotel room. And so she's been working on that speech of what she's going to say. It's another notable point of this tonight is we've seen her out of the campaign drill, a lot holding these rallies as she did just earlier this week on Tuesday night with Governor Walz in Milwaukee. And so, what they're going to be doing tonight, though, is probably one of her longest speeches yet, to hear her views on where this race stands and what this race means from her directly. And so, of course, that in and of itself will be the headline speech tonight after hearing from everyone else, it will now be Harris's turned so try to stick the landing is everyone else has been making the case for her, she'll be making the case for herself tonight.",

Instead, he wants to politicize the issue demagogue, and as you see him doing today, rather than solved the problem. So I'm confident that Vice President Harris will make clear her readiness to sign that legislation, her adherence to the executive order, that President Biden issued in the last several months that has brought border crossing down to the lowest levels since before the pandemic in the Trump years. It's been extraordinarily effective along with a number of other border security measures that the administration has taken. So I think Donald Trump is grasping at straws when in fact, if he really cared about this, he would have allowed that legislation to be enacted.",

Kamala Harris is one of the most accomplished, ready, prepared vice presidents, ready to be president of the United States that we've had in decades. You know, when you look back, for example, in my area of national security, at the last five presidents of the United States, she is the most experienced and ready to be commander-in-chief of any of them, except Joe Biden, who is the current president.

Rohini has been one of them in that room sometimes pitching ideas, pitching to her. She's putting into them, trying to work out the language that eventually we hear in these high pressure moments.But I wanted to just put another point on it that that pressure is not just because she's going to be in this huge room with all these people at this high-stakes moment, but its also the pressure of being the first Black woman, that really weighs on her in these moments and trying not to be the last, I think that when we talk about her motivation, that's a huge part of it.",
