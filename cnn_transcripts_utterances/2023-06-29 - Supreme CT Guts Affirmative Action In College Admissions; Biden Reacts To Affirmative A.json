We'll get his first reaction on today's major Supreme Court ruling that changes affirmative action for college everywhere. I want to get right to CNN's Jeremy Diamond, who is standing by. Jeremy, what do we expect to hear from the President?",

      "sentences": "Well, listen, Dana, I can tell you that President Biden, after he learned of this breaking news this morning, he was briefed by the White House counsel on the implications of this decision, and he then convened a meeting of his senior staff who have been closely tracking this issue.This is, of course, something that the White House has been preparing for a possibility that they have been preparing for for months now. And my colleague Kevin Liptak is reporting that Biden administration officials have been working on contingency plans, including potential executive actions in the event that the court ruled in the way that it has now essentially ending the practice of affirmative action by race in college and university admissions. Now, we know that the White House is actively reviewing this decision. I wouldn't expect any of those executive actions to come down the pike today, but this is clearly something that the President did not want to see. This is not a ruling that he wanted to see. He last spoke about this back during a press conference late last year where he actually expressed, as he frequently does, some optimism that the Supreme Court would not actually rule in the way that it now has around affirmative action. And the President said that he was not so sure that they would overturn the precedents, overturn the existing decision. And what he also did, Dana, was he talked about beyond affirmative action in college admissions, the other steps that he would like to see to advance the cause of racial equity in this country. And we know that racial equity certainly is something that the President and this administration have put front and center. When you think back to even, for example, the pandemic vaccine distribution testing, racial equity was always at the center of various decisions that they made around where to deploy those strategies, for example. But he also talked about things like universal Pre-K, which he was not able to get in the Inflation Reduction Act. And student loans as well, which tomorrow the Supreme Court could also very well overturn in terms of forgiving student loans for college students across the country. Dana?",

And we're also tracking reaction from Republicans to this historic ruling, including, and especially those on the 2024 campaign trail.Back with me is Abby Phillip and Jeff Zeleny. I want to play for you what Tim Scott, who, not only is a candidate for president, wants to be the Republican nominee but also the only black Republican in the U.S. Senate. What he said. SEN. TIM SCOTT (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: One of the things that Harvard can do to make that even better is to eliminate any legacy programs where they have preferential treatment for a legacy kids. Let's make sure that all admissions are based on academic scores and not just eliminating affirmative action. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "He's right. I mean, legacy admissions, athletics, kids of faculty members represent a huge chunk of the Harvard undergraduate student population. Legacy admissions, in particular, which benefit predominantly white students is a huge part of the picture of college admissions.I appreciate that bit of nuance, but I think that that is lost in the rest of the conversation and it also doesn't address the other part of it, which is that it isn't just a question of whether individual students should have the right test scores, et cetera. It's also a question of whether or not, you know, parts of this country, large swaths of them, where black people live which were redlined and racially segregated and disinvested in public schools, whether the students who live there now or their parents still face any consequences from those things. And I think that's the part where the conversation doesn't go in the political space. And when it does go there, I mean, I think the court right now has basically said, no, that doesn't matter. I don't expect that to be talked about on the campaign trail, but I actually think that's something that Tim Scott really understands quite well because he grew up --",

We're going to see that in the current political environment within the Republican presidential field because they're all kind of tripping over themselves and each other to get to the right on this issue.And on that note, Ron DeSantis's campaign just tweeted a -- an old video of Donald Trump back in August 2015, and during an interview. He was asked whether or not he should keep -- society should keep affirmative action, and Donald Trump said, I'm fine with affirmative action. And then he went on to, you know, give a little bit more about the free market and so on and so forth. But generally saying, I'm fine with affirmative action. The DeSantis campaign thinks that they have something on him there.",

      "sentences": "And Dana, just to point out about Ron DeSantis, I mean, I do think this is an area where Ron DeSantis is poised to really outstrip. Perhaps all of the other candidates in the field because DeSantis has taken the state of Florida and really attacked the idea of diversity, which is really at the heart of all of this.The idea that diversity should even be something that we talk about in public education, in colleges, in, you know, the state at all. And so, he's gone much farther in terms of actual policy than most of the other Republicans. And in the field, including Trump -- and Trump, by no means, I don't think that that quote is even actually a very fair assessment of where Trump stands on affirmative action. He has a decades-long position of opposing the effects of affirmative action going back to the 80s. So there's that. But DeSantis has the policy. He, as a governor, has made this his calling card for at least the last several years, and I think that's going to have a major impact on Republicans.",
