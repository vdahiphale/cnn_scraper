And U.S. officials are now talking with one of Benjamin Netanyahu's main rivals Benny Gantz, a top member of Israel's War Cabinet making the rounds in Washington. He will meet with Vice President Kamala Harris, who on Sunday urged Israel to increase the flow of aid to Gaza \"no excuses\". When underscoring the desperate need. Palestinian officials say 15 children have now died of malnutrition and dehydration. Arlette Saenz is at the White House. Jeremy Diamond is in Tel Aviv. Arlette, I want to start with you.

      "sentences": "Well, Becky, first of all, I think when you look at that those air drops, I mean, first of all, it's kind ofilluminates how desperate this humanitarian situation is. I mean, these air drops are often a last resort of sorts, because they are costly, they are inefficient. It's just not a great way of getting an enormous amount of aid. But it just shows you how enormous the need is in Gaza that we're seeing multiple countries, including the United States, now resorting to those airdrops. But it also, frankly, is kind of an indictment of where the U.S. and Israel find themselves at this point in terms of addressing that humanitarian situation. Israel is one of the U.S.'s closest allies, and yet the U.S. is resorting to air drops, because Israel won't allow enough trucks to actually cross into Northern Gaza. It is an indication that the current mechanisms in place controlled by Israel are simply not working to get enough humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip, particularly in Northern Gaza, where we're now getting reports of 15 children according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, having died of malnutrition and dehydration with fears at one hospital in Northern Gaza. Those six more children could soon face the same fate if something immediate isn't changed. And yet, when you speak with Israeli officials, as I just did moments ago with an official from Colgate, which is the military agency in charge of getting that humanitarian aid into Gaza, they tell me that they believe this humanitarian situation is under control. They believe that Israel is letting enough humanitarian aid trucks into Gaza that is contradicted by every single humanitarian aid agency on the ground. It is also of course, contradicted by President Biden himself, who said late last week that Israel needs to do more to get more aid trucks into Gaza. Now, there does appear to be some new ways at work of trying to get more aid into Gaza. Israel is working directly with some Palestinian businessmen in the Northern Gaza Strip, including that aid convoy that we saw on Thursday that was part of that effort to get aid directly into the hands of Palestinian businessmen. But so far, it's not working, in part because of a lack of security for these aid convoys. We have seen in the past as Israel has targeted the police forces that previously provided security for those convoys. And so what you're getting is a situation where these aid convoys are rushed by hundreds, if not thousands of starving people, particularly in Northern Gaza. And so something needs to change here. And I think there's at least recognition of that from the United States. But so far, we haven't seen that situation actually dramatically change on the ground, Becky.",

And that seems to be the case, as we're looking at this past violence in the 72 hours that have just passed as far as solutions. So according to the Hungary government that the Prime Minister, they're looking at this multinational security support mission that the U.S. is funding in part, as well as several other countries and that involves right now at least 1000 Kenyan police officers that would be deployed in some unknown time period. It's believed to be pretty soon that that could happen. But that is incredibly controversial to many on the ground there because they look at this as an outside force coming in that would be intervening in what they consider to be a domestic issue. And then you've got added to that the gangs that are dozens of them that have essentially, as we showed there in that piece taken over an estimated 80 percent of Port-au-Prince alone, along with other parts of the country. And those gangs are looking at this as, again, somebody from the outside coming in to get involved with something that they believe they can handle.

Republican votes are on the line in 15 states while the U.S. territory of American Samoa holds its democratic caucus or one of the state's voting tomorrow is Colorado. And next hour, people casting ballots there could find out if votes for Donald Trump will count. That is because the U.S. Supreme Court could announce its ruling on Trump's eligibility to run for President in that state. Colorado's highest court deemed him ineligible citing the U.S. constitution's 14th amendment ban on insurrectionists. Joan Biskupic is connecting us from Washington. Joan, we know that the U.S. Supreme Court will drop an opinion today. What we don't know is whether it is this opinion.

So clearly, Becky, they have been racing to finish this Colorado ballot dispute. And that's because as you observed, voters will go in Colorado and several other states to the Super Tuesday primaries tomorrow. And you know, a key question here is should Donald Trump's name still be on the ballot, given that the Colorado Supreme Court said he should be disqualified based on that anti-insurrection's ban. So we expect it to come in the next hour, Becky. We also expect based on oral arguments on February 8, that Donald Trump's going to win this case, it's probably not even going to be close. But that's because this was an unusual provision of the U.S. Constitution enacted after the civil war that never has been used in this way.
