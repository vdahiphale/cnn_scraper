Good to have you with us today.Happening right now, the NTSB investigators are on the scene in Ohio after another Norfolk Southern train wrecked in the state. The Ohio EPA says that there were no hazardous materials released in that wreck after 28 train cars derailed in Springfield on Saturday. It downed power lines, knocking out power to some residents and prompting shelter-in-place orders for residents. It comes just a month after the Norfolk Southern train crash in East Palestine, Ohio. And crews there are still working to remove that contaminated soil and liquid from the site. CNN's Jason Carroll is in Springfield now. So, Jason, what are you learning about this latest crash?",

We can tell you, in terms of this latest derailment, it occurred on Saturday just at about 3:00. There was a man there who caught it on his cell phone just as these trains were tipping off the tracks. In all, 28 trains out of 200 cars derailed. But, again, we are being told that there was not a release of any hazardous materials. There were some cars, though, carrying some hazardous materials such as propane and ethanol.

It has mainly to do with these hot bearings, which, of course, was part of the reason why we saw what happened in East Palestine. You will remember there was a wheel bearing that had overheated. A sensor had detected there in East Palestine, but then what had happened was the crew was not alerted in time. And so what has happened here is, Norfolk Southern has come up with this six-point plan to enhance the system, which includes -- I'm going to read some of it to you here -- updating the detectors' ability to catch overheated bearings, to do that more effectively. Another point that they're going to do is review their standards and practices for using hot bearing detectors. And, three, Abby, what they're going to be doing is adding 13 new acoustic detectors, which apparently are able to spot a problem of a visual -- that a visual inspection cannot, so some of the things that they are adding here to try to improve their system. But I have to tell you very quickly, one of the things that the critics say is one simple thing that you can do is add more crews to some of these trains. Remember what happened in East Palestine. You had three crew members there for a train that stretched more than a mile-long -- Abby.",

Now, according to the airline, shortly after takeoff, the pilot there reported a bird strike. It appears that one bird hit the plains engine, it caught fire. And another bird hit the plane's nose. As a result of what happened, that plane was turned around. It was able to make a safe emergency landing back in Havana. And we're told that, by the time that aircraft landed, firefighters were already on the runway, they were able to put out that fire, and everyone that was on board that plane was able to get off safely. It appears that a good number of folks were able to get onto another flight late last night. And we're told it appears at least that the majority -- or the remaining group of passengers that were on that plane were able to get on another flight back to Florida.

And now a source tells CNN it may all have been a mistake. The FBI is saying that the victims were abducted by an unidentified gunman shortly after driving into Mexico in the border town of Matamoros. Now, a U.S. official tells CNN that the Americans were not the intended targets, and that they were there for medical procedures. So, this morning, the U.S. ambassador to Mexico confirmed that one Mexican citizen, an innocent bystander, was killed in this incident. Let's bring in former FBI supervisory special agent Peter Licata. So, Peter, when you hear that they're -- these individuals were basically accidentally targeted in this attack, they were not the intended victims, what does that indicate to you?",

And I'm sure the U.S. government, via the FBI and the legal attache's office in Mexico City and Department of State have done what we call due diligence on some background on who these individuals were. So they have run them through -- these American citizens through numerous indices. And there's apparently no record of past or ongoing criminal activity, which then takes them out of that -- out of that realm.

Do you think that, given that this was clearly -- they were not apparently the people who were targeted here, that that increases the likelihood that they could be returned safely in this environment? LICATA:  Well, you hope so, right? So now, if you put yourself in the mind of the criminal act, and so now they're in a panic mode, perhaps, so they have to figure out what they want to do, how they're going to potentially expose or not expose themselves to their whereabouts in order to have these individuals released. They obviously have no valuables on them. There's no narcotics. There's nothing they can really hold against them if they thought they were a rival cartel or somebody that was shepherding narcotics or illegal substances or contraband across the border near Brownsville, Texas. So these are things that this criminal organization is going to have to try to figure out very quickly before, one would hope, the arm of the Mexican federal government moves in on them.",

So, the State Department's advisory is obviously correct, right, kidnappings and violence against American citizens crossing the border for whatever reason, legitimate or not. Here's the deal. Americans tend not to abide by these warnings. Some people don't even know they exist on the State Department Web site. They just drive or go wherever they need to, to get what it is they want, whether it's for tourism, whatever -- whatever the travel is for. I advise folks, no matter where they're traveling, even if it's to Western Europe, London, Paris, Spain, somewhere allegedly safe. You always carry multiple passports, you fill out what we call an electronic country clearance with the State Department. So, this way, the State Department knows who you are, why you're -- what country you're traveling in, what your itinerary is, and why you're safe. And by no means that's some reason for the State Department to monitor activities, because, trust me, they're not. It's in case something like this happens or even something more benign, like a natural disaster, bad weather, a storm, a hurricane, an earthquake.

The special counsel probe into Donald Trump's effort to overturn the 2020 election is ramping up now. And the former president is using his go-to legal argument to try to block more testimony. This time, Trump wants a federal judge to stop former Vice President Mike Pence from testifying, again, citing executive privilege. Now, already, Pence is arguing that he shouldn't have to testify because of the Constitution's Speech and Debate Clause. And here to discuss all of this is CNN legal analyst Jennifer Rodgers. So, Jen, this has been an ongoing argument. Trump has tried to use executive privilege before. It has failed. But this case does concern his discussions potentially with his own vice president.

Executive privilege will fall in the face of the DOJ's need for testimony here. There's a Supreme Court case squarely on point, United States vs. Nixon, which says -- and it's exactly the same facts as we have here -- in a criminal investigation, when the government can demonstrate a need for the testimony, which they can here because there were conversations that took place where only Trump and Pence were present, so Pence is the only witness who can testify about them -- then executive privilege will not stop that testimony from being obtained and coming in. So it's -- there's precedent right there. The question is, the other go-to thing that the former president does, of course, is to appeal everything as far as it can go. So, even though it's a fairly easy answer on the law, it will take time for the courts to get through if he continues to appeal all the way to the Supreme Court, which we probably should expect him to do.",
