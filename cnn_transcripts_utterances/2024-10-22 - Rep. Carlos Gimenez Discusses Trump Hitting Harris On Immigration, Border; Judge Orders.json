And so, you know, there is no doubt that the Democrat Party and Kamala Harris wants to move us to the left. Remember, Kamala Harris was -- was rated to the left of Bernie Sanders in the Senate. And Bernie Sanders is a self-proclaimed Socialist. So, no, I just don't -- I don't think that that's an exaggeration at all. And the problem is that the Democrats, especially Kamala Harris, when you peg her down, oh, no, no. I don't believe that. I believe -- I'm OK with fracking now. Oh, I don't believe in universal health care. No, no, no, no, I'm not there anymore. And yet those were her beliefs for decades. And so the president is just it's calling her out. And so the news media, I guess this outlet, is trying to say no, no, no, she's really a centrist. She's not a centrist. She is probably the most radical left-leaning or leftist presidential candidate we've had in our -- in our history. And you can't cover up her past.
