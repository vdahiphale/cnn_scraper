I'm Laila Harrak ahead on CNN Newsroom.Boris Johnson ruling out a political comeback at least for now after bowing out in the race for British prime minister. We're live in London with the latest. Plus, millions of Ukrainians could be facing a long dark winter after Russian attacks on critical infrastructure. Russia is using energy as a weapon of war. And protests in Iran triggering solidarity rallies around the world and it doesn't seem they'll be letting up anytime soon. We could find out within hours who will become Britain's new prime minister. The country's third in a matter of weeks while the ruling Conservative Party will announce which candidates have reached the necessary 100 nominations and whether a vote will follow to determine the next leader of the party and the new prime minister. One thing is clear, Boris Johnson not in the running. The former leader announced he would not be moving forward even though he claims he has enough support. Mr. Johnson's announcement came hours after Britain's former Finance Minister Rishi Sunak officially entered the race. Mr. Sunak narrowly lost the last leadership contest to Liz Truss, who announced she was stepping down on Thursday. House of Commons Leader Penny Mordaunt is also a contender. CNN Scott McLean is following developments for you and joins us now live from outside 10 Downing Street. Scott, another quiet day in politics in the U.K. Tell us what led to Mr. Boris Johnson's pulling out of the toy leadership contest.",

But he is the one who has warned throughout his previous leadership run over the summer that these would be tough choices and things would not be easy. He criticized his opponent Liz Truss for her plan to cut taxes at a time when there's a huge hole in the public finances.

STEVEN JIANG, CNN BEIJING BUREAU CHIEF: Well Laila, it certainly appears to be the case. But that kind of absolute hold on power is not without its risk. As you look at his new line up as Selina was saying there -- the number two ranked Li Qiang and the number six ranked Ding Xuexiang -- they are expected to become the next premier and executive vice premier, basically the two men who will be in charge of the world's second largest economy. But when you look at the resume, they have something in common. They have both served as Xi's secretary, and Ding is actually still Xi's chief of staff now but they both lack national level policy making and governance experience. So that's why there's a lot of concern not only in China, but around the world, because they are going to take charge at a time when there's a global recession on the economy. When this economy is facing heavy headwinds. And a large part of that is due to their boss' strict zero COVID policy. And they're unlikely to do anything to change that. And Li Qiang in particular, as again Selina mentioned, gained notoriety for his mishandling of the Shanghai lockdown.

But the one thing, the one clear message out of this party congress is now Xi's governing philosophy will be further strengthened in every aspect of the party's daily work.One of his favorite phrases, the fighting spear (ph), has now been written into the party constitution. So, that applies not only to the military, but also to other policy areas as well notably foreign policy. So, it's very likely we are going to see more and more increasingly assertive and aggressive Chinese diplomats around the world really trading their fire on anyone who dares to question their government. So that does not bode well for anyone who was hoping to see some calming of tensions between China and the west, particularly with the United States. And one notable thing here, Laila, is the current foreign minister, Wang Yi, who is often seen as the epitome of that doctrine, he got elevated into the 24-member politburo despite being 69 years old, Laila.",

But in recent days, he allegedly made use of social media to attack a supreme court judge, a violation of his house arrest terms. On Sunday morning, the supreme court ruled that Jefferson violated the terms, and ordered federal police to serve him with a prison sentence, according to CNN Brazil. But the former congressman, who served as an ally of current President Jair Bolsonaro while he was in congress, refused to follow the agent and attacked them with firearms, injuring two of them. The incident took place less than a week before the second round of the Brazilian presidential election between Bolsonaro and former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. And at a moment where political polarization in Brazil is the highest it's been in years, according to a recent poll, the two candidates are separated by only less than five percentage points. Both Bolsonaro and Lula condemned Jefferson for his conduct. And Jefferson agreed to surrender and was finally detained on Sunday night, only after hours of tense negotiations. And according to our affiliate, CNN Brazil, he's now being charged with attempted murder. For CNN, this is Stefano Pozzebon, Bogota. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Roslyn had sustained winds of more than 190 kilometers an hour when it hit the shoreline. At least two deaths have been reported in Mexico. Since then, the storm has broken up over the mountains. Some of Roslyn's heavy rains left a thick coating of mud behind, which emergency services and even children pitch into try to clean up with hand shovels. Well, it's been three weeks now since Hurricane Ian hit southwest Florida. Many people in the area still don't have power, water, or sewer services back. While, thousands of survivors are only at the start of a long road to recovery, it's even more difficult for older Floridians, some of whom have lost homes they bought for retirement.
