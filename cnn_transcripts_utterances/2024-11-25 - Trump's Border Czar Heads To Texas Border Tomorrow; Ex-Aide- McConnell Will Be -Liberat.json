Tomorrow, his border czar, Tom Homan will travel to Eagle Pass, Texas, to tour the border with Governor Greg Abbott and National Guard soldiers who are stationed there. Now, the centerpiece of Trump's plan is a massive deportation campaign. He's promised to deport all immigrants in the country illegally. My panel is back.So, you know, when you ask about polls, depending on how you ask the question, it depends on how people respond, whether they think this is a good idea or not, and whether they recognize the impact that this could have to them, their economy, their community. But this is what the question was posed. Trump is planning to deport all immigrants in the U.S. illegally, according to this new poll that came out, 57 percent do approve of it, 43 percent do not approve of it. But, as always, especially with something like this, the devil's in the details, and Trump has not explained how they would do this.",

I mean, in many respects, the election was a referendum on the idea of this, but we're about to get beyond the idea of it. We're about to get to the nuts and bolts of it.And the reality is it will likely start with criminals who are here and other things. But once it goes beyond that, if it does, I mean, there could be massive disruptions across the sectors, from construction to agriculture to hospitality. So we'll see if those numbers stay as high there for supporting this once it actually starts impacting people's lives. But look, this is a massive undertaking that the Trump administration is going to be embarking on. Yes, they know much more in the second -- I mean in the second iteration than the first in terms of how to do things like this, but it will be challenged legally but just the process of doing it, many, many, many questions about this.",

We were just talking about Russ Vought at the Office of Management and Budget. One thing that conservatives have -- have proposed doing is, yes, the physical deportation of these people might be stymied when they try to go through with it, but there are ways through executive orders that they can make it impossible for these people to maintain bank accounts, to maintain mortgages, to maintain leases on housing. And so you could pull the financial rug out from under many of these immigrants before you physically deport them from the country, essentially trying to send a very strong signal to anyone trying to come here and to also make it impossible for anyone who is here to stay. So that's something that's not really getting talked about, and that could have a very dramatic economic impact if all of a sudden you have these people who are no longer able to earn money to then spend that money back in the economy in one fell swoop, if that's something that they decide to do early on.",

Most people believe that immigration and border patrol agencies should do that, 82 percent, just 40 percent, say the U.S. military should be involved in this. And this is something that Trump himself endorsed, saying, posting a Truth Social post, saying true when posed the idea of using the military.This is not going to be a particular popular idea. A lot of Democrats clearly don't support this. But some Republicans, including one who could chair a key committee overseeing the Homeland Security Department, says he wouldn't support it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. JOHN BARRASSO (R-WY): We have a national security crisis in this country right now because of our open border. And when he declares it a national emergency, he can appropriately use the military. SEN. RAND PAUL (R-KY): I will not support and will not vote to use the military in our cities. I think it's a terrible image. I don't recommend to use the army, but I would use the FBI. I would use ICE. I would use Border Patrol. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Like, will Congress approve this? And if Congress doesn't, if Democrats block funding for this, does he just divert money from other agencies to do this? There's a whole Posse Comitatus issue. I mean, like, this is going to be a huge challenge. I do think what you don't see them ever talking about is, and I think this is fascinating, but you're talking about executive orders. They don't talk about criminalizing hiring undocumented migrants. If they were to cut, that's been an issue for a long time, e-verify and all this stuff. They don't talk about cutting off the jobs there. They talk about punishing the migrants, but not the people employing them. And I think that's, you know, if they were really serious about it, they would go there, and I think there would be some support for that.

I think when you ask Trump advisers or people within the Republican Party how they would carry it out, everybody has a different answer. Nobody is quite clear, or certainly nobody that I've talked to is quite clear on how it would happen.But the problem I think that they're going to run into is not just the procedural problems, not just maybe the members in Congress that would have an issue, but also the American voters. Because when you ask American voters, are you in favor of deportation, you get one answer. But if you get more specific, are you in favor of violent deportation? Are you in favor of people being taken from their homes? You're getting different types of answers. And so there is a real question of what the capacity is for Americans to support it if you get more specific about how it is carried out.",

Of course, he kept open that Senate seat that Barack Obama's Supreme Court seat. He kept that vacant for a year, helped shift the Supreme Court dramatically to the right, but a big falling out in the aftermath of January 6th.Donald Trump, after he lost the election, Mitch McConnell said Joe Biden won. And then after January 6th, while he voted to acquit Donald Trump in that impeachment trial, Collins said he was morally and practically responsible for what happened on January 6th. So you have some comments of what Donald Trump, what McConnell said about Trump to a historian in late December 2020. This is what Mike Tackett writes about McConnell's comments here. He said, McConnell said, he is not only well, he's stupid as well as being ill-tempered and can't even figure out where his own best interests lie. And that's certainly been on full display. Trump's behavior, he said, only underscores the good judgment of the American people. They've had -- just -- they've just had enough of the misrepresentations, the outright lies almost on a daily basis, and they fired him. And for a narcissist like him, that's been really hard to take. And so his behavior since the election has been even worse by far than it was before because he has no -- no filter now at all.
