Hello and welcome back to the show! After nearly 17 months after he was ousted from office, and currently on trial for corruption, Benjamin Netanyahu is on the verge of an emphatic return to power. With the vast majority of votes now counted in Israel's elections. The Former Prime Minister's Likud Party and its allies are projected to win a majority of seats in Israel's Parliament, the Knesset. Well, the current Prime Minister Yair Lapid says he wants to wait for the final results before any concession. Those results could be announced later Wednesday or into Thursday. Hadas Gold back with his this hour from Jerusalem. And Benjamin Netanyahu is likely returned to power fueled by far right surge, explain?",

People say it's partly because some of these right wing voters have sort of lost their home think about Naftali Bennett once was the Prime Minister of Israel led a right wing settler party, his party completely fell apart. They are no longer going to be part of this Parliament. So those voters may have gone there. And then also you have Benjamin Netanyahu, his previous coalition, governments saw him teaming up with people like the current Defense Minister, Benny Gantz and others across the more sort of the centrist parties, less needing to rely on these right wing parties. But as the years have gone on, he's alienated a lot of these politicians and parties that share his ideology, but because of Benjamin Netanyahu himself, either the personality either because of burn bridges either because of the corruption trail, they just outright refuse to sit with him. And then just you know, what we've seen over the past year is just the really explosion of popularity, especially among young right wing voters in these people with the leaders who are like Itamar Ben-Gvir, who has been convicted for inciting racism. Bezalel Smotrich, he's one of the other leaders of his party, who wants from the Israeli Parliament shouted at Arab Israeli Members of Parliament saying them that they don't belong there that they don't belong in Israel. These are members of parliament; they have just grown in popularity. Now they will be the third largest party in the Israeli Parliament, according to the numbers we are seeing the official numbers still have not all been counted, but that's likely what's going to happen. And this will represent a far lurch to the right in the Israeli government. And then the question will be where will they be in this government? What sort of ministerial positions will these politicians have, because that could really factor that could really affect Israeli policy.",

You can see him here in this clip pulling out a gun in the middle of clashes between Palestinians and Israelis in the highly contentious neighborhood of Jerusalem. Israeli TV footage showed him at one point saying if they throw stones, shoot them. I want to talk more about this with Ofer Cassif he is part of the Jewish App Hadash Party in Israel's Knesset.

You can see that the far right, extreme right the fascist right is not much stronger than those who are against it. It's almost 50/50. But because of the specific way of voting the system in Israel, which is a coalition and a parliamentary system, as you know, so the system translates, so to speak, the votes into seats in a specific way that gives priority at the moment to those fascist state fractions. So this is something that must be understood, because not all Israelis and not all Jews in Israel and fascists, unfortunately, and many of them are out and they are powerful now, because of different reasons. Now, as to your question I think that there are two main motivations or incentives to the turnout of those who support the fascist factions. First, is a global one, we can see that in many places around the globe in the last few years, fascist racist factions succeed in elections. We saw it recently, in Italy, we then - we saw it in the United States a few years ago. And of course, in Hungary and other places, I think it's a byproduct of the global economic crisis, and especially finding a scapegoat in the image of minorities, either Muslims or refugees or asylum seekers, or others.",

Because these look at - these show the patterns of Arab citizens' participation in the Knesset elections over the last two decades.

In retaliation, South Korea has launched three air-to-surface missiles from fighter jets; we are seeing this escalate into a sort of tit for tat. Now critical here, Becky is the timing. This escalation comes just two days after scheduled U.S. and South Korean joint military exercises that involve hundreds of aircraft it involves thousands of military personnel from both countries. In response to that North Korea had called it a rehearsal for an invasion and had threatened even more powerful follow up measures. What experts are saying is that what we saw today is another response to those joint military exercises and escalating tensions as a pretext for potentially a future even larger provocation. Just last week, the United Nations nuclear watchdog had warned that North Korea could be preparing for a nuclear test. The last one they did was in 2017. And the satellite imagery does show activity at North Korea's underground nuclear test site. Another key context - point of context here as well is that North Korean Leader Kim Jong-Un has repeatedly vowed to expand the nuclear power to expand the missile forces because he sees that as critical to not just regime stability but also in increasing his leverage in any future discussions with United States. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is set to meet with his South Korean counterpart at the Pentagon on Thursday, Becky, we know that there's going to be plenty for them to discuss.",

But I think when you view all of this in the round, what does seem to be happening is Russia is re-equipping with both men and munitions. This war has gone a much longer than they expected. So what we're seeing here, around the Kramatorsk area the Donetsk front, if you will, is significant in this. There has been an increase in Russian bombardment and pressure along many points on the front line here in a new area in the front line here, opened up by Russia for a further push. So sort of three key towns or areas under heavy Russian push at the moment along the front line, a little bit to the north, Ukrainians seem to be taking some territory but over a long stretch. Now, Russia is giving the indication that it's got the armaments and the men now to push back and push along the front line to try to take more of the territory of the Donetsk which they say they intend to take President Putin's initial plan for Ukraine. So I think what we're seeing is Russia come back, not in territory terms from losses that they've had, not being able to hold the frontline better, but actually come back with more men and material to try again.

We do know that Biden plans to directly address election deniers as well, in light of several Republican candidates here who have openly said that they may not accept the results of the election unless they themselves win their race. Now, the timing of this speech obviously comes as midterms are approaching here. We're really in the thick of voting at this moment, Becky.

The U.S. and Saudi Arabia fear that Tehranis planning an attack on energy infrastructure in the Middle East, particularly in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. That report from a source who says officials in Washington and Riyadh have been sharing intelligence that indicates an attack may be imminent. Well, my next guest says he saw this coming. Karim Sadjadpour tweet and I quote here, \"I warned about this last week. Iran's internal vulnerabilities coupled with perceptions of a U.S. Saudi rift have increased the possibility that Tehran may attempt another attack on Saudi Arabia\". Well, Karim Sadjadpour joins me now, he's an Iran expert and a senior associate at the International Affairs Think Tank, Carnegie Endowment, a good friend of this show. This is important stuff. Tell us explain what do we know at this point. KARIM SADJADPOUR, SR. ASSOCIATE, CARNEGIE ENDOWMENT: So there's a couple of a thing happening, Becky, internally Iran is more vulnerable than it's ever been since the 1979 revolution. And one of Iran sources of vulnerability is news coming from the outside. And this is something that was unexpected. Probably the number one news channel right now inside Iran is called Iran International, which is a Saudi supported London based satellite news network. And the Iranian Revolutionary Guards essentially issued an ultimatum two weeks ago. They said to Saudi Arabia, either shut down Iran International or there will be consequences, the smoke will get in your eyes. At the same time, this is coming at a time of a rift between the United States and Saudi Arabia or rift over oil production and perception that the United States perhaps doesn't have Saudi Arabia's back in the same way that it had before. And so the combination of these two factors, I think, has made it dangerous possibility of Iran trying another attack on Saudi Aramco. They did it in 2019 and they essentially got away with it.",

      "sentences": "Yes, they got away with it. Because, you know, they will believe they got away with it, because President Trump as he was then great fan andfriend of Saudi Arabia didn't respond in kind. They could be forgiven in Tehran for believing that this rift between the U.S. and Saudi has hit such an idea - that as you point out, you know, they were correct in thinking that the Americans wouldn't have the Saudis back. That is not clear at this point, is it?",

      "sentences": "Well, we've seen statements from even prominent, moderate centrist Democrats, allies of President Biden calling for cessation of U.S.Saudi defense cooperation. And so the Iranians obviously see these things as well. But a rift between the United States and Saudi Arabia is really a lose-lose for both countries because when Saudi Arabia when it appears that, you know, their chief strategic backer, the United States no longer has their back that leaves them vulnerable to Iranian attack. And likewise, if Iran attempts another attack on Saudi Arabia, which disrupts global oil production, you know, that hurts the global economy, that hurts the United States and it hurts the Democrats chances of reelection.",

      "sentences": "I think these nuclear talks are perhaps not quite dead, but they're certainly in a coma for a couple of reasons. One, obviously, isIran's internal uprising, as long as there are tens of thousands of Iranians taking to the streets throughout the country, and Iran is killing its citizens, the United States is going to have a very difficult time providing Iran, billions of dollars in sanctions relief. But I think a more recent development, which has been similarly impactful is Iran sending drones to Vladimir Putin to use against Ukrainian civilians, that has concentrated not mines not only in the United States but also in Europe. The Europeans are now having hesitations about the idea of giving Iran sanctions relief. ANDERSON: I wonder what the impact of these concerns about threats on energy infrastructure around this region? And you know, let's be quite clear, there is a lot of energy infrastructure around this region. It isn't just in Saudi Arabia, this energy infrastructure, of course, here in the UAE and elsewhere. We have seen the mending of ties between a number of Gulf allies, not least the UAE and Gulf countries, not least the UAE and Tehran of late. And the UAE, only, again a couple of months ago suggesting they would return an ambassador to Tehran. What is the impact of these threats on those relations, those regional relations because it looked as if things were changing here and that we were seeing the de-conflicting this region as it were?",

The onecountry I would say within the Middle East has benefited from instability has been Iran, I would say outside the Middle East the one country that benefits from instability in Russia. And so I think, for the United States, Saudi Arabia, UAE, their goal is to try to de- escalate this. But you know, at a time when Iran feels incredibly vulnerable internally, it's perhaps capable of doing things outside the ordinary.",

Well, South Korea mourns and seeks answers after a deadly tragedy; the police chief in the Seoul district has been suspended. That's where the crowd surge happened killing at least 156 people when a Halloween celebration went terribly wrong on Saturday. Police have launched a special investigation and officials also raided police stations across Seoul, seizing internal reports and documents. Records show police were warned hours before the tragedy about a potentially dangerous situation.
