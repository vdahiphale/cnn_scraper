Today, a federal appeals court upheld a law that would ban the social media app in the U.S. next month unless it's Chinese parent company agrees to sell it.Let's discuss the impact of the decision with Lance Ulanoff. He's TechRadar editor-at-large. Lance, it's great to see you. This decision was more or less expected, but it means that TikTok is one step closer to a ban, of course, unless it's parent company, ByteDance, agrees to sell it by January of next year. ByteDance said in April they didn't want to sell. Do you think they've changed their mind? LANCE ULANOFF. EDITOR-AT-LARGE, TECHRADAR: No. I really don't. I still think they consider it a point of pride that this is such a globally popular app and extremely popular in the U.S. Even though TikTok instituted Project Texas, which basically took the whole the whole company, the U.S. part of it, made it a U.S. operation. So they theoretically have a lot less control over it. But there's just been no signals. And it's also unclear who can really afford to buy them.",

And we're -- we're entering that area of uncertainty.You know, between now and January 19th, what is going to happen? Something must happen. It is super unlikely that TikTok wins its appeal. You know, if it goes to the Supreme Court, it just doesn't seem likely it's going to happen. So what TikTok won't -- I don't think ByteDance will let TikTok simply evaporate from the U.S. market. So it may now finally be interested in entertaining that exit idea. But can anybody put together the right number for them? I don't know. It would take someone big. It would take someone, maybe Apple size.",

But it is -- you know, it's honestly quite unclear because we know that Trump has said, you know, that if you ban TikTok, it would make META stronger. META is an American company. But Trump has -- you know, he really doesn't like them very much. So I don't know entirely what's going to happen. But a lot of it will probably have to do with the people around Trump and what they think. And one thing I want to emphasize here is that, in this whole time frame, when people have asked legislators and people and government officials, what are they so afraid of, like what have they seen that makes them so worried about ByteDance? There are certain things they've never told us. They say they've seen things that give them great concern. We just don't know what those things are.",

What does the information tell you about what this disease could be? DR. MICHAEL OSTERHOLM, DIRECTOR, THE CENTER FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASE RESEARCH AND POLICY, UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA: Well, first of all, I think there's been a rush to judgment that this is somewhat of a mystery disease. And while, in fact, we don't yet know what's causing it, it's not been because we've tried looking for it and found that there was no answer. It's because the lab tests that really needed to be done just weren't done. This was in a remote part of the DRC. And while cases started in late October, we're just now getting the first lab tests completed.

In terms of the respiratory like symptoms that you just mentioned, which sounds like early influenza, it sounds like it could be any number of respiratory illnesses. And I suspect that when the final numbers come in, they're not going to be quite the same we've heard. I've actually had numbers that range from 29 to 179 deaths, all since October. So there are now the right health officials on the ground. We're going to know what the real numbers are. We're going to know, is this, in fact, one single disease, or is it a series of respiratory viruses that may be causing the problem? And again, I come back and just remind us all.
