Plus, how Artificial Intelligence is being used to create deepfake porn and how the technology is consistently targeting one group, women? Leaders from around the world are at a security conference in Munich at this hour where the war in Ukraine is expected to dominate the agenda. Live pictures here from the conference and for the first time in two decades, Russia was not invited. You can see there, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy delivering an open address by video link. It comes just days before the first anniversary of Russia's invasion of this country. And he started by referencing the biblical battle between David and Goliath. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Last year when the country was invaded in fact, prior to that, the Ukrainian position has been that all Russian troops have to leave all of Ukraine which at the time, then to Crimea, and of course, parts of Luhansk and Donetsk province, colloquially known as the Donbas.Now, the Russians have tried to seize more territory and the Ukrainians are stronger now than they were then. And they are hell bent on ridding themselves of this Russian invader force, firstly and secondly, ridding the country of the longest standing rebel republics, if you want to call them that way, in the east of the country. So there's no real change at all in Zelenskyy's position, I think what is different in the Munich Conference, and in his Defense Ministers meetings in Europe and elsewhere, more recently is that they're getting more confident about the sort of equipment that they're going to be given to fight. They are talking to Ukrainians, that is about a spring offensive or planning some kind of offensive action. We have seen here in Eastern Ukraine, an increase in Russian activity from Kupiansk and Sumy, up in the north, right down as far as Vuhledar and the frontline going east, west towards Zaporizhzhia. So right across a very long frontline, there has been an increase in Russian activity being seen here on the ground really is shaping operations for what might be a Russian offensive. Of course, as you know, Max, the assessment of the Americans in particular, is that the Russians may not actually even be capable of launching and offensive. But that is certainly not something that the Ukrainians are resting on their laurels with that kind of information. They are desperately calling for more sophisticated weaponry, again and again, calling for tanks and longer range artillery and missile systems, Max.",

So it could be a very costly switch in tactic if the Russians were going to do that.They do, however, have a very significant edge indeed, in terms of men and material when it comes to aviation. They've got far more helicopters, far more jets, far more capability to launch mass aerial attacks against Ukraine. But so far they've restricted those aerial attacks to those waves of cruise missile and Shahed drones from Iran, supplied by Iran are going after the electrical infrastructure here. That may shift that is deeply concerning to the Ukrainians, which is why they are asking for more and more air defenses, Max.",

In fact, according to a summary that was published from the state run news agency Xinhua, China had \"created a miracle in human history\".But this miracle is being seen as dubious by a number of experts and a number of physicians. A lot of questions here, including the reality of the death toll of COVID in China. In fact, after zero COVID ended, China reported 80,000 COVID related deaths in a population of more than 1.4 billion people. Statistically speaking, that seems to be a little bit off According to experts, including the World Health Organization, as well as just physicians watching from the outside. A big point of contention has been exactly how China has counted these debts and illnesses, for example, at one point in China for a death to be considered COVID cause, someone had to test positive for COVID. And then they had to die in a hospital. So it was a very narrow definition. And that's why there is a lot of skepticism about this declared victory, if you will. It's also important to point out this victory. This declaration of victory is having been is taking place at a time when we have been seeing a lot of protests in China over economic conditions. It was just last night, Max, that we were talking about protests over potential cuts to State Health Insurance Programs. Local governments have been strained because of the zero COVID policy in China. Governments had to spend money on testing they had to spend money on quarantine that caused a tremendous economic strain. So now from the Central Government in Beijing, we are seeing what appears to be a much more positive narrative, Max.",

Search operations and intense investigation are still ongoing.And on Wednesday, they said they believe Nicola is at high risk. And here's the statement that proved so controversial. They said \"Sadly, it is clear from speaking to Paul and the family that Nicola had in the past suffered with some significant issues with alcohol which are brought on by her ongoing struggles with the menopause and that the struggles that resurfaced over recent months\". Now British media are reporting that the U.K. Home Secretary Suella Braverman has demanded an explanation from the Police citing serious concerns over the disclosure of those health details.

Now, what we can understand from the statement that's been released by the family is that part of the reasoning for the release of these details may have been the fact. That they said people were getting distracted trying to investigate Nicola and her partner's personal life. And the family also said that they wanted to put a stop to appalling people who might be trying to trade in and sell stories about her.

And that was even more confusing, perhaps without the revelations of these personal details. And they also said that Nicola was treated as a high risk person immediately because she had these specific vulnerabilities referring to these struggles that she was having personally.
