The Israel Defense Forces reports that most of Iran's missiles were intercepted by Israel's air defenses. But the IDF also says a few did make impact in central and southern Israel. They are assessing the situation. We will let you know if they hit any thing or any one of note. Iran's attack one day before the Jewish holiday of Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, follows Israel's launch of a ground operation in southern Lebanon, targeting Iran-backed Hezbollah. That's a group that the U.S. considers to be a terrorist group and a strike Friday, of course, which killed Hezbollah's longtime leader, Hassan Nasrallah. This intense escalation raises the stakes perhaps for tonight's vice presidential debate here in New York. The showdown between Democratic Governor Tim Walz and Republican Senator J.D. Vance was already arguably more critical than your average VP showdown, given that this presidential race is a nail-biter, or perhaps the closest in modern history. Any slam dunk, any slip-up tonight could have implications for Election Day. We're going to have much more on what we expect in that debate just ahead, but we're going to start in the Middle East with CNN's Jim Sciutto live in Tel Aviv. And, Jim, you obviously were on that balcony in Tel Aviv when the attack started. You have reported for many conflict zones throughout your reporting life. How does today's attack compare?",

And in fact, that did happen. There were multiple impacts in and around Tel Aviv. We saw some of them just to the north and south of the hotel where we are and at the peak of it as the interceptors and the missiles were meeting over the center of the city. Several of them were over our heads and of course, the concern is that one of them is going falls down.Thankfully, the Israeli military has said no deaths reported inside Israel. We did hear from Jake Sullivan, the U.S. national security advisor, that there is a report of a death of a Palestinian in the West Bank. But some combination of the missile defenses, folks obeying orders to go into shelters and perhaps good fortune there were not more casualties. They're still assessing damage and I can tell just by seeing some of the explosions that we witnessed on some of those impacts, one in particular, just to the north of us, which seemed quite large. I'd be surprised if there wasn't at least some noticeable damage given the size of those blasts. Listen, a significant attack. We now know 180 missiles. We also now know that the U.S. in addition to Israel took actions to shoot down some of those missiles two U.S. destroyers in particular firing interceptors, we're told. A major escalation, the damage, the casualties certainly could have been far worse.",

You remember in April following Iran's previous missile, in that case, it was also a drone attack. Israel did respond, though with only one missile strike on one installation near Isfahan, which is the site of one of the nuclear facilities, but on a missile defense battery there. This response, given the size of this attack, is likely to be larger. The question really is, where, how extensively and the biggest burning question I would say, Jake, would be, do Israel's targets include Iran's nuclear facilities, because that would be quite an escalation ad one that you, well, listen, in the cycle that we've been locked in for some time, one that you would expect Iran to then retaliate in kind.",

The U.S. footing has been, defend Israel, certainly in missile attacks, back in most circumstances, Israel's right certainly to defend itself and all circumstances. But -- but back Israel's ability to strike back with some caveats and some encouragement not to escalate. But I think a U.S. participation in an Israeli strike on Iran in particular is highly unlikely because the U.S. goal, throughout the last almost 12 months now since October 7th has been to try to keep this war from expanding and cajoling all the sides and not just Israel, cajoling Iran, sometimes via intermediaries, to prevent a further escalation. So, you know, is it further sanctions? Possible. A military strike onIran seems farfetched.",

NADAV SHOSHANI, IDF INTERNATIONAL SPOKESMAN:  Well, Jake, thanks for having me.

And I can tell you, our aerial defense system alongside with our partners, the U.S. and other allies were able to thwart most of those missiles, but not all of them. There have been some hits in central Israel and some hits in southern Israel.

And you do not do an attack that is not an escalatory move with 180 ballistic missiles, I'll tell you this.

MIKE WALTZ (R-FL):  Yeah, Jake, this is spinning completely out of control and I think it stems from a failed Middle East policy from this administration. At some point, they've got to look at the mirror and say that they're de-escalation approach, that their focus on Gaza and a ceasefire and pressuring Israel hasn't worked and is not going to work. And what does work is maximum pressure on Iran and just a few years ago, their currency was tanking, their foreign reserves were tanking, they were exporting almost zero oil and most importantly, Jake, this was a metric it paid attention to, Hezbollah and Hamas and their proxies were all complaining that they were out of cash. This was in 2019. They were literally out of funds to continue their attacks. So until the administration pivots on Iran and we saw Jake Sullivan get -- just get asked what consequences has Iran suffered from the last attack and he couldn't answer the question and I found it just amazing, inexplicable that the Pentagon spokesman wouldn't at least say all options are on the table in terms of a U.S. response and that we are prepared to assist Israel and their response. At least put the threat on the table in hopes of deterring Iran from future attacks. [16:25:05] But this administration is unwilling to pivot.

You can watch the entire debate, however, and our full special coverage right here on CNN. No need to change the channel. Let's bring in Democratic congressman from Florida, Jared Moskowitz. Congressman, it's highly likely that some of the shall we call them embellishments, Governor Walz has -- has made will come up tonight. His claim that he handled assault weapons, quote, in war even though he's never actually been in war, even though he did serve honorably in the National Guard for 24, 25 years. He said that he and his wife used IVF for fertility treatment. They didn't actually use IVF. They used a different treatment. He's exaggerated his trips to China, made false accounts that the time about a -- when what he's running for Congress about 1995 DUI arrest, et cetera, et cetera. I don't know if the moderators are going to bring it up, but, I'm guessing Senator Vance will. How should Governor Walz respond when called out on some of the embellishments, mistruths, lies, whatever you want to call them in front of millions of people watching tonight? REP. JARED MOSKOWITZ (D-FL):  Thanks, Jake. I mean, look, some of those distinction without a difference. J.D. Vance is a good debater. Governor Walz is a good communicator. I think Governor Walz will explain those and then pivot to the lies that Donald Trump has been telling the American people, and the lies that J.D.

That's a non-profit that's helped more than 59 million people find the freedom that comes with having a home. Carter himself kept physically constructing, working on houses, well into his 90s. He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 for his work protecting democracy and combating diseases. Nine years ago, Carter announced that he had brain cancer.
