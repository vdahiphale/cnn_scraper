      "sentences": "So, the way the Trump team has framed this, they are asking the Supreme Court to return to voters the ability to choose the candidate they want. They argue that the Colorado Supreme Court's decision to remove Trump from the ballot was the first time in this country's history that the judiciary has prevented voters from selecting a party's primary candidate.Now, then they go on to advocate for their interpretation of the Constitution, specifically Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. That is the part that has been litigated now across multiple states, and it says that if you engage in an insurrection, you cannot hold a future office. They insist that it doesn't apply to presidents because it doesn't explicitly say that it does. They argue to the high court that if you believe that this applies to presidents, you have to believe that the drafters decided to bury the most visible and prominent national office in a catch-all term. They insist that this reading defies common sense and is not correct. This question, this divided the courts, even within the state of Colorado. So that's a question that is ripe for the Supreme Court. They also argue that the mechanism for determining eligibility, that it is Congress, not the states, and attack the Secretary of State of Colorado's power to assess the eligibility based on her assessment of a candidate's qualifications. So now, all eyes are on the Supreme Court. Today's appeal increasing the pressure already on the high court. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

However, read the language of the Constitution and it is quite clear that they say, frankly, there's another provision in the Constitution that says the president, comma, vice president, comma, and officers of the United States, suggesting that the term officer of the United States does not intend to apply to the president.Again, it's one of these many areas in the law in which our understanding of what terms mean and what the framers put on paper are completely different. Now, this is why we have a Supreme Court. It exists for the purpose of sorting out these complicated legal questions, frankly, precipitated by the mess that the framers left us. In their wisdom, there are ambiguities in the Constitution and they have to be sorted out and this is precisely one of them. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "The documents released by the court stem from a lawsuit that was brought back in 2015 against Ghislaine Maxwell, who was the former girlfriend of Jeffrey Epstein. It was a civil lawsuit for defamation. Eventually, they settled the case, but finally, after years, the documents have been released and some specific and pretty important information coming from depositions that were taken by the lawyers from an associate of Jeffrey Epstein, a woman who used to work for him, where she says that Jeffrey Epstein told her that former President Bill Clinton liked them young, referring to girls, she says, and she said they had a conversation about the former president.Now, the former president has denied any wrongdoing and there are no accusations in the court filings of any kind of wrongdoing or any kind of criminal activity on the part of the former president. A spokesperson for the former president said that as long as he did in 2019, he denies doing anything wrong. He does admit to being on Jeffrey Epstein's plane, but he says that it's been nearly 20 years since the former president had any contact with Epstein and, of course, that Clinton has not been accused of any crimes or wrongdoing related to Epstein. And also, in that same deposition from the former employee, we learned that, she says, according to her deposition, that Jeffrey Epstein, they were on a plane together, on one of Epstein's planes heading to New York City, and they couldn't land in New York, and so they had to go to Atlantic City. And she says while on that plane, Jeffrey Epstein told her that we'll call Trump and we'll go to Atlantic City, and she says they wound up going to a casino. She doesn't remember what that casino was. And again, the significance of this is that we're seeing, you know, two former presidents' names here being mentioned. These names being mentioned are not necessarily new. It's certainly something that we expected. And then now, you know, in the coming days, we do expect to see more documents as the court and the attorneys work through some more of those filings and plan to release more information in the coming days.

So, there's nothing really new about Clinton other than his comment from someone in the deposition about he likes young, he likes them young, or something to that effect. And it, too, could be a very troubling statement if he's making reference to young girls.Obviously, that statement, if he's referencing underage girls, that would be incredibly troubling. But I think it's important to note that Donald Trump is also mentioned in these documents. And unlike Bill Clinton, Donald Trump is running for president. Yes, it's very clear that he had a relationship with Epstein. There's also something in the documents that said that one of the victims was going to stop with Epstein at one of Trump's casinos in Atlantic City. So there are mentions of two former presidents, it's important to note, in these documents. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "So, Bianca, I think first and foremost, it's important to understand that these are two of the most extremist ministers in the current government, and they don't make government policy. Even before Israel disengaged from the Gaza Strip, removed its settlements, moved all of its security personnel out of the Gaza Strip, so with no presence on the ground, they were against that disengagement from the Gaza Strip. And even before October the 7th and those Hamas terrorist attacks, they have been advocating for Israel to resettle the Gaza Strip.So, against that backdrop, their comments are nothing new. I think it's also important to note that they are advocating for voluntary immigration rather than forced immigration. And I think finally, the most important point is that they don't make government policy. This isn't Israeli government policy. And even if it were Israeli government policy, all opinion polls suggest that were elections held tomorrow, this government would be out on its ear. That said, as you say, there has been condemnation from Saudi Arabia, from the European Union, from the United States as well. And while there are people, and you hear this from people in, whether it's Tel Aviv or outside of Tel Aviv, inside of Israel, remarking, as one of the freed hostages did, that there are no good Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. And there are certainly concerns as to what happens the day after this war ends. I don't think there is widespread support for, you know, forcing -- certainly not for forcing, Palestinians to leave the Gaza Strip and an understanding that something needs to happen after this war to ensure that Hamas cannot again repeat those attacks of October the 7th as it has vowed to do. And to ensure that Israelis living around the Gaza Strip and beyond can live in security. There isn't really anything on the table right now that would square those two seemingly opposing objectives. But I think, as I say, important to bear in mind that as those comments by those two ministers are not government policy. And indeed, the U.S. State Department spokesman has said that he's been repeatedly assured by the Israeli government that this isn't government policy -- Bianca.",
