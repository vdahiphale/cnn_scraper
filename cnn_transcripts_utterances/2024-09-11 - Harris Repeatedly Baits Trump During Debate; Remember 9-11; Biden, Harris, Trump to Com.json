It's not code. It's not a trick.And what we've been seeing here is the re-emergence of ISIS, extolling people to attack the United States' lone wolves.

Or even Iran, where ISIS attacked a funeral of Qasem Soleimani, arguably another terrorist leader.

But I'll reiterate, they are coming down, and this is good news for borrowers out there because it confirms once again rates are coming down. You can see the trend. I mentioned it. These are the big drivers of the ongoing price increases that we saw, half a percent on shelter, 3.9 percent on airfare, some late summer travel despite five months of declines. Guilty, your honor. That may have been me contributing to that. Something that everybody keeps talking to me about, the sheer cost of car insurance rising again, despite the drop in used cars and trucks that we've seen. What's helping us to the downside, it's all about gasoline and energy prices and the big drops that we've seen in that down, what, six- tenths of 1 percent in the month this year.
