And frankly, the campaign and the candidate would not like to be talking about this specific issue with just six days to go until election day.Nevertheless, we heard from Vice President Harris a little bit earlier as you referred to. She is already distancing herself from those comments, saying that she strongly disagrees with criticizing people based on who they're voting for. Meanwhile, Jake, we're also getting a little bit of insight inside of the campaign from reporting from CNN's MJ Lee. She said on the one hand, one adviser told her that we won't lose a single voter over this. But on the other hand, a former Biden administration officials said that he was fury because nobody wants him out there after this particular gap. So we'll see whether President Biden spends more time on the campaign trail in the final days of this election. Meanwhile, on the trail, Vice President Harris continues to emphasize the message that she and her campaign want to get out there that hurt ticket is the one of unity over party that her ticket, his be bipartisan ticket. Just earlier today in Raleigh, in fact, she said that we have so much more in common than what separates us, which is part of a normal stump speech, but, of course, says, who knew waits after these comments from President Biden last night. Then she also added contrast as she has before saying that while President Trump has his enemies list, she has her to do list for once she gets so the White House, if she gets to the White House, and the vice president has arrived in Harrisburg, Jake, we expected to be on stage behind us in just a matter of minutes.

But if you were improperly removed from the voter rolls because you did check a box, didn't check a box, one of the clerical error is, in Virginia, they do have same-day registration.

She had to be removed. In Bucks County, the issue was there were extremely long lines yesterday, which was supposed to be the last day where you could show up, register, vote by mail in person, and the Republicans said that there were officials who turned people away, even though they were in line when the polls are closed. You know, they weren't supposed to do that. And they actually got a victory here. They went to court and the court said, okay, we are going to extend this in-person voting in Pennsylvania, or at least in Bucks County until Friday that right now, the Democrats are trying to get a little bit more clarity and county officials trying to get a little bit more clarity on what exactly the court meant.
