Ten killed, dozens injured after a vehicle plowed into a crowd in New Orleans in the French Quarter.You're looking at live pictures right now -- this is from EarthCam -- of just the scene. Normally you would expect to see a bustling, busy French Quarter in the heart of New Orleans but now you see no one. You see strewn -- it looks like confetti along the ground, and you see police officers and law enforcement officers right there -- again, as this news unfolds. We want to go now to the scene in New Orleans. CNN affiliate WDSU's Cassie gives us a look at what's going on, on the ground. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

And that's why the FBI has now taken over the scene as well as homicide units here for NOPD.So we are expecting it to be locked down for quite some time because there is a lot of areas that this hit as more than 27 people impacted. I heard from Aubrey 30 people transported. We are hearing that number is still 12. Two officers possibly hit as well by bullets. This is a very developing scene. And I can show you right now the scene behind me. More and more officers keep coming to the scene. We did see the bomb squad as they were in that area as well -- what Fletcher was talking about earlier. One of my sources is telling me that they believe that there was a package that may have been even connected to that car that drove in. They are just taking every precautionary measure they can because in some cases like this you never know if there is a second attack that could possibly happen. So that's why they have removed so many people from this area. I will tell you they are being very strict but very, very polite in trying to make sure that people are just keeping safe because guys, this is a very tense situation. You can see all those officers in the middle there. We have obviously those who are on the mounted patrol right in front of us here. They've been blocking the area. We can't even really look down Bourbon Street anymore because of how many officers are here. We have state police over there in the middle talking with NOPD as we speak. We also have EMS, and fire is here as well. They are a little bit further down. But walking all the way down the street here on Canal you cannot move. You cannot get any further. And I'll tell you right now I'm seeing people as we speak right now walking down the sidewalk here in sequins and sparkles. I mean, people have been out and about enjoying the New Year's celebration. I mean, just last night we had thousands down in Jackson Square who were just here to celebrate and see the (audio gap) those fireworks. And so we had a lot of people out and about and especially around 3:00 a.m. Usually that's when the crowds start to at least get a little bit quieter when it comes -- (END VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "All right. So what you just heard right there was an update from local officials in New Orleans. The mayor there speaking and the police chief speaking as well. And then also the FBI speaking as well because they announced that they will be taking over this investigation.We learned a tremendous amount of information from that press briefing. First off, that this incident started around 3:15 in the morning in New Orleans in the French Quarter. That there was a man driving a pickup truck and that this was very intentional behavior. The police chief there saying that this was not a DUI situation; that this person was trying to run people over, and also saying that he was \"hellbent on creating carnage.\" Another thing that we learned from that press briefing is that the man who was in this pickup truck who allegedly -- or according to police drove down Bourbon Street trying to hit people also fired on New Orleans police officers after -- I guess it seems he crashed his car and that two officers were shot by this suspect. One of the other things that came up in this press briefing was that it sounded like the FBI said there -- the assistant special agent in charge -- that there was an improvised explosive device found and they're checking on that. But again, as you heard at the end of that press conference they didn't take any questions, so there was not an opportunity to clarify more about that. Let's go to our reporters and analysts who we have with us. I believe we still have Andrew McCabe and Jean Casarez. Andrew, we were talking about what this may or may not have been earlier in the morning. The local officials there clearly saying that this was an intentional act.",

      "speaker": "ANDREW MCCABE, CNN SENIOR LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST, FORMER DEPUTY DIRECTOR, FBI",
      "sentences": "Yeah, Danny, that's right. I was -- it was I thought a bit surprising to see the police chief come out that strongly.[07:45:00] She was unequivocal that this was an intentional act. She mentioned that the perpetrator drove around their barricades in order to get to the crowd that he was apparently seeking -- you know, trying to run over. So it's interesting. And then you had the representative from the FBI -- the assistant special agent in charge -- say that they did not believe it was a terrorist attack or maybe they weren't ready to conclude that at this point. And it's -- I think it's important to note that there are distinctions there. You could have an intentional act that is criminal in nature by someone who is trying to hurt someone else or a group of other people that is not connected to some sort of a terrorist organization or motivated by terrorism. So there's all sorts of kind of a gray area right now despite the amount of information we got out of that very brief press conference. There's still a lot of questions to be answered. And the biggest for me right now, Danny, is do they have this individual in custody because if I'm correct neither the police chief nor the FBI representative was clear about that. If he crashed the vehicle and then fired shots at police officers, you would think that he's in custody. But, of course, we don't know that yet. We certainly can't confirm that. But no question there. They're taking -- they're handling this with everything they've got, and I think putting the FBI in the lead investigative lead is probably the right call there. They certainly have the assets and the resources necessary to sort through a massive crime scene like this.",

I did not hear from any of the officials there what the status is of the suspect here.Jean, one of the other fascinating things that the police chief said is that they had, as we reported, more than 300 officers in that area around the French Quarter on New Year's Eve.

I guess we can -- we do know now that it was an intentional scene, so this is a massive crime scene that they are processing right now as we speak.Twenty-six were injured is what we heard through that press conference. But what I can see is that talking about this being a working crime scene when they mentioned the improvised explosive devices there appeared to be a question. They were not sure if, in fact, that's what they had that they would be looking at now, but they wanted everyone and anyone to stay away from the Bourbon Street area. So it appears as though that's their next order of business right here to see exactly what is going on with the possibility of those devices.",
