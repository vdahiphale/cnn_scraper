And a flyover of jets carrying colors of Russia's flag, president Vladimir Putin arrived here in the UAE for a rare trip abroad.

Israel usingground forces and airpower to advance positions in the south of the Gaza Strip, now encircling the second largest city of Khan Yunis. These pictures show the destruction there and there are similar scenes across northern and central areas. This is video of the aftermath of a strike in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza. The Palestinian health ministry in Ramallah says that the death toll in Gaza now tops 16,000, with most of those killed women and children. The United Nations is describing as tasteless earlier comments from an Israeli military spokesperson, who said a ratio of two civilians killed for every Hamas militant was, quote, \"tremendously positive.\" A spokesperson later walked back those comments, saying Israel is trying to limit civilian deaths to as few as possible. Ben Wedeman here is back with us this hour from Jerusalem. And Ben, you have filed a report just outlining, describing, underscoring the impact that this intense military action is having on civilians in Gaza. Explain. BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Becky, 85 percent of the population of Gaza has been displaced. And when we say displaced, we're not talking necessarily about once. In many instances, with people that we've spoken to, several times. Now what they're looking for is a safe place, somewhere that they have shelter, food, water, access to sanitation. But in most cases, they cannot find it. And one thing they can't find anywhere in Gaza is safety. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

And the needs in Gaza have increased dramatically because so many people have lost everything. We hearing from people who haven't been able to change their clothing in two weeks, who are looking desperately for a bag of flour here, for a blanket there. And as the temperatures drop, it is quite cold this evening here in Jerusalem and it's been rainy over the last two days. The situation is only going to get worse -- Becky.",

The IDF says it is moving into civilian areas that Hamas is using to hide militants and weapons, it says.

Meantime, leaked audio recordings between freed Israeli hostages and the Israeli prime minister reveal considerable anger directed at Benjamin Netanyahu. Relatives of some hostages still being held in Gaza were also at a meeting of what was Israel's war cabinet. Have a listen to this short snippet. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator):  You will return them all, they will not wait 50 days. They will not wait another year, because you claim that they are strong enough.

And also this anger that is being directed at the Netanyahu government for not doing enough to get them out. And so Ynet, which is a local news outlet here, has obtained this remarkable audio of conversations between the prime minister and hostages themselves who have been released and the families of hostages who've been released. Anger being directed at the prime minister for the lack of intelligence that Israel had about the location of the hostages, the lack of action that these families feel the Israeli government took to get them released. At one point, the prime minister, according to this report and according to this recording, which we've heard, heckled him, some people saying shame to the prime minister. There was one woman, a hostage who was freed with her children but whose husband is still being held, who told the prime minister that the feelings she had was that no one was doing anything for them. They were taken from a hiding place that had been shelled. They fled from that hiding place and they were smuggled out and were wounded in the process. And so there is a lot of anger being directed at Netanyahu. And it really raises this question about the argument that Netanyahu has made, that more military pressure is effective in terms of getting the hostages out while you have these testimonies from families saying, well, they are the ones who are actually being hurt in the process as Israel targets Hamas in the Gaza Strip -- Becky.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) (MUSIC PLAYING) NAHLA KNOTT, FOUNDER, TUCKSHOP (voice-over):  My name is Nahla. I'm the owner of Tuckshop cafe, community centered business, that is looking at ways to promote the talent that we have here in the UAE and Abu Dhabi. It is a community that has an environmental focus, to bring awareness and also to always bring a bit of fun. And it was an interesting focus once I opened Tuckshop that is very hard for food and beverage outlets to be sustainable, even within your home. Sometimes when you are trying to select the environmental option, sometimes that is a cost to you. You have to make kind of the conscious decision to be -- have that mindset. My advice to anyone wanting to start a new business is to look at your surroundings, see what businesses are out there. We tend to overconsume and overproduce these days. So it is important that also that we look at ways that we can support other small businesses. That will help in the overconsumption. At the end of the day, the population can only sustain so much. And so the idea, to be able to support other initiatives and not always reinvent the wheel, to actually use your business as a platform for other people, that will only encourage growth in a sustainable way.
