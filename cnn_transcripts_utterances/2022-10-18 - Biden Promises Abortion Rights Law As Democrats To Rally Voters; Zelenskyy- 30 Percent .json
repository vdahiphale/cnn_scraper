How are people coping not only of course, with these attacks, but with this added loss of power?",

We didn't hear it where we are here but it took us off air because there was a big ripple effect as the power was hit across the whole city. Now, there are still parts of Kyiv here that the electricity is out, people -- some people don't have water, some people have low-pressure water.The mayor of the city is asking people, turn off your lights, when you look around here, a lot of lights in this neighborhood are turned off in some of these office buildings, to telling people that they need to save electricity when they can because that will prevent the country sort of using rolling blackouts. But, to Zhytomyr to the west of here, Dnipro to the south and east, also power generating stations in there, those cities as well having blackouts in some areas, losses of -- losses of water in those areas. What we're hearing from the power generating companies here and officials, they're saying, look, when it's power lines and small transformers that get hit, we can repair that fairly quickly, 48 hours. But the problem is the power stations in Ukraine were built at the same time by -- during the Soviet Union, as those built in Russia. The Russians know just where to hit the power stations to get to the critical infrastructure. And what the officials here are saying is when that -- when those big critical bits of infrastructure that generators are hit, that's going to take much longer to repair. So the picture that's emerging is Russia into a war of attrition to try and just take down the electricity supplies in the country, turn the winter dark o-- turn the country dark as it -- as it goes into a cold winter.",
