Here's what we saw. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WALSH (voice-over):  It is usually only the dead lying here in the craters of Ukraine's southern front. But sometimes a glint of life shines. This drone spotting a Ukrainian soldier, Sergei (ph), separated from his unit, wounded in the chest and leg by shelling. He filmed this as he lay alone bleeding. He feared whatever fight to live he put up would not be enough, he later told CNN, from his hospital bed. SERGEI (PH), UKRAINIAN SOLDIER (through translator):  I was ready to fight for my, life and I did, even lying there, under the blazing sun. I realized I was too close to the, Russians and you even start to look at your gun in a different way. WALSH (voice-over):  But the drone operators had other plans. They attached water, medicine and a note to the drone and sent it back. It found him again and dropped the package. But he didn't know if it was friendly or a Russian bomb. SERGEI (PH) (through translator):  All the time I was crawling, a drone was always hovering above. We didn't realize if it was friend or foe. It was a lottery. WALSH (voice-over):  This is the moment he realizes the drone may save him. The water and medicine kept coming, easing the pain that was visible even from up high. And then he crawled back to safety. SERGEI (PH) (through translator):  The combat medics who gave me first aid when they found me were very surprised I survived for two days with a pierced lung. WALSH (voice-over):  Sergei (ph) is recovering and talks now of a new life, with greater value and purpose. \"They don't want to leave anyone behind,\" said the drone operator. \"Every life is important to us. I could not live with myself if we just left someone behind in the field.\" Probably only several miles, away salvation was uglier. Here is a Ukrainian assault by the 15th National Guard on a Russian position.",

Artillery had injured the Russian commander badly and the Russians left him behind, presuming he was dead. But this video supplied by Ukrainian forces shows they found him alive. He received medical treatment. We're not naming him for his safety but he was later awarded a posthumous medal according to Russian media reports. Left behind and declared dead by his comrades, the Ukrainians who found him say he may have wished he didn't survive. \"We said, don't try anything or you'll die,\" he says. \"And he asked us to shoot him. We offered him a chance to do it himself. But he said he could not do that. He is an enemy and I had no real desire to save him. But orders are orders and they have our guys and we can swap prisoners.\" \"As a human,\" another says, \"I was shocked that they had left him behind. As a soldier, I know my enemy and I know it's not an uncommon practice for them.\" The opposite fates on different sides in these wide, ugly expanses of violence. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And I think a feeling amongst Ukrainian forces that we saw, that slowly theprogress they're making may begin to grow in the months or weeks ahead. But generally, it's important to point out that this southern counteroffensive happening now will likely decide the fate of this conflict. In the winter we will see probably a bid for more peace talks, possibly concretizing the current front lines as we see them. And so, so much importance for increased Ukrainian progress, particularly in the Zaporizhzhya area, right now.",

The storm has dealt the heaviest rainfall over the capital, ever recorded in 140 years. Heavy rains began pummeling Beijing and surrounding areas last Saturday with the average rainfall for the month of July falling on the capital in just 40 hours. Severe flooding washing away cars, damaged buildings and roads. Many residents needed to be evacuated. In neighboring Hubei province, over 800,000 people were evacuated. Authorities say nine people were killed, six still missing. Chinese leader Xi Jinping called for every effort to rescue those, lost or trapped by the rain. State media reports maximum rainfall was recorded in 10 weather stations in Hubei province, also breaking historical records. The local meteorological service says rainfall in Beijing and Hubei is expected to ease today as the storm moves toward northeastern China. As we, know China has been experiencing extreme weather and posting record temperatures this summer. Scientists believe it has been exacerbated by climate change. Another typhoon is now heading toward China, Typhoon Khanun, the sixth storm this year, is powerful and slow moving. Currently, it's lashing at Japan although authorities say it's weakened slightly. It's reached winds of 185 kilometers an, hour -- that's 115 miles per hour, the equivalent of a category 3 Atlantic hurricane. So far one person has died. Khanun has knocked out power to one-third of homes in Okinawa. Phone and internet connections have been disrupted, the airport in the capital has been closed for a second day. Okinawa is home to the bulk of U.S. forces based in Japan. This typhoon is expected to move toward China and Taiwan later this week -- Anna, Coren, CNN, Hong Kong. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

A pleading we expect him to stick, with because it is very likely Donald Trump is going to contest these charges the whole way to trial, to take this case to trial. But right now, there is a sizeable case against him and him alone as a defendant, U.S. v. Trump is this case. There are conspirators that are outlined in this indictment, that the Justice Department released yesterday and had approved by the federal grand jury here in Washington. But those conspirators are not charged at this time. They are, however, people who were lawyers, working with Donald Trump and a political consultant, after the election to essentially spread disinformation and put pressure on different aspects of the political system, aspects like the state legislators in battleground states. Using fake electors to submit false certifications to the Electoral College, using the Justice Department, trying to pressure Mike, Pence the vice president, to block the election and then to harness the ability of, rioters and a rally, a group of ralliers, Trump supporters on January 6th, to help further this mission of blocking the transfer of power. That is the overview of this case. Ultimately though, this case is one built around deceit. It is one built where the Justice Department believes the fraud that Donald Trump was perpetrating, where he was saying the election was rigged and it could be overturned, in his favor as the results were coming, out showing Joe Biden winning multiple states. That was intentional deceit and fraud, that that was disinformation that was coming together, as a conspiracy, not just to defraud the United States government but to also disenfranchise voters themselves from being able to have confidence that their votes would result in the next president. So here is what Merrick Garland, the attorney general of the United States, said yesterday, after these charges were released. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MERRICK GARLAND, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL:  Jack Smith, the special counsel, to take on the ongoing investigation in order to underline the department's commitment to accountability and independence. Mr. Smith and his team of experienced, principled career agents and prosecutors have followed the facts and the law wherever they lead. Any questions about this matter will have to be answered by the filings made in the courtroom. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now there are issues that could come up in the case. There could be attempts by Donald Trump to derail it. The Justice Department wants this to happen fairly quickly. They want it to get on the fast track rather than be one that's bogged down, in discussions over where the law should be on this, what the facts of the case and the parameters of the trial should be. But there is a lot of questions on how it will be handled. And so much will be ultimately up to that district judge, Judge Tanya Chutkan. She is a Biden appointee and she is a judge, from my experience, who moves really fast and also has viewed the actions of 2020 quite firmly, quite harshly since its many rioters from January 6 before her.",

He had a phone call with the secretary of state and other regional leaders. ECOWAS, the regional group, bloc of countries, is trying very hard to defuse the situation and in their minds get Bazoum back into power because should this coup be successful in the long run, it really creates a cascade of the security situation, in that zone. The ability for the U.S. government, the French government and others to partner with Niger, to combat extremists in that zone. And Niger itself faces a threat from the Western side, with Al Qaeda linked groups and ISIS led groups. And on the eastern, side with Boko Haram. Now the reason the State Department isn't explicitly calling this a coup, is because, if they do officially designate this hostile takeover of the government, then there is a legal act they have to follow, Becky, which means withdrawing much of the assistance that they are giving to the country, which includes more than $100 million drone base, in the desert area of Agadez. That is a critical intelligence gathering and operations launchpad for the Sahel region as well as the troops in and around the capital. If you look at the toll of extremist violence, in the Sahel region, the Sahel is this, on this, graph, this very steep curve. It's the most deadly zone, for civilians when it comes to this kind of, violence on Earth. And of course, while graphics cannot begin to explain the suffering of civilians there, it does show how bad the situation has become.
