I want to make this about what the White House is saying about the president's health and whether or not they can get their story straight and why not because I think it's very hard for Americans to understand, like, what is really going on here. There's this Parkinson's doctor that's going to the White House on numerous occasions, and they can't seem to answer questions about what he's doing there, if he's treating the president or not. Now we know that he was involved in that, although they still say that he's only had these three neurological evaluations as part of his regular physicals and nothing beyond that.

We all have spouses, kids, parents who get sick, and it evolves. You think it's one thing. You go on medication for something. It turns out it's not. It turns out the medication might have made it worse. So, first you try and figure out ground truth. And, look, I don't know Karine, but I give her the benefit of the doubt, because I think I know a lot of people in the White House, I've worked with them for decades. Some of them are my closest friends. They don't like the situation, you know. They don't like the drip, drip, drip and they don't like being criticized for being covered up. They - it doesn't - also because it's not working. You first have to determine ground truth. And that's the human being do it. And their spouse. The president and the first lady don't go through a medical process and then come out and say, OK, everyone, gather up, we're going to talk about, you know, my vitals and I'm going to tell you what happened when they said cough and all that kind of stuff. So, there is a degree of - of it being a moving target and it being something private and the line of where something is public is hard to - now I would note, the real stupidity here is that this information was helpful to the White House. It showed that they were in close contact with a neurologist because, presumably, that based on the president's appearance, Parkinson's was one of the things on the table that they wanted to stay on top of. So, it was a prudent and responsible thing to do. And it was prior to the president's annual physical in February, which explicitly said that they were looking for Parkinson's and didn't have it. So, that's hiding in plain sight. The process on Monday was ugly. But you know who probably regrets it more than anyone is Karine -",

Yes. And so if they need to, you know, distance themselves, then that's - then that's what they need to do. Whatever I've seen so far hasn't shown me that that's going to be enough to get there.

The more he opens his mouth, the more he gets and gives those unhinged rants at his campaign rallies, the more people can start focusing on project 2025, which is frightening in this country, or should be frightening to folks.
