I'm Fredricka Whitfield.And we begin in Baltimore where moments ago, officials gave an update to that catastrophic bridge collapse. Today, Governor Wes Moore said it's too unsafe for divers because of debris, wreckage, pieces of bridge in the water. The governor underscoring mission first, people always. He said crews are working 24 hours on the water and on the vessel Dali. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. WES MOORE, (D) MARYLAND: We have a series of 24/7 operations currently underway. Unified command are conducting planning and engineering assessments 24 hours a day. We have assets on the water enforcing safety zones 24 hours a day. We have assessments on the Dali being conducted 24 hours a day. This is an around the clock operation, and we're going to ramp up our 24/7 posture in the coming days. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But the second, as you said, to reopen the waterways so that business and commerce can keep flowing through. This is one of the busiest ports in the entire country, and it plays a crucial part in the overall economy. The governor outlining a plan to clear a part of the wreckage so that ships can start traveling in and out around the area, because this entire thing is going to take a long time to be removed.It is a very complicated operation. We are talking about tons of material, concrete, metal, steel, all in the water. And on top of that boat, which we have been seeing since the collapse of the bridge, they are going layer by layer, trying to figure out exactly how to pull it all apart. We know that the biggest crane along the Eastern seaboard has arrived here in Baltimore, and that crane is going to play a critical role in helping to lift some of that metal that's rusting on top of the ship right now. That's going to be really important in order to get things moving. So all of that is happening as we speak. The governor calling this a 24/7 operation. They are working around the clock to get this done. It was also a striking to see several members of the delegation speaking to the families, speaking in Spanish, reminding everyone that they are prioritizing the recovery of those bodies. They know that that's what they are waiting for, and they are trying to do that as fast possible, reminding people that conditions for divers are extremely difficult, but that as soon as they are able to get back into the water, they will do that.",

A spokesperson for the campaign said, quote, \"That picture was on the back of a pickup truck that was traveling down the highway. Democrats and crazed lunatics have not only called for despicable violence against President Trump and his family, they are actually weaponizing the justice system against him.\"And just to describe what was actually in this video, this was captured on Thursday on Long Island. It shows two trucks traveling on the road decked out in Trump flags and decals. And on the second truck, there is a picture Joe Biden tied up, hogtied, as you said. And this is the kind of imagery that we have seen from Trump's supporters from time to time at his campaigns, certainly, online, and yes, on the back of vehicles. It is another thing entirely for the president, a former president and someone aspiring to be president once again, to amplify that kind of imagery. And that's the response that we heard from the Biden campaign. In a statement to CNN, they said, quote, \"This image from Donald Trump is the type of crap you post when you're calling for a quote, \"bloodbath,\" or when you tell the Proud Boys to stand back and stand by. Trump is regularly inciting political violence, and it's time people take him seriously. Just ask the Capitol Police officers who were attacked protecting our democracy on January 6th.\" And Fred, I should mention that, of course, this post on social media, to his Truth Social account, comes just as he is also receiving flack for these attacks that he is making on the judge and a daughter of the judge who is overseeing the allegations of the hush money payments in New York.",

We should avoid all attempts to domesticate Easter or to talk about the Easter bunny. That's fine, I suppose, for the kids. But Easter is this explosive revolutionary message that God is the conqueror of sin and death. We have to recover that still, I think, startling and still revolutionary message of the church. When the first Christian said things like \"Jesus Kyrios\", \"Jesus is Lord,\" well, that was a challenge to Caesar, because the watchword of the time was \"Kaiser Kyrios,\" \"Caesar is the Lord.\" And the first Christians were saying, no, God is more powerful than Caesar. And so there's a new lord, and we should get into his army of love and compassion and nonviolence and forgiveness. That's the still revolutionary message of Easter.",
