      "sentences": "Today on Inside Politics, there is no way to spin this. CNN reads the country's mood right now and find that America is deeply unhappy with Joe Biden. Most Democratic voters hope for change at the top of the ticket and Americans don't take the president and his word when he talks about his son Hunter.Plus, a deal he couldn't refuse. Trump employee number four flips after the government promises to shield the Mar-a-Lago IT manager from prosecution. And a road to ruin, paved by the former president. Mike Pence warns that Republicans are headed for extinction. But is anyone in what is very much still Trump's GOP listening? Chris Christie will be here to talk about that and more in moments. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. Up first, our new poll has important new takeaways about 2024. There is deep rooted dissatisfaction with the incumbent and the direction he is taking the country. There are even deeper doubts about if Mr. Biden is up to the job again. CNN's David Chalian is standing by for us at the magic wall. David, these numbers are just not good. If you are a sitting president of the United States, show us what they tell us.",

Overall, his approval rating is down now at 39 percent approved, so more than six in 10 Americans disapprove of the job he's doing. And you see he's been hovering here for a little bit, Dana, since the spring.You mentioned that Democrats would like somebody other than Biden as the nominee of their party. That is dramatically. So, two thirds of democratic and Democratic leaning voters say that they would like a different candidate to be the Democratic nominee. Only a third of Democrats and Democratic leaners say they want Joe Biden to be the nominee. And we asked this open-ended question of Democrats and Democratic leaners. What is your biggest concern about a Biden candidacy? It's not even close, Dana. 49 percent say it's his age, 7 percent mental sharpness, 7 percent health ability to do the job. This is all related to Joe Biden being the oldest president currently serving and obviously asking the country to renew his contract for four more years beyond next year.",

And you know what, it's not a contest many Americans are all that psyched about.I mean, look at their favorability numbers. They're the same, 35 percent of Americans have a favorable view of Joe Biden. 35 percent of Americans in this poll, have a favorable view of Donald Trump. And Dana, look at some of these attributes for the president. He doesn't have majority support for any of them. 45 percent of Americans says, he cares about people like you, 33 percent say they're proud to have Biden as a president.

One is the president's what he's done on the world stage, particularly with Ukraine, but as part of that, about the stamina that he had in order to get into Ukraine.Let's watch a bit of that.

Look, I talked to the Trump people, they've been putting out this post, talking about how he has a lead. We had another poll earlier this week that had him with a huge lead in the Republican primary field. They're very happy about that. I do think this is just a lot of alarm bells. And I think as it all comes down to talking about this excitement factor, I do think that the Nikki Haley thing is really interesting. It's something that Jeff and I have talked about a lot being on the trail. We know that Haley's people were really banking on that first debate. And they think that they can sell her as someone, one of the only people who can beat Biden. And so obviously, this is something they're going to leave.",

Evan, let me start with you. Because this question of this IT manager, he was -- who is the sort of Trump employee that was in the shadows. We didn't know who he was. We didn't know what was going on. And now we do. The special counsel's court filing said, immediately after receiving new counsel, Trump employee number four retracted his prior false testimony and provided information that implicated Walt Nauta, De Oliveira, and Trump in efforts to delete security camera footage as set forth in the superseding indictment.",

And we'd heard, you know, some of our reporters who had been on this story, including Kaitlan Collins and Katelyn Polantz had heard that there had been someone who had changed their story under pressure from the prosecution.And so that's what explains all of what happened. And what you see in that superseding indictment. What's also, I think, interesting is that, you know, what prosecutors keep kind of going around is the idea that there are a number of people who are represented by people who are paid lawyers, who are paid for by Trump's political committee. And they're trying their best to keep things together, to keep their story straight. And this guy Yuscil Taveras, he's only identified as employee four in the documents. He is the first one to sort of break away from that and sort of expose what has been happening. So, it's going to be interesting to see how the judge handles this. Prosecutors want a hearing to address some of these obvious conflicts. They say there are obvious conflicts. The lawyers are trying to push back on that.",

What did they have to promise to give in order to -- in order to give them immunity or a deal or whatever it is that he's likely getting in order to get his testimony?ELIE HONIG, FORMER ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NY: Yes. So, here is how the deal works. The cooperator first of all has to tell you everything he knows. He has to tell you everything about his own conduct and anything he may know about anyone else. There is no partial cooperation, you have to come clean with everything. In an instance like this, as Evan was saying, where the person lied initially by denying it, that happens. That happens all the time. The question from the prosecutor really is, is this person now at a point where he has complained. And in return what the cooperator gets, this is a transaction is a sentencing benefit. Sometimes you have to take a guilty plea, and you get hopefully a reduced sentence from the cooperators' perspective. In this instance, where the conduct is in prosecutor's view, less significant, you can get a free pass. And it looks like that's the deal that prosecutors have reached here with Mr. Taveras. You're going to testify for us. You're going to tell everything you know about Donald Trump, and Walt Nauta, and Mr. De Oliveira, and we're going to give you a free pass, very common deal crucial to prosecutors building their case.",

They say he has been going to the probation office that he has been abiding by his side of it and that the prosecutors have to live up to their side of it. The prosecution says, no, there is no deal because it was not signed by the probation office.So, what we now have is, we're surely going to see some litigation on this. Hunter Biden's lawyers are not going to just take this. But we are going to likely see an indictment by the end of the month of the sitting president's son, which is historic, obviously. And we may also soon see charges related to his taxes in Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C., all because he came within minutes of really having this deal signed off on and completed.
