Thishas been an anxiety inducing nerve-racking period of several weeks for these families who have watched the process of these hostage negotiations for weeks now, have followed mostly through public reports. They have had contacts with the Israeli government. But, most of what they have learned, these families have told me, has been through public reports. And they have watched as these talks have gotten close to the possibility of a deal before falling apart again. And this week, they watched, as just a couple of days ago, this process was delayed by nearly 24 hours. And now, finally, perhaps a point where they will get to embrace their loved ones, at least those families of the 13 hostages released today, and providing some hope for the families of those who still remain in Gaza, that a deal is possible to release them, that Hamas can indeed deliver on its side of the bargain to deliver these hostages to the Red Cross into Egypt, and eventually, hopefully soon into Israel.",

Jeremy Diamond, thank you. John, I mean, one remarkable aspect of this is we were hearing officials approach it with a lot of caution, a lot of trepidation from the U.S. to Israel to all over. This is unfolding pretty much as we had expected. Obviously, this is the lengthiest part right here, this actual transfer of the hostages.

The Prime Minister,Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the Defense Minister, they are watching as well from a military intelligence office space. That is where they're keeping a close eye to make sure what they have been facilitating and negotiating this deal with Hamas through an intermediary Qatar, making sure that it goes according to plan because they're watching just as closely as we are to see that this day, this day is a template really for further hostage releases, because these are 13 of them, we believe. There are 50 total expected. So, how does it work for the other 37 here? All of this is being carefully monitored. One big unknown is also the condition of these hostages. We have not gotten any kind of medical update. We don't know what condition they're in. That is something that they have been bracing for here in Israel, trying to prepare for really any scenario with all of this. CNN's Chief International Correspondent, Clarissa Ward, is outside of a children's hospital that could be receiving some of these hostages. We do expect there to be children among them, though we do not have any official confirmation of who exactly is in this group yet. Clarissa, has there been any new activity at the hospital? This is a lengthy process, as we're seeing these hostages make their way eventually to Israel. What are you seeing at the hospital right now?",

We've seen a number of ambulances sort of park up alongside. That helipad again, we don't know if that's where the hostages would arrive. But, the assumption is that the children who are released, and if they are with their mothers, their mothers, and they are in reasonable physical condition, that they will be brought here to the Schneider Children's Medical Center. If they are in more serious condition, if they require lengthy or extensive medical care, they will likely be taken to another hospital called Soroka. But, here at Schneider Medical Center for Children, they have gone to great pains, Kaitlan, to make sure that they have done the best job they possibly can of preparing for the arrival of these hostages. They have taken over an entire area of the hospital, and really gone to lengths to make sure that it doesn't look like a hospital. They want to create what one staff member told us was the feeling of a beautiful hotel. There is a lot of thought that's gone into having a lot of toys so that it feels warm, that it feels intimate. The hospital has gone to great pains as well, Kaitlan, to handpick the staff who will be working with the hostages, who will be arriving. Obviously, they want to ensure that they have the top psychiatrists, social workers ready to greet them, Kaitlan.",

But, certainly, these are militaryhelicopters that have landed, about two kilometers from this Kerem Shalom crossing. We have Israeli Military officials who are at this location where we are. We actually happen to be here already, because we knew it was advantage over Kerem Shalom. But, Israeli Military officials brought some photographers and Israeli journalists to this point in order to witness the possible crossing. Again, we have not fully officially confirmed that they are coming through Kerem Shalom crossing. But, obviously, this kind of activity would suggest that that is very, very possible. I think with the light now, you might be able to get a little bit of a better look at some of these helicopters, not clear if they're picking somebody up here, if they're moving on. But, again, certainly the most activity that we have seen at our location. As we know, at this moment, that convoy of hostages is in Egypt, making their way, it would appear, towards Israel. Which crossing? We don't know. This is certainly the closest one to the Rafah crossing. This would be the closest point for them to drive to. And so, I suspect that in the next half hour or so, we may get a clearer picture of exactly what is happening and whether or not they are in fact crossing here.",

It'll give people a sense of just how small these distances actually are here.This is the Kerem Shalom crossing right there that Jeremy was talking about, which is officially a crossing between southern Gaza into Israel. But, as Jeremy points out, there is also a way to get from Egypt to Israel through there also, if they handle it a certain way. We do know -- we did expect that the hostages would be moved south from inside Gaza through the Rafah crossing, which is just right here. I'm just putting little dots there because the distance is, it's really -- you're really talking like barely even a couple miles right there between the Rafah crossing and the Kerem Shalom crossing right there. So, it's possible that they moved out from Gaza into Egypt through Rafah and they will move into Israel again at the Kerem Shalom crossing right there. Another possibility, as Jeremy said, is they'd be brought back into Israel much further south at the Nitzana crossing right there. But, this process appears to be underway, including video that we saw not long ago of a convoy of Red Cross vehicles with people sitting in the back of these Red Cross vehicles. There appear to be both men and women inside them. It was hard to get a good look at their faces. Obviously, among the Israeli hostages, we'd been told that only children and women would be released today as part of the first group of Israeli hostages. We also learned today there is a group of Thai hostages, workers from Thailand who were taken by the Hamas terrorists some 48 days ago. About 12 of them being released also. So, we're trying to discern whether they were in the back of those vehicles or not. Once they will move up from here, whether they move for the Kerem Shalom crossing or down here at Nitzana, we do expect them to go to the Hatzerim Airbase right here. Again, this is a process, and Jeremy, as you are there, watching these helicopters, anymore you're able to discern from the movements that you're seeing?",

      "sentences": "Yes. It's gotten extraordinarily complicated in part, because the Kerem Shalom crossing was one of the main places where goods would crossinto Gaza. It is one of the largest areas for humanitarian aid and commercial goods to go from Israel into Gaza. But, those crossing points, all crossing points between Israel and Gaza, Kerem Shalom included, were closed after those October 7 attacks happened. And so, instead, what has happened, as aid has started to trickle into Gaza in recent weeks, is that the aid has been almost exclusively going in via the Rafah crossing. But, Israeli officials are still conducting checks on all of the goods that enter Gaza. They are the ones conducting a layer of the security checks on those trucks of humanitarian aid, more recently of fuel. And it appears that the helicopters are now taking off again. I think you can -- hopefully, you can still see our shot, John. But, it looks like these helicopters are moving. Let me just pause for a second. Yes. They seem to be just moving into a different position, but they're not all together leaving our location here. But, yes. As we were talking about, John, the situation in terms of getting things in and out of Gaza has been complicated by this war. It has been complicated by Hamas's attack on October 7. And so, now there is a whole new layer of difficulty. But, it is not altogether unusual for Egypt and Israel to coordinate over the entry and exit of people and goods into Gaza. As you know, the Gaza Strip has faced significant blockade effectively of certain goods, of a lot of activity in and out of Gaza, not just from Israel's crossings into Gaza but also from Rafah. There is a reason why journalists -- we have wanted to get into Gaza for weeks now during this war. The Israel and Gaza crossings are closed, but in Rafah, which Egypt controls, they are still not letting journalists in that route either. And I think you can see here, some officials appear to be arriving on the grounds here. I'm not sure who they are, but there are lights around them, perhaps even cameras. I'm not sure if you might have a better view on these officials than I do, John, with a bigger screen.",

We had been told by Israeli officials, who would not confirm identities for obvious reasons,that they did expect families to be included in this group of hostages, not to be separated as they were released by Hamas. I will say, John, we have just now official confirmation on the actual numbers that we've been talking about. There had been some questions about how many Thai nationals were included in this group, the Red Cross, which of course facilitated that transfer. There is that moment again there, John, with the little girl in the yellow shirt that you can see at the bottom of your screen. The Red Cross is saying that they are relieved to confirm, and I'm quoting them now, the safe release of 24 hostages. We do still believe that 13 of those are the Israeli hostages that were negotiated as part of this deal. So, that raises the question of the numbers, the rest are those Thai nationals that we had heard from the Egyptians. They say they facilitated this by transporting them from Gaza to what you're looking at right now. That is the Rafah border and the Rafah crossing that we saw them come through in that convoy that we believe was holding these hostages earlier. Obviously, John, still a lot of questions to come. And I think when you noted the number of ambulances here, it's also it was a big question mark for these officials, the condition of the -- these hostages and what they were going to be greeted with upon arrival. They didn't know. And so, I think that is one thing here. And of course, you have seen some elderly people as well in this group that we are looking at, that we are still waiting for that official list from the Israeli government.

But, again, at this point, it does appear that we've had a look at, at least two of the hostages that have been released, a young girl and an older woman. This process playing out before our eyes at the Rafah crossing. This is Egypt now. So, they are free, whatever you want to call it, they're free, no longer in the hands of Hamas terrorists, but in safety inside Egypt for the first time in 48 days. Impossible to know, Kaitlan, what's going through their minds, impossible to know how they are physically although both people we just saw there, the young woman and the older -- the young girl and the older woman were walking without aid and they were moving along right there.

There was one I believe released by Hamas, one video that we chose not to show for obvious reasons. We're watching this all play out as they have been making this trip. We saw where Jeremy was, where those two helicopters are. That's still a question of what those helicopters are intended for, who is going to be getting on them at Kerem Shalom, and then of course here at the Rafah crossing what we're seeing this line of ambulances. Clarissa Ward is at a children's hospital here in Israel that have been bracing for the potential arrival of some of these hostages as they are being released.

But, we've also been watching at the Rafah crossing as a line of ambulances, and what appear to be hostages going in, in just what is a major moment, the fact that this deal that has been brokered between Hamas and Israel is playing out as they had hoped it would. There are still a lot of hostages to go. 37 is a part of this deal. But, obviously, more than 200 still being held by Hamas and Gaza.

You can see that they know here that they have entered Egypt, and that the 13 women and children have begun their way home. In that sense, there is a bit of, I would say, a festive mood here. There is music playing behind me, as there has been since we got here about a half an hour ago. And they are joyous at this occasion that the first of the hostages have come home. This has been such a square of difficulty, of pain over the course of the last seven weeks. I don't know if you can see it behind me. There is the table set out, one seat for each of the hostages, now set out for a Sabbath dinner here on this Friday evening here. So, for the first time after the calls here, the posters, the demonstrations, the sleeping intends. They are trying to get into the defense ministry to meet with the war cabinet. When they stay here, bring them home now. At least for a small group tonight, now is actually happening. And that has given them a cause to be at least a bit of a celebration here.

We're also learning more about who they are. And I am told by an Israeli source that most of these hostages, not all of them, we don't know that exactly, but a majority of the hostages that have been released just now by Hamas from Gaza are from kibbutz Nir oz. And on October 7, that was a kibbutz that saw a lot of devastation in the October 7 attack. I believe it was estimated that a quarter of the population of the several hundred people who lived there were either murdered or kidnapped into Gaza. And they saw, I mean, it was the kibbutz where they burned basically the kindergarten to the ground. They went into homes. You heard the testaments from the people who did survive that attack, about just how devastating it was that day and how it saw some of the worst violence on October 7. John, we're now seeing, as we're hearing, that they are from kibbutz Nir Oz, the majority of these hostages. Right now, we are watching a line of people now boarding.

We do not know whether it is here as a precaution, whether it is here because it is going to be used for one of these hostages, or for some other reason. But, certainly, when you look at the amount of activity that we are seeing here and all of the indication that we have gotten about the likelihood of Kerem Shalom being the location where these hostages will cross into Israel, it is certainly increasingly looking like that may very well be the case. Again, we do not have that fully confirmed as of now, but that does appear to be the likeliest scenario at this point. As we were talking about before, John, and I think it bears repeating, we know that in the past, this Rafah crossing, this Rafah crossing has been used for these types of situations, Gilad Shalit in 2011. He was taken out via the Rafah crossing into Egypt, just like these hostages tonight, and then he was brought into Israel via this Kerem Shalom crossing. And so, that may very well be the scenario that we are beginning to watch play out.",

It could be something that could be done, I believe, if I'm recalling a conversation I had recently, in about 20, 30 minutes or so. So, it is certainly very close. Again, it depends on what speeds they're moving. We know that they -- there is -- obviously, there are ambulances involved. And so, we will see exactly how quickly all of that actually comes together.
