ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST, \"ANDERSON COOPER 360\": Tonight on 360, what opening statements and early testimony say about where things are headed in the first ever criminal trial of a former president. Also tonight, breaking news in one of his three other criminal cases, what a witness says the former president told his valet and the pardon, he says, he dangled in the classified documents case. Plus, the anti-Semitism and fear Jewish students say they're now enduring on campus after days of pro-Palestinian demonstrations at some of the country's foremost universities. Good evening. Thanks for joining us today. Twelve New York City jurors and six alternates got their first peek inside a high-stakes world far removed from the everyday white-collar charges they've been chosen to hear. A world of celebrity, tycoons, porn stars, alleged payoffs, sleazy tabloids and legal fixers. Safe to say, 34 counts of falsifying business records never looked like this before. And no president or presidential candidate has ever been where this one is or demonstrably less in control of his own faith than Donald Trump, which seemed to be written on his face as he sat through opening statements and watched his one-time tabloid publisher friend testify for the prosecution. Trump is facing possible prison time if convicted and fines for allegedly violating a gag order and trying to explain that he did not do what the prosecution alleges, namely cover up hush money, payments to a porn star to keep voters from finding out.

These are folks that are trying to get this man elected president, and that's the context by which it's happening. And if after the election he no longer thinks he has to follow through, he's still married to Melania.

He knows that he's got these people that are inconvenienced, as I just said, and their lives are disrupted by this.He's going to give everybody some time tomorrow, but he's not going to burn the day, I don't think, on sanctions. I think, in the end, he probably won't sanction the former president. I think what he'll probably do is admonish him, draw some bright lines about what he can and can't say. I think some of the stuff that the former president was doing was too cute by half. And he's going to say, look, I'm going to give you a warning, but if it continues then you can't do it. And, by the way, the statements he made outside the court today, your panelists didn't comment on that, per se, but it strikes me that what the president - former president is doing is he's testifying outside the courtroom. And as your lawyer panelists know, that's usable. If he decides to testify, he can be impeached by the statements that he's making publicly. Again, I think his attorney can't control him, but he should not be doing that. In 100 cases, in 99.9 of them, the lawyer would not allow the client to go out and talk about the merits of the case and paint himself into a corner. I found that to be very interesting.",
