I've seen relatively simple carjacking or bank robbery cases dragged through the courts for years.The idea that this immensely complex case with millions of pages of discovery and potentially hundreds of witnesses could have ever been ready for trial in just a few months from indictment to me is crazy and speaks to potential political motives on the part of the special counsel's office. They wanted to try this case at the height of election season and that really dictated all of their actions and ultimately, the trial timeline that Judge Chutkan set.",

The only Supreme Court guidance on the issue of the legality of the special counsel at issue here is actually Judge -- Justice Thomas' concurrence in our presidential immunity case where he said that Jack Smith's appointment was unconstitutional.So, I don't think Cannon is that far out there. I think that her decision, that's over 90 pages, was extremely well reasoned. And what she said was that just based on the constitution, based on the separation of powers, Jack Smith was not appropriately appointed and his office has not been appropriately funded. Those are two fatal flaws in the special counsel's prosecution and I believe that she will be upheld on appeal.",

We asked the New York D.A.'s office and Judge Merchan to delay that trial until we had finality from the Supreme Court on our presidential immunity arguments. They chose to rush ahead instead.As a result, you have a trial that I believe is irretrievably infected with immune evidence. The Supreme Court again is very, very clear in its opinion that you can't use immune evidence even in prosecutions for nonimmune conduct. So, we believe that's fatal to that New York case. We believe that warrants overturning the jury verdict in that case. If they want to go back to a grand jury and start from square one, I think that's their only path forward. But in the meantime, we're going to seek to have that jury verdict overturned and that entire case dismissed because of the impermissible use of immune evidence there.",

And, you know, from a high in 2022, the number of Americans held by terrorist groups or states wrongfully has dropped by 42 percent. That was a report we released last week.So, this doesn't come in isolation. It's been a real priority for the Biden administration. They've got, you know, 10 Americans out of Venezuela relatively recently, they got five Americans held by Iran also. And now, you have these three Americans and one green card holder. Obviously, it was a very complicated deal to negotiate. But, you know, this is -- the Biden administration has been doing this fairly successful now now for three years.",

Based on your experience, what is your reaction to how this historic swap unfolded?SEN. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN (D-MD), FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE:  Paula, it's good to be with you. Yes, it brought back memories of when I flew down to Cuba with Alan Gross' wife to get him released from a Cuban prison after five years. That was also an important agreement. It was not as large and all-encompassing as this one, but it was uncertain until the last moment. So, it was very heartwarming yesterday to see those images of the Americans getting off the airplane, greeting President Biden, Vice President Harris, and most importantly seeing their families. And as President Biden said, this is a testament to his brand of diplomacy, working closely with our allies. And that requires trust in order to make something like this happen.",

The vice president had talks with both of them as well.So, you can't just make that up at the last minute. You have to work at it.

That somebody else is not getting an unfair advantage through doping.So, we've actually worked with Katie Ledecky, who's a Marylander, and other Olympians on this legislation, bipartisan legislation with Senator Marsha Blackburn and our House colleagues. And it's very simple. It says that the United States will now -- we're giving essentially the person at the White House, the drugs are at the White House, the authority, permanent authority to withhold American contributions from an organization called the World Anti-Doping Agency until we know they're doing their job. And the reason all this is happening, Paula, is that in the previous Olympics we discovered just months ago that a number of Chinese athletes, I believe they were 12 swimmers, had tested positive for doping. But that the World Anti-Doping Agency swept this under the rug. They did not have a transparent investigation. We only learned of this recently because of a whistleblower. So, clearly, they weren't doing their job. So, we want to make sure that we use what leverage we have to ensure integrity in the Olympics. And again, that's only fair for all the athletes.",

You don't have a boxing match stop that quickly unless there's, you know, someone is knocked out. And that was not the case here.

And a story that is out there that is really not correct has now gained traction to the point where it is becoming a worldwide conversation. And the part of it that is absolutely not correct is the conversation that she -- the Algerian, is transgender, a transgender woman. She is not. She was born female and is female, and the International Olympic Committee has said now three different times that she is, in fact, female.
