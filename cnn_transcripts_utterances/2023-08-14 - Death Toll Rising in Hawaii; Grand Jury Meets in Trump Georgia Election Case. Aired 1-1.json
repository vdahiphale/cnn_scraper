So, we saw former state Democratic Senator Jen Jordan. She just departed the courthouse. We previously confirmed that she was here to testify in this Trump case. We also got a statement from former Democratic State Representative Bee Nguyen, who confirmed she too was here to testify in the Trump case. Both of these women were witnesses to these conspiracy-laden presentations that Rudy Giuliani and other members of Trump's post- election legal team gave before Georgia state lawmakers in December of 2020. And, again, we're waiting to see when these indictments could potentially come down. This could take up to two days for her to present her case.

He's trying to get ahead of this potential indictment in Georgia and frame it on his own terms. And so I think one of the most concerning things that people pointed out today about his TRUTH Social post is that he attacked directly one of the key witnesses in this Georgia case and said -- quote -- he \"shouldn't\" testify. That post reads: \"I am reading reports that failed former Lieutenant Governor of Georgia Jeff Duncan,\" noting that he spelled Geoff's name wrong there -- \"will be testifying before the Fulton County grand jury. He shouldn't. I barely know him, but he was right from the beginning of this witch-hunt a nasty disaster for those looking into the election fraud case that took place in Georgia.\" He also went on to call him a -- quote -- \"loser.\" Now, I think the key thing here, Jim, is, it's unclear how a judge, if there are charges brought in this case, would try to talk about his social media activity. We know, as you just mentioned, that, in a separate case, the federal case of Donald Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election results, she's trying to pose restrictions on his social media activity.",

It's often contrary to the facts. And, sometimes, it takes time for those facts to reach the public. What I will say regarding all of this is, from a legal perspective, some of these facts that you alluded to a moment ago, this exclusive CNN reporting about the text messages related to the breach, I mean, that would have a devastating impact in front of a jury if there was a concerted effort by Trump and his associates to try to breach a voting system. That's the sort of thing that you can't explain away. I think everyone understands that that's a crime.

He also testified before the special grand jury last year. Also key, Rudy Giuliani, remember him, former mayor of New York, also former personal attorney for Donald Trump, he oversaw Trump's post- election strategy, including pursuing many of the false claims of fraud. He led efforts to challenge vote-counting efforts in a number of states, not just Georgia, and he presented those bogus fraud claims to lawmakers, state officials, et cetera. He's very much at the center of this as well. Also involved is former Georgia GOP Chair David Shafer. He played a key role in the electors scheme. He told the House Select Committee that Trump himself directed that scheme, also testified before that grand jury now considering these charges against Trump, potential charges. Finally, those fake electors we have been talking about, these are folks, 16 GOP activists who attempted to subvert the Electoral College. In effect, the electoral votes that showed Biden's win, they were going to replace them, or at least attempted to. Many of them have actually cooperated with the DA's investigation. As I mentioned earlier, one of these alleged fake electors, Lieutenant Governor Burt Jones, he is protected from the investigation, but the several others, more than a dozen, in fact, Boris, are still involved.
