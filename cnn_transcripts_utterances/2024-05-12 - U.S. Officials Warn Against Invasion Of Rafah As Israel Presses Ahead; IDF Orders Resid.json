CNN cannot independently verify those numbers.All of this just days after President Biden warned Israel against an invasion of Rafah, threatening to withhold offensive weapons from its ally. CNN senior White House reporter Kevin Liptak is traveling with President Biden. He joins us now from Delaware. And Kevin, top White House officials are now doubling down on the president's ultimatum.

And I think this phone call is significant. It's the first time that we've seen a call like this announced between the White House and the government of Israel since President Biden delivered that ultimatum and CNN that he would not provide certain weapons systems to Israel if a ground invasion moves forward. The White House says in that call Sullivan and his counterpart discussed alternatives to a ground invasion of Rafah. And the White House says that the Israeli national security adviser did say that these concerns were being taken into account. But at the end of the day, the concerns that the White House has about an invasion of Rafah are nothing new. The president has been raising them with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu going back months, going back to February. That has not necessarily deterred Netanyahu from pressing forward. He has said that a ground invasion of Rafah is necessary to completely eliminate Hamas. When you hear from American officials today, that is completely at odds with what they are saying. We heard from the American Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who said that a ground invasion of Rafah could lead to a Hamas insurgency. Listen to more of what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

IDF fighter jets had been striking what they called military targets across Jabalya and conducting military operations in nearby neighborhoods. One father of three says Israeli forces were dropping leaflets, warning they will invade the north. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): There is no safe place.

And I think the question is whether or not the Netanyahu government is going to try to find a way without violating the president's own red line and/or whether the administration not looking for sustainable breach with Israel, they need a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. That's the only way the Biden administration is going to begin to get out of the strategic cul-de-sac that they're now in. So they can't fundamentally break with the government.

And anytime you have any kind of combat like that, it not only has to have a kinetic and state, what is going to happen, what are you trying to do in terms of your military strategy, but that has to be linked to some kind of political strategy. What does the area look like when this is all over? And that is what President Biden has been attempting to get Mr. Netanyahu to do for the last six months. Tell us how this ends. What happens when the fighting stopped? I think they've been very empathetic -- the administration has been very empathetic to the Israelis understanding that they're going after a terrorist organization that has embedded itself underground in this area of operation. But what they haven't been able to glean from the Israelis is what is this going to look like after you kill all the Hamas soldiers, and instead, over the last several months, it's taken a turn where as Mr. Blinken just said it is creating more problems than it's solving. Not only from the standpoint of what's going on in Gaza, but Israel's reputation on the world stage. And of course the U.S. reputation in terms of supplying arms to Israel that may be using them in inappropriate ways. A 2,000-pound bomb in an area that has a lot of civilians and a lot of infrastructure, going after small terrorist targets is not the way to approach a counterterrorism operation.",

Additionally, Shoigu has been the minister of defense for the last 12 years.I think the biggest -- you know, it's a normal shakeup within the ministry of Russia. And for anyone who watches Russia, they know this happens all the time. But what's going to be interesting is what generals are then going to fall that used to be Shoigu associates and I'm speaking specifically of the chief of the Russian forces and that's General Gerasimov. He's likely to be gone, too, soon. So it is certainly a shakeup. They have not been very successful in this war and it's Putin's way of saying, we have to make some changes in the running of the department and the management of the Ministry of Defense. It's also probably tied to what's going on truthfully in Georgia as well.
