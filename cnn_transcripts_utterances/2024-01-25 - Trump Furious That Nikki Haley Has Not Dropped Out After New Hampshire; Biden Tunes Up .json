President Biden already running against Trump as the Republican nominee. He's going to be in Superior, Wisconsin, to tout $5 billion in infrastructure projects, including a billion to repair a key transit bridge there. Let's bring in CNN national political reporter Daniel Strauss to talk about all of this. Daniel, good morning to you. Let's start with Nikki Haley. She has declined to drop out of this race and you saw -- I mean, the energy she's bringing is still very high. I mean, she doesn't feel onstage like a candidate who is down and out. But Trump is obviously very upset about this. I also -- we noticed Senator Fetterman was up on the Hill with some an interesting quote about what was going on on the Republican side. Take a listen to what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLP) SEN. JOHN FETTERMAN (D-PA):  She's roadkill for -- I mean, like why are we still -- where are we covering him? You know, I don't understand that. I don't understand that any of them, you know, Ramaswamy or Phillips on our side, like it's -- it's been about Biden and Trump and it always has been.

The -- Haley is susceptible to the same thing basically, every other candidate, every other major presidential candidate is susceptible to in a primary, which is that when the money starts to dry up, that's when she's going to have to seriously consider dropping out.But right now, she and her team said that they raised about 1 million in very short amount of time in the last few days. Right now, that doesn't seem like the case. But these things can change very quickly. And once that -- once her donors have decided to close their wallets, it'll be very hard to see a path at all, even in the most optimistic supporters' mind for Haley. So that's when she's going to either have to decide to stay in and make her campaign very lean or pack it up and just announced that she's suspending her campaign.",

Daniel, let me ask you about something that's going on, let's stickwith the Republicans for a second. Out in Arizona, Donald Trump was supposed to go and attend this dinner with the Republican chairman out there, but he has been forced to step down amid the release of an audio recording that has him trying to, it seems, bribe Kari Lake who is running for Senate, not to run for Senate.

And the view has been that she is as a nominee, someone who can blow a large or a welcome opening to keep a Senate or gubernatorial seat in a swing state. And I think that's what were hearing here from DeWit who seems to have real doubts about Lake's viability in a general election and wanted to push her out or keep her from running. And if this, you know -- I mean, DeWit in his announcement basically he said that he's not -- he's stepping down for fear of another tape coming out and what it might have on it. He's not sure.

You know, the -- if you look at -- if you compare what America did in Afghanistan and Iraq, certainly have more success in Iraq. And there is relative stability there compared with other areas, and ISIS have been quiet, at least certainly to a greater -- a great extent. The concern I think amongst experts would be if America did pull out -- you know, the government, there is a general theme of instability that has been for a very long time in Iraqi government. If that starts going the wrong way again, the whole situation could flare up and the U.S. wouldn't have troops there. But, you know, it's a sovereign nation. Iraq has to decide whether or not it wants U.S. troops there. And the sign of -- you know, the way these recently tax have gone down, there's clearly a surge and anti- American sentiment there.",

So, in the Red Sea, for example, Houthis being supported by Iran, that will give impetus to that the Houthis was argued that whole situation is happening in reaction to what's happened in Gaza would empower Hamas.I mean, it's so complex.
