      "sentences": "Hello. I'm Max Foster in London monitoring two breaking news stories for you this hour.The International Court of Justice expected to rule and on an interim verdict on the South African case accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza. Also, major sports news. The manager of the English premier league club Liverpool has announced that he's stepping down the end of the current season. More on that in a moment. But, let's bring in Nic Robertson. He's in Tel Aviv for us. Just try to sum up what this hearing is about and really what it can conclude.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, I think the big picture here, Max, is that a final ruling on whether or not on a South Africa's claim that Israel is perpetrating genocide in Gaza. That's going to take this court perhaps several years to decide what they -- and would involve the -- would involve the judges coming to the conclusion which would be a very, very high bar, that the Israeli government itself, and it's setting its priorities, setting its agenda, setting its policy that they were going to eradicate all or some of an ethnic group, population, religious -- religious, religious group, meaning, in this case the people in Gaza. That is a very, very high bar.So what this ruling will be now is an interim ruling, made very quickly by these 15-plus judges that would -- that would not determine that level of that high bar, but would take a view that if they considered that in the future, there is a possibility that this issue of genocide may become something for which they find evidence over time, they would take this precautionary measure. And we know that South Africa asked for a number of measures quite a long list of measures. But at the top of that measure, those measures that South Africa asked for an interim ruling was that there would be an immediate end to the hostilities. So that's sort of where we stand at the moment. Now, the judges themselves may not necessarily choose to pick any or all of those points at South Africa has asked for. We know that -- we know that, for example, there is, you know, a possibility that they might try to roll in some way that would increase or improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza. But it really isn't made at the moment, it's just guesswork until the judges actually speak. But I think, you know, the other points to take away here are that Israel has been very, very strong in its defense. It did send representatives, legal representatives to defend itself at the ICJ. We will expect the Israeli government to comment after -- after hearing this ruling. And the ruling again, I think it's important to state here, that it's not binding, but potentially depending what it is could create more international pressure on Israel and principally the country to look to there would be the United States and that's something that may, you know, begin to take effect in a matter of weeks. But again, depends on the ruling here, Max.",

We're streaming globally and other networks are presumably as well because it really does speak to a truly seismic issue, a lot of people questioning know what real impact of verdict would have.

It'd be interesting to hear it from the U.S. as a key ally for Israel, what they think of all of that, let's get the reaction now from South Africa, because South Africa brought this case. David McKenzie is there for us.I mean, there -- it's difficult to talk about whether or not they want it, but there are some interim measures here that they could look to ensuring, Israel has to ensure it doesn't commit genocide, punishing those who incite genocide, providing -- prevent destruction of evidence of genocide. There was some progress here on the genocide issue, but its not as clear cut as perhaps South Africa had hoped.",

      "sentences": "Yes, I think so, but I think you have to dial it back a little bit, Max, just the fact from the South African governments perspective that the court ruled that that has jurisdiction over this case based on the prima facie, meaning the face value submissions that were given by both South Africa and Israel, and that they couldn't dismiss it outright, even that will be seen as a legal victory by the South African government and the lawyers that submitted this case to the ICJ.So that is very important from the perspective of South Africa and others who feel the same way about what has been happening in Gaza of the last few months? Yes. As Nic mentioned, the very first line in the provisional requests by South Africa was to end the fighting. They did not get that. And that will be seen as a way the court perhaps give Israel some wriggle room in this situation. They did say though, that based on what they had seen and they cited multiple statements by both Israeli officials, as Nic mentioned, and U.N. officials on the ground about the severe humanitarian situation in Gaza, they said that there's an urgent need to have a provisional order from the court, this doesn't mean that they found in any way that Israel had committed any acts of genocide. But they say there is enough in the original submissions for them to investigate this further and in the months ahead, we might get an answer on that will be very difficult to prove, of course. But this will be seen very much. I think as a victory from the South African perspective in that court, the fact that they brought this to the court, and it will be a symbolic victory for this country and for other countries who in their view want to show that Israel needs to change this behavior in Gaza. Israel for its part, of course, has denied all of these allegations and said that it's a spurious argument for South Africa to say what's happening in the that will against Hamas is a genocide, and they say it sets a dangerous precedent -- Max.",

      "sentences": "Okay. Thank you so much.Let's speak to Ben Wedeman. He joins us from Beirut. Because, you know, Israel arguing its not genocide. So all of these provisions affected apply to what it says it's carrying out in Gaza. So, I mean, what real difference does this make to anyone in Gaza?",

      "sentences": "I mean, what actually has this case done? I understand that it's highlighted a lot of concerns about the way Israel has perpetrated this war. But, you know, whilst it may have jurisdiction, it can't enforce any of these laws, can it? And even if it could, it will be sometime down the road. Yes, and at, the end of the day, it comes down to the government of Israel to implement them. The question is, and I'm sure we'll hear in the coming hours Israel's reaction.But yes, there is no way for the court to make Israel do this. That requires sort of consensus among the international community and particularly its major supplier of arms, money, and diplomatic support, the United States. If the United States, for some surprising reason comes down on the side of the ICJ, then that certainly would change things, but I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for it to happen, Max.",
