Nick, I understand you've just heard some details from police.NICK VALENCIA, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): That's right. The Atlanta Police Department spokeswoman telling me that the mother is cooperating, as we've heard from Ryan Young's reporting. She was reported to be among the victims initially among those shot, but the Atlanta Police Department is telling me that the mother was not shot during this incident. As far as sightings of this suspect who is still on the run, they're getting multiple reports of sightings of this individual but at different locations that they haven't been able to confirm. They're saying basically anyone who's a black male on the streets right now you know with a hoodie, somebody is calling about them. So, they are trying to follow up on these credible leads. No status on those victims that were shot. And again, a hard perimeter of about a mile has been put up around this area where the incident initially happened during the lunchtime hour in Midtown. The bottom line here, guys, is that this is still very much show an active situation in a very fluid situation. No update on the conditions of those victims but the mother, as we've been reporting is cooperating with police. And this individual was there as Ryan had reported for a medical appointment for himself. Atlanta Police Department declining to get further details because of HIPAA. But they are saying that that message to the public of sheltering in place is still very much so, one that they want people to pay attention to.

So, we have an unmitigated threat right now someone with a weapon armed and dangerous, already shot and killed one person, wounded others. So, we know the severity of this situation. Now, with that being said, the advantage is with the police right now. They know who this suspect is, so they're quickly working in the background to identify you know, where this person may be going next, what type of resources they have in that immediate area known, affiliates that they can potentially rely on, they may be able to track the individual's cell phone.

You have to try to prevent the suspect from going beyond that.But think about in an urban environment, how many locations there are to hide? How many locations that individual could have ducked into any single building? They could be hiding in plain sight you know blending into you know the environment, you know walking by you know current law enforcement, they may not even realize you know, who that individual is, so it is very difficult. You take that operating environment and you combine it with you know some of the reporting we had. I know it was -- it may not be unconfirmed, but like that, this individual may have a military background. What that signals to me is that he has a proficiency with weapons. He has an understanding potentially of law enforcement tactics because they typically, you know, will mimic what military tactics are. So, there's a close, you know, synergies between the two. So, again, the profile of this individual law enforcement is trying to you know anticipate what that next move is going to be, you know, we know that this incident was you know most likely not planned so this fleeing felon was not part of you know his plan today. So, it -- again, there's some advantages for police but it's still a very tense in a high-threat situation. And what I don't want is for people to see like, yes, the posture of law enforcement officials that we're seeing on TV may seem reduced, but this is a tense situation. They need to get this shooter into custody quickly. But I think with the resources, the coordination with the suspect's family, this will -- this will resolve itself pretty quickly. Unfortunately, these things typically resolve themselves in three ways. One, the suspect will surrender when encountered by police, law enforcement may have to neutralize him as a threat or you know, he may you know, unfortunately, take his own life, right? So, those are really the three ways that this is going to end. But I think this will you know end quickly just look at the resources that are being put towards it right now.",

I mean, there's the physical cost, there's the mental health costs, not just on communities, but of course, law enforcement and others who are -- who are going through this so often. This sort of, you know, fear of what's on the other side of that phone call. And then, of course, the economic costs, which are relevant for cities to shut down like this each time.But the -- because the -- because -- the alternative, though, is unfathomable because given the nature of weapons right now, you simply -- you simply have to protect populations because law enforcement can't be everywhere. And so, the lockdown protects people who are vulnerable, who are not law enforcement, and then you're going floor by floor to make sure that he is not there. I will say there's lots of cameras, and Atlanta's a sophisticated city with lots of cameras everywhere. People have iPhones, we've already seen iPhones. So, they may -- they may not be able to put him in a particular place but they can ensure that he's not somewhere let's say he ran past a particular block. They now know that that block is cleared if they've seen him now on a video two blocks away. Urban searches are hard because they're complex.

But that also means they do not know where the shooter is, or where the suspect is at this point.So, what are the options right now? What are they doing? Tracking down leads, presumably.

And then if a suspect isn't neutralized and they're able to flee, then obviously we're now in a situation where you have a manhunt. There on the scene, what we've been seeing on those images from our affiliates is this is the staged presidents. What we can't see inside that building is likely the officers that are going floor by floor clearing that area, trying to ensure that the suspect isn't secreted in some -- you know, a closet or room. This is a very large building. But also -- you know, and I can tell you. Having been in these situations inside the mobile command centers, which we've seen, which are essentially you know large motor coaches there is you have the various commanders from different agencies, and certainly, the on- scene commander that they're fielding information coming in, intelligence, they're directing resources. But you also have to understand because they are crowdsourcing now with the public asking the public look at this image, call police if you see them, there's also an intake of tips that have to come in.

Now, they're in that -- in that stage where they're just trying to calculate, what resources do we keep here. And, you know, do we extend this perimeter even farther?

      "sentences": "Yes. So, Boris, look, we're kind of right in the middle of this. And what I will tell you is, look, the sources have been really good, so far about sort of laying out what they were trying to do when they first arrived here. I heard Josh talking about how people were just assembling and how they set the perimeter.So, you had the initial APD officers set the perimeter, but their hotels -- actually, we're standing right out in front of a hotel. So, you -- as you can imagine, they were concerned about where this person could run off to. We're also near public transportation. So, they were also worried about that person jumping on that public transportation. I mean, even as we're talking now, we do have the SWAT team members who were getting gear out of their trucks. It's still a very much defensive (INAUDIBLE) here right now. We haven't seen anyone running into any buildings or anything like that. But when you talk about an active midtown area in the city of Atlanta right now, and this is one of the fastest-growing pockets of the city, Midtown where you always have cranes, and everybody's sort of moving throughout the day. And I talked about that grocery store that's on the end of the block there, though New Whole Foods is on the bottom of that large building that's sitting right there. And then this building right here is an apartment complex. So, you have hundreds of people who live in this general area. And when this happened, the officers were good at shutting down not only the street that's over there, that's on the side right there. But they shut down the corresponding intersections on either side. They were trying to stop as many cars as possible from getting into this area. And as I talked about before, the shooting happened in this building, that's the Northside Medical building right there. You can see the corner of it. And this is where they pushed us back. On the other side of this building, there's a parking garage structure, and they were concerned about someone being able to carjack the car. Now, as you can see, these officers moving down the street. They did pick up some equipment. You can see they also look to be taking a breaching device with them as they walk back in this direction. They are still working with the thought process that they've been able to contain the suspect in this area. And once again, what we've learned so far is this man apparently arrived with his mother for a medical appointment, and at some point, became agitated during that medical appointment. And that's when the shooting started. And we've even been trying to figure out exactly how many people were shot because when they say injured or shot, there's a difference there because sometimes when they're shooting, there's glass that explodes everywhere, so people can get injured, but and suffer some sort of wound, but it might not be a gunshot. So, we do know people were pulled out of gurneys. Now, in this city, we do know that some of the hospital staff and EMS actually trained with the SWAT team. So, they had those special teams ready as well to kind of pull people in and to get them off the -- whoever was injured out of this situation. But as we're talking now, you think about more than 10 blocks of this midtown area, the bustling area in Atlanta that has been shut down due to this active search. And as we speak, there are helicopters all in this area that are also searching the buildings around here. If you've been to Atlanta before, we're close to I would say maybe nine hotels. When you add that together, that's why having the Marta Police Department, the Georgia State Patrol, the U.S. Marshals, the FBI, APD, and Fulton County Sheriff's Department altogether coordinating this from the command unit. That's actually two blocks from over where we are is important because they have set up their hive system there so they can bring in all the information from the area, and then put that out. And we've seen that communications department, which is planning for this stuff all the time, pump out that information. That's why somebody was smart enough to go in there and get that picture and bring it in. So, at this point, that's what the information they're working with. This still remains a very active scene. They have told people to shelter in place. So, all these folks who live in these buildings right here, most of them have not been able to come out since this has happened because they're not even leaving cars we have some of these parking garages as you can understand. But the one thing that we haven't seen and we always see these in these active situations is no one's looking in the back of cars to see if anyone's hiding in that situation. But while this is going on, why sirens are still surrounding us as people keep responding to different things around this area, I'm sure people are calling 911 with descriptions.

John, as you are watching this unfold, and right now there are a lot of questions that remain to be answered at this point in time because police have not found this suspect. They are staging, but for what at this point in time, it is hard to be sure of? JOHN MILLER, CNN CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp; INTEL ANALYST: Well, I think what you're looking at is they are staging to be ready because as Ryan described so well, what they did very well was they set up a perimeter to try and keep him contained within that area and to keep people from entering that area. And they did that pretty quickly. So that gives them one advantage. But you know, as we learn over and over again in these incidents, all too often I would add, the shooting usually only takes seconds or sometimes minutes.

And, you know, once he gets out of that perimeter before they set it up, if that -- if that is what happened, then you've got to search everything within the perimeter. But he may not be in there at all. So, one of the things they did extraordinarily well here was downloading the video from the security cameras, isolating those still photos, getting those out to the public, so that the public knows, yes, we're all on the lookout for someone but we know what we're on the lookout for in terms of those photographs. A couple of which you can clearly see him holding the firearm in his hand. So, as they're operating that scene, they've also got their secondary units on the outer perimeter. There was a report of an attempted carjacking of a -- of a pathfinder in the area. They broadcast the description of that individual. It was a denim jacket blue jeans, doesn't match the photograph. But as Ryan pointed out, once you shed that hoodie and another layer or two, they haven't eliminated that possibility. The carjacking was not successful. So, they are focused on that area as well.",

One killed at the scene at least four injured and rushed to hospitals in the area for help. John, if we could put up the images of the shooter that were released by police, I'm interested in getting your perspective on what stands out to you. Not only the satchel but in one image, it does appear as though the suspect is wearing a glove. What do you make of these images?",

And clearly, he was -- clearly, he's overwrought about that, acted out, and is now either in hiding somewhere within that perimeter or on the run.And when police engage him, hopefully, they will be able to actually engage him in a conversation to get him to calm down. But as Jonathan Wackrow pointed out a couple of minutes ago, you know these scenarios have three endings statistically. One is where there is a shootout with police. The other is where the suspect takes their own life before that. Or there's a good percentage of where the suspect is able to surrender. And that would be the hopeful outcome here.",

You know, bringing that satchel having it available in the front almost the way you would in a -- in a military gear type situation really indicates that when he left with his mom today, he did have some kind of plan. He was equipped for that plan. He was literally armed for that plan.And we don't know what else is in there. Although what we've seen in past active shooters is they bring a weapon, sometimes a secondary weapon, sometimes multiple magazines, as we saw fairly recently with the Michigan State University shooter who had the backpack with the secondary weapon and the multiple pre-loaded magazines. In this case, the only indicator is that he kept it that close and that close within reach. Knowing that he was armed and probably -- (INAUDIBLE)",
