      "sentences": "You are in the CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Paula Reid in Washington. Jim Acosta is off.We begin this hour with the latest emergency action aimed at halting what has become a global banking crisis. Switzerland's biggest bank UBS is buying its rival Credit Suisse. The deal comes after shares of the ailing bank lost 25 percent of their value over the past week as major depositors fled in droves, even as an emergency loan from the Swiss National Bank failed to shore up confidence. That bank says the take-over of UBS should, quote, \"secure financial stability and protect the Swiss economy.\" Joining us is CNN economics and political commentator Catherine Rampell. First, though, I want to go CNN's Anna Stewart on the phone. Anna, put this in perspective for us, how big of an announcement is this? ANNA STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT (via phone): This is huge. This -- well, it was for the time one of the biggest banks in the world and is definitely a major bank in Europe. It's been in the midst of a huge sort of restructure over the last couple of years, so it was already under pressure and seen all the pressures on the banking sector following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. And effectively you could say this was one of the weak link and it just started to buckle last week. We saw share price tanked. On Wednesday we saw the Swiss Central Bank offered huge loan of over $50 billion to try and support it in terms of liquidity and largely confidence, it didn't work. So what we're seeing here is UBS, the rival bank in Switzerland, do a huge takeover. It's essentially paying just over $3 billion worth. It sounds like a lot. It's actually taking Credit Suisse at 6 percent less than what the bank is worth on the closing price of the shares on Friday night. Now, just listen to an analyst call with the CEO of UBS about this deal. So we're getting a little bit more detail now. Annual cost saving he's saying of $8 billion by 2027, that means probably a lot of job cuts for Credit Suisse, and an amalgamation of the various units. More I think people will be talking a lot about in the next 24 hours, was this a bailout or was it a bail-in? What was this takeover deal? It was a private sector deal. Regulators very clearly say it wasn't a bailout. However, there are some interventions here. We have the Swiss National Bank, the central bank, providing a loan of over $100 billion to UBS and Credit Suisse at this stage, plus the federal government saying they will guarantee UBS an amount of $9.7 billion for any potential losses. Plus, on the bail-in side, we've got some bond holders. People that held a very specific type of bond in Credit Suisse, their holdings have been wiped out. So $17 billion worth of bonds investments held in Credit Suisse have just disappeared. So the big question is, what will this do to the banking sector, what will it do to the market tomorrow? Will there be confidence that this has been dealt with or will there be nerves about what happened here with some investors holding?",

Almost anything it does to solve one major problem that it faces, i.e., inflation, could potentially aggravate another major problem it faces, which is fragility in the financial system. So, yes, before all of this recent banking sector turmoil, it was widely expected that the Fed would raise rates at about half a percentage point most likely at this coming meeting.Now I think it's anybody's guess, some people are predicting a small hike not as big as had been the case before or had been expected before, rather. 25 basis points, you know, quarter of a percentage point, some are expecting a full-on pause, I think the challenge is for the Fed if they decide to pause, which I think would be reasonable given that maybe they want to see how the dusts settles with all of this, you know, financial turmoil, if they decide to pause, they need to be able to message saying this is a temporary pause. This is not a full-blown terminal stop. We are still, you know, hell bent on crushing inflation and nobody should interpret any pause right now that's in response to these recent events as they're giving up on the fight against inflation. So it will be interesting to see not only what action they take but how they communicate the -- you know, the objectives behind that action and their longer-term trajectory.",

JAKE AUCHINCLOSS (D-MA): I'm concerned, as everybody paying attention is, and Silicon Valley Bank had almost half of its branches in Massachusetts which I represent, including their headquarters in my home town. They banked not just our start-up economy, the life sciences and the high-tech firms, but also affordable housing developers and nonprofits focused on early education. This was a cross-section of our economy and the FDIC and the Fed were right to come in strong and clear on Sunday night. But now we are seeing that nationally, midsize regional banks are under a lot of strain. And for that reason, amongst others, I do think that Congress should raise the FDIC insurance limit through a higher special assessment on banks, so that we give depositors and these regional banks more confidence that those deposits will be there. And also so that we stem some of the contagion of fear that has rippled through our banking sector. REID: How concerns should everyday Americans be about this?",

This is about interest rate risk management, not about credit risk management as it was in 2008.

If Xi Jinping decides to send weapons to Russia for its brutal unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, that would be the most significant development in that war since the invasion itself on February 24th. And United States and its allies need to be prepared to respond withsevere sanctions and international condemnation. Whether those arm sales happen overtly or covertly because China does have a long track record of covert arms shipment over the last 30 years. But it really just reminds us that we can't rely on the good will or the good judgment of Xi Jinping. He is bent on a world order in which China is at the top of a hierarchy. It's in direct competition to the rules based international order, where might does not make right that the United States helped to put together after World War II, and we've got to defend it forcefully on the world stage. Economic alliances, initiatives to strengthen democracy, diplomacy and security initiatives. We need to do all of this with countries like Nigeria, India, Brazil, Mexico.

I've learned that Robert Costello, a former attorney for Donald Trump's one-time fixer Michael Cohen is said to appear before the Manhattan grand jury tomorrow at the request of Trump's defense team. Team Trump apparently believes Costello has information regarding Cohen's credibility.Now a source tells CNN that Costello reached out to both Trump's legal team and the DA's office to offer evidence that contradicts what Cohen has previously said about payments made to the former adult film star. Now Trump's attorneys then asked the D.A. to have Costello appear before the grand jury. Now Michael Cohen is of course the chief witness for the prosecution in this case. He was disbarred and jailed after admitting he used campaign funds days before the 2016 election to play Daniels and a former \"Playbook\" model to keep quiet about alleged affairs. Cohen says he did so at Trump's request. Trump denies any affair with Daniels and his lawyer has said Trump agreed to the payments only at Cohen's recommendation. Now I spoke earlier with former federal prosecutor Shan Wu about what kind of testimony Costello might be able to offer in court tomorrow. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [18:30:09] REID: A stunning visit inside Ukraine. Here's Vladimir Putin in the Donbas region for the first time since Russia invaded Ukraine. He touted the Russian controlled city of Mariupol and surveyed reconstruction programs after the damage inflicted by his own military. His visit comes just days after the International Criminal Court issued a warrant for his arrest for his role in an alleged scheme to deport thousands of Ukrainian children to Russia. For more let's bring in CNN military analyst Lieutenant General Mark Hertling. Colonel Hertling, Putin spent Saturday touring the streets he helped destroy in a country still deeply entrenched in war. What kind of message does that send both to his troops and the Ukrainians? LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: He's trying to send a message, Paula, but he's having some real difficulties doing that. As you see in these pictures he was going through the one apartment building that has been rebuilt, sort of as a Potemkin village, and I don't use that term loosely, in the city of Mariupol. Now remember, as you just said, that city was utterly devastated by his shelling of civilian apartments and hospitals and schools, and now he's going back to take a look around. And it's a photo-op as you see him in this film right now in the middle of an apartment building where he's trying to relocate some of the Ukrainian citizens. It's sending a signal, too, because it's still very far to the west behind enemy lines. It's in the province -- the Oblast of Donetsk, the Russians have control of that province right now.

Neither one of those things were done in Iraq, and just like the Russians, also, I would harken back as I was the war planner in the Pentagon when that war was planned, and actually stood up and said, there are not enough forces for this kind of operation and our end state, our objectives are not very clear.

Arkansas's defeat of Kansas Saturday night. You called the game. Did you expect that outcome? BRIAN ANDERSON, WARNER BROS. DISCOVERY SPORTS COMMENTATOR: Well, you never know. I mean, a team like Arkansas has a lot of talent, and it didn't surprise me that they advanced, but you know, they -- you're talking about the reigning national champion in the Kansas Jay Hawks, so I think that was the element of surprise. But, Paula, this tournament is crazy as you know, and anything can happen. FDU is a 16-seed. That was one of the, you know, biggest surprises of all time and as they beat Purdue, so Arkansas felt doable a day after that happened.",

And I don't think anybody had these two teams in their bracket, maybe one of them, and you would have been bold to have one of them at this point of your bracket. But to have these two quite the shocker.So I would just say, anything is possible, any team can beat any team right now, and you can win any game, you can lose any game. And it just really, if you can just get on a roll, and vice versa, if you start to struggle, it becomes a real mental battle with players and that rim gets smaller and smaller. And as these upsets start to unfold, you can kind of see that pressure build up and you certainly see it in the players' faces, you see it in their parents' faces in the stands, you see it in the fans' faces, our faces. You don't see really see our faces when they're playing a game, but, you know, we get nervous when we called these games. And it gets really tense, and, you know, it just means so much. These players, like, this may be their biggest moment, maybe their -- we call it the one shining moment. But they may never have an experience like this the rest of their lives. Most teams and most players aren't going to make it to the NBA level or the professional level, so this is kind of it, and that can breed some really interesting factors out on the floor.",

The Houston Cougars, they're a great bet.

Of course, mental health is a storyline that plays out throughout the \"Ted Lasso's\" episodes. I don't want to get -- offer too many spoilers for people who haven't seen the show, but it is something that the cast has addressed time and time again. And President Biden has sought to make mental health a key issue of his unity agenda. Now the president teased ahead to the visit a short while ago posting a photo on Twitter with the sign that says \"Believe\" over a door heading into the Oval Office. That believe sign is something that is in the AFC Richmond locker room in the show. So tomorrow the president will be convening this discussion with the cast of \"Ted Lasso\" about mental health. It's unclear whether they will be partaking in biscuits with the boss as \"Ted Lasso\" often does that's in his show.",
