They literally burned the midnight oil in a night that drew from a deep bench of Democrats, all of whom were eager to convince voters why their party is for the people.Democrats trying to take the momentum they have gained this past month and exponentially increase it in a mere 78 days from election day. Now, the page was turned tonight on that stage right behind me, but not before one last curtain call from President Joe Biden. He walked out to a roaring, and I do mean roaring applause. Everyone was on their feet, and it was a pretty fitting minutes long ovation after night that saw speaker after speaker after speaker thanking him for his leadership, for his service, and though some didn't outright say it, for his decision to drop out of the race, and of course, paved the way for his vice president, Kamala Harris, to Now sit on top of that ticket. Now she was there tonight watching from the wings, this time by choice, as Biden delivered an impassioned swan song. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Tonight wasn't a night to talk about, you know, his own emotions, and frankly, it wasn't a night to talk about what he had accomplished or felt that he'd accomplished. In fact, I think that hurts the vice president when he does that. Tonight was a night where he should have passed the baton with care and love and emotion and passion, and I thought he missed that moment and missed that opportunity. And the one thing I'll say that I thought really stuck, and I think you'll hear Republicans say it. Tonight he said that the United States has the best economy in the world.
