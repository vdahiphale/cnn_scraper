This address certainly comes at an interesting moment up here on Capitol Hill, and it is an address that is reserved exclusively right now for Senate Republicans. Now, the Prime Minister will be meeting virtually, beginning a video address behind closed doors with Senate Republicans up here on Capitol Hill. This is a weekly luncheon that Senate Republicans usually have. It's usually just them in the room. So, it's not necessarily excluding Democrats.But, it should be noted that the Prime Minister is also not addressing Democrats. And this comes just one week in the wake of Senator Schumer's massive speech that he gave on the Senate floor last week, as your referenced, where he called for new elections. And that did not go over well up here on Capitol Hill with Senate Republicans. Many were angered by that address on the floor that Schumer gave. Senator Barrasso calling it deeply offensive. And notably, Senator Barrasso is a Republican Senator that invited Netanyahu to speak on Capitol Hill or virtually on Capitol Hill today. Now, Rahel, the meeting will take place in just a few hours. And we've seen Republican senators kind of scurrying about, getting ready for that meeting with this leader today. So, certainly, we'll be reporting on every nugget that comes out after Republican leave that lunch and that address by the Prime Minister.",

We do want to warn you that her report contains some very disturbing scenes.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER (voice-over): I only left to find flour, to find food, this woman screams. Where are they? Her husband, children and other relatives are nowhere to be found. Their home destroyed in an Israeli airstrike while she was gone. Moments later, her nephew is pulled from the rubble. But, he is barely clinging on to life. [11:05:00] In central Gaza, as bombs continue to rain down, so do these foreboding leaflets, a warning from the Israeli military for civilians to flee southwards, directed at those living in the al-Rimal neighborhood, and the thousands currently sheltering in the nearby A- Shifa Hospital complex. This was the scene at the beleaguered medical complex on Monday, the alarming sound of artillery fire echoing through the early hours of the morning. Nobody has been able to reach those injured or killed at Al-Shifa, this eye witness says, filming discreetly. Some 3,000 people are believed to have been sheltering in and around the hospital when the raid began, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. Israeli military vehicles seen here in video filmed by a doctor in the hospital have surrounded the complex for days. On Tuesday, one civilian trapped inside sent CNN this audio recording. The hospital is still under bombardment. There has been heavy shelling and live fire, Lemiya (ph) says. One man was just looking out of the window on the second floor when he was hit by a sniper and killed. The Israeli military says it is conducting what it has described as a precise military operation targeting senior Hamas militants operating within the hospital complex. Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari accused Hamas on Monday of using the hospital as a command center. It is the very same claim made by the IDF ahead of its raid on Al-Shifa back in November. On Monday, the IDF released this video showing a safe full of cash, an envelope with Hamas and Islamic Jihad insignia, and a series of weapons presented as evidence to justify its raid on the hospital. But, much like the IDF raid in November, little other evidence was provided to prove the presence of a Hamas command center at the Al-Shifa Hospital. Hamas' military wing, meanwhile, has acknowledged that its fighters have been engaged in fierce clashes with Israeli troops in the area surrounding the hospital, adding that Gaza's Civil Police Chief Fayek Al-Mabhouh who led the coordination of food and aid deliveries to the strip was killed during the raid. In a statement, the IDF said Wednesday that approximately 90 \"terrorists\" were killed, including Al-Mabhouh. The IDF also maintained that no harm had been inflicted on civilians or medical staff in the hospital. But, testimonies from Palestinians inside Al-Shifa tell a very different story. We were informed by the Israelis that anyone moving within the hospital or around the hospital complex would be targeted by snipers, this medical student says. We can't leave the building to treat those injured outside. Some families are tempted to leave, but they were targeted and killed. Those who have been able to leave central Gaza are now forced to make the uncertain journey south with no guarantee of protection, or survival. Stripped to their underwear and barefoot, these young boys say they are thankful just to have escaped with their lives. Recounting their harrowing experience, they say they were met with Israeli tanks and forced into an open square where they were interrogated and ordered to undress. Other men around them, they say, were killed. Many evacuees have been badly wounded. Limp, bloodied bodies are carried by cart. But, there is little care available in the south anymore. And there is no telling whether these men like so many others will survive. Nada Bashir, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Eye witnesses have told CNN that RSF soldiers are giving civilians an ultimatum, \"enlist or starve.\" Our investigation shows how almost 700 men and 65 children have been forcibly recruited to swell RSF ranks. And that's just what we've been able to verify in Jazira. Across Sudan, reports and images like this one, children in RSF uniform, as across Sudan, millions forced from their homes by violence now face famine. CNN spoke to three dozen eyewitnesses, survivors and the families of victims. The RSF, they say, is weaponizing hunger, denying food to those who won't join. Aid groups say almost four million children in Sudan are already malnourished, as the country faces mass starvation. If aid agencies can't get food to those in need, almost a quarter of a million children could die. Jazira is Sudan's breadbasket, its heartland. To control this part of Sudan is to exert control over who lives and who dies. The RSF deny they're responsible for the hunger gripping the country. Yet, they control every aspect of farming this land. They control the warehouses of food and aid meant to support the most vulnerable. They control the seed supplies, fertilizer, pesticides, agricultural machinery and irrigation channels. And it's not just the infrastructure, farmers are being targeted, brutalized, degraded, and even killed, not just to control food, but to force allegiance. You hear shots on camera as six of the men are executed, according to survivors who spoke to CNN. Those who were spared say the RSF threatened to starve their families if they didn't join. The RSF sits in the heart of Sudan, hoarding food meant for millions. From here, they can wait out, starve out Sudan's people and its army.

And this just in, the New York Attorney General's Office says that an appeals court should ignore Donald Trump's claim that he cannot come up with a $464 million bond in his civil fraud case. The office argues that Trump should try to get multiple insurance companies to pool their resources to underwrite their bond. They also criticized Trump's insurance broker and a top attorney at the Trump Organization, saying that their sworn statements in the case are unreliable. The former President's legal team said earlier this week that securing a bond was impossible after 30 insurance companies rejected his bid.Let's bring in CNN's Kara Scannell for more. So, Kara, I guess the question now is, what does the former President do? What happens now?",

      "sentences": "Well, I mean, this issue is still before the appeals court. It's ultimately going to be their decision of whether they're going to grant Trump's request to not have to post the full amount, that $454 million bond, or I'll say that he doesn't have to post any of it at all until this appeals process is over. Now, there has been the back and forth of legal filings in this case. And on Monday, Trump's lawyer said that they approached 30 insurance brokers that they couldn't get any of them to underwrite a bond of this size. Part of the issue was because the insurers were not willing to take property as collateral. They want cash, stock, something that can be easily converted into cash. Of course, properties can take a long time to sell.So, they came to the judge and they said, we're having this problem. We can't do this. It's an impossibility. And what the Attorney General's Office is saying today is Trump can't introduce this new argument as they were this far in the appeals process. So, they're telling the court, they should ignore it. They should ignore the underlying testimony in it from the top legal officer, from the insurance broker, because they have invested interest in the outcome. They're not independent parties, and also saying that, as you said, then maybe they should try to get insurance companies to pull together. But, they're saying if the court is going to allow and accept this argument, the AG's Office is saying that they want to be heard on it, and that their point here is that Trump needs to tell the court what efforts they've actually gone to? What were the terms that the insurers were offering? Because they're trying to get to the bottom of whether Trump just didn't like the terms that are being offered, or if he really wasn't able to get a bond. So, putting more pressure on that. They also said that maybe Trump should agree to post his properties with the court and have the court have custody of his properties until this is all resolved. Now, the ball, though, is in the appeals court's hands. They will decide whether they're going to grant Trump's motion to give him more time or to let him post a lower amount. Meanwhile, the deadline for Trump to come up with this money is Monday. And the New York Attorney General's Office has been pretty firm in their belief that they're not going to give Trump any breathing room on their terms. So, it's likely they will take some steps as soon as Monday to move forward unless the appeals court steps in or Trump comes up with the money. Rahel.",

Hey, Joe Biden was keeping it real with the Latino voters. I mean, he was very honest in that conversation because he does need Latino voters. Trump has made some inroads. And again, this election is going to be won by the slimmest of margins. And so, every vote counts, and rebuilding that coalition really counts. I think what the President needs to continue to do is just have a direct conversation with Latino voters, talk about his record. We know that immigration reform is an important issue to Latinos, but so are a number of other issues. And so, I think we've got to keep the conversation broad and talk to folks where they are, about the issues that they really care about. The other thing I'll just mention very quickly is, I think we can't underestimate the impact of the legislation that they're attempting to get passed in or to put into effect in Texas. That would essentially allow law enforcement to pull people over or stop them if they suspect they are in the country illegally.

CHIEF OF STAFF, U.S. HOMELAND SECURITY DEPT.: Well, look, regardless of what your position is on immigration, this thing could end up if it's allowed to go forward, really being a catastrophe in terms of implementation. There is a reason why the federal government is responsible for immigration, and that's because the federal government is the sole authority in the United States that can determine who becomes an American citizen and who is not. And so, it's a federal responsibility to enforce immigration laws. If you allow states to start selectively enforcing immigration laws, you create the opportunity for a very serious conflict between the federal government and state governments, the type of conflict that could lead to flashpoints that are actually dangerous for law enforcement, as they can be confused about who is responsible and who is on first on an issue of the utmost importance. Now, what I will say here is the frustration is that Congress has kicked the can down the road for years and years without solving this problem. And so, you now have states trying to solve it on their own and create this situation. Fortunately, the courts have put it on pause again. But, they are playing with fire by considering this. And make no mistake, it would be extraordinarily complicated for the Department of Homeland Security to do its job if individual states are playing in this space.",

That is also bearing out in the polls. In fact, if there is a theme so far this year within the Republican Party, it has been defeat after defeat after defeat for those traditional establishment Republicans.

The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration has not updated its regulations for the industry in more than four decades. It was on track to propose new regulations in May. But, that timeline has slipped.CNN's Chief Climate Correspondent Bill Weir joins us now from New York with more on the safety concerns. Bill, good to have you. So what is the risk here and how serious is it?",

      "sentences": "Well, it's getting bigger as this entire sector explodes. Metaphorically, the concern is that the actual physical explosions could follow this rapid growth. Liquefied natural gas is basically methane. It is all this incredible fossil fuel that's been uncorked by the fracking boom in the United States, U.S. now the biggest petro state in human history, exporting way more than during the Trump administration, as a result of this boom. What they do is they take this gas and condense it down to 600 times smaller than its original size, using certain hydrocarbons that if they leak, create a flammable mist in the air around these facilities that if ignited by even a single spark can cause enormous explosions.Some of the biggest we've seen were in Venezuela in 2012, killed over 40 people, destroyed 3,000 homes and businesses around there. That's the pictures you're seeing there. The Buncefield explosion in England in 2005 was the biggest fire since World War Two. It is exactly one of these vapor clouds igniting. And now watchdogs are saying, look, the growth is amazing. It's great for energy security. But, it is a recipe for disaster if there is no regulation. There hasn't been meaningful regulation in this sector since the 1980s. And as you mentioned, Rahel, there has been some talk recently, but it's been sliding down. The Biden administration has put a freeze on new LNG terminal projects, just to get a sense of all of the hazards. And regardless of whether or not it explodes, methane is an incredibly potent greenhouse gas. It's 80 times more powerful than carbon dioxide when it comes to trapping heat on Earth. So, this is a double hazard, the watchdogs would say.",

      "sentences": "That's a good question. I think some of it is part of the stall, is part of this wider pause on LNG export terminals to try to figure these things out. But, it's long overdue. The industry has said that they support efforts to sort of crack down on methane leaks. Natural gas was billed as a cleaner alternative to coal. But now, we know that's only true if it never leaks. And it leaks everywhere. New satellites just went up to try to monitor those leaks around the world and get producers to clamp down on them. You can see with the special cameras the pollution that we can't see, that pours off of these rigs out of orphaned wells as well as the new ones.And so, it's an easiest problem to fix. It's just leaking. There is so much of it produced. It's so cheap, and it's oftentimes cheaper just to burn it or let it leak than to try to pipe it and sell it on a market right now. But, in the age of the climate crisis, that thinking is changing fast.",

They're looking -- their target for that core consumer expenditure deflator inflation, after excluding food and energy to get rid of the volatility, that those prices experience is about two percent. Right now, it feels like abstracting from the vagaries of the data, it's about 2.5 percent to three percent. So, they just need to make sure that we're headed to.So, I'd say one or two more reports that are more consistent with two than three and we are there to cut rates. And I -- my sense is, by the June meeting, they'll have enough evidence to actually start cutting rates.",

They want to raise rates high enough, keep them high enough, long enough, to slow growth, to quell inflation, get inflation back into the bottle, get back to that two percent target I mentioned earlier, but not raise rates too high, hold them too high, too long that it pushes the economy into recession. So, it's a very delicate balancing act. It's a matter of judgment. If I were king for the day, if I were on the Committee, I'd be arguing like, hey, let's just cut rates now. We don't have to cut them quickly. We can cut them a quarter point, take a look around and see what's happening. If inflation doesn't cooperate, we can stop cutting. We could even raise.But, I think the economy is at a place, and inflation is at a place where it would make sense to cut. But, again, that's a matter of judgment. I could see the other side of that argument to debate. And I think the collective wisdom is, hey, let's just wait a few more months here. Let's make sure inflation is going back to target that we've slain the inflation dragon and we could start cutting rates with -- and ensure the economy doesn't go into a recession.

And I certainly understand for the rate cuts, for the sort of trickle-down effect into the rates that we pay as consumers. And they're sort of waiting to see when this starts to take place. Do you expect a meaningful drop in rates? And what I mean is that I think there is this expectation that the rate --that hat the Fed is going to slash rates, and it doesn't seem to be in the data that they're going to necessarily slash rates significantly.

So, first, we go from 5.5 percent to 5.25 percent, 5.25 percent, five and quarter five, five to four and three quarters. That's where we end the year. That's kind of sort of the trajectory, kind of a slow, steady cut in rates. It will -- it should have -- if history is in guide, it should have immediate relief for households with credit card debt, consumer finance loans, home equity lines of credit, because they're tied directly to what the Fed does.Some folks that are out buying, looking for an auto and need an auto loan or a home and need a mortgage on, they might get a little bit early, but that's going to take more time. So, yeah, you're right. I wouldn't count on rates coming in dramatically here. They're not going to be slashing rates. It's going to be slow and steady and over time.",
