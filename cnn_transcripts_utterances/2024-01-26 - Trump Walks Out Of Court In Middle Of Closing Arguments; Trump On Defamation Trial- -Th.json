This after telling the Republican National Committee not to name him the presumptive nominee, not yet, at least, standing in the way, Nikki Haley, who is fundraising off of Trump's recent comments, threatening to blacklist anyone who donates to her campaign. And in Wisconsin, Republicans in the State Assembly have proposed a referendum on a 14-week abortion ban. We're going to discuss how this issue could affect President Biden's reelection campaign in that much win swing state. Good day, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt to our viewers watching in the United States and around the world. It's 11 a.m. here in Washington, Friday, January 26. There are eight days until the South Carolina Democratic primary, 29 days until the Republican contest there. We have only 283 days until Election Day. This is today's State of the Race. Donald Trump once again campaigning from the courtroom after his party floated and then pulled a resolution to effectively crown him nominee before the votes are all in. Trump briefly attended, then he actually walked out of his closing arguments this afternoon in the civil defamation case that was brought against him by E. Jean Carroll. The former President was on the stand yesterday for less than five minutes, and he was admonished by the judge after he repeated the claims that have already been deemed defamatory. Later, he posted this video, again trying to frame himself as the victim in the case. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, 45TH U.S. PRESIDENT: I have no idea who she is, where she came from. This is another scam. It's a political witch hunt. And somehow we're going to have to fight this up. The whole thing is a scam, and it's a shame and it's a disgrace to our country. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

As for the traditional campaign, the Republican National Committee is withdrawing a resolution declaring Trump the party's presumptive nominee after it sparked backlash. Trump was on board with the idea at first, but now he says \"I should do it the old fashioned way and finish the process off at the ballot box. Thank you to the RNC for the respect and devotion you have shown me.\" OK, there is a lot there. So, it's good we have today's all-star panel with us. CNN political Commentator, Ashley Allison.

Alayna, let me start with you, because suddenly, elections are fair and not rigged or something, according to Donald Trump, who now says he has got to go along with the RNC process. Can you take us kind of behind the scenes? Because he was on board with this. Then all of a sudden, he wasn't on board with this. Clearly, there was some backlash at some place.",

But, the reason they backed off is because of that backlash.

Fine. I'm going to go along with the rules, because he doesn't usually play by them. But, that was a pretty remarkable statement from her. I mean, what's your kind of view of why the politics of this would have been bad for Trump? KRISTEN SOLTIS ANDERSON, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, &amp; U.S. REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST AND POLLSTER: I think the politics of this would have been bad for Trump, one, is it affirms that he is the Republican establishment. A big piece of his argument, as always, I'm fighting the establishment. I'm the outsider. He is not. He is the establishment. He is for all intents and purposes, effectively, like a Republican incumbent. And this would have just underlined that reality that he wants to continue to avoid. The second problem is, as much as he and his allies are taking this, like, if you like Nikki Haley, you're out of the party, don't let the door hit you on the way out type attitude, they need those voters in November. And if those voters do not turn out for Donald Trump, if they vote for Joe Biden, there is going to be a lot of tears and recriminations, and oh, you guys didn't turn out for us and that's why we lost.

But, she is ratcheting up her descriptors of him. She has talked more about the chaos that he brings, the fact that he is unhinged, and just really zeroing in on what she sees as a potentially unsafe and unfit person who is running, although she still, at the end of the day, says she would support him if he is the nominee. So, I think that's her difficulty here is balancing the fact that she ultimately will support him if he is the nominee, but also trying to really go for the jugular and say that he isn't necessarily good for the party and he is alienating a whole swath of voters.",

So, Nikki Haley is doing a favor right now for the Democrats by staying in the race.

I don't think that Nikki Haley is staying in thisbecause there is a realistic path to her amassing the delegates necessary to defeat him at a convention. I think her reasons for staying in are twofold. One is, if you have the money, if you have the support, why not? There is no reason necessarily to drop out. Keep making your case. And maybe something strange does happen. I don't think that's the best reason. I think the best reason to stay in is you can say I'm giving voters a choice. I don't believe that the entire Republican Party has captivated Donald Trump, maybe a majority. And certainly, it seems as though a majority of Republican voters have clearly said this is what we want. But, there is about 30 percent to 40 percent, depending on the state, that says, no, we do want a different direction. If Haley drops out, we won't have a full accounting of what that looks like. So, staying in, even as a sort of symbolic exercise, think of it the way someone like a Bernie Sanders. Even when the writing is on the wall stays in on the Democratic side, to make the case, hey, my wing of the party matters. We deserve to be listened to. You can see a little bit of why that might be irrational for taking him.",

I mean, one of the things, Laura, that allowed Bernie Sanders to do that even when he was losing was that his people, thisarmy of small donors, he could send a fundraising email. The money would pour in. I mean, I remember flying around on a massive plane with him that -- the seats were like mostly empty, but they were able to pay for it. It was like no problem at all, because all they had to do was push the button and they'd get -- donors give them money. And it took a really, really long time for that to dry up. What's your sense of what kind of -- I mean, they have said that about half of the 2.2 something million that they've raised, since New Hampshire has been from small donors, do you think they have something there, an engine there? BARRON-LOPEZ: I think that Haley clearly has a decent amount of donors, whether it's small or also large establishment donors, that want to see her stay in the race. At least, they don't seem to be cowing to Trump's threats so far. And so, whether it's a mix of small and large, I think she has enough there to, as Kristen says, stay in for a bit longer to see ultimately whether or not there is a different path for the party, especially come future years, because again, Trump is the likely nominee. It seems really impossible for Haley to catch him at any point. Although I will say that, of those swath of voters, those independent disenchanted Republicans who want a different path, you see in some of the entrance polling, exit polling of the past two contests that a lot of them say that they don't necessarily think they'll support Trump if he is the nominee. And so, those are voters that could potentially very well go to Biden, if not sit out the election.",

He doesn't usually backtrack on things. There has to have been a reason why he thought that was going to be bad for him.

But, they are very disciplined, and he does listen to them more than he had, his advisors, in the past. But, I do think Donald Trump is also in many ways political savvy. He understands when something is going to backfire on him, and he knew that this was going to be one of those things. And he does not want this to look like, as Kristen pointed out, that this is the party establishment coming here and saving him, not him winning this on his own, even though he recognizes the benefits of having the RNC coming out, declaring that he is presumptive nominee. And I can tell you, from my conversations with Trump's campaign, they are very eager to wrap up this primary and just move on to the general. They want to have everybody unified behind him. That's why you saw him parading all these former rivals and other congressmen, all their endorsements because he wants to just say, the party is behind me. Let's do this. Let's go after Biden, and Nikki Haley is getting in the way. But, he also doesn't want to have it be seen like this isn't him who is winning this himself.

Is she going to step back? But, it doesn't -- it does seem like they're going to have what they need to keep going. BARRON-LOPEZ: It does. I mean, she clearly got more infusion from small donors, in addition to the big donors that are behind her, because she is confronting Trump on the fact that he is saying anyone who gives to Nikki Haley or is behind her at this point, you're not a part of my party. You're not a part of MAGA. But -- so, she clearly is riding high on that. One thing that I think we haven't acknowledged when it comes to Haley's difficulty with breaking through or trying to win over some of those Republican voters, that you were talking about, Kristen, that are in Trump's camp, is also that Fox News ecosystem, because that Fox News ecosystem over and over has painted Joe Biden as this inept, not competitive, just really old person who could be easily beatable by anyone on the Republican side. And so, I think that's made Nikki Haley's argument that Trump is not electable a lot harder, because the Republican ecosystem, news media ecosystem has really said anyone can beat Joe Biden, including Trump, even with all his 91 felony counts. And so, he is someone who could totally take him on. And I think that's why the electability argument hasn't really worked with diehard Republicans.",

And you've also seen the President trying to be much more explicit about exactly what he is willing to do.
