This will be the second time in two years that she has given the speech at the Munich Security Conference. Now her aides told me that this speech today will be a follow up to her first speech last year.If you remember, she spoke just days before Russia invaded Ukraine. And in that speech, she delivered the message that really Russia was on the brink of it and that they would suffer major consequences if they went through with it. Now, of course, we know that they did. So the Vice President today, she will really follow through with it talk about how those threats of consequences have materialized really due to the Western alliance rule. And then she'll talk about how Ukraine still stands strong after a year of its invasion and how Western allies remain united really supporting Ukraine and its sovereignty. Now, the Vice President will also talk about atrocities that the U.S. believes Russia has committed. Yesterday in an interview she spoke about how she believes Russia has committed war crimes really detailing some of those reports that we've heard over the course of the years, was really horrible reports out of places like Bucha and other places in Ukraine. So the Vice President will go into detail about that. Now, of course, the U.S. last year officially determined that Russia has committed war crimes in Ukraine. Now, President Zelenskyy has gone further than that accusing Russia of committing crimes against humanity. So we'll see whether or not the U.S. eventually adopts that same language. Boris, Amara?",

Now if Yevgeny Prigozhin, who is the head of Wagner, has said -- has admitted that they have not made the progress, that they have wanted so far. He blamed in part, what he called the monstrous military bureaucracy of the Russian military. We are increasingly seeing the divisions between this private effort by Prigozhin and Russia's military. And Amara and Boris, we have gotten a new assessment from the White House about the significant toll that that fight in Bakhmut has taken against Wagner forces. They say that in the past few months, there have been some 30,000 casualties. So that's 30,000 dead and wounded 9,000 dead, according to the White House. Of course, over the past year, Ukraine has also suffered tremendous losses, both in Bakhmut and all across the country, but far less transparency from Ukraine and the U.S. in terms of those Ukrainian losses.

This is exactly the same distance as North Korea's longest ever missile launch of the Hwasong-17 back in November, a missile that traveled 22 times the speed of sound. And that Japan warned had the potential to hit the U.S. mainland. And this is North Korea's second ballistic missile that they fired this year. The first was on the New Year's Day. Last week, though what was a cause for concern was that there was a parade in Pyongyang, where Kim Jong-un unveiled an apparent mock-up of a new solid fuel ICBM. They're easy to make, and they're very easy to launch in a very stealthy way without detection by United States spy satellites. So could this be a test of this of this new type of ICBM, or is this another launch of the Hwasong-17? Because the flight trajectory was almost identical to the last ballistic and ICBM class launch in North Korea, which was back in November. And just a reminder, just on Friday, North Korea actually threatened unprecedented action over U.S.-South Korean military drills. Just this week at the Pentagon, they're going to be conducting what are known as tabletop drills using computers to conduct simulations. But then on the Korean peninsula, there will be more traditional military drills happening next month and North Korea always use those as essentially a dress rehearsal for invasion. So we could and probably should expect to see more provocations to come as these drills happen. Boris, Amara?",

A lot of worried folks, despite the best efforts of Governor Mike DeWine to let folks know that the air and water as they're measuring it is safe.He says that those who are drinking on the village water supplies, they tested those wells repeatedly. And none of those toxins from that train derailment has gotten in there. He even said the toxic plume that was floating down the Ohio River had dissipated to the point where it was barely traceable to their tests there as well. But that is done not a lot to alleviate fears. In fact, one Republican state senator from that region went on Fox News right after the governor's press conference and says I don't believe the government. I get a sore throat when I go home. So a lot of testing be done. The governor is not accepting FEMA help right now, for whatever reason, but is accepting Health and Human Services, experts who are coming to town to do an exposure assessment and try to answer the questions of anyone who might have them. It will be interesting to see how that plays out. There's so much frustration and suspicion. We live in an age of conspiracy and after the COVID mask and vaccine debates, you can't blame the folks there for not knowing who to believe given the information they're having. As for Norfolk Southern that the railroad, we have that incredible surveillance video of a town 43 minutes from the crash site that showed sparks flying out of the back of that faulty axle at the back of a 1.8-mile-long train. Safety experts and activists been warning about the railroad industry switching to running longer trains with fewer people in order to maximize profits. And that of course will come up and probably all of the eight class action lawsuits that have been filed against Norfolk Southern so far. We'll stay on it and see what's the latest there.

This was something that has been on the Republican agenda for generations frankly. There was a lot of opposition to these programs at the time that they were created. And certainly, it was very clear there were endless numbers of headlines and speeches when Senator Scott put forward his proposal last year that, what he actually wants and what is desired here is to fundamentally remake these very popular programs as a way to save on the federal budget. Now, if that is something that people believe should happen, they should own it. In this case though, it is politically a third rail. And I think he's come to realize that.
