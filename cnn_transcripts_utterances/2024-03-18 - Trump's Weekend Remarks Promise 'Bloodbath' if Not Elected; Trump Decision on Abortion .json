I would say that, like, this isn't unusual for Trump to kind of go off-cuff. You know, the excuse that the teleprompter was -- was moving around and shaking around. I mean, what Trump does at these things is he kind of -- he gauges the audience reaction, and I think if he's focusing on certain parts of the audience and then he's starting to lose them, they're not understanding what he's saying, they're waiting for that red meat thing, he throws something out there. It's careless, and it's reckless, right? But I don't necessarily feel that, you know, there's a half-truth to everything that he says, enough so that it reinvigorates what he's thinking is the base, right? And you're hoping that at some point, he switches to a general election strategy. But in the back of his mind, he feels like these rallies are kind of boring if he focuses on policy discussions, et cetera. So the January 6th thing, I have honestly no idea what that's about. I can't sit here and say that that's a great thing to start talking about. He's already got those folks in his camp. So move on and try and add voters that you lost in 2020.

Or are you talking about the confession of a crime?If you've been indicted for shooting the sheriff already, then -- and when you say no, I was just referring to the song, if that -- the threat of violence is not hypothetical.

We had a violent transfer of power in 2020. The clock resets. Every other democracy in the world now has a longer tradition of the peaceful transfer of power than the United States, including the newest ones.

And if we see these people as animal -- animals, if we see these people as criminals, then of course, that means that when it comes to another term of Trump, he will be able to say, Well, it doesn't matter what happens to these people. They are evil. And so that's why I think that language is important. When we focus on language, we're not just saying, Hey, oh, another crazy thing that Trump did. It's another pudding brain.

And it's something you hear Donald Trump talk about a lot. He's always thinking about the politics of this issue. We've seen him tried to toe that line over the past several months of him saying, yes, you know, trying to cater to Republicans, that he was the one who helped get Roe v. Wade overturned. But he's also been purposely vague, because he recognizes that he thinks this issue is a political loser for Republicans.

It was swaying in the wind. And you could see that Donald Trump, he kept remarking on that, saying he's not able to use it. You saw make some of these, you know, more off-the-cuff remarks that he typically -- even though he doesn't always use the teleprompter so heavily, it was definitely more noticeable in this speech. And look, I think Donald Trump, the dark rhetoric that we heard on Saturday is exactly the type of rhetoric that, yes, maybe his campaign doesn't always want him to be using, but he's going to continue to use throughout the general election. And part of that is -- it's the same type of rhetoric we saw in 2016: that fearmongering, trying to put fear in the idea of voters that, if he's not re-elected, the country will be far worse without him.
