The vice president and the late Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee were actually close personal friends.They were both numbers of the same Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority. So this will give the vice president an opportunity to celebrate her life and legacy. But it also could be a moment for her to step into that role as consoler-in-chief. I will also note that there are several other notables who are here at this homegoing service for Jackson Lee. That includes former President Bill Clinton and former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton. Both of the Clintons spoke about her legacy in their remarks here at the service. But they also linked Jackson Lee's legacy to Vice President Kamala Harris. Both making a nod to their belief that she will be able to carry the torch of her legacy, carry the torch of a younger generation if she is elected this November. So we will watch this very closely to see how the vice president eulogizes her close personal friend, Sheila Jackson Lee, and what kind of message she could have for voters as well.",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's right. The Israeli military conducted an airstrike nearly three weeks ago that they say was targeting Mohammed Deif, who is the top military commander for Hamas. He leads Hamas' Qassam Brigades, the organization's military wing.At the time, of -- over the course of the last three weeks, effectively, Israeli said that they had indications that he was successfully targeted, but they didn't know for sure. And I'm told that, today, when they came out with this announcement that they had confirmed that he was killed in this strike, they did so after learning just hours earlier through new intelligence that he had, indeed, been killed as a result of that strike. Hamas, for its part, has neither confirmed nor denied this claim from the Israeli government, which is interesting in and of itself. But obviously, this speaks to the number of strikes that Israel has taken over the course of just the last few weeks, taking out Hamas' top military commander in Gaza, taking out the senior-most Hezbollah commander in a strike. And now also, apparently, in a covert operation, assassinating Hamas' political leader. It speaks to what these -- the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described yesterday as a series of crushing blows delivered against Israels enemies. But it is also those crushing blows that have put this region on edge. And that are putting Israel in the crosshairs of those Iranian proxies, as well as perhaps of Iran itself -- Boris?",

And we're told, from that point on, they we're working feverishly to try to come up with another solution to get Paul home. Evan Gershkovich was then arrested in 2023 at the end of March. And this added even more urgency to the U.S. efforts to get them home. And we are told by national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, that these were painstaking negotiations over months and months and months. They involved quiet diplomacy among a number of allies scouring the globe to look for people to include in this swap. And perhaps the most important element, trying to convince Germany to include this convicted Russian assassin, named Vadim Krasikov, who was the key demand from Moscow. Moscow has made very clear for years that they wanted Krasikov back and that they would not release Americans until the Germans did so. So Jake said that this was a lot of efforts to have these conversations with German officials to get them on board with this deal. He actually met with Evan's parents in the White House back in February, right around the time that Russian dissident, Alexey Navalny, passed away. And this helped them get to this point where they were really determined to get this deal in place that we saw today.",

But in our recent conversations, he has shown a lot more optimism about the efforts that were underway. He felt like the U.S. was taking his case seriously. And we saw that, of course, happily reflected in the fact that he and Evan Gershkovich and also Alsu Kurmasheva and Vladimir Kara-Murza were freed today. In terms of the family, I haven't heard much from them yet. I can't imagine how overwhelming today is for them. David Whelan, who is Paul's brother, put out a statement saying, \"Now is the time for Paul to tell his own story.\" Meanwhile, Elizabeth Whelan was there next to President Biden earlier today at the White House as they we're announcing this news that the Americans were coming home in this massive deal. She has been a tireless advocate for her brother. So I have to imagine today is absolutely overwhelming for her.",
