Instead, there have been so many other controversies and issues that have distracted from that message being the focal point of this campaign. If you remember, we spent several days talking about a comedian suggesting Puerto Rico was an island of garbage. There was his suggestion that he put RFK, Jr. in charge of women's health and healthcare in this country. There was a spat with Liz Cheney. All of these elements have distracted from Donald Trump focusing in this final week about the economy. And one of the reasons why he has had such difficulty focusing on the economy as a top issue is because he does not really believe it is the number one issue in this election. He believes it is immigration and the US southern border. He says that quite often when he is at these rallies. He tells it to the media and he says it in his appearances. It is the number one issue to him is immigration, and that is largely because that is the issue that he won on in 2016. He laments that he could not campaign on it in 2020. And so, here he is four years later making that a focal point of the closing stretch. Now, we should point out the rally in Virginia is sandwiched in between two stops in North Carolina, a state he will also be in tomorrow and on Monday as well. That is not a battleground they expected to spend this much time in however, clearly showing how important it is for them to hold North Carolina in these final days.",

It is an ad that is going to be running during NFL games today. It is going to bookend that $370 million paid ad buy that we have talked about before and again, this is because senior campaign officials are projecting a degree of optimism when it comes to reaching those undecided voters, those voters who are fatigued by former President Donald Trump. So, they are hoping that in the closing days of the election, they can bring them over to the vice president, so that they can support her, and of course, all of these events and the lead up to election day are intended to mobilize voters. Of course, it was a star-studded event here in North Carolina intentionally so because the campaign is trying to gin up that enthusiasm hoping that they can also capitalize on early voting ahead of Tuesday -- Jessica.",

Now, Trump is going there four times, it makes you feel like both campaigns feel like the state is in play. But you know, I also think that if you are Kamala Harris, you want an insurance policy in case some chip -- there is some chip in the blue while you are counting on. North Carolina, 16 electoral votes. Georgia, where she was today, 16 electoral votes. That is an insurance policy. I expect that she will spend most of the next 48 hours concentrating on those three blue wall states, but it just gives you a sense of how close this race is.",

I am sure they would love him to stay tethered to that prompter a little bit more and deliver the message that they think will help him win this election, but he is not closing well . She is closing a much more disciplined way. I said earlier today that she has been criticized for being too cautious.

We know Republican women in the suburbs for example, have been voting heavily in places like the suburbs of Atlanta, are they coming out to vote for Donald Trump, or is some portion of them coming out to vote for Kamala Harris?We know that there are non-college White women who could be a poll of support for Kamala Harris, and you know, I do not know whether they feel uncomfortable talking with people about their vote or not. But clearly, we are not seeing that showing up in the numbers particularly, but -- and you know, we will see what happens on Tuesday. That is one of the things I am going to be looking for. The other would be is, is there going to be a surge of Trump voters that have been not captured by the pollsters for a third straight election. There are a lot of theories about the fact that pollsters are now over-correcting and they are actually accounted for in these polls. We do not know the answer to that either.

That's usually between 22 and 24 weeks. One of the states that is key to watch is Florida, and that's just because it's one of the ones that serve the most people. Since the six-week abortion ban went into place in May, nationwide, that led to a 7 percent dip in abortions. That's - 30 percent of abortions in Florida were cut and that led to a dip across the nation.That's because about 1 in 10 abortions that happen in the United States happen in Florida. Just at the beginning of the year, we had about 8,000 abortions a month in the state, but in May, in June, that number went down to 5,400. So that is a pretty big drop there. In 2023, about 9,000 people traveled to Florida to receive an abortion, and that's because they were coming from mostly states like Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama that are more restrictive. Another state to watch, Missouri, that was the first state to actually implement an abortion ban after Roe v. Wade was revoked. And that is also one of the most restrictive states in terms of what those abortion laws mean. So no exceptions for survivors of rape or incest. Providers are at risk of legal viability and then there are exceptions for medical emergencies, but that doesn't apply to a lot of other pregnancy complications like malformation or other complications that can come up in pregnancy. What's interesting also is Nebraska, where there are not one but two measures on the ballot that have to do with abortion rights. One of them would actually preserve a 12-week ban that is in place right now, and another would do as the other measures in the other nine states, which would be to enshrine abortion rights into the state constitution. And Jessica, of course, we are hearing so much about this issue nationwide. There are high-profile celebrities and figures kind of lending their voice to this issue, starting with Beyonce last week at the rally in Houston with Kamala Harris, making it very clear where she stands on the issue, talking about the importance of reproductive rights. And Chrissy Teigen this week in Arizona, speaking about her own experience of needing a late-term abortion, when she was pregnant, and showing up at one of these events in Arizona. Now, regardless of how the election goes on Tuesday and who becomes president, these states and these ballot measures will have a profound effect, Jessica, on what abortion looks like in the country.",

And that's what led to all that chaos. But, you know, it's not just Detroit. It's throughout all of Michigan. The Secretary of State in Michigan, Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat, she's been in a war of words these past few weeks with Elon Musk, of all people, the richest man in the world, the owner of Twitter slash X, because he's been peddling all kinds of nonsense about the voter rolls in Michigan. So this is a local, state, and national issue, the disinformation. But the folks down there are optimistic that they'll be able to have a better outcome this year because they learned the hard lessons from 2020.

Well, let's take a look at the polling aggregates across those seven key battlegrounds that we've been talking about, right? In your Sun Belt, you see a little bit more red than blue. In fact, there is no blue in the Sun Belt. But again, it's way too close to call. Trump by three in Arizona, two in Georgia, one in North Carolina, a tie in Nevada. Come over to those Great Lakes, and a little bit more blue here. But look at this, just a point in Michigan, less than a point - when you're breaking out this symbol, Jessica, the less than, you know how close the race is. And then, of course, in Pennsylvania, all important Pennsylvania, tied, T-I-E-D, that's the bottom line of this election. Way too close to call at this point.

I don't even know what other way to put it, because Pennsylvania becomes the all-important key state. Whoever wins Pennsylvania wins the election. We've been talking about it week after week after week. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, just to the southwest of me here in New York City, becomes the all-important state. If you can figure out who wins Pennsylvania, you probably know who's going to win the election. Because at this point, the polls can only tell you that both candidates are short of the 270 electoral votes needed to win.

Let's go back since 1972 and look at the key battleground states and say, how off were the polling averages.The polls aren't perfect. They are a tool. They give - get you in the neighborhood, but when the race is this close, when all the key battleground states are within three percentage points, that's within the average error band. The average error band for state polling averages since 1972 is, get this, 3.4 points, 3.4 points. And then if you talk about a margin of error, right? Like a 95 percent confidence interval, we're talking about more like plus or minus nine points. All of the key battleground states are within this error band, and they're actually within the average error band as well. So let's kind of talk about what happens if you have an average error and apply it to the electoral map, right? Well, if we have an average error and Donald Trump benefits from the average error, guess what? He gets way past 270 electoral votes. He gets to 312. Why? He carries all the Great Lake battleground states. He carries the southeast battleground states in North Carolina and Georgia. And he carries Nevada and Arizona out west. But, of course, Jessica, there's no guarantee that the polls being off would necessarily benefit Donald Trump, even though they did both in 2016 and 2020. Because they could, in fact, the polling miss could benefit Kamala Harris like it did the Democrats back in 2022. If there was, in fact, a polling miss that benefited Kamala Harris, an average polling miss, she'd get north of 300 electoral votes. Look at that. She'd get to 319. Why? She'd carry the Great Lake battleground states, right? She'd carry Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania. She'd carry the southeast battleground states, Georgia, North Carolina and she'd carry the southwest battleground states of Nevada and Arizona. So the bottom line is this. The polls at this point to a race that's way too close to call. But an average miss in either direction could turn this into an Electoral College blowout. We just don't know at this point.",
