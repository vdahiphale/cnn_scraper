It is Tuesday, May the 28th, 9 a.m. here in London, 4 a.m. in New York City, where closing arguments will soon get underway in the historic Donald Trump hush money case.Jurors have been away since last Tuesday due to the U.S. Memorial Day weekend, and they'll likely begin deliberating the fate of the former U.S. president on Wednesday. But first, prosecutors will try to weave together weeks of testimony and evidence from these 20 witnesses to convince jurors that Trump is guilty of falsifying business records with the intent of influencing the 2016 election. Much of their case hinges on the testimony of Michael Cohen, Donald Trump's former lawyer and fixer. There's no time limits on the summations. Both sides could use visual aids to drive home their points. The defense will present their closing arguments first, and Trump has been complaining on social media about his team not getting the last word. He also posted that he'll go before the judge to, quote, see whether or not he'll become a common criminal. Former White House counsel John Dean weighed in on the defense team's possible strategy during those final remarks. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

They may well try to pitch much of the jury on their closing that Trump was really relying on his lawyer in this instance.I think that's one of the wild cards, and one of the judge who hates to interrupt a closing will find himself confronted with having to object to or when the government objects to it, he'll sustain it and they'll not be able to make that argument.

But the question around the viability of a Palestinian state has really become a point of focus, because when we're talking about the occupied West Bank, what we have seen in practical terms is the erosion of that framework, particularly as well, as international -- as members of the international community continue to push not only for a ceasefire, but for a lasting two-state solution. And what we've seen over the course of the war, over the course of more than seven months now, is the expansion of these illegal Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, which essentially is eroding any framework for a viable Palestinian state in the occupied West Bank.In fact, in March we heard from Israel's far-right finance minister announcing the further seizure of land in the occupied West Bank. So there are real questions as to whether this can actually be viable, regardless of the recognition by these nations of the state of Palestine.
