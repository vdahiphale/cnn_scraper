CIA Director Bill Burns, who has remained in the region to assist with these talks, traveled to Israel today to meet directly with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Israel's operation in Rafah in Gaza is drawing international condemnation in the midst of all this. Dozens have been killed since Israeli forces moved into the city's east. Among those dead children, the youngest, just four months old. According to the U.N. Agency for Palestinian Refugees, more than 50,000 people have fled Rafah in the last 48 hours. Many of them displaced multiple times already in this war. For the first time in nearly 20 years, Israel now controls all crossings into Gaza, stopping aid arriving from Egypt. Israeli officials say the Kerem Shalom crossing has been reopened but the U.S. and Palestinian Authorities have not seen any aid trucks able to cross there. In the north of Gaza, a third mass grave has been uncovered at al-Shifa hospital complex. CNN international correspondent Clarissa Ward joins us now from Jerusalem. Clarissa, you know, I've heard that adjective limited applied to this operation in Rafah by Israeli officials, but our understanding from reporting there is that it's not limited in the eyes of the people who live there, hospitals running low on fuel, aid is not getting in. I wonder how limited that operation actually is and what the effects are that you're seeing there.",

      "sentences": "Well, you are already hearing aid organizations up in arms about the prospects of having those two border crossings Kerem Shalom and the Rafah border crossing effectively closed. The Israeli body COGAT that is sort of overseeing that humanitarian access had said, as you mentioned that Kerem Shalom was open today. UNRWA and other organizations saying that no aid has gone in. The WHO saying that three -- all the hospitals in southern Gaza will be forced to close down within three days if fuel does not get in to southern Gaza.One of the hospitals, the largest hospital in eastern Rafah has already had to shutter its doors and evacuate and move their facilities to a temporary field hospital. Then on top of that, you have the 50,000 as you mentioned, that the U.N. estimates have already been displaced. These people are being told to go to safe zones like Mawasi. These safe zones, according to aid workers, are completely overrun. The infrastructure simply isn't there to support or host them properly. And some of these people, Jim, are moving for their fourth or fifth time even. On top of that, you're seeing satellite imagery that is showing Israel increasing its ground operations. You have had continuous strikes and also artillery shelling throughout the day and the night with at least eight people killed today, and everybody sort of hanging and waiting to see whether what Israel is calling a surgical anti-terror operation will evolve into a much feared, broader Rafah offensive. There are some in Israel who have implied that this is perhaps intended primarily as a negotiating tactic in terms of trying to put more pressure on Hamas and extract more leverage at the table. There are others who are saying, of course, that for Netanyahu, this is about his own political viability with the sort of right-wing hardliners in his coalition. But for the ordinary people of Gaza, as you can imagine, Jim, it is just another disaster and catastrophe in the making.",

      "sentences": "Well, I think if you look as well at what Netanyahu has said, the core key goals are to get the hostages release and to completely eliminate Hamas. Those goals are fundamentally at odds with each other, when you look at the only time that Israel has really been successful in getting hostages out of Gaza, it has been through negotiations.So if the most important priority is to get those hostages out safely, then that has to be done at the negotiating table. And if the goal is to completely eliminate Hamas, which I would add has been ballyhooed by many military analysts who talk about the fundamental impossibility of really achieving that objective, then it requires a totally different framework to operate within. We'll see whether -- if this, you know, if this sort of offensive or the beginnings of an offensive or whatever, however Israel's choosing two characterize it as a limited surgical counter-terror operation, if that is in fact applying pressure and if it is giving them more leverage at the negotiating table. So far what we see is that these talks continue to flounder. And in the meantime, the hostages remain held and ordinary innocent Gazans continue to die, Jim.",

And what appears to be growing tensions between the allies. Secretary Defense Lloyd Austin has confirmed that the U.S. paused a shipment of bombs to Israel last week amid concerns that they would be used by Israeli forces in the Rafah incursion. The State Department is rushing to finish at the same time, a high-stakes report on whether Israel has violated international humanitarian law in Gaza. They announced it will not meet today's deadline. Kylie Atwood is at the State Department. As you know, Kylie, Biden as long set a major incursion into Rafah would cross a red line effectively for the administration. So tell U.S. about this pause.

So all we know right now is that there is this pause in place. It's significant in such that this is the first time that the Biden administration has moved to put any halt on the U.S. arms that go over to Israel since, of course, the Israel Hamas war has occurred.And there has been a significant amount of pressure from lawmakers and Biden's own party for him to do this. He clearly felt like this was the moment for him to do it. And Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said, earlier today that this is happening, quote, in the context of what of the unfolding events in Rafah. So clearly what the United States is seeing with these early incursions, personal incursions into part of Rafah are already alarming them, so that they have gone ahead with this pause. But what we don't know is exactly if they'll keep the pause, for how long, what Israel needs to do to lift the pause. But they've also said that there are future arms shipments to Israel that they will also be examining so there could be further implications here as well. SCIUTTO: It's a notable step. Kylie Atwood at the State Department. So joining me now to discuss what this all means, former State Department Middle East negotiators, senior fellow now at the Carnegie Endowment, Aaron David Miller. Good to have you on, sir. Especially given your long experience in the Middle East in diplomacy, has the U.S. done something like this before -- stopped an aid shipment in war time to Israel in effect to make a point, to say you're going too far with this operation in Rafah?",

Because I imagine Hamas, it's not going to give up its leveraging. I mean, let's acknowledge, the worst kind of leverage it's human beings held in captivity, many in danger of losing their lives, but Hamas doesn't want to give up all its leverage because it does not want to give Israel the ability to wipe it out, which is Israel's stated goal here.So how do you come to agreement?",

But this isn't a negotiation driven by two parties who believe their vital national interests, Netanyahu's political interests, and for Hamas, it's existential.So, I make your prediction you're either going to see a Rafah and no deal over the hostages or you're going to see a deal over the hostages and no major ground campaign in Rafah, or most likely, Jim, you're going to see no deal in the hostages, and no major ground campaign in Rafah, and would be this beat for hostages, families in Gaza, sadly, it's going to go on.",

We know there have been deep divisions in the State Department over this? How does this end? What do you think happens here and what will the impact be? I mean, it may be that the administration is trying to preempt this by slow-walking or pausing these high payload munitions deliveries that Secretary Austin referred to as is the way of trying to signal and preempt congressional pressure as the Israelis -- excuse me -- as the Americans faced the real possibility of actually certified that the assurances that the Israelis have provided are both reliable, incredible. If I had to bet, I think that's probably in the middle of a hostage negotiation, trying to get the Israelis do not to go into Rafah, not sure that he administration is going to certify that the Israeli assurances are not credible, and not reliable.

Some people are still thinking about the $1,500 check they got from Trump.And some recent polling put some data behind that. A Quinnipiac poll that was just released earlier today, showed that Biden edged Trump narrowly overall in this stayed and that sort of goes against some of the recent April polling that showed there's no clear leader in the state. But when you drill down to the economic issues, the disparity becomes fairly wide with Trump in the lead 52 to 44, bigger than the poll's margin of error. Now to that end, advisors and donors have urged the president, the White House the campaign, to try to tack more to the center to appeal to the moderate independent voters in states like Wisconsin and elsewhere and the sort of critical blue wall for Biden and the White House says that their individual policies poll well, and they're going to stay the course -- Jim.",

From this 61 really to Ukraine's military equipment will come $28 billion, it's to Ukraine, and also part of this will come up to 2029. Military budget of Russian Federation is $113 billion per year.So, as you see, we don't have any advantage here, quite opposite. So with these, it's more about stabilizing. It's more about winning the time, but not winning the war. So we need more support and we hope other countries will follow U.S. example and also we hope that United States will continue to be with us and will continue to provide U.S. with what is needed to protect and to restore international law.",
