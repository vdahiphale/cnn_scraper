      "sentences": "Welcome back to CNN THIS MORNING.China's new foreign minister has issued quite a stern rebuke overnight of U.S. policies as tensions between the two largest economies in the world continue to soar. He says, quote, conflict and confrontation is inevitable if Washington does not change course. He also warned that there would be, quote, catastrophic consequences if things don't change. He defended Beijing's close partnership with Moscow. Let's go to Marc Stewart, live in Tokyo, with more. What I think is so interesting about him, Marc, is that this guy is a very accomplished, sort of longstanding diplomat. So, he knows the weight of his words. And the fact that he said, if the United States doesn't hit the brakes but continues to speed down the wrong path, no amount of guardrails can prevent derailing. What does that mean?",

And first of all, he's accusing the U.S. of trying to create NATO-style alliance in Asia, going on to warn that if things persist, that there could be a Ukraine-like crisis, again, under this backdrop of Asia.But that quote you pointed out, it's worth repeating because it is so focused and so targeted to the U.S., saying, if the U.S. does not hit the brakes but continues to speed down the wrong path, no amount of guardrails can prevent derailing, and there will surely be conflict and confrontation. These are really strong words. Also interesting to note today, Poppy, he also made reference once again to the U.S. shootdown of that suspected spy balloon, again suggesting it was an overreaction.",

What did you take from that? STEWARTreference, to make this comparison to Taiwan, he did so. But yet the U.S. has remained steadfast, saying that Taiwan is a sovereign nation and that it has a right to defend itself. We also heard language from the government today saying that Taiwan is very much part of our territory and that we have the right to reunite it.
