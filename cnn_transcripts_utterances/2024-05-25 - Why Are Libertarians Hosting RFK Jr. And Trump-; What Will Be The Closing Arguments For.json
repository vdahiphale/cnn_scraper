Thank you for joining me this Memorial Day weekend.In an unusual move, tonight former President Donald Trump will address the Libertarian National Convention in Washington D.C. And Independent RFK Jr. spoke there on Friday after having flirted with running as a Libertarian earlier in the cycle. This morning the Drudge Report leading with his appearance saying \"RFK Jr. slams locked down standing-o from Libertarians.\" He spent a lot of his hour long speech criticizing both President Trump and Biden. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR., (I) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: President Trump said that he was going to run America like a business. He closed down 3.3 million businesses with no due process, no just compensation in violation of the Fifth Amendment. With lock downs, the mass mandates the travel restrictions, President Trump presided over the greatest restriction on individual liberties this country has ever known. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Still, it's the DNC that attacked RFK Jr. speech first saying, quote, much like his campaign for president, RFK Jr. speech today was a bizarre and poorly received exercise in narcissism. There's no support for RFK Jr. and he has no path to victory. He's just a spoiler for Donald Trump.\"Kennedy's running mate, Nicole Shanahan, speaking on Sunday, she tweeted that her topic will be, quote, \"Medical freedom and protecting American farmers from government corporate capture.\" You could say this is a win for the party to get both a former president and the leading independent to address them trying to win their votes, but is either of them really a Libertarian. On the Libertarian side, Trump did back tax cuts, he spoke critically of America's involvements abroad. On the other hand, he signed off on massive budget deficits, imposed tariffs on imported goods and championed more restrictive immigration policies. And while RFK Jr. appeals to many Libertarians, thanks to his activism against vaccine mandates following COVID-19. On the other hand, his history of Energy and Climate activism runs counter to the Libertarian ethos of limited government. He also was supported Israel student loan debt forgiveness and affirmative action. In five election cycles, the Libertarian Party has successfully appeared on the ballot in all 50 states including in both 2016 and 2020, ballot access remains a high hurdle for RFK Jr. In 2016 the party won its highest historical result, with former governors Gary Johnson and Bill Weld coming in third with 3.3 percent of the national vote, but in four states that Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton by less than Johnson's total number of votes being Florida, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan. In 2020, the Libertarian ticket of Clemson Professor Jo Jorgensen, and entrepreneurs Spike Cohen won just a third as much as Johnson-Weld 1.1 percent of the vote. But given the closeness of the polls between Biden and Trump, the Libertarian ticket could have a huge impact on this election. Also appearing during this weekend former GOP candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, the keynote speech will be delivered by a Libertarian stalwart Ron Paul. The top five vote gathered in a straw poll early in the convention are people whose names are not familiar to the general public. According to Gallup, voters who identify as Libertarians range from 17 percent to 23 percent of the American electorate. So, why is the party ceding the spotlight to Trump and RFK Jr., instead of elevating candidates of its own? Joining me now is Nick Gillespie. He's the editor at large at Reason, the Libertarian magazine. He's the podcast host of \"The Reason Interview with Nick Gillespie.\" Nick, great to see you again. Is it conceivable that RFK Jr. or Donald Trump could be the Libertarian candidate? And if not, then why are the Libertarians being so hospitable? NICK GILLESPIE, EDITOR AT LARGE, REASON MAGAZINE/HOST, \"THE REASON INTERVIEW WITH NICK GILLESPIE\": Well, it is conceivable and the head of the party Angela McArdle, as recently as yesterday told News Nation that, you know, if anything is possible, it seems highly unlikely given the fact that RFK Jr. has said he doesn't need the Libertarian Party for ballot access. And Donald Trump is not the type of person who's going to share the spotlight.",

The Libertarian Party is unlikely, according to my Reason colleague, Brian Doherty, is unlikely to reach 50 state ballot access this time around, but it's going to be in something like 47, 46, 48 states. So that's a huge win.The other question though, is whether or not the Libertarian party faithful, the delegates there will actually vote for somebody like Kennedy. And that goes to your, you know, your larger point, why is the Libertarian Party doing this? Two years ago, the party was taken over by a faction, you know, that was very successful in organizing and arguing against the status quo saying we need -- we, the Libertarian Party needs a tighter, more anti-status message, we need to be focusing on ending wars, ending the Fed, ending COVID, lock downs and restrictions. The group that took over called the Mises Caucus has seen basically revenues from over a two year period declined by a third membership, declined from, you know, sustaining active membership from 16,000 to about 12,000. This is a party that is declining. And I think what they're doing here it's kind of a Hail Mary pass to see if they can get back into the public consciousness. They were expecting to have a couple of higher profile people running for president, that hasn't worked out. So we're left with this unprecedented media circus where, you know, the third largest party in the country is bringing in people from other parties to make a pitch to their delegates.",

With the defense resting this past Tuesday, Judge Juan Merchan set closing arguments for next Tuesday to ensure the final stages of the trial weren't interrupted by Memorial Day weekend. Let's get a preview of the anticipated closing arguments.Joining me now Ellie Honig, former federal prosecutor and CNN Senior Legal Analyst, and veteran criminal defense attorney William J. Brennan, who served as co-counsel with Michael van der Veen. He represented -- they represented the Trump Payroll Corporation in a 2022 criminal case in front of Judge Merchan in the exact same courtroom. OK, gentlemen, Billy, starting with you, as a purely academic exercise, a little role playing, give me 60 seconds that you think would work as part of the Trump defense closing argument. WILLIAM J. BRENNAN, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Good morning, Michael. Good morning, Elie. I think what would work in 60 seconds or less is members of the jury where I remind you when Judge Merchan will (inaudible) instruct you that the defendant remains presumed innocent. That the state always has the burden of proving its case beyond a reasonable doubt. And they haven't done so in this matter. The state has decided to rest its entire case on the word of Michael Cohen, a convicted perjurer, a liar, a thief, a man who stole from his own client, the defendant sitting in that chair there. Judge Merchan will instruct you that if you believe Mr. Cohen lied in one matter, you may, if you so choose, believe he lies in all matters. And ladies and gentlemen, I was thinking about this case recently, and I thought about a little pond that would take my daughter to when she was little a little ice pond, and it'd be a sign when the ice was weak, no skating today. And I took her there one day and there were bubbles under the ice. But I want you to put yourself in my position, picture you were there with your child and you heard a voice from the island in the middle of the pond, come on over the ice is fine. I got here, she can get here too, and it was Michael Cohen. Would you put your daughter on that bubbly thin ice? Of course not. And ladies and gentlemen, that's reasonable doubt and that's not guilty.",

Members of the jury, the defense wants your focus everywhere but where it ought to be on the actual defendant, in this case, Donald John Trump, they want to make the argument here all about Michael Cohen. Let me tell you something about Michael Cohen. He's not a saint.He's a sinner. He told you that. He's done plenty of wrong in his life, most of it for Donald Trump. But what Michael Cohen did is he took you inside a corrupt organization, Donald Trump's campaign, Donald Trump's businesses. And you know what, Michael Cohen's not even the star witness in this case, the star witness in this case are the documents. They're the financial documents, the checks that Donald Trump sign, the ledgers, the invoices, the handwritten notes that showed how they put this whole scheme together, the phone records, the texts, the e- mails. All Michael Cohen is here to do is to walk you through that tangible evidence. So, if you're ever at that frozen lake that Mr. Brennan references, it's not quite the right analogy. It's what if Michael Cohen was telling you on the other side, it's safe to come across and then you look and you saw 30 other people much bigger than you and your daughter walking safely across that ice, then would you trust him? That's the real question here, folks. If you keep your eye on the ball on Donald Trump on falsification of business records, then you will find him guilty.",

And it looks like the way that the judge is going to instruct the jury, you have to follow me here, you almost need a visual to map this out. And I mean, this, by the way, is a criticism of the charging theory. The theory is Donald Trump falsified business records in order to violate some other law. The some other law is New York state law that says you cannot corruptly try to influence an election, which then incorporates three other laws, one of which is federal election law, the other of which is tax, which we've heard next to nothing about in this case.And the other, get ready for this, is falsifying other business records. It's like a circular contraption. So, I think what the judge is going to do here is give a very basic, maybe couple paragraph instruction on what federal election campaign law is and is not, but volumes have been written about this, there's so much gray area. And to me, this is a real risk that the prosecution faces maybe down the line in an appeal setting, because the theory is so untested.",

But I think if you pose your question to the prosecutors, how were they supposed to log these legal on their own hush money payments?I think the answer you'd hear from the prosecutors is, one, not our problem. And two, not like this. The prosecutors, I think, would say you can't falsely claim their legal fees when they're not. But there's a real problem here, Michael, I mean, one of the fundamental bases of our due process here in the United States is that citizens have a right to know with specificity in advance what is a crime and what is not a crime.

Global population is not going to shrink fast enough to address our immediate climate challenges.
