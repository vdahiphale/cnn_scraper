They say, they've killed dozens of terrorists who were barricaded in tunnels and buildings. But what is this mean for the more than 230 people believed to be held hostage by Hamas?Plus, hunting for Jews? A mob at a Russian airport storms the tarmac searching for Israelis on a flight arriving from Tel Aviv. This as antisemitic incidents surge globally and right here in the United States. And then there were eight. Mike Pence is out of the 2024 race as a new poll shows Trump more than doubling the support of his nearest rival in Iowa. Nikki Haley is gaining ground, but can she or anyone else catch up? I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. We begin with Israel's war against Hamas terrorists. A new round of airstrikes lighting up the sky in Gaza as the IDF says it's stepping up operations on the ground and sending more troops in. CNN's Nic Robertson is live in Sderot. Nic, what's the latest on the ground there?",

      "sentences": "Yes. The IDF says it's increasing its activity in Gaza itself. We've seen troops actually on the ground in Gaza city, the biggest city in the north of Gaza Strip, the most -- one of the most densely populated areas. Last night, we were aware that the troops, IDF troops were had at least established a base head on the coastline. And we're relatively speaking outside of densely populated civilian areas that has changed today.The IDF has been dropping flyers over Gaza, telling people there that they are now in a battlefield that they need to move south, out of the northern Gaza area, out of the central Gaza area and go to a humanitarian zone in the south. Even one Al Jazeera journalist said, her husband at their home in Gaza city received a phone call that was from the ADF telling them that they needed to leave. So, this does seem to be an extensive effort to warn the population that there are troops on the ground, that they are coming that the area is no longer safe. But much more military activity and the way the IDF is fighting on the ground, they say the troops are identifying where the terrorists are and then they're bringing in airstrikes on those locations. Now we've heard those airstrikes through the day, we've been hearing and can hear now the fighter jets in the sky. You can see the contrails earlier on. The jets literally flying big lazy loops just outside of Gaza, waiting for those calls from the troops on the ground to target a specific location and that's the way the battle is moving now. Dana?",

Because you have watched as security officials and intelligence officials, high ranking officials inside the Israeli government have all turned by turn taking responsibility for the massive intelligence failure that happened before that October 7 attack. And yet the Israeli prime minister has not taken any responsibility. And instead, what he did over the weekend, is cast blame on that intelligence community, writing in a tweet, \"at no point was a warning given to Prime Minister Netanyahu on Hamas's intention to start a war. On the contrary, all the defense officials, including the heads of the intelligence directorate and the Shin Bet, assess that Hamas was deterred.\"Now, the Israeli prime minister actually deleted that tweet nine hours later, and issued a rare apology saying that he was wrong for that tweet and asserting that he stands behind the security and intelligence apparatus here in Israel. All of that, of course, as this ground invasion advanced, as you can see behind me, Dana, these flares that are going up as Israeli troops continue to operate, even in the dark on this fourth day of this expanded ground operation.

And now we want to go to a terrifying scene that forced a Russian airport to shut down.(PLAYING VIDEO) What you're looking at is a mob that broken and charged the tarmac after a flight from Tel Aviv had just arrived. Some have characterized this as a protest. But to be clear, this was not an antiwar protest. This was an antisemitic hunt for Jews. Videos verified by CNN show them holding signs that read, we are against Jewish refugees, and there was no place for child killers and Dagestan. CNN's Fred Pleitgen is live in Berlin. Fred, what are you learning about this incident, this horrifying incident that played out?",

      "sentences": "Hi, there, Dana. I think first of all, I think you're absolutely right. I think what that crowd was doing was on the face of it at the beginning, at least protesting, but it did then turn into essentially, then trying to hunt down Jews inside that airport on the tarmac and outside of that airport as well.And I think it really was a multifaceted thing, which really looks quite chilling. When you see some of the video that was out there. You're absolutely right, that there was a flight that came in from Tel Aviv into the capital of the Dagestan region of Russia, which is a Muslim majority region in the country. And as that plane was landing, was when these protesters started, and they forced their way onto the tarmac and actually made it all the way to that plane. And I was looking at some of the videos that came out of them were some of the handlers there, some of the passengers had already left. But the crowd then moved on to other planes, forcing the passengers of those planes back onto those aircraft. Now, some of the other scenes that we witnessed there as well, certainly extremely troubling because you could see then some of these groups of protesters in circling, some of the folks who apparently were passengers on that flight from Tel Aviv and checking whether or not these people were Jews. There was one specific incident with a man who said that he was Uzbek but couldn't speak Uzbek language because obviously he's been living in Russia for a very long time. And they accused him of lying and demanded to see his passport and in the end wanted to check the man's phone as well. There was also a bus that was stopped. There were some terrified families inside of who were saying that they simply wanted to get medical attention to some of the children who were on that bus as well. So certainly, some pretty troubling scenes and it did seem as though the Russian authorities on the ground, Dana, were quite surprised that this was going on and it took them helicoptering in police units to disperse the crowd, definitely an incident that certainly is causing a lot of concern. I just really want to point out real quickly that the Kremlin was asked about this incident earlier today, and they blamed the incitement as they put it on external interference of the Kremlin said, Dana.",

And I don't know if you've seen, if you've broadcasted Hamas distributed a video just a few hours ago, of three hostages in a really blatant breach of humanitarian law, you know, basic human decency.And so of course, there is a concern, and we are utilizing all of our abilities in just to bring them home, and they need to be released, they need to be released now.

And that is something that they have done and they're doing as we speak.Having said that, knowing that that is their manipulative strategy. How truly targeted can you be and are you going to be as the Israeli forces move in and trying to avoid civilians? I recognize this as difficult.

They are holding 239 Israelis and foreign nationals hostage. They're also holding 2 million Palestinians hostage. So, our role is to try and differentiate to distinguish between those, but we are going to destroy and dismantle Hamas. Nevertheless, we have to do our best. We've designated the humanitarian zone down in south Gaza. We distributed again, today calling on people to go towards the south and to go towards the areas, the Mawasi area, which is a safe zone, a humanitarian zone where goods will be supplied. And indeed, it is a huge challenge. And every, every life lost in this war is a result of Hamas's aggression against Israel. This is where (inaudible) when we see the images of the three hostages early released by Hamas today, this is a stark reminder why we are here and what needs to change, and the paradigm needs to change.

At Cornell University images like this one surfaced on campus, but it was much worse, targeting not just Israel, but Jewish students, blatant raw antisemitism, online threats, including calls to shoot Jewish students and threats to the Cornell kosher dining hall.Authorities are investigating and warning students to stay away from a building that specifically was named in those threats, which houses that kosher dining hall. In a statement, the school's president says in part. This incident highlights the need to combat the forces that are dividing us and driving us toward hate. This cannot be what defines us at Cornell. And this is just one example of countless incidents at college campuses that have made Jewish students downright scared. Joining me now to discuss this is Jonathan Greenblatt, the CEO and national director of the Anti-Defamation League. Jonathan, there's antiwar, there's anti-Israel and there is antisemitism. Your organization, the ADL says that incidents like I just described to Cornell have increased 388 percent just in the last month since the October 7 attack in Israel. What are you seeing? JONATHAN GREENBLATT, CEO &amp; NATIONAL DIRECTOR, ANTI-DEFAMATION LEAGUE: Yes. Well, Dana, thanks for covering this. And I also want to just thank you for the prior segment. When you clarify on the air something that the BBC and these other networks can't get right. What happened in Dagestan was not a protest, it was a would-be pogrom. These are not people complaining about policy, these are people looking to find and kill Jews. And that clarity of language has never mattered more. Now, in terms of the context here in the United States, the ADL, indeed tracks antisemitic incidents. And let's keep in mind that prior to October 7, we had already seen the highest number of anti-Jewish acts in America, that the ADL had ever tracked in the last, you know, 45 years. So, prior to October 7, it was already terribly frightening. And then as you said, we've seen hundreds and hundreds of horrible acts of harassment, vandalism and violence in just the last three weeks, this almost 400 percent increase. And let me actually put the data to explain it a little bit and in even deeper relief. So, we saw it right here in Washington, D.C. last week, letters projected -- words projected onto the library, Glory to the martyrs, celebrating the individuals who were murdered and massacred Israeli civilians at Tulane in New Orleans, Jewish students were assaulted.",

This is literally antisemitism right. And you know, already Jews are the most targeted religious minority in the country by a wide margin.

And to think that extremism only comes from one side of the spectrum is a joke.So, when I used to say that heart, that the antisemitism from the left, Dana, was like climate change, getting worse and worse, and it could create the conditions in which storms can happen. This is that category five hurricane. When Jewish people are being told to avoid kosher dining halls because other students want to, \"slit their throat.\" Look, Dana, this is a moment of accountability, not just for universities, which by the way, are failing the test. This is a moment of accountability for America. No one should think that it is permissible because you don't like policies in the middle east to threaten violence and incite hate against your Jewish neighbors, your Jewish friends, your Jewish classmates. I have got to say, this is a moment -- this is not a moment just for Jews. This is a moment for everyone in America to say timeout, this is totally wrong. And I think, you know, I'm meeting with the secretary of education in a few minutes. I'm glad what President Biden has said.
