Also, a provocative Op-Ed declares Elon Musk as a security risk. Its author, one of the most respected retired military leaders in America, he is here, live. And President-elect Trump endorses Mike Johnson to be reelected Speaker of the House. But will it be enough to stave off a right-wing revolt? I'm Pamela Brown, in for Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Well tonight, the nation remembers a legacy that, much like Jimmy Carter himself, refused to be bound by expectations. Plans for his funeral, like the man himself, both down home and presidential. Services will begin, where his story did, at the family farm in Plains, Georgia. Saturday, a motorcade will carry his body past the homestead, pausing as the historic farm bell rings 39 times. He'll then stop in Atlanta with services at the Carter Presidential Center, before moving on to Washington, D.C. His body will lie in state at the Capitol, beginning Tuesday, January 7th, until a state funeral on January 9th. While next Thursday will officially be a national day of mourning. The core of President Carter's life was dedicated to looking forward. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JIMMY CARTER, 39TH U.S. PRESIDENT: There's a fear that our best years are behind us.

The Trump endorsement is big. It shows faith and support behind Speaker Johnson, which is going to be critical, going into this, what's going to be the whip count for the next few days, of calling Members, seeing what their concerns are, and shoring up so that they get to the floor vote, and the Speaker's elected very comfortably. With that said, the question now really is, how much political capital will, or -- will Donald Trump be willing to spend, or will he have to spend any at all to call members himself, to get his team calling Susie Wiles, and other people, to see where the holdouts are, and how they get Johnson across the finish line.

I don't know if that's necessarily a good thing for Democrats, because dissent is good. It can help strengthen a party. But besides that point, these are conversations Republicans have had since before McCarthy. If you go back to Paul Ryan, how much power does the speaker have? And that certainly changed coming into the Kevin McCarthy era. And so, you've seen where they've had to cede more power in order to become speaker. That's the question now is, where is the threshold going to be, to call for a motion to vacate the chair for the speaker? If it's one member and one member only, good lord, that's a lot of power, and can certainly cause chaos. And I think this is what House Republicans would be helpful to remember, is how much chaos there was, in the early parts of trying to get that McCarthy speaker vote, and get through that final stretch there. These are the early days, those first 100 days, this is about as honeymoon as you're going to get for Donald Trump, if you can even call it a honeymoon, sometimes, with the way that things get covered going into his administration. So, they need to be unified, to be able to get things done, like immigration reform, which is so huge, like economic reform, which the American people were begging for, coming out of this election, like tax reform, which we know will be up this year.

A South Korean court has approved an arrest warrant for that country's impeached president, Yoon.It comes just weeks after he briefly declared martial law, and sent the crucial American ally into a near constitutional crisis. He accused the main opposition party of paralyzing government and sympathizing with North Korea. Yoon is now facing a criminal investigation into abuse of authority and orchestrating a rebellion. And now, there is an arrest warrant out for him. Wow. Also in South Korea, investigators are digging for clues, as to what caused a commercial passenger jet to crash-land, Sunday, at an airport, killing 179 people on board. There were only two survivors, crew members, in the tail section. Officials say the pilot declared Mayday three times, and reported a bird strike, before making an emergency landing. And video appears to show the airplane's landing gear not fully deploying before hitting the tarmac. This is all complexing, aviation analysts. The Boeing 737-800 then was seen skidding on the runway, at a very high speed, and then slamming into an embankment and bursting into flames. And it's still a mystery as to why this happened, and what transpired in the cockpit, between the pilot's emergency message and the crash. A lot went wrong here. So, joining us now to help us maybe better-understand what happened is Greg Feith, the former Senior Investigator for the National Transportation Safety Board. And Miles O'Brien, CNN Aviation Analyst. It seems like aviation analysts are looking at this, and scratching their heads, because, on one hand, there was a possible bird strike. But how does that explain the other issues? Miles, first to you. MILES O'BRIEN, CNN AVIATION ANALYST, SCIENCE CORRESPONDENT, PBS NEWSHOUR: Yes, Pamela, it has taken a little while for everybody to sort of sort this one through. But I think if you come to the conclusion that first of all, the bird strike did not make it impossible for the crew to deploy the landing gear. That shouldn't have happened. There are many layers of redundancy to get the landing gear down. And then, you consider the possibility that if there was a bird strike, at least one engine had failed. Is it possible the second engine was not providing enough power? Now, if that were the case, then it would be advantageous for a crew, to consider flying the aircraft without landing gear deployed, or the flaps, because that would actually reduce the amount of distance it could fly as a glider. So, if there were a scenario, where they lost complete power, this would be what the pilot would want to do, is to try to approach the runway. The term we call is clean, meaning no flaps, no landing gear, to get as much distance as possible to the runway.",

As Miles said, of course, the big question is, what started this whole action?We know the aircraft was on approach to runway one. We know that the crew was advised of birds. Shortly thereafter, the crew advised that they had struck birds, and declared a Mayday. Declaring a Mayday after striking birds, suggest that there was something catastrophic, or at least very detrimental, that occurred. Just hitting birds, pilots will exclaim that, or at least tell ATC, Yes, we just hit birds or whatever, kind of like \"Miracle on the Hudson.\" But there was a sense of urgency here, and that's the big part is what necessitated this crew to believe that they needed to get the aircraft back on the ground by doing a go -- what's called a go- around. So they abort the landing to runway one, did a teardrop, and came back to try and land on 19. Was there some sort of issue with the aircraft based on that bird strike? There was a passenger, who apparently texted a message saying, We just hit birds, they're stuck in the wing. And that kind of thing. So, is there damage? Two, did a bird come through the window? Because there are large migratory birds in that area. So, did you incapacitate a flight crew member? So now you have one pilot, trying to do a lot of things and get the airplane on the ground. Three, did they get caught up in the moment, trying to get the airplane on the ground, and did not complete the checklist? Because, again, as Miles knows, on the approach, that airplane would have been configured for not only the landing gear down, the flaps down. But then on the go-around, you would, of course, retract the landing gear. But there would have been no reason to retract the flaps and the slats, which are good slow-speed devices. And that aircraft landed at a very high rate of speed.",

So Elie, is there any chance the Supreme Court takes this case? ELIE HONIG, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST, FORMER ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NY: No, Pam. No chance at all. And here's why. First of all, the Supreme Court only takes a very small percentage of all cases brought to it, usually under 5 percent. And the mere fact that a case has the name, Donald Trump, attached, does not necessarily make it Supreme Court-worthy. What they're looking for is a major constitutional issue, or some sort of issue where the courts are split around the country. But this is just really a garden variety civil case. The plaintiff, E. Jean Carroll, sued the defendant, Donald Trump. The jury found for the plaintiff. Donald Trump appealed. The appeals court said no. And that's that. This case, this part of the case, is over.

I don't think the appeals court's going to throw that verdict out, and completely get rid of the case. But it wouldn't shock me at all if the Court of Appeals does reduce that $83 million amount. It's kind of hard to justify why the first case, which involved actual sexual assault and defamation would be worth $5 million, and the second case which is only defamation would be worth 16 times that, $83 million. So, wouldn't shock me to see that number come down on appeal.",

DOJ has long had a policy that they will not prosecute the sitting president. You also have immunity, very broadly, according to the Supreme Court. But most of that does not apply civilly.And both of these lawsuits, involving E. Jean Carroll, the New York State Attorney General's civil lawsuit, all of those can carry on unchanged, untouched, even after Donald Trump takes the oath of office on January 20th. So, these civil cases, unlike the criminal cases, are mostly going to carry on.",

Jack Smith has now dismissed that case, because Donald Trump is about to become the sitting president. And as I just said, DOJ has long had a policy, We're not going to prosecute the sitting president. But there's two other guys, Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira, both of whom were Mar-a-Lago employees, co-conspirators. Neither of them is going to become president. So those cases can carry on. So, what Jack Smith has done here is transfer those cases over to normal federal prosecutors, the U.S. Attorney's Office, not Special Counsel.So theoretically, Pam, those criminal prosecutions can carry on. But it would not shock me, whatsoever, if Donald Trump very quickly pardons both them, as soon as he takes office. [22:00:00]",
