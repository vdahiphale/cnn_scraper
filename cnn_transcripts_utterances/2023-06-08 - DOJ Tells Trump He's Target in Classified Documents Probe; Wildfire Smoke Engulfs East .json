Because they are the site of two federal grand juries where we have seen activity over the last several months.The Justice Department has officially notified Donald Trump's legal team that he is the target in the ongoing federal investigation. This is the clearest sign yet that former President Trump could be indicted and possibly soon. This is all in connection with failing to turn over classified documents. Federal investigators searched the former president's Mar-a-Lago last August. Now, Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. He says the classified documents that he declassified them while he was still in office, though we should note there is no corroborating evidence that we have seen to that effect. Let's get right to Senior Justice Correspondent Evan Perez watching these courthouses along with the rest of us. Evan, why are we on such high alert and what is it that could happen soon?",

And so what this means is that it is not just people around him, people who may have been moving the boxes, people who may have signed documents or lied to prosecutors or the FBI about these documents, about the fact that these documents were held at Mar-a-Lago. This is squarely on the president, the former president of the United States.And it is a moment really that we have not faced before. A former president has never been in this position. And so here we are. We are watching the grand juries both in Miami and Washington where we know that there have been witnesses in recent days who have been talking to the prosecutors, talking to the grand jury. And, really, the question is, you know, does the Justice Department go ahead with these charges against the former president, against anybody else? There is, of course, always a chance that Merrick Garland, the attorney general, could step in and tell Jack Smith, the special counsel, that he cannot proceed. Nothing indicates that that is where we are, John.",

An indictment, a federal indictment, would be even more so.Evan, we've been watching these two courthouses, one in Miami, one in Washington, D.C. What are the mechanics?

We do know that, certainly, we have looked at the law of the charges that the Justice Department has said in court documents they're investigating the former president for. One of them, 793 is statute called the Espionage Act. It is -- if you talk to legal experts, it is possible that because the former president left Washington hours before the new president, Joe Biden, took office, it is possible that the best place to bring a charge like that is in Miami.There are other statutes that are under consideration or under investigation, John, that would possibly be more appropriate to be brought here in Washington, which is where the documents came from before Trump went down to Mar-a-Lago. The mechanics of this is that after the grand jury returns an indictment, if it does, then the former president would be notified and the arrangements would be made for the Secret Service to bring him to whichever courthouse he has to present himself to hear those charges for the first time. Again, there's a lot of steps between now and then, right, that Merrick Garland could always step in and to try to tell Jack Smith that he cannot bring these charges. The other thing that -- John, the meaningful thing about this letter, this target letter, is that the former president still has time. He can to tell Jack Smith and the special counsel that he wants come in and provide evidence to grand jury himself. We do not anticipate that that is going to happen, John.",

And there was an additional witness expected after that man testified, Taylor Budowich. But it's a secret proceeding of the grand jury, and so we don't know if there are any more witnesses.But, Sara, when you look back at this investigation, what has been happening in this federal courthouse in Miami, as well as the federal courthouse in Washington, D.C., the Justice Department has left, it appears, no stone unturned. There are so many people here that could be witnesses. And I was going through the list of ones that we have confirmed, have testified, and the list is quite long. It is nearly everyone that you can think of. It is Trump's defense attorney, Evan Corcoran. It is other attorneys working for him who were managing the documents or who were the custodians for his records. It's Mark Meadows, his former White House chief of staff. It is other aides who were handling records or knew about records. It is people that worked for him at Mar-a-Lago within the Trump Organization, handling security footage, moving boxes. Every single person that we can think of in this investigation, we believe, has been subpoenaed, with many of them having been confirmed, going before that grand jury. And the question for all of them is what Donald Trump knew and when? That is what builds this case. It is the type of information that unfurls after and before that search of Mar-a-Lago that the FBI did in August of 2022, where they went into his office on the search warrant affidavit the office, 45 Office. That is Donald Trump's office after the presidency. That is where they searched. That is where they found boxes of classified records. They also searched in storage rooms at a time when the Justice Department, the National Archives, the federal government made no mistake. To be very clear with Donald Trump, you need to turn over everything. And even into the end of last year, there were still documents that were being found at Mar-a-Lago and in other Trump properties. And so all of this appears that it could be coming together, culminating in that target letter or that target indication that was being given to Donald Trump's team from the Justice Department, and now we just wait to see who else could they possibly bring.

But I think that if Trump was a different person, if he had a different mentality and his legal team had a different approach to this, they could come to Jack Smith and try to come up with a very unique or original proposition regarding, hey, we're going to agree not to run for office. We're going to agree to do X, Y and Z in exchange for some sort of plea to some count. That would be much less serious.And we have seen, for example, with General Petraeus and others who were high ranking government officials, that when there is an acceptance of responsibility and a plea to something, the government is willing to resolve those cases on favorable terms.

I don't think that's going to have any legal weight. But as to the first piece, he's right. It has to be national defense information. And it's fair to say that the Espionage Act was created before our modern classification system. But I think Jack Smith would not be considering an indictment if the materials here did not involve national defense information. And I would expect that, in fact, that they did involve national defense information.So, I have to say, I don't think that's where ultimately the defense is going to lie here. Like you had mentioned earlier that potential declassification defense, Smith is clearly very focused on rebutting that given some of the witnesses he's brought in. I think that's more likely where a defense is going to go. And, realistically, the challenge for Trump and what the Trump team has to focus on is what former Attorney General Bill Barr talked about the jerking around of the Justice Department, the various ways in which he refused to produce the documents and the potential obstruction of justice.",

The night and this morning probably has been the worst in Philadelphia so far. But the best way to illustrate is just to look behind me.We're in Camden right now looking across the Delaware River at Philadelphia. You can see the Franklin Bridge. But this is normally the Philadelphia skyline right here. You should normally be able to see city hall, the Comcast building, Liberty Place, but, barely, you can make it out just across the Delaware River right now. Like we said, still hazardous. The city of Philadelphia, they say that they're not paying as much attention at the moment to the actual coded color. They're just saying, still, stay away from the outdoors if you can help it. Wear your mask if you're outside. And then close your doors and windows. I know I have been closing my doors and windows at my house just trying to keep all of that smoky smell away. Philadelphia School District meanwhile, they recommended that students wear masks on their commute back and forth to school. But they and the city, they're hoping that some of this clears up by the afternoon. We actually happened to be in Harrisburg yesterday, speaking with Governor Josh Shapiro, governor of Pennsylvania, and he gave us his thoughts on this smoke that's been filling, in his words, all 67 counties. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. JOSH SHAPIRO (D-PA):  We want to encourage people just to be safe. I'll give you a pretty simple example. I was getting ready to go out for a run this morning rather than going outside and doing that. And I don't have asthma or any other issues like that. I worked out in the house. So, I just want to kind of encourage people to be vigilant. If you do you have acute health issues, be really mindful of your time outside, and, hopefully, this will pass very soon.

And these heat domes that are parking way up in the northern latitudes in Canada, right above us, are just desiccating those boreal forests, those pine cones are turning into fuel at a staggering rate. And so it's burned 15 times the average so far this year and we haven't even started summer. So we now have to sort of get used to this.The U.N. predicts that at the current rates, we'll see wildfires like this increase 14 percent by 2030, 30 percent by 2050. And those are nebulous numbers that don't really sink in the way realization that fires 500 miles away are determining whether or not your kid can play outside today. And we have to brace perhaps for a future where that's more of a reality, especially on the East Coast. You think about at least the mindset among my neighbors this is so bizarre because they think that wildfire and drought and that sort of thing is the price of living out west. But with Canada happening, will it be this bad regularly? That is up to the winds. This was an abnormal event. But this is another staggering statistic, Sara, that I came across. 60 percent of the wildfire smoke breathed in America today comes from another state, comes from trees burning way far away. So, there's no real escaping it, the way we think about it. But you can look at lessons from over in Asia, where India has the kind of air we saw yesterday every day. As a result, their life spans are nine years shorter in some places over there, Beijing had index numbers above 700 at one point, which really woke up the government there, and they had a deliberate de-smog program, and now they were having record clean air in Beijing maybe 15 years later. So, we're now coming to grips with wildfire smoke in the east as part of our new normal luring about the hazards it causes. It can be ten times more harmful than the pollution coming out of your tailpipe, for example. So, this may be a wakeup call, and hopefully we learn the safest lessons from it.",

The Supreme Court ruling in a 5-4 ruling just moments ago that the state of Alabama must redraw its congressional maps.Now, this was a case where black voters had challenged the congressional maps that were actually in place for the last election in 2022, saying that they only had a majority in one out of seven congressional districts despite the fact that black voters make up 27 percent of the state's population. What's interesting here is that this Supreme Court, a divided Supreme Court with justice Roberts and justice -- Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Kavanaugh siding with the liberals and then four of the conservatives dissenting, they actually ended up siding with the district court. And more than a year ago, the district court had said that these congressional maps should be redrawn. It was then appealed up to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court, though, said, no, we're not going to make them be redrawn for the 2022 congressional elections. So, essentially, a bad map was in place in 2022 where voters maybe were disenfranchised for not having enough representation. The Supreme Court now saying those maps were essentially wrong. State of Alabama, you have to go back and redraw these congressional maps. I mean, this is a very big win for people who may in the future want to challenge voting maps. That's because, over the past several years, the Supreme Court has really gutted many sections of the Voting Rights Act, really depleting the ability of several groups, many groups to challenge different aspects of elections. But in a surprise move from this case this court this morning, they're actually keeping, maintaining that power of minorities to challenge voting maps, other election rules under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. Kate, this is definitely a surprising decision. There were a lot of court watchers sort of holding their breath, thinking that the court would eviscerate Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. But the court here doing just the opposite in a 5-4 decision, handing a big wind to black voters and telling the state of Alabama, you need to redraw your maps to give greater representation for the 27 percent of black voters in your state.

And the court today, the Supreme Court agreeing with that, not dismantling any of Section 2, and saying to Alabama, go back and redraw these maps, because, essentially, they're just not fair.
