And that's going to be really important, because not only do you have to prove that he did it. You have to prove that he was even at the site, because, as you will recall, the weapon, the other items, they were recovered at the crime scene. He was arrested miles away.

If something gets put out there that's prejudicial, if something gets put out there that reveals the prosecution strategy, you put the case at risk.

Interstate 95, as many of you know, goes all the way from South Florida all the way up towards Washington, D.C., and even further north up to New York. And this vehicle that the detainee was in was moving up from Palm Beach County from that golf course up towards 95 north. And we heard the sheriff say maybe he was driving back to where he came from. We know he did have a connection with North Carolina. So maybe he was thinking about heading back up towards North Carolina in the course of those remarks. And we also heard the sheriff correctly express his gratitude to that one eyewitness who spotted this individual at that area at the golf course, spotted this individual, took a picture of him, took a picture of the vehicle, his black Nissan and the license plate number, which was so critical in finding this guy as he was moving up I-95 from Palm Beach County to Martin County. And he thanked this individual, did the right thing. You see something, you say something. And in this particular case, if you're an eyewitness, you do something. You take a picture on your phone.

So they had a description of the vehicle. License plate readers hit on the car. It was traveling northbound. Those officers were on the highway. They spotted the car, and they were able to get enough assistance there. They didn't pull them over right away. They waited until they had sufficient resources there where they could actually pin him in and not get into a high-speed pursuit, which was very smart on their part. So things went well. I mean, it worked about as well as it can work. That's where real-time crime centers really play a critical role, because they're able to go into databases, get more information, push it out to people in the field that need to have it, and so forth.
