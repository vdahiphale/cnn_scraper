They vote yes or no.And what is likely going to happen here is that they will hand down an indictment. And then the suspect in this case, Zapeta-Calil, will be indicted on those charges. As we know, they are prosecuting him on murder in the first degree and the second degree, as well as federal arson charges. So, that's what's likely going to happen today.

He is directing the NYPD to work with ICE to explore the possibility of whether or not Zapeta-Calil should be charged at the federal level. And more than anything, it really signifies and shows this sort of willingness by Mayor Eric Adams to work with federal authorities when it comes to immigration enforcement. So, we'll see what the federal authorities have to say about it. We're waiting to hear back from them. In the meantime, the Brooklyn district attorney, who is prosecuting this case, has said they welcome the help, but they also point out that they are prosecuting him on murder in the first degree. The top charge, if he is convicted, he's facing life in prison without parole. So, that is what we are expecting out of what we believe will be a very short hearing this morning.",

Now, at some point along this journey, if you will, the air - the flight crew realizes that they have someone on board that doesn't have a ticket. And so they, of course, decide to come back to the gate. It's at that point that we're told, for reasons that have yet to be explained, that the passenger was able to get off the plane at the gate before authorities got there. And so authorities arrived at the gate and then had to figure out exactly where this passenger went. We're told that the passenger was eventually taken into custody after being spotted in a bathroom. Now, Delta put out a statement that read, quote, \"as there are no matters more important than safety and security, Delta people followed procedures to have an unticketed passenger removed from the flight and then apprehended.\" The name of this passenger, Sara, has not been released by authorities, though we're told that the passenger was charged with trespassing.",

I think the question is, how exactly does he intend to follow through on some of these threats and these taunts that he's been issuing for the past several days now?Now, I did catch up with one Trump adviser, and they gave me their interpretation of what all of these posts mean when it - as it relates to taking control over the Panama Canal, but also his, you know, revival of his desire to purchase Greenland. Something that I will argue that Greenland's prime minister says that is not for sale. And also these taunts to the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, about trying to, you know, absorb Canada into the United States as its 51st state. All to say, this adviser told me that they believe that this is part of a larger negotiating tactic, that Donald Trump is really trying to kind of begin planting the seeds for. And essentially, he wants to force foreign leaders to the table to have these kinds of negotiations in ways that Donald Trump believes will benefit U.S. trade and give them better prices on certain deals that they have, but also trying to curb both China and Russia's influence. Now, as it relates to all of these calls about him, you know, alluding to wanting to take back control over the Panama Canal. I'm told that really, Donald Trump's overarching goal with those - with that messaging is to try and secure lower rates for American vessels that pass through there and to get lower shipping rates, essentially to boost American companies and what they're paying in some of these deals as they go through the Panama Canal. I will also say that when I talked to this adviser, they said that essentially he believes, Donald Trump, that Chinese companies own a lot of these ports, and that effectively gives them a lot of control over the shipping rates, as well as which vessels are allowed to pass through. As it relates to his calls for Greenland and him reviving that desire again to try and purchase the country, I'm told that Donald Trump believes that that's really his way of trying to curb Russian influence in the arctic region. So again, this is kind of Donald Trump's way of trying to strong arm some of these politicians, kind of assert his dominance, but also see if he can bring them to the table and begin kind of laying that all out, even though he's not in office yet and he still has days to go until he is sworn in on January 20th.",
