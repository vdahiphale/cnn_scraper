It is going to be an interesting couple of days and it might actually only be a couple of daysbecause we could have a Prime Minister as soon as Monday, if there is only one candidate who manages to garner the support of 100 of their fellow Conservative MPs and that is a pretty high bar considering when the leadership contest was held over the summer, there were zero candidates who after the first round had the support of 100 MPs. Obviously, they`ll have to whittle themselves down if MPs or candidates are finding that they can`t actually get enough support. And so behind the scenes, we`ll see a lot of jockeying, a lot of horse trading, a lot of throwing support surely, until someone can get to 100. It actually wasn`t until around two that Rishi Sunak in the leadership contest this summer got to a hundred. It wasn`t until four rounds later that Liz Truss, and then later Penny Mordaunt joined him with at least 100 MPs backing him. And so Liz Truss, it seems, had dug herself quite the hole and right from the get go, from when she became Prime Minister, one that she no matter how hard she tried, no matter what she did, she could not pull herself out of, but now the party is finding themselves at the bottom of that hole, as well. And so you can understand the need for expediency to try to right the ship as quickly as possible. You can also understand the need for expediency given the fact that these country is going through a cost of living crisis and all of the decisions that this government is making is having real impacts on people`s lives. And so people like Penny Mordaunt, people like Rishi Sunak are very likely to be the frontrunners as it goes so far, especially considering that Rishi Sunak, the man who came second in the leadership contest this summer, but had the most support amongst MPs was the one who seemed to correctly predict that Liz Truss` policies would be disastrous for inflation, and it turns out, he was exactly right. So, you have to wonder whether that`ll give him some kind of newfound credibility this time around.",

He had this historic election victory. He had the charisma that many other leaders, particularly his recent predecessor, Theresa May, had lacked. He managed to unite voters that have never been united and knit together before by a Conservative leader. And yet, by a series of unforced errors and hubris, many would say, he kind of threw it all away and that hasn`t changed, but he is the members` favorite according to recent polling.",

That was also legitimate because Liz Truss was not elected by the general population, andyet she was disregarding elements of the Manifesto that had got Boris Johnson elected in 2019. So there was frustration there. The reason why a General Election is not on the cards, unless the Prime Minister decides to call it is because in this country, a parliamentary democracy, people vote for the party, they don`t vote for the Prime Minister on the ballot as such, whereas in America, for example, it`s a presidential democracy, so people are voting for an individual. So it`s within the gift of the majority party inside the House of Commons to change their leader as many times as they want. But in reality, it`s all about who can command the confidence of the House of Commons and get legislation through and naturally a party that`s in such disarray, that they`re changing leaders quite frequently, they may well not be able to do that and then that can leave a General Election and a fresh mandate as the only option left, but the Conservatives know they face electoral annihilation at the moment, so that would be an absolute worst case scenario.",

And they were talking about how to get a grip on the environment. It`s important, even this government has suggested that they`re going to roll back quite a lot of the environmental regulations. And it all came to a head in Parliament last night, over about whether to go ahead with fracking. These are very important things but the notion of being a laughing stock, look, I even asked a former senior Tory MP and former minister, Alan Duncan. He was on my program earlier. He agreed with Sadiq Khan, didn`t like that a Labour leader abroad was saying that, nonetheless agreed and said, we have to get a reasonable and competent government back in place to lead this country. They don`t think there`s going to be a general election, it`s a parliamentary democracy; it works slightly differently. They don`t have to call them election right now. And the hope amongst the Tories is that they can get somebody, who would be viewed as a safe and sure pair of hands to work in tandem with someone who`s already viewed as a safe and sure pair of hands. That`s the chancellor who Liz Truss appointed when she ditched Kwasi Kwarteng, Jeremy Hunt. And they`re hoping that they can spend the next time, the rest of the time they have in office to stabilize this ship. And to an extent, they stabilized some of the financial chaos. But not for the people of this country, who are still facing massive cost of living and this self inflicted wound included raising interest rates. That directly affects people`s ability to buy and to pay off their mortgages. So it`s very hard times for the people of this country.",
