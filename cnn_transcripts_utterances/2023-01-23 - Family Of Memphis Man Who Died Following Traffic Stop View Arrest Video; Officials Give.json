Benjamin Crump who's one of the attorneys for the family, went on to say that the video reminded him of the beating of Rodney King.

They did say that sometime during the video, you actually Tyre Nichols say, what did I do? They did though, make the point that they couldn't really get into the details of what they saw because this is still an active investigation. Not only are the Memphis Police Department investigating, but also the U.S. attorneys as well as the civil rights division for the Department of Justice and the Tennessee bureau of investigation. All of them involved in this.I was on the phone earlier with the district attorney's office asking them, you know, really what's the holdup, guys? Why not release this video? They did say that they wanted the family to see it first, but there is a plan -- it's not a matter of if -- but when this video is made public. They say sometimes perhaps later this week or perhaps next week, is the plan. They are also considering charges against the five officers that have since been fired from this incident. Those officers have been named as Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, Emmitt Martin III, Desmond Mills Jr. and Justin Smith. Those charges, if any, are announced the district attorney's office tells me they would come later this week. But clearly a lot to get through here, and the family still processing what they saw earlier today. Again, that press conference still happening right now -- Alisyn and Victor.",

What's your view of that, how these may play into or against one another, and what you hear from the AG Garland there?HARRY LITMAN, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY: Yes, so, it's a really big and vexing question. I know how it should play, and I know how Garland wants it to play, and he is the boss of the department which is, zero impact. And you can imagine, Victor, the way this should actually, unroll is Smith will provide a recommendation to Garland. Probably Garland will take it. Hur will provide a recommendation to Garland and as my last utility appearance, I was suggesting there's no criminal there, there, and unless we find out more. And probably Garland will take it. They are in separate offices. They are separate people, so I think there's a kind of political sort of cloud that maybe brings them together in the public mind, the media's mind, the House Republican conference's mind. I don't see though, that it's necessary and indeed, I think Garland will try very hard to make it not the case that they somehow bleed together.
