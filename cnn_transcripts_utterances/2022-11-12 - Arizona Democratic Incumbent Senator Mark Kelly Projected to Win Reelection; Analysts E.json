Democratic incumbent Catherine Cortez Masto now less than 800 votes behind. Kelly's projected win in Arizona will give Democrats 49 seats in the Senate. A win in Nevada would secure Democratic control of that chamber. Democrats have also picked up more House seats. The Republicans only need seven more to retake control of the House of Representatives.Here with us to share their insights, Democratic strategist Hilary Rosen and former Pennsylvania congressman, Republican Charlie Dent.

I think if we can get a little bit of margin of safety in the Senate with these two seats, I think Senator Cortez Masto is going to pull it out. The outstanding votes seem to be in the Democratic populous area of Clark County. Look, I think the Senate is a big back storm. It's important for us for judicial nominations, to prevent the House from executing on really radical things once the Republicans take over. So I think we're going to end up in kind of a draw.",

He is more unpopular than Joe Biden. So I think that's part of it. Certainly, the Dobbs decision. I said for some time that the Republicans need to moderate on -- Republicans need to moderate on that issue. Clearly that was a motivating issue for Democrats. So there are a combination of things, but bottom line is I think you just have to lay it on Donald Trump. He has brought nothing but defeat to the party now since he has come around. He lost the House, lost the Senate, we are losing legislatures with candidates who simply professed fealty to him that does not resonate with a broad swath of the electorate, including many Republicans.",

So I think we're just going to sit back and watch the show in terms of their own internal fight. But they will have the majority.Sure, the White House is working hard and has been working hard behind the scenes to do what they can to prepare, as have members on the Hill. I think that there is one thing, though. This kind of let's blame Donald Trump for everything I think has become too much of a Republican mantra. I think it's an effort to try to avoid a nasty Republican primary, which they are bound to have. There are a lot of tactical voting problems that these guys did that were not Donald Trump's issues. They didn't worry about early voting. They made people worry that the election system was fraught, and so they didn't promote mail-in ballots. They depended on everybody going to the polls on Election Day.

But this is the first time that they are face to face since the pandemic, since Xi Jinping got this unprecedented third term, paving the way for a presidency for life and potentially unchecked power in pushing forward with whatever initiatives he deems fit, even if they go against the hopes of the United States.One of those contentious issues certainly would be the future of the self-governing democracy of Taiwan, but they're also talking about climate, they're talking about North Korea, they're talking about the economy and technology and all of these contentious issues. They are going to have to basically lay out their views in Bali next week at the G-20. President Biden is here in Cambodia for the ASEAN summit where he is essentially going to be picking the brain of key U.S. allies, leaders, many of whom are here in the region, including Japan and South Korea. He is going to ask them what they want to come out of this meeting, this face-to-face meeting with President Xi Jinping. And he's also going to ask for their cooperation on these other issues, including the North Korean nuclear threat and trying to sharpen the punishments for Kim Jong-un if he does go ahead with this possible seventh underground nuclear test. It's a lot of stamina to be the president of the United States. He arrived early this morning and the activities are still going behind me at the hotel where they are holding a gala, a dinner, and he is going to be right back up again tomorrow morning for more meetings. And then this bilateral meeting where he is going to meet with both Japan and South Korea's leaders at the same time before hopping on a plane and going to Bali.

NADIA ROMERO, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENTlot of people who live in the state of Georgia were looking forward to having a bit of a break from all of the politics and all the political ads, but, no, that's not going to happen. At least for the next four weeks you will continue to see all of those ads on every airwave possible. And we'll also see some big spenders, some big heavy hitters will make their way to Georgia as well. Political leaders as well as celebrities will come to the state of Georgia to rally either for Herschel Walker or for Raphael Warnock. We saw already Senator Ted Cruz make his way to the state to rally for Walker. We are expecting other big names to come out for Raphael Warnock. You have rapper Lil Baby who is coming to have a big event tomorrow who is from Atlanta. A double platinum, multi-selling artist who will rally for Warnock. That's the kind of star power that you will continue to see in the state of Georgia. And this Senate race was the second most expensive race this election season right behind Pennsylvania as all eyes back here again on Georgia for this runoff election.",

We are starting to see that in the central U.S., but all of that cold air is really going to spread out in the coming days, especially once this cold front really starts to exit the eastern portion of the country. It's not there yet. So you can clearly see where the warm spots are compared to where that cold air is. Still 73 in Jacksonville, 75 in Charleston, even 67 still in New York City. But quite a different story on the other side, 35 Chicago right now, 32 in St. Louis, same thing in Cincinnati.But a lot more areas are going to start to see that cold air begin to push in. We have got the next some system here. It is bringing rain to areas of Kentucky and Tennessee, but back behind that where the cold air is already in place, you have snow showers for areas of Indiana, Illinois, and even portions of Ohio. But take a look as we go through the week. Really the entire lower 48 is going to see those temperatures either at or below normal, and they are going to stay there. That's going to be the key. This isn't just going to be a one, two day punch where you get cold temperatures and they rebound. Today is the last day, really, for a lot on the eastern seaboard. A high of 73 today in Boston, back down to 46 by Monday. D.C. not that much better, maybe getting up to about 70 for the high today, but a high of only 50 by the time we get to Monday. That cold air is already there for Chicago, and it's going to stay there. It's not even just the Midwest.
