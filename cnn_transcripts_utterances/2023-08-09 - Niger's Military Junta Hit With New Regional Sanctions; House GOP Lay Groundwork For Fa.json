So it sounds like very dire conditions that President Bazoum is currently being held in.I mean, he has been in contact with the outside world. He wrote an opinion piece for The Washington Post, for example, and has had calls with some world leaders. So he hasn't been entirely cut off but it seems that the junta are holding him captive and he has said he's a hostage and, seemingly, in very dire conditions. And this adds to the growing frustrations from the -- from the U.S. and other partners about the junta's hardening stance and their refusal to come to the negotiating table. Here is U.S. State Department's Matthew Miller. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MATTHEW MILLER, SPOKESMAN, U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT:  I think it's very unfortunate and it is in keeping with the message that we heard from them yesterday when acting deputy secretary Nuland presented options for a diplomatic path forward and a negotiated process going forward. And they were not willing to take that path at this time. We're going to keep trying, again fully recognizing how difficult that path is. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Thank you, Stephanie.All right, now to Iran where women are still pushing back against veiling laws even as the government there increases punishments on those who defy the rules. This comes nearly a year after Mahsa Amini's death -- the woman killed while in custody of the morality police. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Iran's brave women are fighting for their freedom with everyday acts of defiance like this -- out on the streets without the mandatory hijab. This recent video appeared to show a woman harassed and called a criminal for refusing to cover up. \"The days of being afraid of you are over,\" she says. Nearly a year after the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Jina Amini in the custody of the so-called morality police, the uprising sparked by her death may have been crushed by a bloody crackdown, but not the will of those standing up for their most basic of rights. Countless women have been defying the clerical establishment, choosing not to wear the compulsory hijab. And now the regime is lashing out with a campaign of renewed repression, announcing the return of morality police patrols.",

They warn you if you disobey they take video or photos. And normal people who are still on the government's side work like paparazzi.\" And that's not all. Authorities are considering a draconian new bill that would make failure to abide by the strict Islamic dress code a more severe offense with unprecedently harsh penalties, including five to 10-year jail sentences and fines of more than $8,000. This may be just a warning to intimidate those who dare to dissent. But an intensified crackdown has been well underway. This chilling video released by a group affiliated with the security apparatus captures some of their terrifying tactics. Facial recognition technology purportedly being used to identify and threaten unveiled women. Cameras are everywhere. Thousands have had their cars confiscated, according to Amnesty International, and women without a veil are being denied access to education and public services. Perhaps even more disturbing is courts have been imposing degrading punishments on women, including counseling sessions for, quote, \"anti- social behavior,\" cleaning government buildings, and washing corpses in morgues.",

This happened in 2021. He could receive up to a decade behind bars. And we could learn more later today about the winning Mega Millions ticket sold in Florida. A single ticket sold at a Publix grocery store in Neptune Beach matched all six numbers for the largest jackpot in the game's history. We do know the winning numbers were from a quick pick. I'm trying to think about if I have any family in Florida. I don't think that I do. But any Florida viewers -- you know, hit us up. All right. More than 80,000 people are still without power this morning after ferocious storms pummeled the eastern U.S., killing at least two people. A pair of tornadoes and widespread flooding in Massachusetts really created havoc in multiple communities. Some areas saw up to seven inches of rain. The water submerging cars, as we can see in this video here. In Maryland, downed electrical poles left 47 people trapped in their vehicles for hours until power lines could be de-energized. And Indiana residents still digging out from tornado damage. Let's get to meteorologist Derek Van Dam. Derek, a lot of severe weather on the forecast. What can we expect today?",

This is where we have our greatest probability of severe storms. So if you're in places like Memphis to Nashville and perhaps into Little Rock, this is an area that has what is considered a level three of five from the Storm Prediction Center.And look at what they've detailed here. Very large hail, damaging winds, and an isolated tornado as well. The greatest probability of a tornado right where you see this yellow shading. So, southern Missouri into western sections of Tennessee, including the Memphis metropolitan region. It's got a five percent probability of tornadic activity. This, on the heels of the active weather that occurred yesterday. There were 13 reports of tornadoes -- a few across the eastern Front Range of Colorado. But a couple of tornadoes reported in Massachusetts as well. They also saw heavy rainfall. You saw some of the video of the flooding taking place in the state as well. Over half a foot of rain fell in some locations there, including the Lawrence region of Massachusetts. So here's the latest radar. Fairly quiet along the Eastern Seaboard for now. This is the round of thunderstorms that's going to continue to roll south and east. As it does so, we currently have a thunderstorm watch until 6:00 a.m. Eastern time for Wichita and the Central Kansas area. That's where we're focusing this morning but it moves east through the day.

It could even be challenged in the courts. And what he's actually done is two things.First of all, there's a five-year program which is designed to help residents of East Jerusalem. There's an aspect of that which is meant to help those residents improve their Hebrew, learn Hebrew, boost their Hebrew to a level that would enable them to study at Hebrew University. That program as a whole is worth hundreds of millions of shekels -- hundreds of millions of dollars over five years. And as another part, which is money destined for Arab municipalities. And this is part of a kind of leveling-up program to help poorer municipalities kind of have similar resources to those which are wealthier. And after doing all the sums, they worked out that Arab municipalities still had a shortfall, so more money was set aside. This is the 50+ million dollars per year that was set aside. And what the finance minister is saying is look, it's not fair that this money should go to Arab municipalities and not poorer Jewish ones. He says that this money was only set aside in order to placate what Mansour Abbas, who is from the Islamic Ra'am Party and was in the previous government. And finally, he says this money could find its way into criminal organizations and terrorist groups. And that, he says, is why he's doing it -- Rahel.",
