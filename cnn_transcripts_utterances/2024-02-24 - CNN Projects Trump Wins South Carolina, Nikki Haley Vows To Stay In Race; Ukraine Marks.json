JIM CLYBURN (D-SC): Well, you know, when I see all the gaffes? Trump had some cue cards on yesterday or last night and he couldn't get his own wife's name, right? There's something wrong with Trump, and we noticed something wrong with Trump. All of that meandering that he was doing today, but you never see any reporting on that. If Joe Biden commits a gaffe, a guy who stuttered all of his childhood into his adulthood and everybody know his stuttering is what caused a lot of his speech impediments. And we know, it has nothing to do with his brain. He stumbles one time and everybody says, he's too old to be a precedent. Look, we had a president of these United States, I saw the wreckage of the other day, who in the top ten, and some people got him in the top three, Franklin Roosevelt was in a wheelchair. It didn't bother his brand. He got elected president more often than anybody else in the history of the country. He ranks has been the best presidents we've ever had, not because he was able to walk, but because he was able to think and do so in a way that benefits the American people, benefit his great country keep us moving toward a more perfect union, not the fullest sense that were getting from down Trump.",

There's a moment. There were several of them thought that she was going to drop out, but obviously she's not. But I'm hearing from senior advisors if that isn't going to impact anything that they are doing moving forward.On Tuesday is the Michigan primary, and just to note, he has only gone to Michigan once. We now know Nikki Haley's super PAC is spending about $500,000 there. They don't even have a big infrastructure in the state of Michigan. In fact, I'm told they've only hired two people there. Clearly, he is so confident that he is going to win there, that he's not going back, he's not even attending the primary there. And it comes to Super Tuesday, which is the week after that, he is leading in the polls in every state. So what I'm talking to senior advisers, when I'm talking to allies, they are saying that they don't believe there is a path for the former governor of South Carolina. They're going to continue to pivot to the general election and try and shift their focus to President Joe Biden. And part of that is going to be trying to recreate and reshaped structure and reshape the RNC, which is the Republican National Committee. We've done a lot of extensive reporting, of course, first on the chairwoman who has said that she would step out down when Ronald Trump becomes the nominee, but also on the extensive RNC, he, Donald Trump has this is promoted a person who has supported his lies about the 2020 election to be the chairman of the RNC, as well as his daughter-in-law, to be a co-chair person of the RNC. He is right now still operating as though he is the presumptive nominee and trying to reshape the party, reshape the RNC in his image.",

Well, Jake, Nikki Haley's headed to Michigan tomorrow, an empty sets off on 10 extremely busy days for her campaign as she is vowing, of course, to keep her campaign alive tonight. And we spoke with her campaign manager earlier fair tonight, who told us to say that she's headed to this week, they include Minnesota, Colorado, Utah, North Carolina, Virginia, Massachusetts, Maine, and Vermont.That's a lot of states but what I do want to point you to is the fact that I've talked to campaign aides who say that they do see fertile ground in those western states, Colorado and Utah, and also in the northeast certain states, Vermont, Massachusetts, and Maine. And it's worth noting that there are some of those states, including Massachusetts and Vermont, where its winner-take-all, if someone hits 50 percent, they believe that that could be a possibility for Nikki Haley. But it'll be an area for us to watch. Where do they actually put these resources into? We know that her campaign is going up with national ads, both digitally and on TV to push her campaign ahead. Her super PAC is also investing in some of these future states. The question is, can she get enough of these delegates in these future states to make a decision after Super Tuesday, that you will keep her campaign alive. Of course, she's vowing tonight that it's incredibly important for Americans to have a choice. She talked about them the fact that they shouldn't be a Soviet style election where folks are going out to vote, don't have an option in front of them and she wants to be that option. I also think its worth noting, Jake, that she had a pretty somber tone tonight to talk about her concern about the future of the country. And she said that she believes that South Carolinians are concerned as well. But because she's concerned, that is one of the reasons that she's staying in the race despite, of course, losing her home state of South Carolina -- Jake.",

One is that the Democratic Party has for very long period of time taken Black voters for granted. And there is a question right now about the energy that is behind Joe Biden from Black voters and supporting him in November. That is true.What's also true and can be said is that Donald Trump is a racist who utilize his racism as political currency. I can remember going back in studio in 2016 when Jake Tapper was interviewing him about David Duke and he like he didn't know who David Duke was on the eve of the Mississippi primary. The fact that he keeps an -- even Lindsey Graham said it tonight that Black Americans have a propensity to commit crimes, et cetera to hyper-sexualized us, to make -- to hyper criminalized us, to keep falling into these tropes. That is the type of racism that plays to the base of his party. He says these things to Black voters, to their faces the ones who ignorant enough to be in that room, not talking to them. That's what people missed. Donald Trump is not talking to Black voters when he goes down these tropes. He's actually talking to White voters into his base to turn them up and built in a lot of the resentment that we see. A lot of the things that we see that are going on in this country about people who are coming out is because there are some fear that they are being replaced either by Black or Brown voters. And when you see him talking down to Black folk in their face, there is a large swath of the American public who says, I liked the way that sounds, and that's the currency that he uses. So I think two things can be true. The Democratic Party has been on -- laying on their asses for too long when it comes to so to Black voters, that is true. You're seeing that catch up with him, and Donald Trump is racist.",

You heard is his pretty dark vision of America and attacks against Joe Biden in his CPAC speech earlier today. And then you also heard his speech tonight. He came out very early. Perhaps the reason why they put them out early before Nikki Haley, so she would not get under his skin. He didn't even mention her in that speech as he tried to talk about the general election. And then he was asked apparently about this to a Fox News reporter about Nikki Haley's staying in the race and he said, I'm not really thinking about it. We have to beat Joe Biden. He said, I don't know if she's in the race at all. So well see if that allows them to now call her names -- like he's calling her birdbrain and all the like.

Russia's war against the country and people of Ukraine just hit the two-year mark. The conflict has been a key issue in the fight for the White House as new U.S. aid to Kyiv remains in limbo because of opposition by Trump's Republican allies in Congress and frankly, opposition by Trump.

I think many Ukrainian soldiers didn't expect there'll be able to use minimal western armory in the opening in days of this war to hold back the third biggest army in the world, essentially, part of that was Russia's fault for simply not being up to the task they set themselves. And then they did later that year, managed to kick Russia out of a lot of the territory they'd occupied, and then a southern counter offensive which simply didn't deliver in the summer of last year.But now, Ukraine's military face their hardest test because it's been that Western aid that's kept them afloat, frankly. You can't fight a war just based on brave hearts alone, you need proper weaponry and weaponry is drying up. They don't have the shells that they need. And so Jake, we've seen over the past week or so the realizations that people were talking about in December, that slowdown of the $60 billion from Congress would translate into deaths and loss of territory on the front lines. Well, that is happening now and it happened last weekend with a loss of Avdiivka, Ukraine pulling out of that last Saturday, and were slowly seeing a village near that being retaken by the Russians and pressure in other parts of the frontline to unclear if this is going to basically herald the beginning of a collapse in Ukrainian front lines that may not occur. But were definitely seeing Russia resurgent, taking advantage of this particular moment. And more importantly, too, Jake, behind the scenes, Moscow retooling its economy, resilient, desperately resilient to sanctions. Those 500 targets over the last 48 hours from the Biden administration, Moscow will find a way to work around that. They have been doing that quite ingenuity other the past few years or so. So, I think concerns here that while Ukraine is running out, none of emotion not have hoped, nor the desire to fight this war. But at the basic tools it needs to do that. Russia is both finding the resources and beginning to get its strategy slightly more coherent, Jake.",

It's been forefront about this from the very beginning and continues to want to try and find ways to get around that hurdling Congress. But there is this ultimate fear I think amongst many Ukrainians that are looming potential Trump presidency brings not just a new era of uncertainty, but the very possibility that but the main ally they've had over the past two years might suddenly want to advocate for Vladimir Putin. That's the strange background noise and all of this, nobody really knows why Donald Trump feels such an affinity towards the Kremlin head, but its there and its unmistakable.",
