Donald Trump is entitled to some presidential immunity. In the last opinion, on the last day of the term, the Supreme Court finally released its ruling in the hugely anticipated January 6th case against Trump. The six to three decision says the president has absolute immunity for official acts, but not unofficial ones. The question of what constitutes an official act or an unofficial one will be kicked down to the lower court again. In her dissent, Justice Sotomayor wrote, orders the Navy SEAL Team Six to assassinate a political rival? Immune. Organizes a military coup to hold on to power? Immune. Takes a bribe in exchange for a pardon? Immune. Immune, immune, immune. With fear for our democracy, I dissent. Pretty strong. While Trump called the decision a big win for our constitution, the January 6th trial now almost certainly won't be heard before November, and if Trump wins re-election, he could make the case disappear altogether. Neal Katyal argued many cases before the Supreme Court, including as the U.S. acting solicitor general, and he's joining me now. Welcome back to our program. NEAL KATYAL, FORMER U.S. ACTING SOLICITOR GENERAL: Thank you for having me.",

It was a big win for Trump and a big loss for the American constitution and our democracy, as Justice Sotomayor said.I mean, Christiane, even before the decision was rendered today, the whole thing was a big win for Donald Trump because the Supreme Court took many months to decide this case, when normally, they would have acted much more quickly. And what that did is effectively make it impossible for Donald Trump to be tried for his alleged crimes on January 6th before our presidential election in November. But what the decision today did, which I think was pretty unexpected, was to make his prosecution even harder should he lose the election, because it's going to change the rules. In America, we've generally had a tradition that no person is above the law. That's why we fought our revolution. And as Justice Sotomayor says in dissent, that's not true anymore. Now, the president -- a former president, is going to have a massive amount of immunity for actions he undertook while as president.",

Again, Justice Sotomayor, as you say, I'll give you the actual quote, gives -- she says, gives formerPresident Trump all the immunity he asked for and more. Adding that it makes a mockery of the principle that no man is above the law. But, the chief justice for the majority writes, the president enjoys no immunity for his unofficial acts, and not everything the president does is official. The president is not above the law. So, where are we? I mean, what does that actually mean? What does the majority actually mean?",

The question is, what isa practical matter will an unofficial act be? Even if, for example, the trial court concludes that pressuring Vice President Pence to throw out the vote on January 6th was an unofficial act, which they'd have to do against the presumption that everything's official and you couldn't introduce evidence of a president's motive and so on, let's say the trial court concluded that. That's then going to go up to the court of appeals on an appeal, and then possibly the United States Supreme Court delaying things for another year or two. The general way our constitutional system has worked is, you got to obey the law, you don't get to say something is an official act when it is, you know, like, undoubtedly, you know, has unofficial personal consequences, you got to face the music. But Trump has managed to both delay his criminal trial now for months and months and months and to adopt -- to force the Supreme Court to adopt a standard that makes it hard for him to be tried or any president to be tried because they'll claim everything, Christiane, to be an official act.",

She said -- accusing the majority of judicial hubris and saying the majority disdains restraint and grasp for power. So, again, that is -- like Sotomayor, these are very -- you know, very sharp dissents for these two rulings.

A -- the Constitution's not going to protect us, the courts aren't going to protect us. We have to exercise our judgment to put a responsible person in that office, someone who takes the American tradition of adherence to the rule of law, respect for our constitution, as his or her most sacred duty.

Biden spent the weekend at Camp David, according to reports, his family is urging him to stay in the race, even as commentators and former officials are called for him to bow out. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, the hometown paper where the CNN Debate happened, has called on Biden to pass the torch. In response, Atlanta's former mayor, Keisha Lance Bottoms, said, better reasons for a candidate to drop out would include violently trying to overthrow an election, demanding 11,000 more votes from the secretary of state, felony convictions, sexual assault, and indictments in Fulton County. And Keisha Lance Bottoms is now a senior adviser to President Biden's campaign. She's joining us live. Welcome to the program.

And unfortunately, this is a candidate and a former president that we just don't know how far he will go. So, it's going to be very interesting to see what Judge Chutkan determines to be official acts, but I don't believe that our founding fathers contemplated that there would be a president who would go to the extreme of talking about dismantling the constitution who would try and overthrow a government, as you mentioned, January 6th. We saw that happen in real-time. And Donald Trump is very proud of this Supreme Court. And this should be a reminder to everyone that elections do have consequences.

So, it's understandable that people had -- that people coming out of the debate, but I would remind people that we don't judge a presidency based on 90 minutes. Let's look at the totality of what this administration has delivered for the American people, and hands down, there's no comparison. I was mayor of Atlanta while Donald Trump was president. It was chaos. It was uncertainty. You never knew from one day to the next what to expect, going back to our last interview together, where we were in the middle of an interview, we wrapped that interview only for me to turn on the television and see that people were scaling the walls of the Capitol. That's what Donald Trump brought to our cities and our communities across America, and that's what people should focus on, not 90 minutes.

Sometimes folks have the impression that maybe this is a country club and people haven't paid their dues or countries are delinquent. But the reality is that for 10 long years and actually before even 10 years ago, American presidents of all political stripes have been asking European nations to spend more on their own defense. And the good news is, as of this year, in July of 2024, we now have 23 members of the alliance spending 2 percent of GDP on their own defense. So, let me start with that good news. On Ukraine, in terms of who's winning and losing. In recent months, we've seen small advances by both sides. We're talking about kilometers or miles really in single digits. But what we do see is that a continued determination on the part of the Ukrainians is having a real impact. These are forces that still have high morale. They're well trained, and now they're well equipped. More assistance is flowing into Ukraine, and they continue to do everything they can to not only hold the line, but to push Russians out of their territory. On the Russian side, they have forces to throw at this war, but these are not the troops that are well equipped or well trained, and that is why Russia, tragically, has lost hundreds of thousands of troops in this senseless war.",

That's when the pledge,it's called the Wales Pledge, came into effect, where everybody committed to spend 2 percent. And since that year, since 2014, we've seen consistent increases on the part of the Europeans to spend more. So, it's really through three U.S. presidents, through President Obama, President Trump, and now President Biden, that we've been able to get Europeans to the point where now two-thirds of them meet the mark. Of course, we need all allies to hit the target, without question, but the fact that in 10 years we've seen consecutive growth and now have 23 allies meeting the target is just a remarkable achievement.",

What will this new initiative do? It will take all of the assistance that is flowing into Ukraine and provide greater coordination and greater coherence of those efforts. But also, so many countries are now training Ukrainian forces that NATO wants to provide some coordination of those efforts. NATO has a lot of experience. NATO, of course, as you'll remember, helped transition the former Warsaw pact countries in Eastern Europe to NATO membership. It has a lot of experience helping countries with modernization, interoperability, standardization and that's what's NATO is here to do, and that's what NATO will be announcing in the next day or two. What we will be doing, I can say, is that countries will be coming forward with additional offers of air defense. This is an acute need on the part of the Ukrainians, thanks to what the Russians have been doing in recent months with these endless indiscriminate tragic attacks on civilians and military infrastructure. And so, allies have come together to look for ways to flow additional air defense into Ukraine urgently and to do it now.",

So, I see nothing but good news radiating out of the NATO alliance. And in terms of who started this war, let's be sure that we get the facts straight here. Russia started this unprovoked war of aggression in Ukraine. No one else is responsible for that. Russia likes to often say either Ukraine or the NATO alliance is responsible or someone else, but the reality is that President Putin started this war two years ago, and he could end it at any time.",
