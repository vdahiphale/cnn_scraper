There's 25,35,45 members of that conference, who just are not serious about governing. They're nihilistic. And insofar as he lets the tail wag the dog, the government's going to shut down.

They're also asking for a boost in funding for some key programs that provide assistance to millions of Americans.Now separately, the White House is also asking Congress for a supplemental request. That is to provide more funds to FEMA, which has been responding to very expensive disasters across the country and whose funds are set to run dry by the end of this month. As well as more funding for Ukraine. Now House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has said the FEMA funds will be replenished, but there is pushback about those funds being linked to Ukraine. Now also, there is disagreement within the Republican Conference about the spending bill. Republican hardliners have asked for an impeachment inquiry into Biden action on border security, as well as cutting spending to pre-COVID levels as part of passing any type of spending bill. So that is likely to play out in Congress in the weeks to come. But all of this really a Sprint to the finish in September when the fiscal year ends.

But his ministry has faced issues of corruption, allegations of corruption in recent months. And as you mentioned, while he is not directly implicated in those.You may remember earlier this year, a slew of senior officials were dismissed amid issues of the procurement of military supplies. In the wake of that, the Deputy Defense Minister resigned in August. We saw President Zelenskyy dismissed the head of all military recruitment offices across Ukraine. You have to remember, President Zelenskyy had promised to clamp down on corruption from the time he was campaigning as president. This has been a long-standing issue in Ukraine, probably only more magnified by the conflict. And as you mentioned, it does come as a difficult time this dismissal, a very key figure, a very key character being pushed out of the Ministry, of course as Ukraine says, it's making gains on the ground.
