Now that was following the vote, the president issued a statement thanking lawmakers, saying tonight, senators from both parties voted to protect the hard-earned economic progress we have made and prevent a first-ever default by the United States. Together, they demonstrated once more that America is the nation that pays its bills and meets its obligations and always will be. CNN's Melanie Zanona was on hand for those votes and she has the latest now from Capitol Hill. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MELANIE ZANONA, CNN CAPITOL HILL REPORTER: Well, after weeks of intense negotiations and with just days to go before the default deadline, Congress has averted an economic disaster. The Senate on Thursday night passed a bill that would raise the debt ceiling until 2025 and also limit future spending. And the final vote tally in the Senate was 63 to 36. They needed 60 Republicans and Democrats to come together to pass this bill. And they did. Take a listen to Chuck Schumer talking about this bill after the vote. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), U.S. SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: Default was the giant sword hanging over America's head. But because of the good work of President Biden, as well as Democrats in the House and Democrats in the Senate, we are not defaulting. Democrats said from the start, we must take default off the table. For a long time Republicans, many Republicans in the House resisted. House Republicans were ready to take default hostage in order to pass a radical, hard-right agenda that never could have passed with the American people. So tonight's outcome is very welcome news for our economy and for American families.",

First of all, they had to hammer out the deal, which took weeks. Usually they try to do these things in a matter of months. It was a very complicated fiscal agreement. There were blowups. There were points where it looked like it was gonna go completely off the rails.And then the other half of the battle is that they had to sell this deal to their members and there was opposition from both Republicans and Democrats. Democrats don't like the stricter work requirements for food stamp recipients, they don't like some of the energy permitting reforms, and Republicans thought the bill does not go far enough to cut spending. They also don't like that it's gonna hike the debt ceiling for two years until after the next presidential election, but ultimately a coalition of members came together in the middle to get this done and avoid what would have been the first ever default.

And if the domestic and global economy collapse into catastrophe, you know, there's no way he walks out of that blast radius.I mean, it affects him. So I think avoiding that was worth it to Biden to essentially renounce what he had originally set out, which is that he was not going to negotiate around the debt ceiling. And Paula, I think it was a very revealing kind of measure of the way Biden has approached this presidency. He has criticized Republicans, he's called out the MAGA faction and so forth. But in the end, he chooses to try to make the system work rather than going to war against the other side on the grounds that it is, you know, pursuing a radical agenda. He was very measured throughout this whole process. And that did allow him to bring this into shore with relatively minor concessions to Republicans, certainly not many more concessions that he would have to make in the budget process anyway later this year, given the Republicans have announced.",

I refuse that path. Defund tyranny. Live free. Not to be outdone, right? The Democratic progressive wing, you know, AOC, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez saying you are cutting food assistance, you are pushing through a disastrous pipeline, you are causing harm to the environment and you're holding the entire U.S. economy hostage.

You know, Republicans, House Republicans don't have a comparable lever to demand changes from Biden.Again, I mean, even this deal has measures to kind of reduce the potential threat of a government shutdown later this year and the freeze in domestic discretionary spending, which again is only one- sixth of the federal budget and is way too small a lever to meaningfully affect the long-term deficit trajectory, that's already agreed to. So there isn't that much more I think they can do. They'll hold a lot of hearings to try to embarrass the administration or you know, score points against them. But the right in the Republican Party are not going to have many more options like this, where they have something where Biden clearly has to deal with them. If anything, don't forget in 2025, the next big fiscal fight is going to be the expiration of the Trump tax cuts when the leverage will switch back to Democrats if they have even one chamber of Congress, much less the White House. So I do think, you know, probably from this point forward, we're going to see fairly modest legislative achievement, you know, in the remainder of this Congress. And I think the left and the right will be out there banging, you know, their gongs and making their case for bigger change. But it's going to be very hard to find a vehicle where they can do that. Yeah, it certainly, as you said, that you already see them already in electoral mode. In fact, Chip Roy immediately went and campaigned off of his no vote. Ron, I got to thank you for holding our hands through the last few weeks certainly give us a lot of political insights. I appreciate it.",

Doctors told CNN that patients most commonly report an effect on alcohol use. It may be because these drugs in a class known as GLP-Ones have an effect not just in the gut, but also in the brain. It's something being studied at the National Institutes of Health, where researchers just published a paper showing semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic, reduced what they call the binge-like alcohol drinking in rodents. DR. LORENZO LEGGIO, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF HEALTH RESEARCHER: We believe that at least the one of the mechanisms for how these drugs reduce alcohol drinking is by reducing the rewarding effects of alcohol, such as those related to a neurotransmitter in our brain, which is a dopamine. So, these medications are likely to make alcohol less rewarding. TIRRELL (voiceover): And it's not just alcohol and nicotine, patients have even told the Atlantic it had effects on behaviors like nail biting and online shopping.",
