European Union Leaders agree to open talks on Ukraine becoming a member, but fail to agree on a multibillion dollar aid package. We'll have a report from Brussels. And a UK court has ruled that Prince Harry was a victim of phone hacking. Welcome to the show. And U.S. and Israeli officials are looking ahead to the next phase in Israel's war with Hamas. Earlier U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan reiterated Washington's support for Israel's war efforts. However, he also spoke of the Biden Administration's desire for Israel to shift to a more precise and targeted approach against Hamas amid still rising civilian casualties coming through in Gaza. We've got Alex Marquardt traveling with Jake Sullivan today, who is also said to meet with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in the West Bank in the coming hours. That is where Alex is right now Alex, always great to have you on. Let's start with what we've seen already with Jake Sullivan, saying that he spoke with Netanyahu on dumb bombs used.

And so insofar as anybody has influence over Netanyahu and the government, it's the United States. But that does not mean that the U.S. can dictate terms. And Jake Sullivan today certainly taken care to make sure that it doesn't look like that he is dictating how Israel should go about its war? I asked Jake Sullivan about our reporting about how thousands of dumb bombs have been used just shy of all of the bombs that have been dropped on Gaza. He didn't deny that. In fact, he didn't say that Israel shouldn't use them. He just said that they are -- it's they're determined -- their use is determined on a case by case basis to turn, depending on the mission that Israel intends to carry out. And of course, that they do take care of making sure that they don't hit civilians. This has been the Biden Administration's line that Israel has the intent to do what they can to make sure that civilians are not killed. But the actual effect they have said is not what they are hoping for. We heard President Biden saying just yesterday that he really wants Israel to take better care of making sure civilians don't get killed. But Eleni the big question today was how the U.S. sees the timeline for this war playing out? How that squares with Israel's intention, which they say is to eradicate Hamas? And for -- you know to go after them for as long as it takes. Here's a little bit of what Sullivan told me earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAKE SULLIVAN, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR: What I am going to say is that we had a very constructive conversation yesterday about the transition from the high intensity phase forward. And we expect that that will occur in the future. When exactly that happens and under exactly what conditions will be continuing intensive discussion between the United States and Israel. And I will make sure that that conversation, at least as far as I can do it is going to stay -- is going to take place behind closed doors. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Try to take out Hamas Leaders in Special Forces raids, when that's going to happen? Jake Sullivan wouldn't say we've been told behind the scenes that U.S. has been pressing for it to happen in weeks, not months. But Sullivan being very careful, not wanting to make it look like he's pressuring Israel while in Israel. And of course, there is the concern that of course, the timeline could slide if Israel is not meeting its goals. Sullivan saying that this was very much a condition based timeline.

This was an immensely important call, in part because this is actually the first time that thesetwo leaders, NATO allies have spoken since this war began a war in which Turkey and the United States have -- you know vastly divergent viewpoints. The United States is probably Israel's biggest ally right now. And Turkey is undoubtedly one of its strongest critics. And when you read and compare these readouts of these two calls or this call from these two countries, there's not a lot of crossover. In fact, it's not clear to me that there was anything -- of any real substance that was actually agreed upon. I'll run you through a few examples. So when it comes to Sweden's NATO bid, of course, Turkey is one of two countries that still have yet to approve it. The American side of the call says they discussed the importance of welcoming Sweden as an ally as soon as possible. The Turkish version though, is different. All it says is Sweden's NATO membership process was discussed. Turkey is hoping that the Americans will approve the sale of F- 16 fighter jets to them, at the same time as the Turkish Parliament approves Sweden's NATO bid. But the Americans didn't actually mention anything about that on their readout. The Turkish version says the F-16 issue was discussed during the meeting. And on Gaza well, the differences become even starker. The American version says that on humanitarian aid, says the leaders also discussed efforts to increase humanitarian assistance to Gaza and protect civilians. The Turkish readout actually makes no mention of humanitarian aid. It says this. During the meeting, President Erdogan stated that the humanitarian tragedy in Gaza must be stopped as soon as possible when it comes to the fighting. President Biden, the American version of this call says President Biden reiterated his support for Israel's right to defend itself. The Turkish version says the United States' withdrawal of unconditional support for Israel can ensure a ceasefire quickly. It is the historical responsibility of the U.S. to ensure a permanent ceasefire in the region as soon as possible. Of course Eleni, part of the problem here is that Turkey and the United States view this whole situation fundamentally different. The Americans, you know, look at Israel as the country that's defending itself. Hamas is the terror group. Turkey views Israel as the terrorist state. That's what President Erdogan has said. And it believes that Hamas is merely a liberation group. And even after the war, they don't agree on what should happen next. The Americans believe that Hamas should play no part in governing Gaza. When I spoke to Erdogan's Chief Advisor on security and foreign policy, he made very clear that whether you like it or not, Hamas is part of this and they will have to be some part of a solution if there is one coming down in the future, Eleni.",

Just to start with the Danish ones, the ones announced by the Danish authorities on Thursday. We've just had an update on that. It is four people that were arrested that we know of so far, we've just heard from Danish authorities, that four extra people were remodeling costs custody in absentia. They are still now at large. What we understand is that these arrests have been made in regard to terror allegations. We don't know the specifics of that the details of it. In fact, state authorities have been very cautious about linking this to the Middle East. We've heard from the Danish Prime Minister who did reference the war in Israel, against Hamas. But we haven't heard that specifically from the authorities with regard to the details of the nature of the charges. As for the four arrests that were made by German authorities, three people inside Germany, one person inside the Netherlands. These were specifically linked to Hamas. In fact what German authorities say all the three people who were taken in front of an investigative judge today and that extra fourth person who was tipped off by German authorities were arrested by Dutch authorities is that these four were active members of Hamas, long standing members of Hamas, Eleni? And they've been actively preparing to carry out attacks against Jewish targets. In fact, on some of those specifics, what we've heard from German authorities is that this group of individuals had been collecting weapons, and building a cache of weaponry in Berlin. The aim was then to use them elsewhere against U.S. targets. And what they noted they say after October 7th was an increased number of trips by these individuals from Berlin to other parts of Germany to try and acquire more weapons. So two separate series of arrests, but both come at a time of course, when European countries are on high alert, because of that fear of terror threats that have been linked to the war in Israel. Here in France, we're on our highest level of warning and European why -- the EU had warned that Europe should prepare for a heightened terror threat, specifically Eleni over the Christmas period.",

Though that takes an average of a decade and Ukraine has more obstacles than almost any country that's ever tried to attempt this before. However, Viktor Orban did succeed in blocking the 50 billion euro sum which was supposed to reassure Ukraine and tie it over economically through next year, and for the next four years as well. Bearing in mind that comes after the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy did not succeed at getting the $61 billion from President Biden. So he is in a difficult spot now a precarious position at a critical juncture where Russian President -- Russian President Vladimir Putin is claiming more success on the battlefield. You know, that can be argued. But the key point about this summit is that it will be long road ahead for President Zelenskyy. But this is a very -- it's a very momentous occasion for Ukrainians. Let's not forget that back in 2013, when Ukraine was en-route (ph) to signing a European Association Agreement, IE taking a step towards becoming closer with the European Union. That was one of the key triggers to ultimately Vladimir Putin illegally annexing Crimea. So these moves of Ukraine to go further into the European fold and away from Russia are what antagonize Vladimir Putin the most. So it's a very important step for Ukraine on that front, but the cold hard cash to backup Ukraine's ambitions to fight off Putin and to stabilize itself as a country that is not there.",

Upon arriving in St. Vincent where the talks were held the President of Venezuela, Nicolas Maduro issued a statement where he said that he arrived with the backing of the Venezuelan people. He says they support his annexation of this region of Guyana. This is an issue that goes back decades Venezuelans have long felt that this part of their country was wrested away from them unfairly. It is an area that is about 160,000 square kilometers a jungle remote region of Guyana, but one where there has been discoveries of oil and gas that promised to provide the Guyanese people with billions of dollars in the years ahead. Guyana for its part says this is an issue for the International Court of Justice to decide and they're not prepared to give back a single piece, single part of this area which they say it belongs to Guyana. The President of Guyana on Thursday, said that both countries are committed to peace and working on this issue together. But he seemed unwilling to budge to the demands of Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro, who has increasingly over the past several weeks, been threatening Guyana with the idea that Venezuela could invade and take away by force, a part of this contested region, if not the entire contested region. The United States is backing Guyana, as there are other countries in the region. And it's unclear if Nicolas Maduro really tends to follow through on these threats, or this is just a bid to increase nationalist sentiment ahead of a presidential election in 2024.
