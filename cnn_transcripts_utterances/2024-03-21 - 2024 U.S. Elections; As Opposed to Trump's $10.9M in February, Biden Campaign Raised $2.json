New fundraising numbers are out and Joe Biden is dominating Donald Trump in the race for campaign cash as the former president asked his voters to cough up donations for the half a billion dollars he needs by Monday. His pitch, \"Keep your filthy hands-off Trump Tower.\"Plus, the perks of pardon power. We have new reporting this hour about how more than a dozen people pardoned by Donald Trump are now helping his push to get back in the White House. Stay tuned for our exclusive story. And Benjamin Netanyahu may be heading to Washington. Speaker Mike Johnson says, he'll make the invitation official hours after the Israeli Prime Minister spoke privately with House Republicans. Netanyahu tells the U.S. to stay out of his country's politics, so why does he seem to be wading into America's? I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines and inside politics. First up, in a race between the oldest presidential candidates ever, it's all about keeping up. And Joe Biden hopes his campaign schedule sends a message to voters that he has the strength and the stamina to spend four more years as president. He's been to eight states since Super Tuesday, including the six biggest battlegrounds. Donald Trump has campaigned in just two states, Georgia and Ohio, perhaps in an effort to keep costs low as he struggles to keep pace in the money race. CNN's Alayna Treene is covering this story. Alayna, what are your sources inside Trump world telling you about his anemic campaign schedule?",

      "sentences": "Right. Well, there's a reason that Joe Biden is out there, far more frequently than Donald Trump and why Trump is choosing to stay off the trail since securing the Republican nomination, and that's largely because Donald Trump needs to raise money. We know that over the past -- a few weeks, ever since Donald Trump secured the Republican presidential nomination, he's been hosting fundraisers, attending fundraisers at his Mar-a-Lago home, as well being -- meeting with donors and trying to court donors to help him with the campaign's money problem.And I'm just going to read for you, Dan, and walk you through some of the numbers that we got from the latest FEC filing. So, in February, the Biden campaign raised $21.3 million and they entered March with $71 million cash on hand. That's compared to the Trump campaign having brought in $10.9 million and $33.5 million, having that as cash on hand. And so, Donald Trump is very much trailing Joe Biden significantly in the money game. Now, part of that, of course, is that Joe Biden is the incumbent. He has been in the incumbent, and he hasn't had to fend off primary challengers the way that Donald Trump has. And when I talked to the Trump campaign, they tell me that they are hopeful. His numbers this month or in February were better than the money that he raised in January. And they do believe that now that he is officially the Republican nominee, and does not have any other primary challengers that they can continue to raise money. But again, I mean, they are having to preserve resources, cut costs, do what they can to try and save money to help his campaign keep up with Joe Biden's.",

Thank you so much for that reporting, Alayna.Let's talk more about this and so much more with CNN's Gloria Borger, Jeff Zeleny, and Priscilla Alvarez. Hello everybody. Jeff, let me just start with you. You've been on the campaign trail a lot. Obviously, talking to voters and talking to campaign operatives. What is your sense about why it has been hard for Donald Trump? The real deal about why it's been hard for him and the Republican Party to raise the money that they need to raise? JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT:  Look -- I mean, a lot of it is what Alayna laid out there. I mean, he has used a lot of the money. The RNC over the years before he was a candidate again spent a lot of money on legal fees. Some donors are, quite frankly, wary of contributing to his legal fund where they, you know, would prefer the money go elsewhere. Some of it is the fact that his operation is not nearly robust and a traditional, as other campaigns have been. But I think the -- the biggest thing is he's like feeding two mouths here. He's a criminal defendant, which is very expensive in multiple jurisdictions. One would be expensive and never mind all the jurisdictions. And he's running for president. So, as you said, they are linked, in some respect. He's linked them. I mean, that's why he jumped in so early in the first place, but that's the biggest reason. But I think the -- at the end of the day, I mean, the money is coming back. He's having meeting with the fundraisers. Any Republicans who, kind of, rolled their eyes and didn't really want him to be the nominee, they're on board, basically. They've opened up their checkbooks. So, I'm not sure if it's the money as much as, you know, what they're doing with it. And deep questions at the RNC because they, you know, said they wouldn't spend money on legal fees. But that was the old RNC. This is his RNC and they're going to.",

Trump is fundraising off of that possibility. Sending a text to supporters yesterday, reading, Keep your filthy hands off Trump Tower.So, what he is doing, and I just want to be clear, he's not asking his supporters to pay his bond.
