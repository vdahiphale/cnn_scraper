      "sentences": "Today on Inside Politics, a cold campaign reality. Blizzard conditions in Iowans chaos for the Republican candidates trying to reach every voter they can. The crucial question. How much will this dangerous weather impact turnout on caucus night?Plus, firing back. President Biden ordered airstrikes against Iran backed rebels who've been firing at commercial ships, fueling fears that the Middle East could be on the edge of an all-out war? And I don't hate her. That's the faint praise. Some Iowa Republicans are giving Nikki Haley. We're going to hear what some voters are really thinking in a brand-new focus group. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. We start in Iowa which is under a blizzard warning today. It is freezing there. Now I'm sure you're thinking, duh. It's January. Obviously, it's cold in Iowa, but this is different. It is brutally cold. Historically cold. So cold that Iowans are being told not to even take a step outside and it's going to get worse. Monday looks likely to be the coldest caucus night on record. We're talking about windshields as low as negative 30 degrees. CNN's Jeff Zeleny is sort of indoor outdoor. We can see the outside, but you've got a little bit of the heat from the inside. I just want our viewers to not be super concerned about. You tell us what you're seeing there, not only with the weather, but with the campaign.",

      "sentences": "Well, Dana, we are bundled up. No worries here about that. But the weather is political here. And this is why it is one of the central worries and concerns of the campaign going forward at this point. It's what they're preparing for. It's what they're thinking about. And it's what they're worrying about.And the candidates have mainly had to cancel most of their events today. So, the campaign has essentially frozen in place. And this is why this matters. Now that voters necessarily need to hear one more stump speech or even the closing arguments, but these events are about organization. When you walk into a campaign event, you are met by a campaign staffer or volunteer who is making sure they have your information. So, they can remind you on Monday to come out to the caucus. So, it's all about organization as we talk about so much. But now there certainly has been so much spending here in Iowa. Nikki Haley and her Super PAC are now leading the charge in terms of spending. So perhaps it's a good day to watch some of those television commercials for Iowans who are trapped inside. But Ron DeSantis just did make it out to one event this morning. And he talked about the importance of Monday night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL) 2024 GOP PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'll ask you for your support on Monday. I know it's going to be cold. I know it's going to be not the most pleasant, but I don't think you'll ever be able to cast the vote that has more impact. Given the circumstance, we don't know what the turnout is going to be. It could be much smaller than what it's been in the '16 cycle, that's possible. So, if you're going out and you're bringing four or five different friends with you or family members, that is going to pack a punch in a way that voting and a general election just simply would not at that level.

People who sign up to call in, the campaign is keeping track of them. And again, they can remind them to vote on Monday night.So, Dana, the reason this matter is turnout as Governor DeSantis was just saying there. For weeks and months, Republican officials here were telling me they expected a record setting turnout more than in 2016. Now that's very much an open question with the cold weather. We're talking to older voters certainly have a concern getting to the polls. But look, the campaign is going on into the weekend. Former President Donald Trump is coming into Iowa this weekend to campaign tomorrow. All the other candidates are hoping to get back on the road. But the weather is politics now. And it's one of the central things hanging over this campaign. Dana?",

Our excellent reporters Zolan Kanno-Youngs of The New York Times, CNN's MJ Lee, and Alex Burns from POLITICO who we lovingly call Mr. MJ Lee right around here.Yeah, you're welcome. Let's just look because we do have to just do one more beat on the weather or a couple. Give it context because I made a joke like, OK, it's cold in Iowa in January, like of course it is. But it really is on caucus night going to be much colder than we have seen ever. I mean, look at that. And again, negative four, that's going to be the high in Iowa. I mean, we've been in Iowa when it's cold. I was just in Iowa when it's cold, it's hard to imagine how this is not going to impact turnout. ZOLAN KANNO-YOUNGS, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, THE NEW YORK TIMES: I feel like I've thought I knew cold weather being from Massachusetts. But this is I mean, frigid. And, you know, for weeks candidates have gone to Iowa really to build this enthusiasm for this moment -- for this moment to try and encourage turnout here. You know, even DeSantis and Nikki Haley over the past week, you know, doing that as well. But with this weather, I thought also, Zeleny made a good point about particularly with senior citizens as well and those that may have other health conditions. I mean, this could be dangerous. So, we do need to kind of see and assess here and really look at how this will impact turnout and enthusiasm.",

I mean, there are different ways that this could end up panning out. I mean, is it just lower turnout across the board and sort of every candidate feels the effects.Or, you know, is there a scenario where the candidate with the most passionate voters i.e., the Iowans who are like really willing to get in the car, even though there's like 10-feet of snow in front of them. Do they end up having some kind of advantage? I mean, I do think it's interesting. We're hearing a little bit of concern from the Trump campaign, preemptively that they're a little worried the idea that their supporters because they think he has it sort of locked down, maybe they sort of, you know, predict that other people are going to show up and they won't have to.

It's a bigger problem for everyone else than us. What they're suggesting this particular advisor is that if they drop three or four points, that's like, you know, dropping from a very high lead to another very high lead and others don't have that luxury.Nikki Haley, I literally can't comprehend it, it's going to be negative 15. But I'm going to be out there. And I want you to go out there. DeSantis, we look forward to forcing our opponents to try to match our campaign pace, when it hurts to breathe outside.

He has tried to continue with this theme of, look, I am advocating for sort of Trumpism, Trump's policies, but I'm the better person to actually execute it. I don't know if saying that, you know, you are the best person to execute. Trumpism is an effective strategy when you are not the original person doing that.

So, it's clear that basically U.S. patients run out -- ran out here.And what U.S. officials were telling me last night was that it was Tuesday's attacks that were the straw that broke the camel's back, there was some 20 drones fired specifically at U.S. ships in the Red Sea, including a ship carrying jet fuel. And the concern was had one of those drones struck and not been shut down. That it might have sunk that ship and that was the bridge too far. So, the U.S. is responding. What's clear, though, is they do not believe that these attacks have one taken away all of the Houthis' capabilities here or their ambitions frankly, and they do expect the Houthi response. And officials have made it clear to me that this may not in the words of one senior administration official may not be the last word from the U.S. either.
