It also marks the beginning of the end of Donald Trump's historic first criminal trial. The closing arguments will be underway this morning and the jury could be handed the case and begin deliberating as soon as tomorrow.So will Donald Trump become the first former president to be convicted of a crime? That depends on today and will very soon be on the shoulders of 12 New Yorkers and six alternates to decide. With me right now ahead of all of this is defense attorney Randy Zelin, and CNN legal analyst and former U.S. attorney Michael Moore. Michael, put today in perspective for me if you could. What is going to happen -- what needs to happen for either side? MICHAEL MOORE, CNN LEGAL ANALYST, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY (via Webex by Cisco):  Yeah. Well, I'm glad to be with both of you. It is an important day. It's a day, really for the first time, that the lawyers get to argue their position. They've been able to put on their evidence. They've been able to bring out documents. They've been able to make some objections and to sort of give some bluster in the courtroom. But to actually get to tell these jurors out of your own mouth what it is that this -- why this is important, what matters, why this piece of testimony is irrelevant, why this is a lie, why this should not be used as a reason to convict the former president or why through the prosecutor this ties it altogether. So when you talk about closing arguments this is, in fact, the first time they're going to get to argue this case. And so, there are risks to go in too long if you're on either side. You want to get in there and get quick. This jury has sat through now weeks of testimony and trial. You don't want to lose them in a closing argument. Sometimes lawyers have a tendency to lose a good point because they've drawn on too long. But this is a day where they get to tie those loose ends together. And, you know, the defense will be saying look, the state didn't meet its burden. It didn't prove the defendant guilty -- Mr. Trump guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Here are those reasons to doubt. The prosecution will say well, wait now -- don't be caught off by some red herring flying out there. This is -- this doesn't mean anything. They're wanting you to get lost in chasing rabbits instead of actually looking at the meat of this case. And so, those -- that'll be the competing narrative, in some form, that we hear today.",

And so, the law gives them the chance in circumstances like this to come in and be the one and have the chance, at least, to carry that burden forward. I think if Randy was arguing on the other side, they wouldn't have a good chance at carrying it because those are some great points that he brought out here in the argument. But the complaining about Trump about how this thing lays out and what the procedure is, that's just sort of much ado about nothing. I mean, in every courtroom around the country the prosecution gets to conclude if there's been some evidence put on certainly by the defense. I mean, that could be one factor that's considered. But they do bear the burden. So there's nothing that's being done to him. What his -- what he ought to be doing is slapping his lawyers on the back and telling them they've done a good job and to go in there and fight for him, and let's make sure we point out A, B, and C because these are the holes in the state's case.",

The headline in Politico this morning -- the Playbook -- is \"Dems in full-blown 'freakout' over Biden.\" You see it right there in, like, 26-point font. \"Dems in full-blown 'freakout' over Biden\"And they have a quote here from Pete Giangreco, a direct mail guy -- a famous Democratic direct mail guy. And he says, \"There's still a path to win this, but they don't look like a campaign that's embarking on that path right now. If the frame of this race is what was better, the 3.5 years under Biden or four years under Trump, we lose that every day of the week and twice on Sunday.\" So these are Democrats fretting, Paul.",

I think he's done a great job but this fixation on getting credit for his accomplishments I think goes about it the wrong way. Bill Clinton didn't get credit for his economy until Newt Gingrichshut down the government. Barack Obama didn't get credit for Obamacare until the Republicans tried to repeal it. What the Biden campaign needs to do is go on the attack, and the attack needs to be not -- not -- that's right, not oh, Trump is a crook. It should be Trump is a threat. We, together, Biden should say, cut the price of insulin from $300.00 to 35 bucks. Trump is a threat to that. he'll repeal it. We expanded health care and cut your health premiums. Trump wants to repeal that. We produced more energy than ever without sacrificing our environmental laws. Trump wants to sell out to big oil, let them raise your prices, and pollute our environment. No, it's go at Trump as a threat to Biden's accomplishments and that's how Biden gets credit for his accomplishments. And I don't think they're quite there. I think they're simply saying give me a gold star. I did such a good job. And really, I should carry 50 states -- let's be honest -- and the District. You know, I think that's the wrong way to do it. It should be all about Trump as a threat to your middle-class life.",
