Then, the man who spends politically chaos into gold. \"Veep\" creator, Armando Iannucci, talks about his current series, \"Avenue Five\". And finally, the monumental Barbara Chase-Riboud, amid one of her many retrospectives, we discuss the thrilling life that shaped this African American artist. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. November marks the end of this year's tennis season, and what a 2022 it has been. From idols like Roger Federer and Serena Williams, \"Evolving away from the sport\", to heroes of old like Rafael Nadal making unbelievable comebacks. The Spanish king of clay laid claim to being the best ever this year, winning his 22nd Grand Slam at the French Open, extending an all-time record. It's a road he started down when he won his first slam, also in France, at just 19 years old in 2005. And here's our conversation after he won in Paris for an unbeatable record, 14th time.
