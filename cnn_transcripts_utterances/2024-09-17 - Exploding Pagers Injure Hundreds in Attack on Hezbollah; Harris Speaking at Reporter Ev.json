Tonight, thousands are wounded in Lebanon afterdeadly pagers explosion across the country, Hezbollah is pointing the finger at Israel, we'll have more details ahead on this breaking news story. Plus, Sean \"Diddy\" Combs is charged with racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking. The details -- well, rather disturbing. He's due in a federal court this hour, we'll bring that to you live. And extreme weather is causing chaos in Europe right now with catastrophic flooding in central Europe, and deadly fires ranging in Portugal. But first, we begin with an apparent coordinated attack across Lebanon. The Lebanese Health Minister says that at least nine people have been killed and nearly 3,000 others injured when hand-held pages suddenly exploded. Both the government and Hezbollah blame Israel. Hezbollah is vowing revenge. The explosions targeted Hezbollah members, but civilians were also affected including an 8-year-old girl who was killed. Footage of the pages exploding have been circulating, are still circulating on social media. Of course, we want to warn you, the next video is disturbing.

And it is probably one of the most widespread acts of violence to hit across Lebanon since the war with Israel in 2006. There was a Beirut port blast, and that was concentrated in the capital. This hit all around Hezbollah's stronghold it seems in the country. Now, we don't know if some of these devices were in the hands of non-Hezbollah members. There is some suggestion that this may have been a particular kind of device that only that armed militant group used. But it's a shocking violation of their own internal security.

Let me bring in Fawaz Gerges; he's aProfessor of International Relations at the London School of Economics and Political Science. He's also the author of \"What Really Went Wrong: The West and the Failure of Democracy in the Middle East\". And so, Fawaz, good to see you. Let me pick up really where Nick just left off, and that is where that leaves Hezbollah. The group is already saying it will retaliate, blaming, quote, \"criminal Israeli aggression\". What are we likely to see you think? Is it beginning of something bigger as Nic was perhaps suggesting? FAWAZ GERGES, PROFESSOR, INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS, LONDON SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS &amp; POLITICAL SCIENCE:  Well, I have no doubt in my mind that Hezbollah will retaliate. It will not retaliate immediately. Hezbollah does not really basically act out of hand. Hezbollah will assess its options, it's a moment of chaos. It's a moment of volatility. It's one of the greatest security breach of Hezbollah's communications. A large number of Hezbollah's fighters and commanders are injured, it will take Hezbollah quite a few days, but my take on it is that Hezbollah sees this vast attack as a kind of really the first salvo in Israel's all-out war against Hezbollah. And just to add, you know, to what your correspondent said earlier. Hezbollah has been planning for this moment for years. Hezbollah expects such moment. This is an organization, a party, a powerful military organization that has been planning different emergencies. And I take it, even without communications, units will know what to do in such moments. So, even though there's chaos, it's very unsettling for Hezbollah. My take is Hezbollah will retaliate much bigger than it has had before, but at the same time, Isa, Hezbollah will avoid a retaliation that triggers all-out war with Israel. Hezbollah does not want a direct all-out war with Israel. It has been really trying to avoid targeting Israeli civilians for the past 12 months.",

It means a conspiracy involving other people, that he didn't just do this allegedly himself, but had surrounding of individuals, prosecutors alleged that included members of his security team, members of his household staff who essentially worked in order to help traffic these women, drug them, sexually assault them in certain cases. Now, I'll read you part of what this indictment actually entails. You can see here just a slew of allegations as prosecutors allege \"members and associates of the Combs enterprise engaged in and attempted to engage in, among other activities, sex trafficking, forced labor, interstate transportation for purposes of prostitution, coercion and enticement to engage in prostitution, narcotics offences, kidnapping, arson, bribery and obstruction of justice.\" Just a slew of federal allegations there against Combs and his criminal enterprise, they allege.

We were told that they uncovered numerous items, electronic medium, the prosecutors today said that as part of their investigation, they've actually uncovered video that was taken of these women being assaulted, which will all be part of this ongoing prosecution. And of course, you know, this all stems from many of those civil allegations that several women had filed in court against Combs, accusing him of sexual assault. Of course, there was the one dramatic video that CNN broke that occurred. This was an incident in a hotel room here in Los Angeles several years ago, where you can see Combs on videotape brutally assaulting his former girlfriend, there she is there, standing in a lobby. What prosecutors said today is that she was trying to flee that hotel room to escape. And you see him running down the hall, even goes, grabs her, throws her to the ground, starts brutally attacking her, reason I bring this up is because until that video came out, Combs and his team were essentially attacking the women, saying that these accusers were out to get money. That story changed after this came out, Combs issued somewhat of an apology, and so now, here we are now. This investigation now moving to a very dramatic new level. He is now in federal custody.",

But the U.S. will not be drawn on it at this point, saying that they are still gathering information. Now, we're also not going to get a comment, it appears from Israel itself. The Israeli military saying that they won't be commenting on it, not necessarily a surprise. But we also know that the Israeli military has announced that it had a situational assessment on all arenas on Tuesday. So, this was really to make sure of its readiness in both offensive and defensive areas. It was headed up by the chief of staff of the IDF. So, that's really all we'll be hearing from the Israeli side. But Hezbollah has been very clear, in the fact that it believes Israel is responsible, they have said that there will be retribution. Although, of course, it's difficult in these chaotic hours after this attack took place to understand what sort of retaliation that would be, how logistically, technically it would be possible when potentially you have hundreds, if not thousands of Hezbollah operatives injured. And one key method of communicating between the militants, having been taken out. And of course, there will be great reticence to be picking up phones or to be communicating in the regular ways after such an attack. Now, it has been called by the Lebanese Minister of Health, a mass casualty event, 2,800 people being injured, well over 100 of those critically wounded, as you say, Isa, as well, nine have been killed. And what we have heard is that hospitals in southern Lebanon that are trying to cope with the influx of injuries have been overwhelmed, that they are working at over capacity. We know that the Ministry of Health has told health officials to come back to work as soon as this happened, to make sure that they had the personnel available to deal with the sheer number of casualties. Now, what we understand is that much of the injuries are to the hands, the face, and also to the abdomen, clearly showing where you would usually carry a pager, potentially hooked on to onto the top of trousers, so that is the area that would have been injured.

In their belief, Israel has managed to significantly infiltrate what they believe to be a fairly low tech, but also a secured way of communicating with each other.

      "sentences": "Paula Hancock's there for us. Appreciate it. Thank you very much.Well, Vice President Kamala Harris is about to speak before members of the National Association of Black Journalists. I want you to listen in. Have a listen to this. KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT AND U.S. PRESIDENTIAL DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE:  -- unemployment since the Great Depression. We came in during the worst public health epidemic in centuries. We came in after the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War. And a lot of it due in large part to the mismanagement by the former president, as it relates to COVID and obviously January 6th. And we had, then, a lot of work to do to clean up a mess. As of today, we have created over 16 million new jobs, over 800,000 new manufacturing jobs. We have the lowest black unemployment rate in generations. We have invested in small businesses, and I'm going to -- there to the benefit of many people, but including black small businesses, some of the highest rate of creation of new black small businesses in years. We have done the work of capping the cost of prescription medication for our seniors for issues like insulin and again, I'm speaking to the black journalists who care about all people, but in particular, I'll talk about the impact on black people, where we know black folks are 60 times more likely -- 60 percent, excuse me, more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes. And we have now finally capped the cost of insulin for our seniors at $35 a month, capped the cost of prescription medication for our seniors at $2,000 a year because we, unlike the former president who promised to do it, we, finally, have allowed Medicare to negotiate drug prices against the big pharmaceutical companies. And these are just some of the accomplishments. Is the price of grocery still too high? Yes. Do we have more work to do? Yes. And I will tell you, I do believe that I offer a new generation of leadership for our country that is about, in particular, turning the page on an era that sadly has shown us attempts by some to incite fear, to create division in our country, and to do the work that is about bringing some level of optimism, and dare I say ambition, about what I know is possible in our country. And so, my plan for the economy includes what I imagine and believe and call an opportunity economy. What we can do to grow an opportunity economy where all people have access to the resources to compete, to apply their incredible work ethic, their ambition, their aspirations and their dreams and actually, not just get by, but get ahead. And I can talk in more detail about it, but specifically, I'll mention a few things. One of the big issues that affects people right now, in terms of the economy and their economic wellbeing, is we have a shortage of housing supply. It's too expensive. People can't afford to buy a home. You know, we grew up, our parents, where they had the ability to somehow believe the American dream was attainable. Not so much for younger working people. And I recognize that. So, my approach is a new approach, which is to say, let's just take this and deal with it head on. And part of my approach is to say, I'm going to employ and engage the private sector, in particular home builders with tax credits, to give them the incentive to create new housing, 3 million by the end of my first term. And understanding that not everybody is, you know, handed a silver spoon but works hard and is trying to save up for a down payment. Part of my plan, under my opportunity economy, is to give first time home buyers a $25,000 down payment assistance so they can just get their foot in the door to be able to then engage in what will prove to be their opportunity to build intergenerational wealth. And here's my personal experience coming at that. I grew up a middle-class kid. My mother was hard working. She raised me and my sister, Maya. She saved up. And it was only by the time I was a teenager that she could afford to actually buy her first home. And I know, and I identify with, I know where I come from.",

And it's a squeeze for millions of people. In some parts of the country, it costs more for child care than for rents. I think Bloomberg recently reported an average of $33,000 a year. So, I'm just wondering, you mentioned that in your opportunity economy, a child tax credit, but that's just one part of an ecosystem.",

My plan is that no family, no working family should pay more than 7 percent of their income in child care. Because I know that when you talk about the return on that investment, allowing people to work allowing people to pursue their dreams in terms of how they want to work, where they want to work, benefits us all, it strengthens the entire economy. We saw, for example, during the pandemic what happened, and it sadly has dissipated as a conversation that we need to resuscitate, which is the number of women that had to leave the workforce because of a lack of child care and home health care. And so, many of our families, in particular women, end up carrying the responsibility. Men do too, of course. What we call people who are in the sandwich generation.",

      "sentences": "Who have young children and are also taking care of their parents. And it is just absolutely too expensive for them to be able to work and dothat. So, my plan is not only about 7 percent of income for working people for childcare, but also, we need to do better for our childcare providers and our home health care providers in terms of ensuring that they receive the wages that they deserve based on the dignity of their work. I have spent time with home health care providers and their work is some of the most taxing work you can imagine. And I actually, when my mother was sick with cancer, did a lot in terms of taking care of her. And the work that is about taking care of a loved one, in particular an elder, is extraordinarily heavy in terms of the emotional toll, the time it takes and we do it because that is what we do, but not everyone has the ability to take time from work to do it. And they need help, and we need to make sure we have home health care workers that can help them. But I want to also get back to the earlier point that you made about extending the child tax credit. So, part of my new approach is we need to expand the child tax credit. And so, part of my plan that is under an opportunity economy is to extend and expand the child tax credit to $6,000, so that young families, in particular, for the first year of their child's life, which is an extraordinarily important time in their development, have the resources to be able to buy a crib, buy a car seat, buy children's clothing, and not have to worry about whether they're going to be able to meet their other needs. And I will -- I don't need to remind anybody here, especially these esteemed journalists, but when we expanded the child tax credit a couple years ago, we reduced black child poverty by half. And so, again, if you talk about the benefit, and if you think about the benefit to the economy overall, it strengthens our economy to do things like pay attention to affordable child care, affordable home health care, and extending the child tax credit.",
