I attribute that to the fact that there are a number of voters that are just absolutely disillusioned and disenchanted and disappointed. You know, politics has been a -- an -- it's been rough, you know, these past several years, especially coming out of the darkest days of the pandemic. And while there has been progress, progress has been very slow. You know, the President oftentimes talks about the government giving folks that breathing room.

And a decision was made four years ago to remove a statue of Roger Taney, that had been on statehouse grounds for 100 years, because we in Maryland decided that symbols are important. So I think at this point, we have an opportunity to rename the bridge after a Great Marylanders. His name was Congressman Parren Mitchell. He was a founder of the Congressional Black Caucus. He represented the district in which that bridge is located. And more importantly, he represents inclusion. He represents someone who was trying to make America better and not bitter.

Economist with the National Bureau of Economic Research sent out more than 80,000 fake resumes to Fortune 500 companies.And they changed applicant's names to suggest that they were white or black or male or female. So they used Lakisha (ph) or Emily (ph) on one, Greg (ph) versus Jamal (ph). Well, they found a typical employer called back the presumed white applicant around 9 percent more than the black ones. But for the worst offenders, these are auto parts or service companies, car dealers, that number rose to roughly 24 percent. Now as bad as that is, it's actually better than the original study 20 years ago, that found that white names got 50 percent more callbacks in that era.

Others ask why does this matter? Well, if the people on the screen who look most like you, our gang or cartel members, maids or housekeepers have a stereotypical accent or over sexualized, there is an impact that if they show up at all, that's what many Latinos say they see reflected back on them in the media.Listen to this. There's this recent USC study. It looked at lead or co-lead movie roles from 2007 to 2022, 15 years, 1,600 films, 75 Hispanic or Latino roles, 75 out of 1,600 films. The National Hispanic Media Coalition says this is just one piece of a big problem. And this week they came out with a blueprint they hope can help. Part of the campaign is actor Gabriel Luna, of course you'll recognize him from HBO's \"The Last of Us\" he stars in it alongside Pedro Pascal. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And whether it be the indigenous community or the Latino community, I think that there is, there's very, very little opportunity. When it comes -- it just comes down from the top.
