Israel admits that its forces unintentionally struck innocent people. A decisive response, that's Iran's promise after accusing Israel of striking its consulate in Damascus. And swapping legal trials for campaign trails, Donald Trump sets off to Michigan and Wisconsin. We want to begin with outrage and demands for accountability. That's after an Israeli strike killed seven aid workers who were delivering food in Gaza. World Central Kitchen says that two of its armored cars branded with the charity's logo were hit. That's despite coordinating movements with the IDF. It calls it an unforgivable targeted attack. Israel says that it was unintentional and is promising to investigate. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It is not clear the World Central Kitchen has not given any confirmation that that ship actually touched land and offloaded anything. If it did, that would explain this convoy unloading some of this aid into this warehouse. If it didn't actually make it to land, then that means that it's not going to, because that ship, it appears, is headed back toward the direction of Cyprus, at least from what we can tell on publicly available tracking websites, marinetraffic.com is one of them.And so, whether that aid eventually comes back to Gaza is an open question.

I recently went to the region and visited Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, Israel and Oman. And I think President Biden has done a good job of containing the risk of regional escalation since the beginning of this war by Israel against Hamas.But, Iran's response to Israel's attack may well be the next step or stage in escalation regionally.

Wade is something that President Trump has described as one of his greatest accomplishments.So, now we'll put to the test whether or not millions of Floridians go to the polls and vote to restore reproductive freedom or vote to embrace a six-week abortion ban. It is unusual for women who are pregnant to even know that they are pregnant that early in their pregnancy. And so, this is just the latest of many examples across the country of Republican state legislatures or other Republican leaders pushing the boundaries now that Roe v. Wade is no longer there to protect reproductive freedom nationally. So, I would agree that Florida is now in play because this will mobilize millions of voters to come up to vote, to take their stance on reproductive freedom.

Botswana and Cabo Verde are great examples of multiparty democracies that are stable, that are -- that have low corruption and high government service, and where our partnership has made a lasting difference. The picture that you're showing right now is from a community school in Malawi that was constructed with U.S. assistance.Malawi and Zambia and Angola are different countries. There are countries where there are critical public health challenges, where there is significant poverty, where there is hunger because of drought and climate change, and where American investment through PEPFAR, the program to combat HIV/AIDS that was started by President Bush and has been sustained by every President since then. PEPFAR has made a huge difference. The life expectancy of the average person in Zambia, in Malawi, in Angola has increased by 50 percent because of our investments in combating transmissible diseases like tuberculosis, malaria, and HIV. So, we had a chance to visit hospitals and teaching schools for nurses, a chance to visit Millennium Challenge compact projects that are contributing to economic development, and a chance to visit schools and get a sense of what difference America makes in this region. This is also a region that is critical to the great power competition between the United States, Russia and China, because of the vast storehouse of critical minerals and strategic minerals that are in the north of Zambia as well as in parts of Angola and Malawi. Our principal interest is in promoting democracy and stability, in seeing the people of this region develop on their own terms and pursue their own futures, but frankly also to push back on Russian and Chinese influence in these countries, particularly Angola and Zambia, that for many years were close allies and partners of China and Russia, and are today much more open to partnering with the United States on their path forward.",

It happens at a primary school near the capital Helsinki. Finnish police say that they have a 12-year-old suspect in custody. This person is a fellow student of the victims. Sources tell CNN that the Biden administration is close to approving a major fighter jet sale to Israel. The deal reportedly includes up to 50 F-15 jets. It's expected to be worth more than $18 billion. It would be the largest military sale to Israel since the country went to war with Hamas after the October 7 attacks. The sale is likely to be hotly debated in Congress, particularly by members of the President's own party, as they've called for restricting military aid to Israel. And World Central Kitchen says it is pausing operations in Gaza. That's after an Israeli strike killed seven of its aid workers who are delivering food. Israel calls it a targeted attack.

But, many women don't even realize they're pregnant at six weeks, which means that people in Florida will likely have to travel out of state for abortion access. Now, voters will get a chance to weigh in on this as well. There are lots of moving parts to this.

In the first case, the court ruled that Florida's privacy clause in the state constitution does not protect the right to an abortion. And so, that cleared the way for this six- week ban to take effect in 30 days. As you noted, Florida now joins a number of states in the south, across the U.S. that have some type of restriction on abortions, if not an outright ban.Now, Planned Parenthood of Florida said that this decision is not only going to impact women that live in Florida, but women that live in some of these other states that had been coming to Florida in recent years to try to get access to an abortion, because now they have to figure out how they're going to get to a state without some of these type of restrictions. Now, some abortion providers anticipated the court's decision yesterday, saying that they were focusing some of their efforts now on trying to move some of their services to some of these other states across the U.S. that, again, do not have any restrictions on abortions. Now, the Supreme Court, the state Supreme Court also ruled that yesterday that voters, they will be the ones to decide whether or not to expand access to abortion. The justices here in Florida approved the wording of a constitutional amendment that would protect the right to an abortion in Florida. Now, the ballot amendment would prohibit the restriction of any abortion around the week before viability, rather, which is around a 24-week mark of a pregnancy, Rahel. It is important to note here that 60 percent of voters in Florida would have to approve this constitutional amendment in November in order for it to take effect. You can expect that these two rulings will no doubt figure into the presidential race here in Florida, considering that historically, Florida has come out on the Republican side of things. However, Democrats believe that these two rulings will energize their base, will get voters out, and they believe could ultimately put Florida in play. Rahel.",

We shall see. Carlos Suarez in South Florida, Carlos, thanks so much.All right. Let's bring in our political panel to discuss this further. Joining me now is CNN Political Commentator S.E. Cupp, and Democratic Strategist Mark Longabaugh. Good to see you both. So, S.E., should Republicans be concerned about a potential political backlash here after these decisions in Florida? What do you think? S.E. CUPP, CNN POLITICAL REPORTER: Yeah. We have a number of metrics to prove why they should be worried, one were the 2022 midterms in which reproductive rights figured very heavily into the decision making of a lot of voters. Two, we have a number of states, red states, states that went for Donald Trump, like Ohio and Kansas, where these effective bans were tried and they were voted down by those voters in those states. So, the math isn't great. We also have polling that just shows most people are not for a six-week ban. Most people think this is too extreme. And we have all of these test cases. In the news, people who have come up against these regressive, puritanical laws that really are impractical and make having a family or deciding not to have a family, are really impossible, sometimes criminal decision to make and process to have. So, there is a lot of evidence for why this is not a good idea strategically and politically for Republicans. You don't have to look too far to find out how this goes.",

I mean, I think this is an explosive decision in two ways. One, the Florida Supreme Court heightened the saliency of this issue by approving this draconian ban, and at the same time permitting the ballot initiative to go forward. I think it could cost Republicans both the state at the presidential level and certainly at the Senate level.

I think the interesting thing will be to see what Trump says about this. Will he take credit for this, for sort of pushing this? He has said in the past that a six-week ban was unpopular.

And to pick up on this -- the point about Ohio, just to look at the numbers there, that ballot initiative in Ohio passed with 56 percent of the vote. Joe Biden only got 45 percent of the vote there. I mean, that's like a 10, 12 point swing. Florida is much, much closer than that. Arizona is much, much closer than that. This issue really could cost the Republicans dozens of states. And by the way, we should also look at the Senate in terms of this is on the ballot in Montana where it may help test or hold on to a very competitive seat.

In New Hampshire, they said it would take us months to get signatures. We got them in one day in Utah. We got them in one week during a blizzard.

And there is curiosity in a third-party campaign. The problem for RFK is, I think the more he speaks and let you know what he thinks, the more turned off, I think, a majority of people will be. But, I don't know. Conventional wisdom, and I see a lot of pundits and even the Biden team is saying that this is going to cut into Biden voters, I do not buy it.If you watched that interview with our Erin Burnett last night, this was not a guy looking for Democratic votes. This was a guy who called Biden a bigger threat than Trump to democracy, who praised Trump voters, who said Democrats have forgotten them. He spreads conspiracy theories. He is anti-vaxxed. He hired -- appointed a woman who believes in the same as his VP (ph). This is not a guy who is trying to get Democrats to vote for him. I think he is playing for Republican voters who might be a little turned off by Trump's crazy, but unfortunately, they'll just find more crazy over in the RFK camp.",

I mean, the Green Party was on the ballot in 30 states. Libertarians were on ballot everywhere. There were four or five others, and this is in 2020, they were on the ballot in more than 15 states and they didn't have a billionaire running mate.

There is no real news out there that I've seen that can explain this move today. Yesterday, though, we do know that the company lost a lot of value because they explained their 2023 results. Right? They lost $58 million. They have very little revenue, just over $4 million in revenue. And so, this does underscore why some experts are warning that this company is overvalued, right, that it is -- looks more and more like a meme stock.So, Rahel, I think that we should expect more turbulence from Truth Social and Trump Media ahead because the stock just keeps going up and down dramatically each day.",
