This dash cam footage shows the orange glow from an apparent Ukrainian drone that crashed outside Moscow. Russian defense officials say it's one of four drones they intercepted Tuesday. Aviation authorities temporarily closed all of the airports in the Moscow region.And Russia's Defense Ministry says it destroyed a Ukrainian reconnaissance boat on the Black Sea, which was spotted near a Russian gas production facility. For its part, Ukraine says it carried out a successful attack on a Russian military base on Monday, claiming one of its drones damaged at least one aircraft. And CNN correspondent Clare Sebastian joins me now live from London. Good morning to you, Clare. We are seeing a rather dramatic uptick in drone attacks on Russia.

      "sentences": "Yeah, Rosemary, it is a dramatic uptick. All but a handful of days in the month of August have not seen Russia accuse Ukraine of attacking its territory with drones. And Moscow in particular has become a target. This seems to be about two things, one, causing disruption, angst, anxiety. Airport disruption, for example, seems to be one of the hallmarks of this now, as we saw today in Moscow.And that, I think, is what these attacks in Moscow today represent, obviously Russia is saying they shot down these drones, but you can see those images there, a high-rise apartment building in the suburban town of Krasnogorsk just outside Moscow was damaged. This was in not only the same town, but really the same area of that town where the government buildings of the Moscow region are based. So unclear if that was an actual target, but certainly that will have, you know, put people on edge. I think, look, there's also military targets here. You talked about the Sheikhovka air base that Ukraine is now claiming responsibility for hitting on Monday, claiming to have destroyed or at least damaged a plane there. That is also part of what we're seeing. Russia says that on Saturday another airbase was hit. So this is sort of the SAS style tactics of going as far as possible behind enemy lines and trying to disrupt military installations, logistics, things like that, all trying to ease pressure on the front lines, and in that vein, the Russian Ministry of Defense is also saying that it destroyed a Ukrainian reconnaissance boat in the Black Sea near Russian gas production facilities. The Black Sea also has emerged really in the last month as a much more active front in this conflict, really ever since Russia pulled out of that grain deal. Rosemary?",

The first one was actually back in March to Moscow to see his quote unquote \"dear friend\" Putin. That kind of dynamic really underscores what you and David have been saying. That is, despite these countries' vastly different political and economic models, these leaders are really bonded over their shared grievances, if you will, but also desire to change the current global order.[03:15:09] And that, of course, is why they were discussing not only the potential expansion group but also as David said the plan reduction on their reliance on the U.S. dollar for example all of that of course could potentially increase the impact of the BRICS group but also by extension the leadership role occupied by Xi Jinping at a time when tensions remain high between Beijing and Washington. That's why we have seen Chinese officials and state media here really drumming up this narrative of emerging nations around the world coming together to counter what they describe as the U.S. policy of unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdictions. But Xi Jinping also arrived in South Africa at a time when the economy, China's economy, the world's second biggest face strongest, its strongest headwinds in decades when they have a myriad problems here at home. So that in a way is why he's seeking new markets for China, new supply chains for China. But also that could also make some more constraint in terms of the projects he can invest and finance in the global South, particularly in Africa. That's why some experts say that Beijing leadership is now switching gear to focus more on so-called low-cost, high-impact strategies by, for example, improving party-to- party relations by touting the superiority of the Chinese system, by also bringing more African military officers to China for training, not to mention expanding China's soft power. CCTV, the state media outlet here, for example, debuting the second season of a show called Classics quoted by Xi Jinping across Africa and, Rosemary, undoubtedly Chinese officials hope that is going to be a huge hit.

A short time ago, the country's Supreme Court gave him eight years in prison for corruption. Thaksin was ousted in a 2006 military coup, which he attended, while he attended a UN meeting in New York. He was convicted of corruption during his self-imposed exile. Let's turn to CNN's Paula Hancocks. She joins us live from Seoul. for us. So Paula, why is he returning now?

The Pheu Thai party, which has been winning recent elections, not the most recent one, of course, has been backed by him. His daughter is in politics. It's a real political dynasty.So the fact that he is back in Thailand is significant. It is something that he has been saying he would do for some time. He repeatedly put that on hold and postponed his return. But he has returned today and he has been greeted by supporters at the airport and he was then taken to the Supreme Court where he was sentenced to eight years for previous corruption charges. He was convicted while he was in absentia. He has said that he believes in the past that those charges were politically motivated. But what this timing tells us is that it's the very same day as a new Prime Minister could potentially be voted in the government. Now we know that in the coming hours there will be a vote. There is only one candidate that will be voted on. And that is a member of the tax and affiliated party, Pheu Thai, Srettha Thavisin. We know that this is a party that also has his daughter involved, but it is Srettha Thavisin that is the candidate, potentially the next Prime Minister. And he has also tweeted just this morning when Thaksin returned, saying he congratulated Thaksin and his family for returning to Thailand. So that shows the relationship between Thaksin Shinawatra and the Pheu Thai party still. The controversy as well comes when you look at what Pheu Thai is doing. They announced on Monday that they would form an alliance of 11 parties. Worth mentioning though, they were not the party who secured the most votes in the May election. That was the progressive party Move Forward who was unable to create a government as it was blocked by the conservative and military-backed parties. So Pheu Thai has now said that they will form this alliance not including the party who won the most votes, but also including two military-backed parties, which is something during campaigning. They said they would not do it'll be interesting to see what the progressive and the youth vote makes of that, Rosemary?",

When he came to the microphone to give his statements, he said the thing that a lot of folks I've been hearing from for two weeks have been saying, that he wants Maui, the people of Maui, to help determine how this place is rebuilt. There is a question asked, who will have the most influence in that conversation going forward? Locals here, working class Native Hawaiians and multi-generational locals are worried of disaster capitalism, people moving in to exploit this and buy up as much land as they can in this paradise and rebuild it for their interests as well. The president says, promises that won't happen. It remains to be seen. There's a lot of forces at play here right now. He did serve as empathizer-in-chief after five days of being mostly silent on the issue publicly, but the governor said he was working behind the scenes to assure first responders that the feds had their back on this. He shared the stories we're familiar with of losing his daughter and wife and wondering if his sons had survived a car accident early in his political career. And that's what so many people here are going through now. The list of the missing, according to the mayor of Maui, was whittled from over 2,000 by the FBI and authorities down to around 850 now. That still seems impossibly high this many days, almost two weeks now after the fire broke out. Forensic anthropologists, though, say historically, scenes like this can take months or even years to sort out the missing. You can hope there's still some confusion as to who's on that list. But the real heartbreak is to think about the children who were left home that day. There are parents in this town who lost their kids. There are kids who lost their parents. We're unclear if President Biden was able to meet with any of those. We know he did meet with Archie Kalepa, historic figure here. Uncle Archie, as he is known, a hall of fame waterman who led relief efforts from a sort-of a cul-de-sac command post we went into as well. Some of those who have been very active on social media were at the table at least with President Biden for the few hours he was here. But now, all eyes are on this place to see how soon they can find the huge number of missing. And make peace with the families. And how exactly they will rebuild. Bill Weir, CNN, Maui.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) COREN (voice-over): A toxic blight on Japan's coastline rising like a monument to the memory of nuclear disaster and bottling up its dangerous legacy. Just over 12 years ago, a 9.0 magnitude earthquake off Japan's coast triggered a tsunami. Power was cut at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant. Its cooling systems stopped working, and the plant went into meltdown. Water was pumped in to reduce the temperature of the reactor cores, becoming radioactive. 1.3 million metric tons has been kept here ever since. It's been treated to remove and dilute the most dangerous elements. On Thursday, Japan will begin to release that water into the Pacific Ocean.
