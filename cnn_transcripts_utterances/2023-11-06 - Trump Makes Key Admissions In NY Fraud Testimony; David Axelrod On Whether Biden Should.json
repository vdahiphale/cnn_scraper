Plus, large explosions are rocking Gaza, tonight, as Israel claims it has isolated Gaza City, while striking 450 targets, in just the last 24 hours. And alarm bells are sounding, tonight, for Democrats, because Donald Trump is ahead of President Biden, in these States, that could decide the 2024 race, one year out from the election. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Under oath, and off the rails, that is really the only way, to describe the four hours, of extraordinary testimony, that was wild, even by the standards of Donald Trump. The former President repeatedly got into it with the judge, who will decide his fate, at this civil fraud trial, beginning really just minutes after he took the stand. At one point, Judge Arthur Engoron, threatened to dismiss Trump, from the witness stand, warning him not to give speeches, when he was being asked direct questions, yes-or-no questions. At one point, the judge noted, quote, \"This is not a political rally.\" He even urged Trump's lawyers, who were sitting there, in the courtroom, to intervene, saying, quote, \"I beseech you to control him, if you can. If you can't, I will.\" It was only when Trump walked out of the courtroom, after a break that was ordered by the judge, to have a conversation with Trump, and his attorneys, that he zipped his lips. And I'm being literal here. He made the gesture, to reporters. He went back in the courtroom, after that. And later, when his testimony did finally wrap, he had this to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, 45TH U.S. PRESIDENT: I think it went very well. I think you were there and you listened, and you see what a scam this is. This is a case that should have never been brought. The fraud was on behalf of the court. I think you saw what I had to say today, and it was very conclusive. Everything we did was absolutely right.

When he was asked whether he had maintained accurate books and records from 2014, he told the court, quote, \"I hope so.\" I'm joined now by former Superior Court Judge, LaDoris Hazzard Cordell; and former federal prosecutor, and CNN Senior Legal Analyst, Elie Honig.

So, through all the drama and the spectacle, this really was a debacle, in substance, I agree with the judge, for Donald Trump.And there were a couple of key moments that stood out to me, where Donald Trump really made important concessions. First of all, one of the things I was wondering going in is, is he going to defend these valuations? Is he going to say, \"No, we actually got it right, when we said Mar-a-Lago was worth $500 million?\" Turns out, he literally doubled down. He said, \"No, that's actually worth a billion dollars,\" which is a surprising legal tack. The other thing he did was he simultaneously tried to distance himself, from the valuations. He said, \"We're going to bring in the very big bankers.\" OK, I guess, he's saying these people from Mazars, these accounts, they're going to come in and explain it. But in another really key point, to me the most important sentence of the day, Trump said something like, \"I saw those statements. I reviewed them. And at times, I gave input.\" And it was a quick little moment. But that's something that I think the A.G.'s office is going to latch on to, because he acknowledges, he knew them, and he knew enough to even give input, into those statements. So, I agree with you. I think his testimony was inherently contradictory, and a mess. But there are some real useful pieces, in there, for the A.G.'s office.",

His own former aides say as much. But these new numbers, from the New York Times and the Siena College poll show that the incumbent President does have a lot of ground to make up, before the election, just 364 days away. Here's why. Look at these polls. Right now, based on these numbers, Donald Trump is holding a solid lead, in four critical battleground States, that really could decide the fate, of the 2024 race. He is up in Nevada, Georgia, Arizona and Michigan. In both Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, the President and Trump, right now, are within the margin of error. If you compare it to Biden's numbers, in 2020, he's down in some of those key States that put him in the White House, like Arizona, and Georgia. To break down these numbers, here with me now, CNN Political Commentator, Karen Finney, who was the Communications Director, for the Democratic National Committee; and Kristen Soltis Anderson, a CNN Political Commentator, and Republican strategist, and pollster. I'm so glad you're both here with me, on these numbers, tonight. And Karen, I mean, when you look at them, it's serious erosion, in States, that Biden needs.

KRISTEN SOLTIS ANDERSON, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATORAnd I will agree completely with Karen, that a year out from the election, nobody needs to panic over any poll numbers. But I do think that this poll does give us some clues as to why this is the case. When voters in this poll were asked, \"Do you think that Joe Biden's policies have helped or hurt you, personally, when it comes to your economic situation?\" They say, \"Hurt.\" And then, when they ask people, to think back, on Trump's presidency, by almost a 20-point margin, they say that Trump's economic policies helped them. Now again, there's plenty of time, for lots of ads on the airwaves, to persuade voters otherwise. But, right now, whether it's issues like the economy, or like national security, voters are looking back at Trump, and they're saying, \"Hey, maybe it wasn't so bad.\"",

Why would voters say they think these policies may have harmed them, instead of helped them? Again, that's where I go back to. Clearly, something, there's a disconnect. And the other thing in the poll that I thought was interesting, that I think we'll be talking about, in the days and weeks to come, was the fact that when they then also asked people, whether if President -- former President Trump was convicted of a crime, would you vote for him?

There have been a lot of plans, rooted about for, an international peacekeeping force. But the reality is there are not a lot of countries that are eager to send their own troops into Gaza.

They're facing all these calls, from world leaders, to find a way, to get a ceasefire, humanitarian pause, tactical pause, whatever you want to call it. I mean, look at, over the weekend, you can see these pictures that happened. There were protesters, pro-Palestinian protesters, outside the White House. This is paint, I should note. But this is something that they were removing, from outside the White House, today, as all of these protesters were there, making very clear their feelings, on this, with this red graffiti. I covered the White House for several years. There were always protesters out there. I don't know if I've ever seen anything like this, though.",

Will that change the outcome? Look, we'll have to wait and see. Obviously, there's a reason why the GOP Secretary of State is doing that.
