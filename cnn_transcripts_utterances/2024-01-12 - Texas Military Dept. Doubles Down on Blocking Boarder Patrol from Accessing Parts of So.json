But let me get you up to speed as to how all of this started. It was Wednesday evening when Texas authorities started putting up razor wire fencing and gates around a public park, shocking local officials. Well, the situation escalated when the state of Texas took the extraordinary step of blocking Border Patrol from that public park, not only from that public park, which Border Patrol uses the boat launch at that public park to launch their boats to get access to the Rio Grande, but also to a staging area that they use during migrant surges and also to miles of the river. And the Texas military department, which are the state authorities that are there, doubling down saying that they're not giving Border Patrol access. Saying in part in a statement, quote: The current posture is to prepare for future illegal immigrant surges and to restrict access to organizations that perpetuate illegal immigration crossings in a city park at the Rio Grande and the greater Eagle Pass area. But Governor Abbott taking it a step further today during a press conference, saying that the state of Texas has the authority to do this. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. GREG ABBOTT (R-TX): So Texas has the legal authority to control ingress and egress into any geographic location in the state of Texas, and that authority is being asserted with regard to that park in Eagle Pass, Texas, to maintain operational control.

The numbers at the U.S. southern border have plummeted significantly. Apprehensions back in mid- December were about 10,000 migrants a day along the U.S. southern border. That dropped to about 3,000 per day in January. Now, in Eagle Pass, the epicenter of all this latest battle, they're about 500 per day this week. And so that also raises questions about why is the state of Texas doing this at this point in time? Back to you guys.",

And then within the next 60 days, if he wants this operation to continue, he's going to have to come to Congress to ask for support.But look, the Republican-led House right now can't even pass the simplest procedural votes. The House came to a standstill again this week on a procedural vote, just to get to the vote to actually vote yea or nay, on a piece of legislation. So expecting that the House of Representatives, under this Republican leadership, is going to secure the security of the -- the national security of the United States, that's a longshot right now. I'm embarrassed to say that, as a member of the House myself. But that's part of the context here for why the president just had to take decisive action, which is exactly what the administration did.",

Then you had special ops advisory assistance at a pretty high level that then quickly got out of Dodge, out of Israel. Then you had U.S. strikes in Syria against proxies, in Iraq including one in Baghdad, now what we've seen in Yemen overnight. The U.S. says it doesn't want to make this a broader conflict.

And I think that's the most important reason why the president took this action. There are a lot of militant groups like the Houthis in Yemen who are trying escalation. They are trying to instigate a broader regional war.That's what these terrorist groups want. Hamas has been very explicit in this. They want the other terrorist groups in the region to join in. And so what the United States is doing with its presence and with these deterrent strikes is saying that's not going to happen. You act up, you conduct terrorist activities against peaceful international shipping, we're going to hit you back and prevent that from happening again. So there are people who will say that this is escalation. I think it's exactly the opposite. It's deterrence. It's exactly the message we need to send to these militant groups, to these terrorists in the Middle East that this kind of violence won't stand and we're not going to allow it to instigate a broader regional war.",

But I do think there is diplomacy going on behind the scenes, Brianna, to say to the Israelis, be careful.So there are a lot of ways in which the U.S. presence in the region right now is preventing a wider regional conflict. It's slapping down these terrorist attacks, the Houthis from Yemen as we saw last night, the terrorist attacks in Iraq against U.S. troops. It's having close consultation with our allies, including the Israelis, saying you've got to tread carefully here and not spark a wider conflict. There are a lot of ways in which the U.S. is playing an important role here because we don't want a broader Middle East war.",

At the end of the day, this white supremacist's life will be coming to an end. I just don't necessarily like how it's going to come to an end. I mean, he's going to know his death day eventually. He's going to be given a date in which he'll no longer be here.On 5/14, Geraldine Talley, my mother, didn't know this would be her last day on Earth. Celestine Chaney didn't know this would be her last day on Earth. Ruth Whitfield didn't know this would be her last day on Earth. Zaire Goodman didn't know that this would be the day he'll get shot and have bullet fragments still in his body. That's going to affect him for the rest of his life. So I feel, you know, why does this white supremacist who committed this act of racist domestic terrorism, he gets that privilege to know when he's going to die? For me, I would love for him to rot in a supermax prison or stay here in county jail somewhere near the city in which he caused all of this hate and chaos. I want him to constantly be surrounded by the same individuals that he tried to kill. I want every second of the rest of his life to be in constant turmoil, not knowing that this is going to be the day that somebody tries to kill him because he tried to kill people that look like me. I want him to constantly fear that this could be the day he's going to die. I want him to constantly know that he's going to be assaulted, possibly assaulted by multiple individuals with no guards around. I want everything and everyone that he's ever loved to suffer. I want people who had any idea what type of monster this person was. I want the person who sold him this semi-automatic illegally modified weapon. I want all of these people to suffer. I want his life, the rest of whatever life he has, to be filled with pain, misery, and just unimaginable suffering. And for as long as I'm living, whether that be 20 years or whether that be another 60 years, I want to personally see him suffer to the point that he can't take it no more. But I just feel for him to be given his day of death, I think this is a coward's way out. And just very disrespectful to the families of 5/14 and anybody affected by 5/14.",
