Later this morning, Camp David is where U.S. President Joe Biden will host the first trilateral summit between the U.S., Japan, and South Korea.Now the summit will be brief, likely only several hours, but it could be hugely consequential. It follows President Biden's sideline meeting with the two leaders at the G7 in Hiroshima last May. And the goal here is pretty simple. Give two vital allies who've never liked each other very much a chance to work together with the U.S. to counter China's rising influence in the Indo-Pacific. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol had this to say as they prepared to depart for the U.S. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YOON SUK-YEOL, SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT (through translator): The Republic of Korea-U.S.-Japan Summit that will be held at Camp David will set a new milestone in trilateral cooperation contributing to peace and prosperity on the Korean Peninsula and in the Indo-Pacific region.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): All eyes on the skies over North Korea. South Korea's spy agency telling lawmakers in Seoul. Pyongyang is planning a provocative show of force including an intercontinental ballistic missile launch. The military is detecting signs of possible ICBM launch preparations, monitoring active movement of ICBM launch-related vehicles in Pyongyang, expecting drills including tactical nuclear capable missile launches in the coming days. The latest intelligence as North Korea faces growing International pressure. U.S. and South Korean military exercises begin next week. North Korea considers the annual drills a dress rehearsal for war. Those drills coming as President Joe Biden prepares to host the leaders of Japan and South Korea on Friday at Camp David. China and North Korea high on the agenda. At the U.N. Security Council, the first meeting in more than five years on North Korean human rights. A North Korean defector telling the council, the government turns our blood and sweat into a luxurious life for the leadership and missiles that blast our hard work into the sky. The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights says many North Koreans face extreme hunger, acute medicine shortages, claiming the U.N. and NGOs remain barred from the country. Two nations not barred from North Korea, Russia and China. Two patrons with power to veto biting Security Council sanctions. Both sent high-level delegations to Pyongyang last month. Leader Kim Jong-un showing off his latest ICBMs and drones, analysts say, bear striking resemblance to U.S. military models. Suspicion is growing. North Korea may have plans to secretly provide weapons for Russia's war in Ukraine. So far, no hard evidence. But South Korea's spy agency expects growing military cooperation, warning of a possible transfer of Russia's core nuclear and missile technology to North Korea. For nations trying to contain the North Korea nuclear threat, analysts say the worst may be yet to come. Will Ripley, CNN. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The historical grievances and often hostile relationship between South Korea and Japan, America's two most important allies in the region.And yet President Yoon and Prime Minister Kishida, they are putting that to the side to fly into Camp David a little bit later today in Maryland and meet with President Biden for this one-day summit. We heard from the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken earlier and he said that this meeting will give the three heads of state a chance to talk about concrete steps towards maintaining peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region. Look at its core, Camp David is about dealing with, as you say, North Korea, but more importantly, China. It's rising. It's aggressive. Beijing is making its military presence certainly felt in the region. Think about Taiwan, the territorial disputes in the South China Sea, the disputes over the Senkaku Islands, you know, with Japan. And we heard from the U.S. ambassador to Japan, Rahm Emanuel, earlier this week. He took part in a panel discussion at the Brookings Institute. And he said that China assumed that South Korea and Japan would never resolve their historical differences and basically get on the same page. He believes that by doing this and embedding this mechanism of cooperation in what he calls the DNA of the three governments to create a new normal, that this will be a major deterrent for China. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RAHM EMANUEL, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO JAPAN: I think it doubles down not only on our strength about alliance, but more importantly, it doubles down on the fact that we've created something that exactly what China was hoping would never happen. (END VIDEO CLIP) COREN: Kim, obviously Beijing will be watching this summit very closely. The fear is that it could retaliate economically, which would be a big problem for Japan and South Korea. China is their largest trading partner. We did hear from China's top diplomat last month, Wang Yi. He warned Japan and South Korea against aligning themselves too closely with the U.S. Let me read this to you. He said, no matter how blonde you dye your hair, how sharp you shape your nose. You can never become a European or American. You can never become a Westerner. Now at the end of this summit we're expecting to hear from the leaders. They will announce expanded cooperation not only in joint military drills and military information sharing but also in A.I. supply chains and cyber and economic security. The hope, Kim, is that this trilateral meeting will become an annual event, you know, in its own right. Kim.",

Thank you so much for that, CNN's Anna Coren in Hong Kong.Russian and Chinese warships on joint maneuvers near Japan's southern islands have triggered a strong diplomatic response from Tokyo. On Thursday, nearly a dozen ships from the two navies were seen transiting international waters together near Okinawa. The Russian military released this video of what it says were the ships on joint Pacific patrol. Now CNN can't verify these are the same ships. Japan's defense ministry denounced the maneuvers as a show of force against Japan and a threat to its national security. Moscow's mayor says Russian air defenses shot down a drone over the city a few hours ago. Debris from the drone allegedly fell near the Moscow Expocentre. This marks the third time in the past month that this district of the capital has been struck by drone debris. It's one of two incidents officials reported in recent hours.

      "sentences": "Getting Ukraine's F-16s was always going to be an ambitious complex task. You have to provide technicians inside Ukraine who are Ukrainian to do the vast amounts of servicing that these complex jets need between their flights to keep them operational. You need to train in English F-16 pilots. That training project was supposed to happen in NATO European allied nations.The program for it was complex. It didn't move as fast forward as people necessarily hoped. So, the initial ambition from the Biden administration to see F-16s flying in Ukraine by the end of the year clearly has been stalled and that's been recognized by Ukrainian officials in the last hours here. It's a huge deal really for Ukraine because while they wouldn't really necessarily impact the frequency of sirens that you hear in a population center like this, that's mostly because of long-distance missile attacks, they could have a big impact on the southern counter- offensive front line where Russia has air superiority and the half metric ton bombs that the Russians drop on Ukrainian positions have been slowing that offensive and causing enormous casualties. So the F-16s were a chance of Ukraine redressing that balance. The idea it could happen this year, it's fair to say that was ambitious. The fact that it's not happening, well, possibly that's a reflection of how long these tasks have been taking inside of NATO itself. We've seen ourselves when we're in the outskirts of Urozhaine, the town most recently captured by Ukraine, how important air superiority could be for Ukraine to push the Russians back to speed up that particular advance. Urozhaine, important, certainly, because it enabled them to keep moving south. At the same time, we've also been hearing from Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko talking about how they will not attack Ukraine and if they were attacked they could potentially resort to nuclear weapons. Important to put that in context, Belarus has already been used for the invasion of Ukraine last year. Belarus doesn't have its own separate nuclear arsenal. It will rely on Russia for that. And so Lukashenko often making these statements to suggest they don't really want to be part of this war, but they shouldn't necessarily be considered to be weak at this stage. He enjoys minimal domestic support, but was seminal to Putin in turning around the Wagner coup a few months ago, but still a deeply complex date for Ukraine where the thought of F-16s being delayed will be poorly accepted by so many here.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VEDANT PATEL, U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT DEPUTY SPOKESPERSON: While these atrocities have been taking place in Darfur, reportedly have been committed by the RSF and affiliated militia, our view is though that both sides have been responsible for abuses and both the RSF and the SAF must cease fighting, ensure their forces, respect human rights and international law, and hold accountable those responsible for atrocities and other abuses, as well as allow for the unhindered humanitarian access as well.

BRUNHUBER: Yeah, and as you say, I mean, the growing problems of sexual crimes and according to Save the Children, some 1.5 million children will fall into crisis hunger levels by next month. And the problem is aid workers are struggling to reach those in need often because they face being attacked, but also much more solvable problems. They can't get into the country because they can't get visas. I mean, the security situation is more intractable, but surely the bureaucratic barriers can be solved.",
