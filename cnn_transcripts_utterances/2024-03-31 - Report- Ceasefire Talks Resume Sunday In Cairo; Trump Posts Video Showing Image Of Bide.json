The last round of talks happened in Doha earlier this month.On Saturday, Jordan's foreign minister told reporters that Israel must allow more aid into Gaza to prevent famine. He was in Cairo meeting with the foreign ministers of Egypt and France. In Tel Aviv, on Saturday, thousands of protesters were on the streets. (VIDEO CLIP PLAYS) They chanted \"bring them home now\", demanding that all hostages in Gaza be released, and that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu be removed from office. Well, police say a large number of protests is set fires and blocked roads. Officers used water cannons on some of them, 16 people were arrested.

There has been fighting as well around the Gaza Strip elsewhere with huge medical needs according to her, the world health organization who says that it is some 9,000 Palestinians who are now in need of urgent evacuation from the strip in order to get the care they need, given that there are only now ten minimally functioning hospitals across the territory.It comes as an Israeli delegation prepares to head to Washington. Its possible that could happen as early as Monday in order to meet after the canceled trip last week with American officials, what the United States is hoping to do is urged them to find ways of voiding the full- scale assault, the ground offensive on Rafah that Israel has been threatening to carry out. Shortly we heard again from Benjamin Netanyahu this week explaining that it was necessary in order to flush out those last four Hamas battalions that are believed to be holding out there. It is the fate of the 1.2 million Gazans currently huddled in and around the city and desperate conditions intense. And what their feet would be should such an assault went ahead that weighs heavily on the minds of the outside world. It comes, of course, as there is a glimmer of hope for the hostage negotiations. We under sand that Israel will be sending its negotiators back both to Qatar and to Cairo in order to pick up those negotiations where they'd left off. The hope that Hamas can be convinced to make concessions on a couple of the most outstanding points, the most difficult points in these negotiations, the question of the return of civilians the north of the Gaza Strip and the question of the continued presence of Israeli soldiers, and of course, the question of the long-term fate of the territory beyond the six- week ceasefire at the heart of a potential deal.

I asked him about the looming famine in Gaza and why the Biden administration isn't putting more pressure on Benjamin Netanyahu to allow more aid into the enclave.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AARON DAVID MILLER, FORMER U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT MIDDLE EAST NEGOTIATOR: I think the administration has finally accepted to reality that most of these really public part of the security establishment, the extremist government in Israel is simply not willing to facilitate massive amounts of aid as long as Hamas holds hostages. [03:05:20] The Israelis are convinced that Hamas is diverting a fair portion of this aid. If the Israelis wanted to, the port of Ashdod is only within what, 20 miles from northern Gaza. That port is amply equipped with screening facilities to handle an enormous amount of assistance which because then be trucked in. But after five months, it's quite clear that the Israeli government doesn't have the will, they may have security concerns to basically open the floodgates and obviously it creates a huge problem. I also think the administration realizes now that there's very little they can do. They've pressed very hard, they've got one additional crossing point opened in the north. But the truth is that the only way to prevent catastrophic starvation and famine is to downshift the Israeli military campaign. And the only way that's going to happen is if in fact you can get a six-week pause through an Israeli Hamas negotiated agreement. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
