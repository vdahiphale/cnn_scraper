We do begin this hour with breaking news into CNN out of Pennsylvania.Fugitive murder suspect Michael Burham has been caught. He escaped from prison more than a week ago apparently by climbing on top of workout equipment to reach the roof. Police say he then slid down a rope that was made of bed sheets. CNN's Polo Sandoval is following all of this for us. Polo, what more can you tell us?",

This now marking the official end of this massive manhunt for this escaped inmate in rural Pennsylvania that's been ongoing for nine days now.Authorities have been on the hunt for this man, Michael Burham, since last week. Our colleague Brian Todd speaking to investigators and a source close to the investigation saying that he has been now recaptured in Warren, Pennsylvania, this evening without incident. As we mentioned he escaped last Thursday. He's in a hole in a gated covering of a wreck yard. He was jail in connection to an arson and a burglary case. Additionally, he had been a suspect in a New York homicide case. It was concerning for officials who said he was a military -- at least a former military reservist. He was considered dangerous and he also had some survival skills. Likely something that certainly helped him evade authorities for as long as he was able to. However, Pennsylvania state police were very direct in saying that they were going to continue this round-the-clock search through the woods in Pennsylvania. That they were still determined to track him down and get him back behind bars. And then here we are just days later, and it seems that, again according to officials speaking to our colleague Brian Todd, that he is once again in custody. You'll recall that Pennsylvania state police had initially floated the working theory here that he may have had an accomplice or at least some assistance. That is certainly going to be something key that we hope to learn more about in the coming 30 minutes when we are told that state investigators will be hosting a press conference updating us officially on this recapturing of Michael Burham. So there are still many questions here. But of course the key development now after about a week and a half long escape, we can now confirm that he's back behind bars according to officials.",

My SWAT team was out there weeks at a time looking for him.When you get a survivalist, it is almost impossible to find him.

You can see this going down in a heavily wooded area certainly speaks to, you know, that earlier point that was being made about his survivalist skills, giving him -- at least for a few moments or at least for a few days giving him the upper hand as he was able to evade authorities.I'd tell you, as we get ready to hear from authorities in the next 20 minutes or so, it will certainly be interesting to hear more about the way they were able to track him down. It's hard to believe it's been eight years since I was on the ground covering the Dannemora prison escape, we remember that, with two convicts that managed to escape authorities, and the takedown of both of the suspects. One was killed. The other who was detained, was as dramatic as the escape. So fast forward to eight years later and this latest incident here, it will be interesting to learn more details about how authorities were able to track down Burham.

But what is certainly unmistakable is you see his hands there behind his back. If we can show that video again to our viewers.And authorities heavily, armored and armed, keeping them very close by as they walk him back to Warren. I should mention, the Warren County officials in contact with our other colleague Danny Freeman have told him that they are currently preparing an isolation cell at the Warren County Jail where he is likely going to remain for a to be determined period of time. The big question is where will he then be transferred to? So clearly authorities will not be taking any other chances with him as they are preparing to put him in isolation once he makes it back to the Warren County Jail. ACOSTA: All right, Polo Sandoval, Steve Moore. Thanks to both of you. Really appreciate it. We'll have more on all this at the bottom of the hour. Now to Georgia where a manhunt is underway right now after a gunman shot and killed at least four people in Henry County just south of Atlanta. The circumstances surrounding the shooting are unclear. But we're told that three men and one woman were shot near a subdivision in the town of Hampton.

Now in terms of his state, obviously, you could see his condition there for yourself. But authorities expanding on that saying that he was dirty, wet, tired.
