And we're now also learning about an Easter Sunday heist in Los Angeles, one of the biggest cash grabs in the city's history, thieves reportedly stealing $30 million. Hello. I'm Wolf Blitzer in Washington, and you're in the CNN NEWSROOM. At any moment now, President Biden is due to hold a very important phone conversation with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and it will almost certainly simmer with tension. A senior White House official says the president is -- quote -- \"angry\" and will voice his frustration over the Israeli military's killing of seven aid workers Monday in Gaza. The founder of their charity, World Central Kitchen, wants an independent investigation and says the IDF, the Israel Defense Forces, systematically targeted them. A CNN analysis of videos of the aftermath shows the attacks appear to have been multiple precision strikes outside of the conflict zone. The entire convoy, two armored cars and one unarmored vehicle, was struck. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, clearly, President Biden intends to speak to him about these strikes against the World Central Kitchen convoy which killed seven of these aid workers.And we have watched over the course of this week as Israeli government officials, military officials, including the prime minister himself, have really sought to convey the seriousness with which the Israeli government and its military are taking what has been described here as a grave mistake. Whether or not he have -- will have sufficient answers to the president's questions is another matter altogether. But this obviously will add another layer of tension between these two men at a time when we have watched the U.S. criticism of Israel's conduct of the war in Gaza rising over the course of the last few months, but, of course, no real changes in U.S. policy in terms of the supply of weapons and support for Israel's military campaign against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. But the undercurrent to all of this here in Israel is also the fact that this is just one part of the pressure that the Israeli prime minister is facing. Beyond the international pressure, he is also facing pressure here at home. We have seen rising protests against Netanyahu over the course of the last several weeks, with protesters going to his residence earlier this week, and, last night, Benny Gantz, his chief political rival, a member of the war cabinet, calling for early elections as soon as September. That will be another layer to what the prime minister is facing here. And -- but, for now, there is no clear mechanism for Prime Minister Netanyahu's government to actually collapse. For now, his position here seems secure in that regard.",

As you know, there's new reporting just out in Israeli news publications that Israel has been using artificial intelligence to help identify bombing targets in Gaza.Tell us about that. DIAMOND:  Yes, this report coming from \"+972\" magazine, reporting that the Israeli military has been using an artificial intelligence program known as Lavender to identify targets in Gaza, effectively developing kill lists of suspected militants, which the Israeli military then subsequently acted on. This report says that the military relied on the system to carry out strikes, systematically targeting militants, including sometimes low- level militants, while they were in their homes at night with their families, resulting in thousands of civilian casualties. The Israeli military, for its part, didn't outright deny that this system exists, but they argued that this is merely a tool that is used in conjunction with human personnel who cross-reference this database to analyze and determine targets before actually authorizing those strikes. But one source told \"+972\" that human personnel served, effectively, as a rubber stamp, sometimes spending only 20 seconds actually verifying the information that this A.I. system was giving them.",

Barak, thanks very much for joining us. You're doing amazing reporting. I know you're hearing from your sources that the White House temperature is -- quote -- \"very high\" going into this phone call with Netanyahu.

      "sentences": "Thank you, Wolf.I think the relationship between Biden and Netanyahu at the moment are maybe at their lowest point ever. And one of the reason that the call that is taking place, I think, in 15 minutes is going to be so difficult is because WCK, this organization headed by Jose Andres, has a special place in Joe Biden's heart. And the reason is, is that Jose Andres is a longtime supporter of President Biden and a personal friend. And when Biden had to call Jose Andres to express condolences and to try to explain to him what happened, this was, I think, a very difficult moment for Biden, at least from what I hear from more than two or three U.S. officials. They all say this was a very personal, difficult moment for Biden. And I think Netanyahu will feel it very well today when Biden calls him.",

But Ben Rhodes, who had served as President Obama's deputy national security adviser, says this. And I'm quoting him now: \"Until there are substantive consequences, the outrage does nothing. Bibi obviously doesn't care what the U.S. says. It's about what the U.S. does\" -- close quote. So will this call, Barak, really move the needle?",

Just the thing is that I don't think that Biden is acting very differently than the Obama administration. There was a war in Gaza in 2014 for 51 days, and the Obama administration didn't act very differently than what Biden is doing now. There was one case at the time that they delayed one weapons shipment towards the end of that war, but nothing more than that. So I think it's a bigger thing than this administration or that administration, because it is very hard politically for any U.S. president to take a step like delay or condition arms supply to Israel, and it has political consequences inside the U.S., especially on an election year.",

There are not a lot of forces in Gaza. He's been talking about the Rafah operation for months, approving the plans again and again and again, but still not implementing it. It has results in Israeli public opinion. His approval ratings are very, very low. But, on the other hand, we have to remember, he still has a 64-member-of-Knesset majority, OK? Even if Benny Gantz leaves the government today, Netanyahu is still the prime minister, and it will be very hard for anybody to bring down this government, maybe only if we will see those demonstrations growing to much bigger numbers than they are right now.",

The announcement comes just a day after Israel said it would increase recruitment and call up air defense reserve forces. Tell us about this. I suspect it's because there is a lot of concern in Israel that Iran might decide now to retaliate militarily for Israel's airstrike against an Iranian consular building in Damascus?",

It's almost -- Israeli officials almost treat this as a -- as a fact and are only waiting to see when the Iranian retaliation will happen and how exactly it will look like. And I think there's a lot of concern not only in Israel, but in the Biden administration, that this could be the moment where this conflict is becoming much, much bigger, something that the Biden administration managed more or less to contain, not completely. We saw -- we see that there's fighting in Lebanon. We see that there's skirmishes on the border with Syria, obviously Yemen. But if Iran comes into this, to the picture, we're looking at a whole different conflict here. And I think this is what the Biden administration is hoping to prevent. And I think it's going to be a prominent issue in the call between Biden and Netanyahu, and not only the issue of Gaza.",

And it is unclear now -- unclear how many people were in that vehicle or if anyone was hurt. And take a look at this. Another shows nurses springing into action to protect newborn babies at a postpartum care center in Taipei. You see them gathering the kids together and hanging on to make sure they don't tip over. Thankfully, none of the babies were hurt. CNN's Ivan Watson is in Taiwan for us. He's got more on the details of the aftermath of this earthquake. Ivan, what are you seeing?",
