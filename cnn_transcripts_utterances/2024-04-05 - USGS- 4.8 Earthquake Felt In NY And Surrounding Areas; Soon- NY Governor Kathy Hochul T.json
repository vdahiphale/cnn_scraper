A 4.8 -- 4.8 magnitude earthquake rattling the tri state area just a few moments ago. Initial reports indicate the shaking was felt in New York, in New Jersey, down in Philadelphia, as well as Washington, D.C., where I am.Right now, the NYPD says no damages or injuries have been reported, but it only happened a few moments ago. New York's governor, Kathy Hochul, says her team is assessing the impact. And the New Jersey governor, Phil Murphy, says he's activated the state's Emergency Operations Center. CNN is, of course, covering the story from all angles. I want to go to our meteorologist, Elisa Raffa. She's over at the CNN Weather Center for us. So, Elisa, walk us through what we know so far.",

We were on a high floor, but we could feel it. I didn't feel anything this time. But friends of mine are texting me right now in the Washington, D.C. area, in Maryland and Virginia, they felt it as well. So we're watching this very closely. I want to go to CNN national correspondent Gloria Pazmino. She's joining me on the phone right now. She's in Queens, New York. What was it like where you are, Gloria?",

      "sentences": "So Wolf, I have to tell, you know, I've lived in New York City my whole life. Never have I experienced what we just did shortly before 10Initially, I thought there was a big truck driving down my street. You know, I live in an old pre-war building, second floor apartment, and sometimes when heavy vehicles go down the road, the apartment does shake a little bit. But I have to say, after the first five, six seconds, it became pretty clear it was an earthquake. You mentioned the earthquake we felt in this area several years ago that felt like it was a lot shorter and not as strong as this last one. And we've been hearing from people on the air. You know, this is just an area of the country where we are not used to feeling this kind of thing. So it is extremely sort of jarring and shocking when you feel it. You know, I could feel the floor shaking underneath my feet. I could hear my neighbors upstairs that were coming down the stairs and heading out to the street because for a moment there, I wasn't sure if it was safe. I could hear the neighbors asking each other if they were OK. But we should say that as of the last few minutes, we have heard from the fire department here in New York. They did receive reports of shaking buildings and they are responding to calls to evaluate structural stability. So far, there have been no major incidents here in the New York City area, but they are continuing to monitor. It was definitely a few seconds, Wolf, of wondering what was going on. Nothing have I -- had never felt anything like it in my years of living here in New York.",

New York City just felt the impacts of a 4.8 magnitude earthquake with an epicenter of Lebanon, New Jersey. New York City's mayor is being briefed. This is from the office of the mayor. While we do not have any reports of major impacts at this time, we are still assessing the impact. So they're bracing for a lot more.And, Gloria, I know you're still with us, so let's talk a little bit about the great fear once there's an earthquake is that there will also be aftershocks, which could be very damaging as well. So far, you felt the earthquake, but you haven't felt any aftershocks, have you?",

But that's why it was felt in the New Jersey area, New York City area, obviously Connecticut as well. It was also felt down here in Washington, D.C., in the area, including Maryland as well. So we're watching this.No reports of structural damage or any serious problems, at least not yet. But it's very, very early. It just happened a few moments ago.

      "sentences": "Wolf, here on the streets of New York speaking to folks on the sidewalk, and reaction is a bit mixed. Some people certainly felt it while others. They just spoke to a couple visiting from Mexico City, certainly no stranger to this kind of shaking. They didn't really feel a thing about 30, 35 minutes ago when this event took place here. Some preliminary numbers from the U.S. Geological Survey here tells you, really paints a clear picture of the potential impacts here in terms of the number of people that likely affected this earthquake earlier this morning.According to preliminary reports, some roughly 23 million people lightly experienced some light shaking, about 300,000 moderate shaking, and about 9,000 people likely experience what's being described by USGS as strong shaking. This is all based on some of those preliminary reports right now, that preliminary information that indicates that this was a 4.7 magnitude earthquake that rocked the region earlier this morning. But a key takeaway right now, Wolf, in terms of what's happening on the streets of New York. It is relatively business as usual. Right now, though, people are certainly buzzing about the events that took place earlier today. But the main point that we're getting right now from New York City officials, as you just reiterated and so did our colleague, Gloria, is that there are no injuries to report at this time, also no any signs of damage. But, you know, speaking to friends and loved ones in the area, they certainly felt it. I know that my wife felt it and she lives here in New York City. And so there's certainly a concern about aftershocks. So we haven't seen or felt any indication of that. The mayor's office recommending that should that take place, they're putting out some guidance for residents that it's important for people to either to drop to the floor, cover their head and neck and then take additional cover under heavy furniture should that take place. But again, at this point, it seems that event took place at about 10:30, and here on the streets of New York, it is business as usual. But you ask them about the earthquake, and they're certainly ready to talk about it. Wolf?",

She's a seismologist for the U.S. Geological Survey. Susan, thank you very much for joining us. Give us some context right now. First of all, what can you tell us about this 4.8 earthquake? SUSAN HOUGH, SEISMOLOGIST, U.S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY: Well, so the estimate now is 4.7. It might vary a little bit. It is obviously not a usual event. It's not unheard of that on the West Coast of North America, you have an active plate boundary. You have the San Andreas Fault. And we know that's an active earthquake zone. On the East Coast, the continent and the ocean are glued together. You don't have an active plate boundary, but you do have stress. And we have had moderately large earthquakes and damaging earthquakes up and down the Atlantic seaboard in Charleston, South Carolina, in 1886, in Virginia in 2011, in Quebec in 1989. So they do happen. Going back to the 1700s and 1800s, there were earthquakes close to magnitude five near New York City. So we've just had one of these infrequent events. We don't -- 4.7, we don't expect to be large enough to cause damage. It's just not that big. But it is strong enough, as people have been describing, to be strongly felt.",

      "sentences": "Yes. If you look at where earthquakes have struck, the Mineral Virginia, as we call it, earthquake in 2011, it wasn't directly along the coast. It was into Virginia a little bit. So there are stresses along the Atlantic seaboard because you have continental crusts sort of glued to oceanic crust and you've got things going on geologically. But it's not like a localized San Andreas Fault where we know where the earthquakes are going to fall. You have a zone of stress. So it's not surprising to see earthquakes within that broader zone.",

Well, it doesn't seem so incredible, this video, but it's people running out. You can see that inside, people clearly feeling this earthquake. You can see the shaking. This is inside a coffee shop in Boonton in New Jersey. I want to bring in CNN's Pete Muntean. He's here with us in Washington, D.C.

      "sentences": "That's right, Wolf. You know, the thing is, you can't feel an earthquake in the air, although passengers are definitely feeling the impact of it right now. Ground stops still in place, per the FAA, at Newark and at JFK until half past the hour, 11The FAA has tweeted out a statement saying that this is a rapidly evolving situation. They say that this 4.8 magnitude earthquake in New Jersey may impact some air traffic facilities, New York, New Jersey, Philadelphia and Baltimore. We do know now that Philadelphia and Baltimore have been removed from the ground stop list, air traffic operations resuming as quickly as possible. So we're continuing to follow this. Jeannie Shiffer of the FAA says that crews there at Newark and at JFK still need to inspect the runways. Our Greg Wallace listening to air traffic control audio as it's coming in real time. He says crews from the Port Authority of New York have inspected the Runway there at Newark. It seems like some flights are departing right now, but some flights are having to be diverted that were bound to New York. Remember, New York is a city on the move, never sleeps. And the thing here is the impact on the infrastructure in New York. Those in California may chortle about this, but New York is very much a bridged and underground city. And so New Jersey transit is treating out that all of the lines on the New Jersey transit system are being held by about 20 minutes right now because of inspections that need to take place at bridges. To put this into context for you, after the 2011 earthquake here in Washington, D.C., there were a lot of things that were damaged. The national cathedral was damaged. The Washington monument was damaged and closed for a fairly long period of time. So this is not over just yet. And inspectors, those at the travel, will need to make sure that things are all clear so that the 1, 1.5 million people who commute to New York every day can continue to do that safely and successfully. We are just seeing the impacts now of this rapidly evolving situation, Wolf.",

We're also waiting to hear from the Port Authority about this.The latest from the NYPD transit chief is that there is no specific damage reported just yet to infrastructure in New York, although, of course, it will take a little bit of time to assess that as the crews are able to get out there and truly lay eyes on a lot of this stuff.

It's on the western edge of Manhattan. It is a huge complex. The NEWSROOM is located on the 18th floor. And when the ground started shaking, I felt it. My colleagues felt it as well. But as you can imagine, when you live in a place like New York City, you begin to second guess yourself. I was thinking, you know, is this something that is happening?You know, again, I said this a little earlier, but I hadn't eaten this morning. I thought perhaps am I lightheaded? But then I saw my monitor move just ever so slightly. I come out of my office there. Then all the producers are pouring out, my fellow correspondents. It was Jean Casarez who said, you know, I think we just had an earthquake. And I said, oh, that's what it was. I'm originally from California and so I'm accustomed to feeling the ground move beneath my feet, but not in a place like New York City. And I think a lot of New Yorkers, a lot of people in New Jersey, a lot of people in Connecticut who felt the same thing, were wondering the same thing, Wolf. But at least for now, we are getting reports that not hearing any reports of significant damage. We are expecting a briefing from New York City mayor, the governor also, as you said, she is expected to have a briefing in a short while as well. The governor already put out a statement that said my team is assessing impacts and any damage that may have occurred. And we will update the public throughout the day. We know that the tunnels are being checked on, Holland Tunnel being checked on at this point as well. But again, this is something that folks were feeling all the way out east an hour and a half plus away in places like Long Island. They were feeling it all the way out in New Jersey. They were feeling it in Connecticut as well, magnitude 4.8. Some of the reports that were getting from folks, Wolf, included dishes rattling, some things moving off of shelves, things of that nature. But again, when you're in a place like New York City, this is not something one would expect.
