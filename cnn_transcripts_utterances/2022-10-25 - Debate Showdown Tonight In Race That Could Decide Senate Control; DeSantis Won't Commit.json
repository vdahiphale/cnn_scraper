Vladimir Putin raising new fears about his war plans as Moscow doubles down in its disputed claim that Ukraine is planning to deploy a dirty bomb. And corporate America turns on Kanye West for his anti-Semitic remarks. We'll take a closer look at the impact as Adidas and the Gap cut ties were the controversial rapper now also known as Ye. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM. Let's get straight to the midterm countdown right now. We're just what two weeks, two weeks out from Election Day. Candidates in a slew of pivotal contests preparing to clash in high stakes debates tonight with millions of voters already casting their ballots early. CNN Congressional Correspondent Jessica Dean has our report from the battleground state of Pennsylvania. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) JESSICA DEAN, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Tonight the two candidates for Pennsylvania Senate seat will face off for their only debate, Democratic Lieutenant Governor John Fetterman and Republican Mehmet Oz squaring off in a tight race which could decide the balance of the U.S. Senate. LT. GOV. JOHN FETTERMAN, (D) PENNSYLVANIA SENATE CANDIDATE: It's the elephant in the room having a stroke. DEAN (voice-over): Fetterman plans to use closed captioning to read everything being asked of him and he answers Oz gives as he continues to recuperate from a stroke he suffered in May. It's a tool he's utilized in recent interviews and on the campaign trail. It's also an issue Oz has already seized on. MEHMET OZ, (R) PENNSYLVANIA SENATE CABDIDATE: I don't think there's closed captioning on the floor of the Senate and maybe he doesn't need closed captioning when he's actually moving around. But maybe he does. Again, a lot of question marks and voters deserve better. DEAN (voice-over): Fetterman has previewed his own attack on Oz hitting him on crime, a focal point of Oz's campaign.",

And -- so there's a great deal of nervousness about it.And it's not just because of the nature of the race, but you know, John Fetterman had a stroke shortly before the primary. He -- as a Jessica reported, that has become an issue in the campaign. People are going to look to see how he performs. Does he have enough command to represent them in the Senate? And then, you know, Oz, there are things that he has to worry about as well. He is someone who basically lived in New Jersey, moved to Pennsylvania to make this race. He has switched positions on a lot of issues. And he is not a popular figure, even among Republicans who had a spirited primary. So he has to come across as someone who connects well with people who is someone who has some roots within the state and understands the state and the whole country.

If he shows that he's in total command and that this issue is not a problem, I think he jumps a huge threshold for voters in trying to demonstrate he's up for the job. The Oz task, though, is do you belong in this arena? He's new to politics, people know him as a celebrity doctor on T.V. And I think he also has a moment here where he needs people to walk out of here thinking that they could see him, not that he's on a lark of some sort with this campaign, but actually see him as a United States Senator.

And what that looks like behind the curtain down at Mar-a-Lago is that he's starting to have discussions with his team about who would be in his campaign leadership, where he would launch his next presidential campaign, what exactly it's going to look like, the kind of operation that it will be, will it be lean, like the 2016 presidential campaign that was very bare bones, minimal staff, or will it be a robust operation like it was in 2020? And those are the questions that Trump is talking about with his team right now.A couple of names that we've picked up just from our sources down who are close and talking to the president daily are Chris Aveda (ph) as a potential leadership position on a 2024 presidential campaign. He is a Virginia based political consultant currently involved in Trump's super PAC, Sergio Ogore (ph), Susie Wiles (ph), Brian Jack (ph), these are all seasoned political professionals who are currently surrounding the president and are very likely to be elevated to a 2024 presidential campaign, Wolf.",

She appeared in the court outside of Moscow by video conference, she wasn't there in person, and she made an emotional appeal to the judge to reduce her sentence. She talks about how devastated she was to be away from her family. She admitted her guilt again. She apologized again to the court for bringing in that small quantity of cannabis oil for which he was found guilty of drug smuggling.But none of that seemed to have moved the judge at all, non-legal arguments either. And the judge upheld the verdict of guilty for drug smuggling against Brittney Griner. And he upheld the sentence as well. They reduced it a little bit, a couple of months reduced. And so, instead of nine years should now be serving something just over eight and a half years. So not much of a consolation. Certainly the lawyers said they were devastated by this, lawyers for Brittney Griner, that is. When I spoke to them last week in Moscow, they indicated they expected some kind of substantial reduction in a sentence. That did not happen. What happens next? Well, I mean, the legal path has run out. It's not clear where there's another opportunity for the lawyers to appeal again on behalf of Brittney Griner. So, in the next couple of weeks or months, the expectation is she'll be moved from her pretrial detention center, which is close to Moscow to a more long term location, a penal colony of some kind, which could be somewhat further away, which would be a lot more inconvenient for to get visits from diplomats and from her lawyers. But you know, we'll see where that is. But again, a very bleak day for Brittney Griner. Her only hope, perhaps, some kind of prisoner swap.",

And of course, those are the key questions not only, of course, for the January 6 investigation on Capitol Hill, but also for the Justice Department, which wants to know what the former president was doing, what were those interactions before the efforts to overturn the election in 2020.So, what is happening now behind closed doors at the U.S. District Court is the Justice Department is seeking to compel that testimony.

And Adidas says it will take a hit of more than $240 million to its fourth quarter sales like cutting ties. JONATHAN GREENBALT, ANTI-DEFAMATION LEAGUE: I wish it had happened sooner, but this does send a strong statement that there are consequences when you express antisemitism in any form of hate. TODD (voice-over): On October 8, West tweeted he was, quote, \"going death con three on Jewish people.\" His Twitter and Instagram accounts were locked. He since been abandoned by the Gap, Vogue, the fashion house Balenciaga and his powerful agent, CAA. For a man who's won 24 Grammy Awards and has been a trendsetting fashion mogul, how big a fall from grace is this?",

LZ GRANDERSON, LOS ANGELES TIMES OP-ED COLUMNIST: Or even its platform in the context of a post 2020 America with everything we know that's going on in terms of hate crimes, in terms of antisemitism, in terms of racism. So, we're in a climate right now that's very, very tense.

He suggested that George Floyd died from a fentanyl overdose rather than police brutality. Can West reverse any of this and make a comeback. The apology tour hasn't been convincing. He recently told an interviewer he was sorry for the hurt that the death con tweet caused, but wasn't sorry he said it. His ex-wife Kim Kardashian just issued a statement criticizing hate speech but only after she was called out for not addressing West behavior earlier. One damage control expert says this.",

He has a big platform, that's why we're paying attention. But for Jews around the country, particularly as we approach the fourth anniversary of the Tree of Life shooting, the deadliest attack on Jews in our country's history, this is something that we're thinking about that the community is worried about every single day.

But I know that people around him are still saying, you know, he's still allowed to think the way he thinks, these companies are allowed to disassociate themselves, but they want to make sure that he in the in the arena of the monetary gain, that he's still being paid. I'm not sure what's going to happen here, but I think that we are all learning a lesson. I think Kanye is learning, you know, a bitter lesson here.

One in four American Jews has experienced antisemitism, and yet one in three Americans overall don't know what it is. Here's an opportunity to come together and to really work on a societal approach to condemning antisemitism. Nischelle was right, no one should be targeted because of who they are. And that's what's happening when he spews this kind of venom, these conspiracy theories, this hatred of the Jewish people, we need to come together. That's why AJC has worked so hard to train companies to identify antisemitism, what it is, and then to work with the companies to make sure that if something happens they're addressing it right away. The threat is real and it requires all of us, whoever we are, whether someone's in government, whether they're in business, whether they're on a university campus to come together to address this in a societal wide way.",

But what I'm saying is, it's dangerous when someone who has a platform like him spouts these things, because there are a lot of people in society who can't tell the difference and who believe in that and who take that as a sign that they have been validated and they are -- they could act on these things. It's dangerous. I mean, we think of Los Angeles, you know, as a city of liberation a lot of times and a lot of liberals and progressive thought, but we saw that on display that there are a lot of people who really have a lot of hate and evil in their heart and they use this as a jumping off point to spew it.",
