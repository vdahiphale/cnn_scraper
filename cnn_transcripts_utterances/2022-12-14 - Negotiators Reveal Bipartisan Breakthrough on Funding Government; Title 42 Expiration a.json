Because he knows that he's going to be looking over his shoulder at his right flank for the months ahead. And he probably wouldn't be able to cut a deal with Democrats, because there are going to be so many concessions he's going to have to give conservatives in order to get that speaker's gavel. So McCarthy in a very difficult position here, and like you said, telling his caucus yesterday that he was a \"hell no\" on this spending deal.
