There's a battle heating up for that region, Ukrainian troops are getting ready. This is the next step in their counter-offensive. But for Russia -- for President Putin, he's not going to back down easily.Kherson is strategically important to the Kremlin. It connects occupied Crimea to the rest of those Russian-occupied territories, all the way up to the Russian land border. And then, of course, there's the symbolism here. President Putin simply cannot afford to lose more land to this Ukrainian counter-offensive. So this is going to be a really tough battle. We have information today that according to a Russian-backed official from Kherson, it is most likely \"that Russian troops would pull out of the city itself, not the region, but the city itself.\" There's also a social media video that shows the Russian flag coming down off of the main building in that city. But again, take all of this with a grain of salt, President Putin again, not going to let go of that city easily. I also just want to quickly mention those critical infrastructure strikes that we've seen going on for weeks continuing overnight, as well across Ukraine. Yesterday, Kate, I visited a hospital just to see what's at stake. I know we have some videos to show you. Doctors told me you know when the water cuts off, that means we have to stop dialysis treatment for patients. So that's what you're looking at across the country, a frontline preparing for yet another battle and across the country, more and more suffering as Russia targets innocents, Kate.",

So, in addition to getting therapy, they took these patients -- these study participants, about 233 of them, and what they found is that when they were given this drug called psilocybin, it's a chemical version of the psychedelic mushrooms, when they were given a dose of it, their depression symptoms really did go down when they were given the highest dose. And it worked quite quickly, much more quickly than antidepressants. But here's sort of the other side of this. After 12 weeks, that response was not sustained. So there seems to be an issue with how long this last.And in addition, 77 percent of the study participants had side effects like headaches, and nausea, and dizziness. So it's important to note this could maybe, in the future, be a possibility for folks where other kinds of therapies don't work to treat their depression. But the study authors noted that there was a concern about some of the folks who took these drugs, a number of them thought about suicide. In addition, a number of them ended up going back on their antidepressants. So, this isn't perfect. It's not -- maybe magic mushrooms, but it's not a magic cure, Kate.",
