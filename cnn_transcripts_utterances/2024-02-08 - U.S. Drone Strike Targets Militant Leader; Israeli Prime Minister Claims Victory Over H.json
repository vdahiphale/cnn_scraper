The commander of the militant group behind a deadly attack on U.S. forces last month was in a moving vehicle on a busy street. But at 9Sources tell CNN the militia leader was in charge of the group's logistical support, including drone and rocket operations. Kata'ib Hezbollah issued a statement Thursday mourning the commander's death. The group is part of a broader movement backed by Iran that has carried out attacks on U.S. forces in the Middle East, more than 160 since October 7. A drone strike in Jordan last month killed three U.S. soldiers and wounded dozens more. More details now from CNN's Oren Liebermann (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But at the strategic level, I don't think they're working, because what they're not doing is creating deterrence to prevent Iran from coordinating these groups to launch further attacks. And we've already seen an indication from Kata'ib Hezbollah that they plan on doing that.And I think the risk is the U.S. will essentially follow the same model in Iraq and Syria that they're doing in the Red Sea against the Houthis, which are these tactical strikes that achieve effective military results, but don't necessarily lead to strategic success. And that is a real problem, because it will invite the Iranians in both the Red Sea and also in Iraq and Syria to essentially test where the red lines are for the U.S. and escalate where they so desire.",

So, the very fact that the U.S. is being so precise, so limited, a number of days passed between the first set of strikes and this strike. It's giving the Iranians time to organize their forces, regroup, redeploy. I think what you will see is the Iranians, through their proxies and through the IRGC, retaliating at a time and place of their choosing. And the challenge is that, firstly, that doesn't, as I said, achieve any strategic success for the U.S. It just maintains a series of tactical actions back and forth.But secondly, if the Iranians sponsored retaliation through these groups then leads to further U.S. casualties or even worse, people being killed, then there will be immense pressure on the Biden administration to escalate and go after Iran directly. And of course, as you said in your introduction, the Biden administration is desperate to avoid a wider war. They would be forced on the horns of a dilemma. They have to retaliate to the loss of further U.S. service people, but to do it effectively, they have to go into that wider war.",

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has spent the past few days in the region to push that deal. On Wednesday, he met with Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who did not outright reject a counteroffer from Hamas. Instead, describing it as delusional and crazy.The Hamas offer is for a three-stage ceasefire over a total of 135 days. Hostages would be released over the first two stages in exchange for thousands of Palestinian prisoners held in Israel. Hamas also is demanding a total withdrawal from Gaza of Israeli troops, as well as an agreement on a permanent ceasefire by the end of the 135 days. Netanyahu says Israeli forces will not withdraw from Gaza until there is a complete victory over Hamas, which he says is just months away.

Because Egypt is vehemently against any operation in Rafah because it's concerned that this would lead tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to go into Egypt, into the Sinai. Therefore, I do not believe that Israel will do it because it needs Egypt for the mediation in the hostage deal.And that's exactly one of the things that Blinken spoke to Netanyahu and to Minister of Defense, Israeli Minister of Defense Galant.
