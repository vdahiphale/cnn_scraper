Zaporizhzhia is close to the southern front, while Kharkiv is quite close to that Russian border.Let's start in Zaporizhzhia, where, according to local authorities, there were some 52 different strikes all across the region. Around seven people were wounded by rocket strikes in a town that is near to the front line and then closer to the city itself, which is one of the biggest cities in the country, there was a rocket strike. Thankfully, no one was killed in Zaporizhzhia. But farther north in the Kharkiv region, at least one man, 33 years old, was killed by an artillery strike. There was a rocketing attack on the city, which is Ukraine's second biggest city. Four Russian rockets fired at the city. There was some damage, but thankfully no casualties. Rahel and Victor, we also heard from President Vladimir Putin today, who was talking about the potential use of American cluster munitions here in Ukraine, he said that it would be a crime. He goes on to claim that Russia has not yet used clusters, but if the Ukrainians decide to that they could respond in kind. There is well documented evidence that Russia has indeed already used their own cluster munitions since the start of the war, both against soldiers and civilians. For that matter, Ukraine has used them as well. But when the U.S. decided to send their cluster munitions to Ukraine, one of the biggest reasons given was that Russia had already been using them. There's also a significant ammunition shortage when it comes to artillery ammunition, and this very much is an artillery fight in this counter offensive. What impact these American cluster munitions could have on this offensive? I asked one of the main generals in the southern part of the country. He said it could radically impact the battlefield.

Thank you for being with us. Let's start where Alex left off here. This warning from Putin suggesting that he would use Russia's cluster munitions if provoked. Well, this entire war is unprovoked, so that doesn't hold water. But why do you think this warning is coming now? LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: It's not a warning. It's an admission of lies, Victor. Russia has been using cluster munitions since 2014, not just since the February 22 invasion date. There has been proof on film and in, you know, the finding of the unexploded munitions. And in fact, a lot of data has been gathered that the Russian cluster munitions sometimes have a dud rate of between 30 percent and 40 percent. All of those things are factual. So the instance that Mr. Putin is now saying this is a threat, you know, we will use them if they use them, is just another one of the Russian lies that we've been hearing throughout this campaign. And yes, they will make a difference. I'm not sure they will make as much of a radical difference as a lot of people are saying. Having once been under cluster munitions and having been wounded by cluster munitions, they are certainly devastating.

They are using all types of missile systems.What I found interesting in Alex's reporting is with the data that says over 50 were fired in several provinces, but only a few people were wounded. That tells me that these are being used indiscriminately. It brings back some memories of mine from Iraq where insurgents would use missiles and just fire them toward a location, not hoping to hit anything, but just creating more terror.

And as we've seen over the last couple of days, Mr. Putin has changed his story on that, too. Now, suddenly, these are not legal activities. There's no legal capabilities for these Wagner fighters. And what we're hearing from open source intel is that Wagner is now determining where is their next strategy. Is it still in Ukraine, which it doesn't appear to be? Is it in training Belarusians, or is it focusing on their actions in Africa, where they've been for several years? But to answer your question is, does this concern the Ukrainians? It did a few weeks ago. President Zelenskyy gave orders to General Zaluzhny to ensure that there was a defensive capability in that northern border. But given the numbers of Wagner's forces that are there, and given the incapability of the Belarusian soldiers to conduct an attack, I would not think that this is a major issue for the Ukrainians.

It is complex. And I don't think it will be hard for them to get more time to prepare.And also, whatever the judge's intentions are, and they'll have some questions about whether Cannon would want to speed things along, the judge has to be careful, too, because if you push the defense too hard, you are creating an issue for an appeal in case there is a conviction because they'll say, hey, we weren't ready to go, we kept telling you that.",

And there are cases where the jury selection can take a really long time because of the degree of vetting that's involved. So, I think there is very good protections there.

It saw a 141 percent jump in chats answered and 46 percent rise in calls answered. And the average speed to answer those calls or texts dropped from two minutes and 39 seconds to 41 seconds. U.S. Health Official Monica Johnson, she is the director of 9-8-8, she describes this as a transformative time in behavioral health care. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MONICA JOHNSON, DIRECTOR OF 988, SAMHSA OFFICIAL:  This is a three- digit number, easy to remember. 9-8-8. You can call it, text it, or chat when you feel like you need support rather that's for depression, sadness, anxiety, whatever it may be. This is the most transformative initiative in behavioral health care that I have seen in my career. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And so, when we say we're feeling uneasy and the discomfort around it, it's because we know that the industry can be better and we want to see it be better.

But if you look at Mickey Guyton, Mickey Guyton was signed to a record deal in 2012, and since that time she has not had radio success. And it's not that she hasn't been successful, she's had grammy nominations, she performed all over the country, she's a super successful artist.

Every other genre, if you see success on streaming or even on social media, doors are open for you. But the country music industry is so focused on radio, and because of people that work in radio are refusing to acknowledge this problem, their -- it won't be fixed. The CMAs, the CMTs, the ACMs, all of them have done various -- they've had various efforts in diversity, and we are seeing more representation on the artist side, but the radio is still not budging.

Beyonce's \"Daddy's Lesson\" from the \"Lemonade\" album, it was -- there was a performance there on the CMAs, but it was rejected by the Grammy Country Committee, didn't get much play. And if any artist of this period has the full phalanx of industry support, it's Beyonce. Lil Nas X's, \"Old Town Road\" was on the country charts and then removed from the country charts because they said it wasn't country enough because of the composition there. That ended up 17 weeks at number one on Billboard Hot 100. Holly G., I know you have gotten a lot of pushback, a lot of really threats because of your highlight of this. It's actually part of the reason why you are going by Holly G. and not your full first and last name. Are you surprised by what the response has been to highlighting this disparity in the genre?HOLLY G.:  I'll be honest, usually, no. But with the Tracy Chapman thing, it does surprise me a little bit because Tracy Chapman was such a revolutionary artist and she stood up for, you know, all the things that I believe in and she was such a pioneer. And so, the people that are fans of hers that are having an issue with what I'm saying about it must not have been paying attention because we're not attacking Tracy, we're not saying Tracy wasn't successful. We're saying, she actually deserved more. She deserved a spot in country music. And I don't think that she would argue with that either. I don't think that she would ever have a problem with black people standing up for our place -- rightful place in an industry, especially considering that black people created country music.",
