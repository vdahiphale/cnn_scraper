Now to some disturbing election security news this week, suspicious packages were sent to election offices in more than 20 states, triggering evacuations and understandably rattling staff. This is according to CNN and Associated Press reporting.The FBI is investigating the threats that arrived as election officials across the country prepare to send the first ballots to overseas and military voters this weekend. And right now, the Georgia State Election Board is meeting to discuss a series of controversial proposals that could have a big impact on how the state counts votes and when election results are revealed. And CNN's Sara Murray is here to break all of this down for us. Sara, lovely to see you. My understanding is one of these measures that they are looking at just actually went through. Can you explain?",

So they are considering a dozen rules that could go into effect around November and election officials in the state are basically begging them to stop making changes when we're just weeks out of early voting. So here's just a couple of them, and I'll explain the one that passed as we get to it.But one of them is this provision that would require marking absentee ballots to distinguish them between provisional and emergency ballots, which seems like not a big deal, except that all of the ballots in Georgia have already been printed, and they're about to go out. Another one of these rules requires a hand count of the number of ballots on election day at these polling places to make sure the number of ballots cast matches with the tally from the machines. And this is the rule that just passed and was a big concern for election officials. And another rule that, at least for now, sounds like it is tabled is a daily, again, hand count of the number of ballots on each day of early voting to make sure that you can match that day the number of votes cast with the number recorded by the machines. And election officials are saying you guys do not understand that you need to train people on this. You need to make provisions to move these things forward. You're essentially injecting chaos into this process.",

Gentlemen, it's thrilling to have you guys back on TV together. Thank you both so much for being here.

So that's why you see leaks coming out today that Trump's staff hopes he does the right thing, but this will not decide the election, but it's another problem for Donald Trump. But what we have to remember, this close to early voting starting, election day is very close. Every day that gets burned on stuff like this for Trump is not a day he's out screaming about the border or inflation or something that's actually relevant to the voters who will decide this election.
