      "sentences": "At the end of this week America's top general will step down from his role as the President's Top Military Advisor, the highest-ranking uniform member of the military. General Mark Milley departs after four years as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He served two presidents, of course, President Trump, a Republican, appointed back in late 2018. And then later now, President Biden, he had a relationship with Trump during those final days of the administration, sometimes tenuous.He also drew criticism from this moment when he appeared briefly alongside Trump as he walked to a church just across from the White House, across Lafayette Square for a photo-op, this during the George Floyd protests, Milley in uniform at the time, he did later apologize for creating the perception that the military was involved in what was essentially a domestic political event there. CNN's Katie Bo Lillis joins us now with more of her reporting on military. You write in your piece that some see him as the most politicized Chairman of the Joint Chiefs in recent history. And I wondered, do you hear that from inside the building, from on the hill? And what is the essential criticism?",

      "sentences": "Right. Well, Jim, it's a great question. So the -- the Chairman Joint Chiefs, right, is the president's top military advisor, right? He's outside of the chain of command. And like all U.S. generals, he's supposed to operate independent of domestic U.S. politics.But in ways large and small, Milley, in particular in the military, broadly were really kind of sucked into some of the toxic politics of the Trump era, right? Milley, in particular, in the wake of the January 6th attack on the U.S. Capitol taking some pretty extraordinary actions to safeguard against what he saw as some of the president's more sort of outlandish impulses and against kind of the chaos of the moment. He's also become really sort of the face of the so-called woke military for critics on the right. And one detail that we learned that kind of speaks to how attuned Milley has been to kind of the domestic politics surrounding both his chairmanship and the military in general is that his staff every morning pull the transcripts from the primetime Fox shows like Sean Hannity, at one point, Tucker Carlson, that frequently take aim at Milley to sort of monitor if they are talking about Mark Milley. And so now, Jim, I think there's this very active debate over whether or not Milley kind of stretched the bounds of the chairmanship in ways that may have sort of changed the apolitical nature.",

For some members of the military and I would say not just sort of partisan Republican critics, this was Milley stepping too far into a domestic political issue.",

In the wake of January 6th, Milley had a call with his Chinese counterpart in which he sort of reassured them, we're not going to attack you.

      "sentences": "Yeah, Jim, while they haven't made this contract public, a lot of the writers that I've talked to feel like most likely the studios met them where they wanted to be met in terms of their wages, especially when it came to residuals and streaming. Also, how many writers needed to be in the room and then AI? That wassuch a big issue for the writers and actually sources telling CNN that, that was really the last sticking point, the artificial intelligence. And so a lot of people just excited because they believe they got what they wanted. Of course, we have to see all of the details, but everyone telling me they're ready to go back to work. The Union, though, saying not yet. They want to be able to finalize the language of the contract first. That's what they're working on right now. After they do that, we expect a vote from the leadership tomorrow. And once that vote happens, then we'll likely see the details in terms of what they agreed on, and then the writers are going to be able to ask questions and try to figure out exactly if they like it or not. And then they have to vote to ratify. So it still takes a while, and keep in mind, the actors are also on strike. So even if this gets ratified and the writers are no longer in strike, well, then you still have to deal with the actors. And SAG-AFTRA is saying they're still at the picket lines, and the writers are actually being encouraged to go out in the streets and join the picket lines with the actors. They're essentially one big family. And so while you may see some talk shows and late-night shows go back to normal in the coming days or weeks, well, for movies and TV shows this year, we still don't know. It all depends on the actors, Jim.",

What we know is that after the surgery, the patient was breathing on his own, his heart was functioning without assistance, and we know that the medical team is now monitoring him closely.And how this kind of procedure works, the pig that donated its heart was actually genetically modified. Some pig genes were edited to help reduce the risk of the patient rejecting the organ or having a severe reaction and to control the growth of the organ. And we know that some human genes were inserted into the genome to help reduce those risks as well. And this is the second time we've seen this kind of procedure performed successfully. The last time was just last year. The same medical team performed the same surgery on a previous patient. That patient went on, Brianna, to live for two months after the procedure. He did eventually die of heart failure, but researchers say now that we're seeing the second successful surgery that gives hope for this kind of science, especially at a time where the nation is having a shortage of organ donors. We know that nationwide, more than 100,000 patients are on an organ weight list. Among them, more than 3,000 are in need of hearts. So scientists and doctors are making the argument that this kind of procedure in the future, if it continues to evolve, could be a possible solution to the organ shortage that we have in the U.S. right now, Brianna.",
