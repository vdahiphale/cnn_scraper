There are members in the Congress who oppose providing additional military and financial support for Ukraine. Many in your own political party and in your own state of Indiana, such as Senator Mike Brown.Do you support additional A to Ukraine? And how do you handle opposing viewpoints from those in your own party and your own home state? PENCE:  Well, first thank you for your ministry for so many years. And even in these times of war, the difference you're making in the lives of the people of Ukraine. You know, I've said from very early on that it is absolutely essential that the United States of America and our western allies provide the people of Ukraine with the support they need to defend themselves and repel that unconscionable Russian invasion. I've made it very clear that I believe that there's no room in the Republican Party for apologist for Putin, and that we need to continue to stay the course and stand strongly with President Zelensky and those courageous fighters who, who just this week, their efforts witnessed the Russian retreat from a city called Kherson. They're making incredible progress, but we can't flag in our commitment. I'm passionate about it because I've always believed in what we used to, Jake, call the Reagan doctrine, which is wherever there are free peoples that are willing to fight communists, we'll give them the resources to fight them so we don't have to fight them. But it's a little more personal than that for us. Karen and I were on a trip through the Middle East in March of this year. We stopped on the way back in Poland to thank relief workers in a Christian organization called Samaritan's Purse that were providing relief in the early days following that unconscionable Russian invasion. We actually were able to travel into Ukraine that day, just a few miles, but we came to a refugee center. And I saw a site that I never thought I'd see with my own eyes. Women of every age, children of every age, with what -- whatever their earthly possessions they could carry on their backs, all lined up and being processed to leave their home country and to leave their men behind to fight against the Russians. As a member of Samaritan's Purse said that day, he said, I never thought we'd see those sites that weren't in black and white. So, they harken back to images in Europe in the Second World War. And what's happening in Ukraine is unconscionable. And as the leader of the free world, the United States of America needs to continue to stand strong with the people of Ukraine until the Russian -- the Russian army is repelled and the sovereignty of Ukraine is restored.",

And it really emanates out of my faith. I -- I accepted Christ as my savior when I was a young man. And when I opened the bible, I read verses like, before I formed you in the womb, I knew you. And admonishments to choose life so that you and your children may live.And I knew in that moment that the cause of life needed to be my cause. I was a champion for life when I was on the airwaves in Anderson, Indiana for years. And then as your congressman, and then as your governor and as vice president, I always believed that Roe versus Wade would be overturned. I just didn't know if it would be overturned in my lifetime. But thanks to three Supreme Court justices confirmed by our administration, the American people have been given a new beginning for life. And in a very real sense, the question of abortion, to your point, has been returned to the states and the American people where it belongs. And I think in that democratic process, I -- it may take us long to restore the sanctity of life to the center of American law in all 50 states as it did to overturn Roe versus Wade. But however, many years I have left, for me and my house will, will be standing for life, but not just for the unborn. But I think, I think it's going to be incumbent upon states that enact pro-life protections to also demonstrate generosity and compassion to women facing crisis pregnancies, to support not just the unborn but newborns in new and in renewed ways. As I said at the close of my book, I truly do believe we have an opportunity to demonstrate not just a commitment to the sanctity of human life, but a commitment to come alongside and support those that are facing crisis pregnancies. And I'll look forward to being a part of that, bringing principle and compassion to that debate. But because of the Supreme Court's decision, the debate has now returned to the American people. And I'll be a part of that in the cause of life.",

I want to send my thanks and appreciation to NASA and all the great companies that worked with them to send that extraordinary rocket on a path around the Moon. Really setting the stage for sending the next man and the first woman to the moon in just a few short years.I appreciate you bringing it up because, I'll never forget the day that President Trump asked me if on the campaign trail that, if that if we won the election, would I want to lead the National Space Council as vice presidents had done in the past. Now, what he didn't know was that the only committee I ever asked to be on in Congress was the NASA subcommittee. What he didn't know that Karen and I had taken our kids when they were little to vacation at Cape Canaveral just to see the rockets. And I'll never forget just saying to him over the phone, would I lead the space council? Would I? And we went to work and I would tell you it was bipartisan work. Because you know, for the longest time we'd grounded the space shuttle and we were literally hitching a ride with the Russians to get back to the International Space Station. And when we came in, we were determined to put America back in the lead in human space exploration to get out of low earth orbit, to go back to the Moon and onto Mars. And working with NASA and working with the incredible space entrepreneurs in this country, we set in motion the processes that'll do just that. And I must say, as I said at the top of this broadcast, I'm -- I've got more than a few arguments with the Biden administration. But I'm truly grateful that they've continued to stay on course, to return Americans to the Moon. But I must tell you, that day that we were at Kennedy Space Center, the president, Karen and I were watching the day in 2020 in the midst of that pandemic, when for the first time in 10 years American astronauts returned to space on an American rocket from American soil. And I'll never forget, you can see the picture in my book. The president and I were standing very stoically. It was an important moment in the history of American space exploration. But my wife had both fists in the air, and I think she captured the enthusiasm of Americans. Look, America needs to lead in space. Not just for the advantage, not just for our security, but because we need to carry our values and the values of freedom into space. And I have every confidence that we will.",

And I truly do believe that we spend too much time in politics talking about the other side and not talking enough about what our vision is.And I truly -- I believe that the success we had in the 2016 campaign was for all the contention in that came -- campaign. The American people still heard a commitment to rebuild the military, to secure the border, to cut taxes, rollback regulations, unleash American energy, and appoint conservatives to the courts and the rallies that I stood before. And I always told people, if you want a large rally, you send Donald Trump. If you want a small rally, you can send me. But it was always the same. People were animated, not so much by personality as they were by a vision, and by policies. And I truly do believe that those policies will carry whether we're the standard bearer or not. I think the difference for, for any candidate will be whether they offer a compelling vision to the American people, a vision of putting back into practice the policies that left our country stronger and more prosperous after four years of the Trump/Pence administration. But also, as I said at the top of this program. I think the American people are looking for leadership that can unite our country around our most timeless values and ideals, and demonstrate the kind of civility and respect that Americans show one another every day. And so, we'll take time at the end of the year. We'll give prayerful consideration to what role we might have, but I promise you, Jake, I'll keep you posted. And we will, we'll stay in the fight for our values and do everything in our part, to strengthen and serve the country we love. So, help us, God.",

But really leaned into this idea that, that Trump really didn't mean it in, in some ways.And I thought that that was, really emblematic of Mike Pence. I mean, I think that for the people who love Pence, it's perhaps a sign that he is a good and decent person, that he's forgiving, he's a person of faith. But for folks who are looking for Pence to express a statement of principles even on something like that where he and his family were put in danger, where his former boss was doing something that he described as reckless, but other people have described as anti- Democratic. He wouldn't even go there to sort of express broad statements of principle about why what Trump did was wrong, and also, even a little bit of outrage, I think, it's hard for him. Because I think that that is generally -- I covered Pence for the duration of the Trump/Pence presidency.

He's, you see the video of him being whisked down the stairs while you can hear shouts outside the capitol of hang Mike Pence, his wife, his daughter, you know, I mean, and you asked when, what he felt about the president. I would've had some pretty strong words. I would've gotten in the car and driven back to the White House, had probably got in a fist fight with the president, right? I mean, that -- that's what people are looking for, is saying like, wow, that was my wife and family. I'd be back there banging on the desk saying more than, you know, you let me down, Mr. President. And I think that's the issue. You know, Mike Pence is a decent human being, great guy. I got to spend a lot of time with him. And I think people want -- people want to see a little more fire. They want to see someone who is going to stand up and fight hard. And that's what the allure of President Trump was. And I think that's what they see in Ron DeSantis in Florida. And I think that's why he's, you know, kind of surging the polls. They see someone who's kind of a pugilist in the -- in the political sense.",

I think if we look at the results of the midterms last week, there is a constituency in American politics for people who are not election deniers, who are espousing real policy, and perhaps people who are willing to push back on those things.Pence doesn't really want to be that person. He wants to be just distant enough from it, that he can't be, you know, called an election denier. But not so distant that he might be perceived as being more in the sort of Liz Cheney vein of the Republican Party. And it's just hard to see who that appeals to. You know, on the other hand, I mean, I do think that the one thing that Ron DeSantis has that is working for him at the moment, although it remains to be seen whether that will work in an actual primary, is that he's picking fights with the other party. Pence won't do that either. It's just hard to see what the lane is. I think this Republican Party of today, frankly, is not particularly all that interested in the nice guy who shows up at the party.

They're now calling this a Polish Ukrainian plot and a provocation on the part of those two countries to try and draw this into a wider conflict between Russia and NATO.It was quite interesting because the spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin, Dmitry Peskov, he came out earlier today and he actually praised President Biden's early reaction to this. Of course, President Biden had said that it did appear as though the missile fragments that landed in Poland probably originated from Ukraine and were not fired off by Russia. The Russians are saying that that was obviously the kind of reaction they wanted to see. On the part of the European allies, they called that hysteria and specifically singled out the Polls. The Russians put forward what they called their experts saying that it was absolutely clear that this was a surface to air missile. And even summoned the Polish Ambassador to Moscow late last night. He was at the, Russian foreign ministry, I would say for about 20 minutes, not far from where we are right now at all. And then the Russians also laying into the Ukrainians as well.

But there are still a lot of questions that are open. Did this interceptor hit some sort of Russian projectile and was then maybe diverted to the territory of Poland, or could there also have been a Russian projectile that was hit and then part of that also landed on Polish territory.
