It`s estimated that by the year 2050, the worldpopulation could grow from 7.8 billion to nearly 9 billion. Transportation experts are considering how to support the travel needs for that many people. But could the solution for congested cities mean zipping around above the streets? Here`s Rahel Solomon with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RAHEL SOLOMON, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  It`s not a plane and it`s not a helicopter. But it might just be your aerial ticket to the next frontier of urban transit. This is VoloCity, an all-electric, manned, drone-like aircraft. It looked like something of a sci-fi film, but this high-tech flyer is aiming to take off in the very near future.",

Voloports are designed to optimize the charging and the handling of the passenger. We are now leaving the prototype status. We`re really on a very solid track to go into commercial operation in 2024, in cities like Paris and Rome, because we believe if we can fly in Paris and Rome, we can fly almost anywhere, because it`s a very complex, very dense urban environment.",
