      "sentences": "Soon, President Biden will make a speech warning about ongoing threats to democracy. He is in Arizona, a key battleground state and still a stronghold for election deniers. President Biden is expected to highlight Donald Trump's role in those conspiracies and the threats that they pose to America.A preview from the White House, quote, \"There is something dangerous happening in America. There is an extremist movement that does not share the basic beliefs of our democracy. The MAGA Movement\". Joining me now to talk about this and more is Presidential Historian Douglas Brinkley. Thank you so much for joining me. Talk about this speech. It's going to be, first of all, the setting. Not only in Arizona, but at the John McCain Institute, which has a lot of meaning. He -- the president is going to go about as far as he ever has, we understand, accusing his former rival, the former president, the MAGA movement, of just basically not believing in democracy. Can you put this in historical context?",

I represent the soul of America again, that worked with him before, but we're now -- he has a record and people are worried about the economy.We have a government shutdown going on. We have the, you know, the autoworkers strike, as I mentioned, and much more with climate change, et cetera. So is Biden kind of going back to a golden oldie and just repeating it or is he going to be putting fresh Fodder on the fire of American politics and really gin up ideas about the future? Right now, it's kind of a backstop speech saying, hey, beyond me lies fascism. You're going to have a choice. Well, the problem is there may be third parties and there may be more than a choice between Biden and MAGA. And so I think Biden has to -- today it's important, honor McCain, take this speech, use it occasionally, but he's going to not -- can't rely on this kind of I represent democracy, the other side doesn't all the time.",

But I think Biden has to really deal with these fact that people are afraid in the country that they don't feel better days are coming. And just get down to those kitchen table issues, talk the economy.He's going to have to sell Bidenomics in addition to saying, I'm a Stalwart of democracy. But we're in a real threat in my mind with trumpism and Biden is the warrior standing in front of it and he wants to, in Arizona say, I've got john McCain on our side. Now, that may not be a lot of Republicans, McCain Republicans, but in Arizona they exist and he's going to need that coalition to back him in because Arizona is an all-important state in 2020 forward.",

Thank you so much for joining me. What's your take so far in the hearing, sir? REP. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI (D), ILLINOIS: Well, I think I concur generally what -- with what was just said, which is none of these witnesses are fact witnesses. They can't really testify about anything regarding Joe Biden. And then secondly, there is no evidence of that type of wrongdoing. And that came up over and over again. And the irony is that, you know, instead of talking about this, we should be talking about funding the government, which is about to shut down in about two and a half days. And so that was really looming over the whole proceedings. The kind of absurdity of focusing on this particular issue of impeachment when there's so many other issues we should be dealing with.",

Now, that's not their job. But still, given all of that, that we just established, my question to you is why is it that the American people, according to a CNN poll, 60 percent of Americans, to be precise, say that he acted either illegally or unethically? Should the White House and Democrats be doing more to push back on Republican claims because they seem to be seeping in to the electorate?",

The fact that he has nothing to do with any of the business dealings that he didn't receive even a dime. Despite the fact that the majority has subpoenaed and collected over 12,000 documents and bank records, not even a single one shows that Joe Biden received a penny off of any transaction.Today, though, an interesting poll came out showing that a vast majority of American people feel that there should not be impeachment proceedings with regard to this particular situation, even if they have concerns about Hunter Biden. And so, you know, we have to remember that Joe Biden himself is the only one that can be impeached. It's not Hunter Biden who is a private citizen who's being, you know, prosecuted by the U.S. attorney in Delaware.",
