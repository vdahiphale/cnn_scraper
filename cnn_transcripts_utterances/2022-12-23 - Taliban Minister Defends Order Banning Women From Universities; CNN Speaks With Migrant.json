Could somebody please tell me why?AMANPOUR (voice-over):  This new policy is the latest announcement on what many are calling the systematic expulsion of Afghan women from all aspects of public life. And when I traveled to Kabul this spring, I confronted a Taliban official the very day they demanded that all women in work, even on television, had to be masked. AMANPOUR (on camera):  Afghan women are afraid that this is the beginning of your efforts to erase them from the workspace. AMANPOUR (voice-over):  Back then, the most senior Taliban government official, Sirajuddin Haqqani, told me that he would safeguard the rights of Afghan women, including the right to an education. SIRAJUDDIN HAQQANI, INTERIOR MINISTER OF AFGHANISTAN (through translator):  There is no one who opposes education for women and already, girls are allowed to go to school up to grade six. What I am saying to you is that very soon you will hear very good news about this issue, God willing. AMANPOUR (voice-over):  But that promise never materialized and this week, women's and girls' rights have taken a major step backwards. In fact, officials who pledged they would be different than Taliban 1.0 are now accelerating their march back to that same harsh version. This is my interview with a Taliban official back in 1996. AMANPOUR (on camera):  A lot of people want to know what you're going to do about the women issues. What about women's education, girl's education? Women working -- widows who have no other way to support themselves?",

It's not correct.AMANPOUR (on camera):  But the girls can't go to school. We've been to schools here that are all closed. AMANPOUR (voice-over):  Since the Taliban came back to power last year, women have been banned from most workplaces, from politics, and from entering public parks and public bars. They even now require a male guardian for long-distance travel. More pragmatic Taliban sources tell CNN these bans come straight from the Taliban's so-called supreme leader ameer Akhundzada and his kitchen cabinet based in Kandahar. They form the core of the hardline religious leadership. The United Nations says it's outraged and is calling on the Taliban to reverse the decision. The United States said that it would further alienate the Taliban from the international community and deny them the legitimacy and recognition they crave. In the last two decades since the Taliban was first driven out of Afghanistan, many urban women were excelling in school and in the workforce, contributing to the country's economy, society, and culture. Now that half the population is being erased from public view and public works, this country is falling ever faster, ever deeper into extreme poverty and hunger as another bleak winter takes hold.

But for those who wait in line, their journey has been long and dangerous, and this is the final step in their dream of making the U.S. their new home, even as the Trump-era Title 42 restrictions remain in limbo.CNN's David Culver has more from the southern border. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DAVID CULVER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  There are those who cross illegally -- streams of people every day, every hour. And then there are those who watch, wait, and face the unknown. Here in Cuidad Juarez, this is what the U.S. looks like for Yulexi Fernandez (PH) and Lucy Bastillas (PH). \"We're not criminals. We're good people,\" they stress. The two met while serving in the Venezuelan military. In October, they started their trek north, fleeing political turmoil, hiking through jungles, rafting murky waters, riding a train from on top -- so close to their final destination until policy and this halt their journey. Before sunrise Tuesday, we watch as Texas law enforcement mobilize sealing off this popular access point to American soil, one of the state's efforts to stop the flow of migrants. But it only reroutes them a short distance down river, creating a new bottleneck for illegal crossings and a tense standoff. The setting sun ushers in freezing temperatures. By nightfall, migrants settle in on the U.S. side of the river, building campfires to keep warm. Hours later, some rush another border entry point about a mile away. Under Title 42, they can still be immediately expelled on the grounds of COVID prevention. Lucy and Yulexi determined to enter legally.",

      "sentences": "All right, your Romans' Numeral this morning, 3.2 -- as in 3.2 percent. That's how much the U.S. economy really grew between July and September -- the third quarter. That's the final revision, much stronger than the first two readings of the quarter and a sharp recovery, you can see there, from the stall in the economy in the first half of the year.Looking at markets around the world right now, you can see that Asian shares have closed lower. Europe has opened slightly higher. And on Wall Street, stock index futures also leaning up. You know, that strong GDP report knocked the Dow down yesterday -- the rate-sensitive tech sector hurt hardest. The good news on the economy was bad news yesterday for stocks. Investors think the Fed will have to keep rates higher for longer to cool this strong economy. The broader S&amp;P 500 fell more than one percent. On inflation watch, gas prices barely budged at $3.10 a gallon. Closing out the last full week of the year with strong news about the economy. That strong GDP reading. Jobless claims near pre-pandemic lows. Consumer confidence rebounded to an eight-month high. There are signs inflation is starting to peak. You know, the Fed's medicine, though, is dinging the housing market. Home sales slowed for the 10th consecutive month -- the longest such stretch on record, going back to 1999. And you're probably feeling it in those 401(k)s. Stocks are headed for the first -- for a down month and the first down year for stocks since 2018, and the worst year since the financial crisis of 2008. An economic gut check. The Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the PCE Price Index, is due out later today. Let's bring in Federal Reserve and economy reporter at The New York Times, Jeanna Smialek. And Jeanna, you know, I have been going live with that PCE indicator. I mean, it has become Main Street, kitchen table news -- some of these more wonky arcane economic reports that people watch. It's because every week we get a conflicting batch of news. What is your takeaway from this week and where we stand? JEANNA SMIALEK, FEDERAL RESERVE AND ECONOMY REPORTER, THE NEW YORK TIMES (via Webex by Cisco):  It is such an interesting time to watch the economy because it's incredibly difficult to really classify this economy. On one hand, like you just said, the housing market clearly seems to be slowing down. We're waiting for that to show up in the rest of the data. But then, other parts of the economy do reflect they're reaccelerating. We've seen very solid consumer spending. Those GDP revisions I think reconfirm to us that consumer spending has been even stronger than we understood it had been. And the consumer is the engine of the American economy. They make up 70 percent of all activity in the U.S. economy. And so, if they're strong and if the labor market is strong, which we think we know it is, it's very hard to see how the Fed gets this economy down to sort of the gentle deceleration it's hoping for next year without doing a little bit more on the interest rate side.",

Consumers say that they don't feel good about the economy. But I almost think at this stage you have to look at sort of like a core confidence indicator.The first thing I do when the New York Fed consumer confidence figures come out is go to the job expectations and wage expectations indexes because those ones look very different from the rest of the confidence numbers. You know, people will tell you that they feel very bad about this economy, but then they'll also tell you that they think they can get a new job if they wanted one and that they think they're going to get big wage increases next year. And I think that those two things are really sort of where the rubber hits the road on the economy. You might think that everything is going very badly at sort of some macro level, but if you think that you are personally going to make more money next year, you're likely to keep spending.",

We had a lot of spending back in 2020, one that probably helped to push up inflation or at least tip the margin. Then we had a lot of sort of more targeted packages this year that probably did help to sort of shore up some of the consumer confidence that we're seeing now -- some of the good spending that we're seeing.In the sense that some of the president's agenda items did help probably to moderate the gas price increases this year, for instance. And things like that really do matter to consumers.
