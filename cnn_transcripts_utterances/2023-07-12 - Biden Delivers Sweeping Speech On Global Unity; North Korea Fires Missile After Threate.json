Of course, there were differences throughout this summit about how concrete of a timeline that should be offered to Ukraine for joy -- for joining NATO. But ultimately, what we saw throughout this summit is this unwavering support as the G7 declaration called it for Ukraine.You know, in that speech, President Biden insisted that the U.S. and its allies would continue to be there to support Ukraine for the long haul. But he didn't really make reference to any of the tensions that had been bubbling up at the summit nor did he get into specifics of that agreement that the G7 leaders have had to really jumpstart negotiations to establish some bilateral security commitments for Ukraine. But he also, as we heard in that soundbite, really tried to send a pointed message to Putin. That the NATO alliance has been reinvigorated and that it is stronger than ever before. As you noted, the fact that Sweden would soon join the Alliance was a big win for President Biden heading into the summit after Turkey dropped its objections. But in this speech, it wasn't just about projecting the unity for Ukraine and also the strengthening of NATO. It was also an opportunity that Biden tried to use to make a case for global unity overall. Saying that the fact that allies were able to come together to support Ukraine and the fact that they've been able to expand NATO, should be a path forward on other issues that the world is confronting at this moment, like climate change, and technological advances. There was one line that really stuck out to me where the president said that the world isn't a choice right now.",

He spoke of the gap in those 15 years. Those had been pledges, he explained, in fact, what there were now were tangible commitments that had been ratified by individual nation-states and their Parliaments.And there was a distinct change in tone. A little earlier here, we heard from the British defense secretary about the fact that he'd taken aside the Ukrainians at one point to say, look, we understand that you want more than you've gotten, but you have to understand that as far as NATO allies go, these are our weaponry is that you're talking about. They're our own stockpiles of ammunition often that we're giving. There is a lot of political capital that has gone into getting you what you've gotten so far. A lot of economic capital as well. Let us make it clear in your tone that you understand that. And I think you did see, Jim, a distinct shift in the tone of President Zelenskyy. There was a lot more thinking, a lot more gratitude, and a lot more recognition of everything that has been achieved rather than simply what he still wants to have achieved. So, I think he goes home having spoken to his public and that's one of the points that the British defense secretary made. Look, we understand that you're speaking to your people after a lot of blood has been spilled and with a lot of pressure on you. But he has also now come and recognized all that's been done and gone home I think reinvigorated. You have on one hand, Jen Stoltenberg, the Secretary General of NATO, and President Biden, they're really echoing in each other's closing comments how galvanized NATO comes out of this summit.",

And the president's speech there today is certainly the big thing that he is focused on today. And we're joined now by a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Democratic Congressman Jason Crow of Colorado, to talk more about that. Sir, I want to ask you. We heard that the National Security Adviser, Jake Sullivan, said Biden was going to offer Zelenskyy these long- range missiles in this bilateral meeting that they already had. That's something that you and some of your colleagues have been calling for months, for -- at this point. What difference is this going to make in the war? REP. JASON CROW (D-CO): Well, Brianna, I think we have to continue to respond to the changing battlefield. One thing I learned at war myself when I was in Iraq and Afghanistan was that no day or week at war is the same as the last day or week. So, we're evolving the nature of our support, and we have to continue to provide the tools for Ukraine to strike deeper behind Russian lines. What we're seeing with the counter-offensive right now is that the Russians have moved a lot of their logistics supply lines, their command-and-control centers further back into Crimea, further back from their front line of defenses. We have to provide the Ukrainians with the ability to do that. The British have already done it, the French announced that they're going to provide longer-range strike missiles, and the United States is going to follow suit.",

And he was asked if the U.S. was sending those because it doesn't have enough of the kind of munitions that Ukraine really needs you know, was this in a way a substitute.And he said that that is right. That that's what was happening there. Is the U.S. or Western allies actually running out of munitions at this point? How much of a concern is that and how is that going to impact the eventual end of this war?",

We are drawing from our reserves, no doubt, and we are trying to increase our own supply chain. One of the things that we've seen with this war is that every NATO country has seen stresses on its supply chain.So, we're actually making moves right now to do supply chain reform and to enhance our capability to respond to that. But as Jake Sullivan said, just a couple of days ago, we do need a bridge ammo supply as we make those longer-term changes to our supply chain. And that's why this decision to provide cluster munitions is actually such an excruciating decision because I'm personally very conflicted on this. I don't like these munitions. I've seen the impact of them on the battlefield. They definitely have some humanitarian concerns.

And Article Five is the neutral self-defense obligation of the NATO charter that says an attack on one is an attack on all.We're just not going to create a situation where the United States and NATO goes to war with Russia. We cannot sustain that. That's not tenable. But this is not binary. That's a false choice to say that will happen, it will not happen. There is a very viable, very large third path where we provide a clear pathway to Ukraine with clear criteria for them to join NATO over the next couple of years that they make the reforms. They make the investments that create the interoperability with their military with the NATO partners. That's another requirement. Ukraine will do that. I have full confidence that they will. And we can do that without creating an escalation of risk. But the last point, Brianna, is this. We should never ever give Vladimir Putin veto authority over our own security decisions. The United States and NATO will decide what's in our own interests in the interests of European security and our own national security.
