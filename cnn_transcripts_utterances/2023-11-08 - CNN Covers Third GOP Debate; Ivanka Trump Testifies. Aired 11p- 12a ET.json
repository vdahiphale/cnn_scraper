RON DESANTIS (R-FL): Now, if you look where we are now, it's a lot different than we were in 2016, and Donald Trump is a lot different guy than he was in 2016. He owes it to you to be on this stage and explain why he should get another chance. He should explain why he didn't have Mexico pay for the border wall. He should explain why he wrecked up so much debt. He should explain what he didn't drain the swamp. And he said Republicans were going to get tired of winning.

Number two, the governor's clear suggestion here is that the president, the Biden administration, is only addressing islamophobia and not antisemitism at all. That is just not true. The Biden administration did announce last week that it is developing a national strategy to counter islamophobia. Biden's White House had already released its national strategy to combat antisemitism months ago, Anderson, in May.And this week, Biden's Education Department issued guidance reminding schools that they have a legal obligation to address incidence of both islamophobia and antisemitism. In addition, we know that President Biden himself has repeatedly denounced antisemitism, both in the wake of this Hamas attack in October and for years before.
