And what really concerns officials is not necessarily the roughly three feet of snow that they've received about 15 miles south of where we are, here, downtown Buffalo, it is stuff, what is coming down on top of that, which would potentially compound the situation throughout the region. That is why there are travel advisories and travel bans that are still in place.Here in Buffalo, that travel ban was downgraded to an advisory, meaning now that if you are able to get out, but to try to limit that to only essential travel. Because the message that is still going out is that the worst could still be ahead, when you look at the numbers that have been forecasted, that we could potentially see, close to four feet of snow in the Buffalo area. Now, this storm system is going to slowly -- according to what we've seen from our experts, slowly make its way from the north where we are, and that is why the threat is certainly not over. Yes, we are seeing some people either driving or walking around. But we can assume that most of those folks who cannot stay home today. I saw some people on their way to work earlier this morning. But for the most part, it seems, at least this is what the local mayor here is saying, people are heeding those warning, especially with the worst still ahead.

I did speak to the State Department that had suggested this immunity. This is a part of what they told me. This suggestion of immunity does not reflect an assessment on the merits of the case. It speaks to nothing on broader policy or on the state of relations. This is purely a legal determination. They say that there is an unbroken practice of the United States in recognizing immunity foreheads of government. And they also say this is how they want U.S. heads of state and government to be treated. So, it is a legal determination. It is part of an unbroken practice.
