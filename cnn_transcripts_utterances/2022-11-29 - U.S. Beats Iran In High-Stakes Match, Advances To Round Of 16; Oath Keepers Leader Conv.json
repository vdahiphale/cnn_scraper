They appeared to mouth the national anthem. Remember, in their first game, they didn't even sing it.And of course, Pulisic is the story of this game. He's the biggest star in the American team. They were dominating possession in the first half, they were struggling to find a way through, but he really put his body on the line to get the ball over the line for the Americans. It was a wonderful goal. Sergino Dest playing the balling with a header, Pulisic, getting it into the back of the net, but he was hurt as a result of that. He managed to play on for the last few minutes of the half. He didn't come back out for the second half. We don't know what his condition is. But clearly American fans will be worried about their star band.",

The fact that they've been able to come through this game with all of the speculation and all the kind of adversity that's been thrown at them and the political angles that have been discussed, they managed to stick to the task and get this done. This team is very hard to score against. They've only conceded one goal in the tournament that stands them in very good stead. The problem is, they don't score many goals either, but they know what they're doing so far. And that's going to be a great game on Saturday.",

So the Iranian players performed under intense pressure today after Iranian leaders threatened to torture or imprison their families if the players, quote, \"failed to behave,\" unquote. This game, of course, after the players refused to sing the national anthem at the match against England last week. Do you think this could have played a role in the team's performance today? LINDSAY TARPLEY, FORMER MEMBER, U.S. WOMEN'S NATIONAL SOCCER TEAM: I think at this level, it's important to -- you hear a lot of the things going on behind the scenes, but you also have a job to do when you step out on that pitch. And I thought today, both teams did an excellent job of playing a very, very good match, bringing it all but also in a respectful manner. I also think it's important to note that the World Cup can be an example of how sport can unite countries and cultures but also be a catalyst for change.

As you said, charges of seditious conspiracy are exceedingly serious and exceedingly rare. Before these January 6 cases, it has been over a decade since DOJ even tried to charge seditious conspiracy and that particular case was unsuccessful. You have to go back two decades plus to find a jury trial in the federal system that resulted in a conviction for seditious conspiracy, and that involve a foreign terrorist organization that was plotting attacks on a series of landmarks in New York City.So, this is extraordinarily rare, and it really vindicates DOJ theory here. Seditious conspiracy means to plot to use force to overthrow the government or to interfere with a lawful function of government, here the counting of electoral votes by Congress, it doesn't get any more fundamental for our democracy than that.

That's exactly how the system is supposed to work.I actually think it's a very good thing for the Justice Department, because it's going to make, in many ways, this verdict very defensible. Ultimately, at the end of the day, the jury took a very close look at each one of these defendants. And you know, there's a saying we had as prosecutors, one defendant one count. In other words, you know, for some of these defendants, even if they were found not guilty of certain things, in the end of the day, they're all being found guilty of at least one very serious felony. So the judge, once that happens, the judge is going to be able to consider all the history and characteristics of the defendant, all of the nature and circumstances of this offense, and give a sentence based on all of that, regardless of what the charge was. So, you know, I think it's a win for the Justice Department that they have a guilty verdict, as to all the defendants is to a serious felony. And as a seditious conspiracy, what I think it shows is that the jury was considering these defenses, which by the way, Jake, were inconsistent with each other. I mean, each defendant and their own spin that they were giving, which usually helps the Justice Department because those are not necessarily aligned with each other. And I think what they did here is they credited some of those defenses as to the lesser culpable members of the Oath Keepers, but at -- or as a mirror, suppose that associate, but acid people at the very top they were willing to hold the top two people in the Oath Keepers responsible for that seditious conspiracy.",

The jury here found all five defendants guilty and trying to obstruct an official proceeding, that's the third count.All five defendants have been found guilty.

And, Jake, I'm just want to point this out, if people are wondering, how could there be not guilty verdict as to the bottom three defendants on the seditious conspiracy charges, but guilty verdicts as to obstruction of an official proceeding charges? The difference there is the use of force. What distinguishes seditious conspiracy is that they're plotting to use force. And so the jury found that yes, the top two defendants Stewart Rhodes and Kelly Meggs, they were in on a plan to use force, the evidence here involved amassing weapons and attack plans.

How might this verdict today, this guilty verdict for two of the five for seditious conspiracy, and guilty for all five for obstructing official proceedings.

And the way this works, Jake, if you want to cooperate in the federal system, it's all or nothing, you can't be selective about who you cooperate against or what information you give, you have to give everything.

For the first time ever, the American people slammed on the brakes on a party that had no power. Republicans didn't have the House, didn't have the Senate, they don't have the White House, and still voters said, whoa, let's not -- I understand pumping the brakes when your party has any of those things, but we have never before had voters sake, let's not let them get behind the wheel.This -- so Republicans have got to find a way to disavow this. And I think that Michael Fanone, Congressman Beyer's tweet that you referenced really important. People have been lied to. It was a lie when people said this was Antifa, a left wing group, Black Lives Matter, a left wing group, it wasn't. The Oath Keepers or ultra-right wing group. It was alive when Donald Trump said there was love in the air. It wouldn't love in the air for Michael Fanone when they beat him nearly to death, caused a heart attack. So, it's really important that the truth went out here, do not just my Democrats or your Republicans, but that people understand that when you've been told this was peaceful or this was left wing or this was just free expression of the First Amendment, you were lied to.",

It took almost a full week, but we have more Republicans speaking out against Nick Fuentes, who is this holocaust denying anti-semitic racist to Trump -- Donald Trump met with, I guess a week ago today. Kevin McCarthy, the House Republican leader for six days didn't say anything about this. I guess the story only broke on Friday, to be fair, but even though other people have come out and condemned it, and including Vice President Pence. Then earlier today, here is what Kevin McCarthy, who's about to be the House Speaker said about Donald Trump and Nick Fuentes.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), MINORITY LEADER: I don't think anybody should be spending any time with Nick Fuentes. He has no place in this Republican Party.
