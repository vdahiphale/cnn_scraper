We take you therefor a first-time look at the destruction after this week's catastrophic flooding in Libya. A historic strike for the first time ever, the powerful United Auto Workers Union downs tools at all three big U.S. automakers at once. We'll have the very latest for you. And a legendary painter passed away. We pay tribute to Colombian artist Fernando Botero. But first, this evening, new details are emerging today about the catastrophic flooding in Libya from Storm Daniel. Officials say bodies are still washing back up on the shores of Derna after six days really after a wall of water swept through the city. Survivors are in shock as they desperately search for their loved ones. Thousands of people are dead, some 10,000 reported missing according to one humanitarian group. And today, the UNAID chief says the extent of the unfolding disaster, it's still unclear. Have a listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MARTIN GRIFFITHS, U.N. UNDER-SECRETARY-GENERAL FOR HUMANITARIAN AFFAIRS:  This is a tragedy in which climate and capacity has collided to cause this terrible tragedy. Derna, a city of about a 100,000 people -- 900,000 people affected. And this is on top of the situation in Libya where 300,000 people in Libya already need humanitarian aid. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But they're getting a lot less, and that's the reality. The World Health Organization is providing $2 million. The U.S., $1 million through its development agency. The EU as you can see there is sending just over half a million dollars as well as medical equipment, rescue boats and helicopters. And the U.K. has pledged $1.25 million to support victims. Well, the director of International Medical Corps, David Eastman joins me now live. David, I appreciate you taking the time to speak to us, we just got that report, just came into us from Derna.

Our Paula Hancocks explains. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  There aren't many world leaders alive this close to Russian military secrets. North Korea's Kim Jong-un is shown around the plant where Vladimir Putin's warplanes are developed and built. A close-up look at the inside of a fighter jet, Kim asking plenty of questions. He was walking in his father's footsteps, the late Kim Jong-il toured here just over 20 years ago. It is a visit that may prove useful. Beyond the jets seen at Kim's public events, his air force is mostly built on old Soviet-era jets, in desperate need of an update, analysts say. Putin and Kim made a very public show of unity on Wednesday, Kim pledging his full and unconditional support for Putin, whether in Ukraine or his fight against hegemonic forces. Putin has appeared willing to help Kim with his military ambitions, although how far and how quickly is not clear. The United States, South Korea and Japan jointly warned there would be quote, \"clear consequences if either country violated U.N.

He's accused of falsely stating he was not using illegal drugs when he purchased a gun in 2018. Biden's attorney says a plea deal collapsed despite no change in the facts of the case. He blames pressure by Republicans as the indictment represents a great threat to the U.S. justice system. Let's bring in our Kara Scannell live in New York for more.

They're going to challenge it on the facts to argue that he wasn't actually using drugs at the time that he made the gun purchase. But also whether the law itself is constitutional. There is a big Supreme Court decision about gun ownership in the U.S., and then there have been subsequent lower court decisions. So his lawyers already looking to those to make the case that the charges themselves are not legal, that they're no longer constitutional, you know. But this is still a case that is likely to go to trial. It's likely to go to trial when his father is running for re-election of president. And you know, the next immediate step here is that Hunter Biden will have to be arraigned. So he'll have to appear in court, enter his plea in this case, and you'll remember, this all related to what was a wrapped up plea deal that was presented to a judge a couple of weeks ago. And that involved no prosecution on the gun charge, if he abided by certain conditions for two years. Now he's facing three felony counts with serious potential prison time. And it also included a plea deal where he would have pled guilty to two tax misdemeanor charges for not paying his taxes on time for two years. And in that case, the prosecution said that they would have recommended he received a probation sentence, so no jail time. But right now, we do know that around the corner in the tax case is some possibility of additional charges. So Special Counsel David Weiss' team has said that they may see charges on tax cases either in Washington D.C. or California, because that's where Hunter Biden lived during the years that he allegedly failed to pay his taxes on time. And that the question there is how soon will that happen? Well, for one of the years that's under scrutiny, the Statute of Limitations or the amount of time that the government can look back on to bring a case is coming to ahead next month. So we could see additional movement in that space just in the next couple of weeks.

It's pretty much due south of Bakhmut. There have been battles going on there for an extended period of time. Now, we do have to tell our viewers it is a very, very small place that the Ukrainians have now been able to take back. But one of the things that we can see there in that yellow that we see under screen right now, is that they are now very close to those Russian positions, and also to some of those Russian supply lines into Bakhmut as well. Now, that does give them certain ways of tampering with those Russian supply lines by hitting those Russian supply lines, and in general, increases or betters the positions that the Ukrainians have there on the frontline. We've seen some of the videos that have come out from there, and certainly, some of them do seem quite spectacular, like the one where that drone seems to tell the Russian soldiers to surrender. There's another one with a drone actually attacking what the Ukrainians say is a Russian vehicle with an officer in it. The Ukrainians are touting this as a big success for themselves because they say that the unit that was down there for the Ukrainians managed to smash the Russian unit, as they put it. It's obviously been a while since the Ukrainians have had a success like that. We know with the Battle of Bakhmut that it's sort of been a little bit secondary over the past couple of weeks, as the Ukrainians have been trying to make their push to the south.

And I want to bring up a photo that was tweeted or posted on X just a few hours ago by the mayor of Medellin which is of course, Botero Home City, the birthplace of the master.

The tweet I believe, we haven't translated, but I'll translate that for you. The words that Botero said that was that he wanted the statue to remain on display with the half destroyed by the car bomb. But as a memory of the stupidity and the criminality of Colombia.
