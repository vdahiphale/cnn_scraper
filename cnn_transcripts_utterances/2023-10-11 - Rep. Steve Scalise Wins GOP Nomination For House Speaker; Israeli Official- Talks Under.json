Israel has now formed an emergency wartime government in response to the Hamas terror attacks that have killed at least 1,200 people -- 22 or more of them Americans. The Israeli government is publicly accusing the Iranian regime of, quote, giving the green light to Hamas, which it funds, to carry out the barbaric attacks over the weekend -- a statement that differs from sources familiar with U.S. intelligence. If you thought the seriousness of this all, the deadliest day for the Jewish people since the Holocaust, the war that will cost countless innocent Israeli and Palestinian lives, risks of a regional conflict. If you thought this all would motivate House Republicans to get their act together, to elect a speaker, so the U.S. legislative branch can function -- well, you would be wrong. Behind closed doors today, the majority of House Republicans chose Congressman Steve Scalise of Louisiana to be their nominee to be the next speaker of the House, but 99 House Republicans did not choose him. And instead of coming together behind the majority choice of the majority party, the minority is, once again, rebelling. In the full House vote on the next speaker, which could happen have been happening right this minute, is not happening, and it is scheduled for -- well, who knows when, really? Let's start on Capitol Hill with CNN's Melanie Zanona. Melanie, when will this vote for speaker take place? At least one, when is it scheduled to take place? And does Scalise have enough Republican support to win the speakership? Or will he, by that time?",

In fact, it seems very unlikely that is going to happen and that is because of your second question, which is Steve Scalise does not currently have enough votes to secure the speakership on the House floor. Remember, he only won the party nomination by a very slim margin. The vote was 113 to 99, and he needs 217 on the House floor.So, Scalise has some work to do here and he did recognize that to reporters after he won the party nominations. Let's take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. STEVE SCALISE (R-LA), MAJORITY LEADER: First, I want to thank my house Republican colleagues for just designating me as the speaker. Obviously, we still have work to do. We are going to have to go upstairs on the House floor and resolve this, and then get the House opened again. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So, there's a math problem here. Steve Scalise is going to have to rally the support of the Congress, but at this point, he does not have the votes, all while critical issues like aid for Israel and government funding hang in the balance.",

The scale of the destruction, it took the Israeli military days of pitched battles to completely clear and gain control of what was once a sort of very tranquil oasis, a community of people who had lived together for a long time, roughly 1,000 or so. So far already, they have found the bodies of more than 120 people from that community.There are many others, though, Jake, who are missing. It is unclear, were they taken hostage? Are they in Gaza? Are they alive? Are they somewhere else, possibly? And it was the first time that journalists had been allowed in and there was a huge group of us who were brought in at the very end of the day. It's difficult, in these situations, always, Jake. You realize you're just starting to get a sense of the scale of the atrocities and it is difficult as well, of course, to put together a really coherent picture of exactly what happened. What is clear is that there was an enormous amount of bloodshed. You can see blood all over the place. You can see the extent of the firepower that was required to try to take it back. You can see where fires were started by the militants, since they basically went through, door to door, executing people, abducting them. We spoke to one resident who has lived there for 30 years. His eight year old daughter, I thought he had was his daughter, who had gone to her friends house for a sleep over. And she never came back. He was lucky to be rescued, but his eight year old daughter is among those more than 120 dead. And so, you're really talking about the kind of loss and the kind of destruction, the kind of hatred that honestly is difficult to process, is difficult to understand. There will obviously be a lot of questions to be asked about how this happened and what exactly happened, and putting together a timeline, and trying to really thoroughly understand the whole anatomy of this massacre.

And we went to the party and arrived there at two a.m., three a.m., and we dance until sunrise. And right when 6We had to run for our lives. We saw rockets shooting in the air, so we ran to the car and we went to the nearest bomb shelter that was down the street, outside of the festival. As we got into the festival site, as we got into the bomb shelter, there was about 35 to 40 people who entered. When we got rescued seven hours later, only 9 to 10 survived.

Just to even talk about it, I can't even cry because it's like my tears are frozen from what I saw. I had to witness, first hand, my uncle getting shot, not shot, excuse me, getting blown and exploded by a grenade that was thrown onto his stomach. I had to witness a girl getting a grenade hit on her back, and her back blew out, and I saw her sitting there, crying, her face blowing up, and she's suffering for two hours. I saw so many things that I can't even explain. I saw guts, I had flesh all over my body. We had to bury ourselves under these dead corpses to protect ourselves from these grenades that were hitting and from the rifles, the RPGs. You could hear the terrorists laughing from excitement, laughing from happiness that we are dying.

One survived, I'm so grateful, but what happened was, like, the Holocaust 2.0. I can't even describe to you. I never thought in my life that something like this whatever happened to me. After sitting there hiding under bodies for seven hours, we just prayed. All I had to do is pray. I was in shock. I couldn't even cry, I was in survival mode.

A senior Israeli official says, Iran was not only aware of the operation, but effectively gave the greenlight for the attacks. But U.S. intelligence contradicts that. U.S. intelligence suggests Saturday's attack caught senior Iranian government officials by surprise. CNN's Matthew Chance is in Tel Aviv, Israel. Oren Liebermann is at the Pentagon.

Well, obviously, Iran is well known to be a funder for a long time, a trainer of Hamas militants, and a political supporter of Hamas as well. There's complete agreement on that.But where there is a slight bit of difference, a bit of light between the two countries' assessments, I think, is that this Israeli official is saying that, look, Iran may have not known about the timing, the exact timing of this Hamas operation that led to so many Israeli deaths. It may not have anticipated the consequences would be so great. But it was aware, as far as he is concerned, this Israeli official is concerned, that the operation was being planned and it was going to go ahead at some point. Now, that's different, is my understanding, from what the U.S. is saying, which is that this whole operations surprise Iranian officials, according to U.S. intelligence. And it doesn't go so far as to say, well, Iran orchestrated this whole thing from top to bottom. But it's somewhere in the middle, Jake.",

But again, the intel does not paint a direct line from Iran to this attack. And that's what the U.S. is looking at right now. But it is worth noting, of course, that this is early intel and the U.S. and Israel are, of course, going back through all of the intel that they have, trying to figure out how they miss this, if there were signs leading up to this, as well as looking at current intel to see if there's any lines of communication. So, there still is a lot to go through. But based on the early intelligence that U.S. officials are looking at, there is no direct evidence linking Iran to this attack, in terms of knowing about it or having prepped it, or giving an immediate greenlight there. So, that is what is leading U.S. officials to lean towards the conclusion that it was a Hamas attack in its planning, in its execution, and the decision on the timing. But I will go back to a president Joe Biden just said to underscore the links still that exist between Iran and Hamas, whether or not it was directed to this attack on, but one Biden spoke, he specifically said Iran, quote, be careful. So, the link remains there and that's one of the things the U.S. is watching very closely, to see if the fighting that's currently limited to Gaza spreads beyond the region to Iranian other, Iranian proxies, Jake.",

Do you think Iran knew that this -- that the Iranian regime knew that this attack was going to happen? If not, on that day, at least imminently? REP. JIM HIMES (D-CT): Jake, I'll tell you what I think, which is that we are making way, way too much over the statements of a bunch of members of Congress who don't know, who don't have access to the kind of intelligence that the chairman and I do. For what? They are still pulling bodies out from under bushes. They are still tracking down murderous terrorists. We will have an opportunity to see precisely what Iran knew when. You know, the chairman makes exactly the right point, you know, unless you need to know why or whether Iranian officials, exactly who signed off or did what, when they did it, we know that for decades, Iran has provided weaponry, financial support, and all sorts of other support, to Hamas. So, of course, their hands are not clean here. But this is a sort of fog of war situation. We are getting conflicting reports as well. Again, I would suggest that the focus right now needs to be on supporting the Israelis, on making sure that we can keep the hostages safe, and making sure that we do force protection, meaning that our men and women in uniform are protected abroad.",

Number one is the set of values that we do not leave people behind. We will spare no expense. We will fight any fight to make sure that our people are recovered. We will negotiate, we will do everything we need to do. The second thing, of course, the United States and Israel share is remarkable competence in such things.
