Ukrainian officials have already, though, said that they had no direct involvement in the alleged attack.People in Moscow shared videos online of what they saw as drone fragments that they'd found in their yards from these attacks. Russian officials say two people were hurt, three residential buildings damaged in the alleged attack. This happened just hours after another Russian drone attack on the Ukrainian capital, the 17th Russian drone attack on Kyiv this month. CNN's Frederik Pleitgen is in Kyiv for us.

An advisor to the presidency here in Ukraine, he came out and he said, of course, they have nothing to do with it. But at the same time, the Ukrainians are also saying that they are quite happy about the fact that this happened and that they believe that things like this could happen in the future again.And so, obviously, that seems like possibly somewhat of a wink. But, again, officially, the Ukrainians are saying that they had nothing to do with this. But, certainly, this does seem as though this drone attack that happened in the early hours there in Moscow really having shaken maybe not necessarily the Russian leadership, but certainly a lot of people there on the ground in Moscow. From what we're hearing, one of the drones that was taken down was apparently taken down the Rubliovka district or near the Rubliovka district of Moscow, which is, incidentally, where Vladimir Putin has one of his properties. Also, in total, the Russians are saying that they took down eight of those drones that came in. They say three of them with electronic countermeasures, but three of them, they also had to use their air defense systems. In other words, shoot missiles at those drones. And you're absolutely right, Kate. Vladimir Putin did condemn this. Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

There was the Ukrainian air defenses shooting at these drones. You can see behind me, we actually have some of the debris now raining down on us as the crews here are clearing out the debris of one of the buildings that was hit. As you can see, it is substantial. There's a lot of things that are cleaning up now in those top floors. In fact, we pan up. You can see some of that work going on. That's an apartment that got hit there. A woman died in that apartment. In total, there were also several other people who were injured.

So, prosecutors are going to have to prove not just that this individual killed these 11 victims, but that he did it because he was motivated by religious or racial hatred.

Texas is the latest state to approve a ban on programs that promote diversity, equity and inclusion at public colleges and universities.

This whole effort follows similar moves made in Florida where Governor Ron DeSantis signed a bill, a very similar one two weeks ago defunding DE and I programs at all state universities. And new this morning, the Supreme Court has decided to not take up a case brought by a victim of sex trafficking who wanted to hold the online platform Reddit responsible. In the case, this woman was joined by parents of other minors who say their daughters were coerced into giving sexually explicit images that were later posted online on the site. This all centers around Section 230 of the Communication Decency Act, a portion of the law that has long been under the microscope.
