Why he is pulling back if not out of New Hampshire just days before the primary.Kate is getting better. Rahel is in for her. I'm John Berman with Sara Sidner. This is CNN News Central. All right, we do have breaking news. CNN has obtained a copy of the federal report evaluating the law enforcement response to the Uvalde school massacre. This report was shared with CNN by a family member of a Robb Elementary student. The full report is expected to be released later today. CNN's Shimon Prokupecz has been working this story from the beginning, and, Shimon, I can see you looking through the report right now. What are you learning?",

Something is not right about what we're being told, what happened and how police responded.So, it's so interesting to me now that you're telling me that this federal report goes into the response to the response because this is about the victims, this is about the families and how they've been treated after in many ways this horrible massacre. You say there's some accountability here. Does this federal report name names and give an outline for maybe who or what is to blame?",

They are naming names of their -- naming the leadership that day, specifically the school -- the former now school police chief, Pete Arredondo, who really was sort of, the they say, based on their investigation, and, really, a lot of the investigation that we've done, that he was in charge of the scene that day and that it was two other law enforcement officials.You had the sheriff, Nolasco, who was there that day, and then also the active -- the acting Uvalde police chief, Mariano Pargas. In all of these names, all of these individuals have been the subject of several reports that we here at CNN have done in-depth analysis based on video we obtained, reports we obtained, all showing the lack of leadership, all showing the fact that they failed to take any kind of action on that day, despite knowing, hearing 911 calls, hearing that kids were inside that classroom, hearing from the husband of a teacher who was inside telling them that his wife was inside shot. So, all of this sort of this report takes everything that has been known, some new information and puts it all together, and really just paints an ugly picture of the response both that day, both after and even to this day of how this community has been treated. And the other thing, John, you know, I remember us, you and I standing outside that school the next morning, and remember we did that lengthy interview with that Texas Department of Public Safety official who was the spokesperson. And he came to the scene and he started just talking to the media and offering all kinds of narratives of this heroic effort, that the police were here and they were there to rescue people, but days later, all of that started to unravel, and that was a big problem here, because the family members in the community were just not getting answers, true answers, accurate answers, and that is something that they are still living with here in the community, and it has caused a major distrust, it has caused major trauma for this community.",

So, Jonathan, this is a federal report, the results of an investigation that's been going on for months and months and months here. A lot of what it finds is what we have come to know through reporting by Shimon and others here that the law enforcement response was inadequate, in many ways, just wrong.

Aggressive action by law enforcement is critical. You need to draw the gunfire away from innocent victims.Remember law enforcement is going in with equipment, with tactics, with training, with knowledge of how to suppress that threat. Those innocent victims have nothing. You are the savior. If you're that police officer, you have a moral and ethical responsibility to go in and at least draw the fire away and try to suppress that threat as quickly as possible. That force of action by law enforcement is critical to resolving this situation. When you don't, this is what you get for 77 minutes. John, I was on air on CNN with you with Shimon in those moments looking at and understanding, wait a minute, why aren't police moving? We saw that they were taking positions outside of the building, but there was no action. And what happened was that caused frustration on the scene. We saw a complete collapse of any type of incident command. And, again, this report outlines it, but now we need to move into that next phase of accountability.",

She is facing more than $10 million in damages in this lawsuit. Now, the judge has also said that Carroll's lawyers can play the Access Hollywood tape. That's where Donald Trump bragging about how he, as a celebrity, has a right to do what he wants to have women, that was allowed in the first trial. The judge has said he will let that come in again because it may help the jury understand the former president's mindset and views toward women. It's unclear if that will be played today, but that is one of the pieces of evidence that Carroll's team has said that they want to play. Sara?",

It's something along the lines of, other people did it too and first, in terms of saying bad stuff about you, E. Jean Carroll. Why are the Trump lawyers doing this, and is it effective? NORM EISEN, CNN LEGAL ANALYST:  John, it's not effective. And the reason it's not effective is because the Trump lawyers are pointing to an approximately five-hour gap between E. Jean Carroll revealing what Donald Trump did in New York Magazine and Donald Trump claiming it was false. And what Alina Habba, Trump's lawyer, is trying to do here is to say, look, you were attacked in this five-hour period before President Trump said anything. And, therefore, you can't blame President Trump for everything that has transpired since. But, John, we're talking about five hours on the one hand and years of harm that E. Jean Carroll very persuasively testified about on the other. And I just don't think the jury is going to care. The examination has also been marred by considerable additional bumbling by Trump's lawyer, Ms. Habba, who doesn't seem to know the basic rules of evidence on how to use these documents and information. So, that is also a negative when you have a lawyer bumbling in front of a jury.",

Jean Carroll. That's Donald Trump himself taking the stand. He would have been much smarter to save up that leeway, John, for when he was on the stand, and it really counts the most in front of the jury to get a little extra room to make his points.The judge is going to be on the edge of his chair. He's clearly starting to get fed up with Trump. And I just don't think you talk that way to a federal judge, especially not Judge Kaplan. He's been on the bench for a long time. This is not the judge in state court, Judge Engoron, who heard the New York State civil fraud trial, who gave Trump and his lawyers a lot of leeway. That's just not going to happen here, and Trump will be barred from the court or ejected from the stand if he continues with these kinds of shenanigans.",

Everyone is subject to the Constitution. No, you cannot cross the line. A president cannot have that absolute immunity. That would be a dictatorship. It would be a lawless country. And there is no way that the D.C. Circuit is going to embrace that kind of broad, absolute immunity or that the Supreme Court will. It's just a question of how long it takes for the appellate courts to resolve this. Can we get that trial back on track in the District of Columbia federal courts?
