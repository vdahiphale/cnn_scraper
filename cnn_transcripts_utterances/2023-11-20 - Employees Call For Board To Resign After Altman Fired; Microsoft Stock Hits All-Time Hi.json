We're heading towards the best of the day. Let's see if it hauls over the course of the day of the market and the event that everybody is talking about. Employees at OpenAI are threatening to quit en masse unless the board resigns and Chief Exec Sam Altman is reinstated. In Israel, families of Hamas hostages are pressing the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to ensure their loved ones' safe return. And Javier Milei pledged to dollarize the Argentinian economy. Now, he's won the presidency. Can he do it, the uphill battle to make it happen? I'm back in New York. Welcome to New York. It's Monday. It's November the 20th. I am Richard Quest in New York as elsewhere. Of course, I mean business. Good evening. We begin tonight with OpenAI in turmoil, as more than 500 employees threaten to quit over the ouster of the CEO Sam Altman, who seems to have already gone. The employees are accusing the board of directors of mishandling Altman's firing and say there's been no evidence that Altman was dishonest with the company's directors. Now, they're calling for the board itself to resign. Among the workers who signed this letter was the board member, Ilya Sutskever. There, you see the board members besides, of course, the two, Greg and Altman, who have gone. You can see exactly how -- those are, we assume, the ones that must have voted in favor. OpenAI's chief scientist, who also tweeted he regrets participating -- this is Ilya. He regrets participating in the board's actions. So one assumes that at least four of this -- three or four of this lot all voted for Altman to be pushed. And Microsoft, which is OpenAI's biggest shareholder, announced that Altman would now join its own research division. You can see Microsoft shares sharply, $378. It's a record high. Anna Stewart is with me. We'll pass this into various bits, if we may, Anna, because do we know -- I mean, we saw the board there. There were six members of the board. But assuming some of them vote for him not to go, do we know how all this came about?",

ROGER MCNAMEE, CO-FOUNDER, ELEVATION PARTNERS: Well, Richard, I think you put your finger exactly on the problem, which is that the organization of OpenAI is ridiculous on the face of it. But I think the piece where I may have a different view than Kara is that I believe that Microsoft has controlled the products of OpenAI since it made the investment that took it to 49%, that OpenAI, like so many Silicon Valley companies, was really a creature of the world of free capital and zero percent interest rates. And when rates started to rise, I think there was enormous financial pressure, and they went to Microsoft in a position of great weakness.

And health ministry officials in Gaza, which is, of course, controlled by Hamas, they insist that this is simply proof that, you know, no one was refused medical care at hospitals in Gaza. But what Israeli officials are trying to paint here, Richard, is a kind of broader picture. And they are putting together all of these different pieces of evidence to try and argue that Hamas has used hospitals like Al-Shifa Hospital for their operations, whether that is above ground, getting ease of access through the hospital's main entrance or below ground that the Israeli military released yesterday, the first videos from inside that tunnel shaft and inside one of the tunnels that they say is under Al-Shifa Hospital. We've actually been able to geolocate that video and confirmed that it was taken inside the Al-Shifa medical complex. Inside that tunnel, what you can see is the kind of very typical curved ceiling that is very typical of Hamas tunnels in Gaza, and then you get to a door. What is behind that door, we don't know yet, and nor does the Israeli military, because they say it may be booby trapped, and therefore, they haven't opened it yet. So while the Israeli military is perhaps presenting more evidence that indicates that Hamas has indeed -- does indeed operate tunnels below Al- Shifa medical center, they have yet to fully prove that that massive command-and-control center, which not only they, but also the United States alleges exist below Al-Shifa.

They said that they did not shell the hospital. Nonetheless, the result here is that 12 people are dead, among them patients and at least one medical staffer from this hospital. And what's concerning here, of course, is it's just the latest example of people dying inside what should typically be protected civilian infrastructure. Over the weekend, we saw that dozens of people were killed in a strike on a UN school in Gaza. The Israeli military says that it is looking into the incident. Egypt and Qatar have already blamed the Israeli military for this attack. But the case that Israel has been making for weeks now as it is targeting the civilian infrastructure is that these buildings effectively lose their protected status when they are being used by Hamas militants to carry out their attacks. That is actually accurate under international law. The question is, whether in all of these instances, the Israeli military has met the burden of proof that they are indeed legitimate military targets.

However, it's crucial to see who backed him in the second round, Richard, and one of them is Mauricio Macri, who's the former president of Argentina, who ruled the country between 2015 and 2019. And the other one is Patricia Bullrich, who was the central right establishment candidate, whom Milei won against in the first round of the presidential election. Faced with the choice of another central left government with Sergio Massa, or with the jumping to the unknown, which is Javier Milei, the establishment of the Argentinean business, the establishment of the Argentina central right, has decisively supported Milei. That is what propelled him to victory yesterday, and that power base will be crucial over the next four years. Richard?",

It wouldn't be the first country to dollarize its economy, but it would by a long way be the largest. So, dollarizations happened in El Salvador, Panama and Ecuador. But look at the difference. None of them even come close. The largest, which is Ecuador, is just a fifth the size of Argentina's. It also wouldn't be the first time Argentina's attempted dollarization. The government pegged its currency to the dollar, which is slightly different, but it's pretty much the same concept in 1991. That scheme folded in 2002. Dollarizing means Argentina will have to come up with and buy into the dollar. It makes the country's central bank, at least on certain monetary responsibilities, essentially obsolete. They are really running a dollar economy. Miguel Alberto Kiguel is the former adviser to the Argentinean economy. He joins me now from Buenos Aires. Sir, thank you. Do you expect -- I mean, there're really two aspects here. There's the technical aspects of dollarizing, where you've got to get the dollars into the system, you've got to provide the liquidity, you've got to provide the notes and coins, you've got to transfer, all these sort of things. Now, the economy said it can't be done. Professor Steve Hanke said, absolutely, it can be done. It's just a matter of nuts and bolts. Where do you stand?",

He's been pushing for the dollarization because he thinks that that's a way, you know, to stop deficit financing, to stop fiscal deficits, which has been one of the main problems of Argentina over the years. Now, the big problem for Argentina is for the government basically is that it wants to dollarize and it doesn't have dollars. Obviously, dollarization means to exchange all the pesos in circulation and give people U.S. dollars, coins, bills, whatever they need, right? And the amount that Argentina needs to do that transaction is roughly $30 billion if they want to buy all the monetary base, which is what are the liabilities of the central bank and that's what it needs to be dollarized. That money clear is out of reach for Argentina because Argentina first doesn't have dollars, doesn't have reserves. The government doesn't have reserves. In fact, we have negative reserves. The central bank owes money to the rest of the world. So, it's basically almost impossible to get there just by what we have at the moment. And there's no credit, sorry, and there's no credit to get it. So, Argentina has no access to lending.",
