But another presidential right of passion -- passage, rather, a fall debate, is not so clear. After this weekend, Donald Trump backed out of a face-off he'd agreed to with Biden and said he would only debate Harris if FOX could moderate in front of a studio audience next month. That came after days of false attacks by Trump on Harris' racial identity. Last night, Trump praised these comments from a speaker at his Georgia rally. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

All of those posture adjustments are to prepare for a potential response against Israel from Iran or any other adversary that should try to do Israel harm. And we have been quite clear that we will work to defend Israel against the threats that it faces from outside its borders. And you don't have to take our word for it.

And this is the kind of decision that the president has said he will make, he will continue to make, and he will make it a priority. So will this alter Russia's behavior going forward? I, frankly, don't think that is a question that entered into our calculus. We have seen countries like Russia detain Americans before this administration came to office.
