      "sentences": "Good morning. You are live in the CNN Newsroom. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.We're following two major stories unfolding this hour. At any moment, the Supreme Court will begin releasing a new round of critical decisions. This term is filled with blockbuster rulings, including Donald Trump's claim of presidential immunity and criminal prosecution. And on this day, before CNN's historic presidential debate, we have new reporting about the preparations going on right now inside the campaigns. Sources are telling CNN that Donald Trump's team wants him disciplined and focused on so-called kitchen table issues. We're also learning President Biden will target Trump directly, our sources say. The president will attack the former president's character and remind voters of the chaos and volatility of Trump's first term. All right, let's begin with the Supreme Court and the rulings that will be coming out at any moment. CNN Chief Legal Analyst and former Federal Prosecutor Laura Coates is here. Laura, I mean, we've been waiting for this big decision on immunity for Donald Trump based on some of the claims that he's been making. Tell us about the importance of this case and I guess give us some context as to why are we waiting so long?",

      "sentences": "Well, as Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch alluded to, this would be a decision for the ages. The stepping back, 10,000 foot view is, should a president enjoy absolute immunity? Can they just do whatever they want and not face any consequences? This is really the narrow question that the Supreme Court is going to be grappling with.You are right to think about why are we waiting so long. In fact, remember, Jack Smith wanted this initially decided before even went to the D.C. Court of Appeals, where we heard that infamous analogy about hypothetical about whether you could order SEAL Team Six to commit a crime to assassinate your political opponent and rival to which, of course, they were incredulous about the doubling down on that very point. But this is a monumental case that will decide for America really about the balance of power and about checks and balances because if you have an unchecked executive and the head executive branch, what is the point of having these checks and balances? So, it's been a really critical decision. We don't yet know what it's going to come of this But I would be surprised if they were to say that a president had a blanket immunity. I'd also be surprised, however, if they were to articulate a list of different ways in which you could describe what official acts are. That's going to be the crux of this issue, what's an official act essentially, and if you're doing something officially as the president of the United States, should you actually enjoy that immunity? But they're not going to enumerate a list. That would be, you know, wholesale what you could do in the future.",

But this is a conservative supermajority and I suppose, you know, all bets are off in terms of making, you know, predictions on, on what they might do.But there's also this other ruling that we're waiting on that pertains to January 6th and whether the defendants will face certain charges obstruction of Congress and official acts of Congress. That is also very important. What about that?",

And, you know, it just goes to show you, Laura was talking about the other January 6th case, January 6th happened, what, almost four years ago, the attack on the Capitol. We're still grappling with these legal issues that really go to the heart of, you know, this top tier of folks who are around Donald Trump and the fact that we haven't really seen any of them pay any kind of a price for what took place on January 6th. And what the Supreme Court might decide here is going to have a huge impact on whether we're going to actually see justice for those folks at the top.",

Former Congresswoman Liz Cheney, in fact, a couple of weeks ago wrote an op-ed asking the court to please move quickly on this expeditiously. Because once we see this decision, it will have a big impact on whether Special Counsel Jack Smith can go ahead with the trial before the election.And what does that mean? Will Americans get to hear testimony from Trump's inner circle, from his former Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, from his former Vice President Mike Pence, from White House Counsels Cipollone, Philbin, Herschmann, who are all there. Not only in the weeks leading up to January 6th, but they were there on January 6th. They know what Trump did and did not do when the violence was going and it is really critical from what we understand of the grand jury testimony and other evidence for voters to be able to hear that evidence before they vote in November.",

And, Elie, you can comment on that one as well. The Supreme Court said the White House and federal agencies, such as the FBI, may continue to urge social media platforms to take down content the government use as misinformation.

So, you may remember about a year or so ago, a group of Republican state attorneys general and a group of internet users, social media users, sued the Biden administration. They said you are violating the First Amendment when you were -- during COVID -- primarily during COVID, but other issues to when you were reaching out to social media companies saying you need to take this post down, you need to moderate this post. And the question was, does that violate the First Amendment?The Supreme Court has now found by a 6-3 ruling, not your usual, it's actually a cross ideological majority, that the people who sued do not have standing, meaning state A.G.s and people who may use Twitter or Facebook, you don't have enough of an injury from this to even bring the lawsuit. So, they didn't even reach the First Amendment question, the First Amendment merits. The Supreme Court just said 6-3, you're out of luck. This lawsuit is no good. Go back to the drawing board.",

The conversation around reproductive rights and the conversation around abortion access has shifted away from the stereotypical notions of who people want to create a narrative of who's seeking abortions, and then the idea of those who are still wanting to have children and are desperate to do so, but are unable in this particular pregnancy.That has shifted the politics of this in a way that I think was probably not anticipated politically by a number of people. We remember hearing on our own airwaves when you had a different congressman saying, well, hold on, is the Republican Party going to be known as, you know, the It's anti-IVF, as anti-family planning as anti-different aspects of it.

It's a business decision and it's their platforms. And when the FBI says, hey, we think this might be Russian disinformation, that doesn't mean it's government censorship.

The justices, I guess they're just like us, maybe procrastinating a little bit because they still have ten outstanding opinions to release. And right now we know that they will release some likely tomorrow, and then on Friday, they could do ten in two days, but it appears likely that they may have to go in to the next week. It's also a little surprising, they had a similar but different case related to social media, and specifically states that it passed laws to restrict social media companies' ability to restrict conservative viewpoints, or to, in their words, censor them. It's a similar First Amendment question about the relationship between governments and social media companies. That was widely expected to maybe come at the same time as this other case to answer the broader questions about the First Amendment. Obviously, this one was kicked out on standing. The justices did not get into the First Amendment question here. So, that raises the possibility that maybe they will with the other case.

Two presidents will pitch two visions for our nation's future, two messages about who we are as a country, and two views on America's role on the world stage.The showdown nothing less than historic, it's the earliest presidential debate that we know of in American history. It's the closest the candidates will be to one another on stage. And it's the first time in decades that a network will host the showdown, not the presidential debate commission, and there won't be a live audience. CNN is covering this historic moment from all angles. Jeff Zeleny is live at our studios in Atlanta. Arlette Saenz is following President Biden at the White House. Kristen Holmes is at West Palm Beach for us with the Trump campaign. Jeff, let me start with you. You're down there at our Techwood campus kicking the tires and everything.

There are no advisers. The minute these two of presidents walk into the studio, they are all alone. And that is very unusual for presidents. As you know, they're very much surrounded by the trappings of office.So, how this will work? The moderators, Jake Tapper and Dana Bash, will ask a candidate a question. They can talk for two minutes. The other candidate will respond for a minute, and then the first candidate can respond for a minute as well. Interestingly, there's no audience, as we said. Also the microphones will be directed at the candidate who is speaking. It will not be on for the candidate who is not. Now, a big question here is, we all remember the first debate from four years ago, when there was so much interrupting going back and forth, it was hard to focus on the issues at hand. Will there be any of that? Will it be heard off mic or not? You can bet that has been part of the debate practice that President Biden has been doing at Camp David, and Donald Trump has been doing as well at Mar-a-Lago, a different type of debate prep. But, certainly this, will look different. It will have an old time feel, if you will. Of course, the first to televised presidential debate back in the 1960 campaign, just two candidates in studio, that's what tomorrow night's debate will look like as well, Jim, but so many more pressing issues in these times.",

That's a strategy that he had used back in 2020. It's not something he will do this time around. Instead, advisers say he will really focus on trying to drive home that contrast with former President Donald Trump. The campaign has teed up issues like abortion rights, democracy, and the economy. But advisers tell us that they are also prepared for the possibility that foreign policy could come up at this debate. That is an area where the campaign really believes that there is a stark contrast in Biden's vision for the world and Trump's vision for the world. It's an opportunity potentially for Biden to try to paint Trump as dangerous and unfit for office. A campaign official speaking of that, contrast said, quote, President Biden stands up to dictators and defends freedom. Trump is a loser who is too dangerous and reckless to ever be anywhere close to the Oval Office. Again, they added Donald Trump consistently praises authoritarian leaders and dictators, pledges to sell out our allies and undermines our democracy.
