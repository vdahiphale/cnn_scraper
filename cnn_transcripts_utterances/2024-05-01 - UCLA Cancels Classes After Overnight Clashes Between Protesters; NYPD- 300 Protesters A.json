So they just reinforced that here from the pro-Palestinian side and you can see they're still working on that here.For one thing, this is - where we're standing now is where we saw these clashes happening overnight. And the question that the Governor has is the question that a lot of people here have is why did it take so long for law enforcement to be called in? We know that they got here after midnight, after things had been escalating, where you see that footage where it looks like people are using the barricades, pulling them down, throwing things that way and some things coming from the other side as well during last night, what we saw - I can tell - still tell you, there's some blood out here still. And I talked to one woman who did just feel compelled. She's just a native of Los Angeles. She saw what was happening on the news. She just felt compelled to come out here, doesn't have students here or anything. And this is what she says she saw when she got out here. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

When Mayor Karen Bass called for it, after around one o'clock in the morning, that's when the police presence started to move here.

There are many set up.I don't particularly know if they're still set up, currently, because I have not been back to campus after the events of last night, but they have been around. People have been holding them and they have been shouting things that express their support for Israel and some support for Israel's military occupation of the Gaza Strip. And as to that previous point made, it does seem that most of these counter protesters are not students and that they are adults. Their affiliation with the university is unclear to us and they are not always the most willing to speak on what their affiliation would be, but they are not of the typical student age.

And I think the interesting facet is that we were expecting the university to allow the encampment to stay until the end of this quarter unless there were there were altercations that they deem to be violent than yesterday's that necessitated the removal of this encampment.However, yesterday they also released a statement saying that the encampment was a lawful and that it was unauthorized. And that if students and faculty do not leave, that they should expect to be faced with potential disciplinary actions, including sanctions, expulsion and suspension. So as of right now, we're prepared for it to be until the end of June, but that could change at any day.",

Well, little did anybody know that the wheels were already set in motion, that the president of the university yesterday, Minouche Shafik, had already submitted a letter to the New York Police Department, calling on officers to once again make their way onto campus to - not only to clear out what's left of the encampment, but also to regain control of the situation.The president of the university saying that the reason why that happened was because the university had been pushed to the brink. And so today, for the first time in two weeks now, any member of the Columbia University campus who wishes to participate in any sort of demonstration now presumably would have to do it on the sidewalks. And much of the afternoon, we saw these sort of roving pro-Palestinian protests, which have gone silent for now, but it certainly is possible that they will once again return. We also heard from not only New York City mayor, Eric Adams, today, but also members of the New York Police Department describing, going into great detail about the planning that went into place. Eric Adams saying that there was, as he described it, outside agitators that, as he said, influenced some of those demonstrators and had also seen signs and traces that there was a coordinated effort to certainly disrupt operations on campus. And then finally, there is also an important voice in all this, Brianna and Alex, that is some of those Columbia students, a majority of the students who were not actively participating in these demonstrations, one of them, Sulaiman Ahmed (ph), graduating hopefully next month, he says, that he was looking forward to any sort of normalcy. And now he, like so many other students, are concerned that an NYPD campus - an NYPD presence, I should say, on campus for the next several weeks, is uncalled for and unnecessary, as they - as he put it.",

In fact, UNRWA has said that just last month, that was the month where more trucks got in than at any time since October. But the fact is, UNRWA still says in the same breadth, as does Secretary Blinken, that it is still woefully inadequate. There is simply not enough being able to get through.Now, humanitarian aid groups are still blaming Israel saying that there are too many restrictions to get things into the Gaza Strip, the security is too slow, there are arbitrary decisions being made, at the same time as Israel is saying that it is doing everything it can to allow more food and aid into the Gaza Strip. But this was really a focus today with Secretary Blinken's trip and his meeting with the Israeli Prime Minister as well, talking about how to secure this ceasefire so that that they can swamp Gaza with aid. This is what humanitarian aid groups want to do. They want the ceasefire and then they say they can avert the famine. Now, as you have mentioned, they have said - Secretary Blinken says the ball is now in Hamas' court. He has said that this is the best proposal, the best deal that will be on offer, saying that Israel has been extraordinarily generous in this deal. We haven't heard officially from Hamas through the Egyptian and Qatari mediators at this point. We did hear from one senior Hamas official saying that what Israel hasn't managed to achieve during war, it will not achieve during negotiations and pressure, so trying to downplay the likelihood somewhat. But we haven't had an official response at this point, and certainly there are hopes on many sides that there will be a decision to carry out a ceasefire. At this point, it looks potentially as the first phase would be up to 33 hostages for several weeks of ceasefire and Palestinian prisoner releases. Back to you.",
