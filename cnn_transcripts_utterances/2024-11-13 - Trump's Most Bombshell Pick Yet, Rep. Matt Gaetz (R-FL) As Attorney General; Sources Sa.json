We're breaking down Trump's most jaw-dropping picks yet and how these loyalists might use their power on his behalf.And that includes a deep dive on the president-elect's choice to be the U.S. defense secretary, why even some Trump insiders are shocked and unhappy that Fox News Host Pete Hegseth has been tapped to lead the Pentagon and potentially reshape the U.S. military. Plus, we'll take you inside today's White House meeting between the incoming and current presidents. What they said in front of the cameras amid some awkward smiles and what happened behind the scenes. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. Let's get right to the breaking news, President-elect Donald Trump unveiling his stunning and polarizing choice to be attorney general of the U.S., Congressman Matt Gaetz. Trump following through on his desire to put a diehard loyalist at the helm of the U.S. Justice Department he has railed against. Let's get some more from CNN's Kristen Holmes, who's covering the Trump transition for us. Kristen, tell us more about the choice of Gaetz that's raising concerns, serious concerns, even among some Republicans.",

      "sentences": "That's right. This is certainly a controversial pick, Wolf. I want to make one thing clear, this really felt like a surprise to a lot of us that have been covering the transition because we had spoken to a number of people, particularly who are very close to the transition, who have been working with the Justice portion of the transition, who did not name Matt Gaetz as somebody who was on the short list.We have been told that this was someone who came out of the blue almost. He was just not somebody who had been sitting down with Donald Trump meeting with them as part of these traditional meetings, but I am told that this, in part, is because Matt Gaetz is such a loyal ally to Donald Trump. Now, one thing I want to note here, this is what Donald Trump said in his statement. He said, Matt Gaetz has distinguished himself in Congress through his focus on achieving desperately needed reform at the Department of Justice. Matt will end weaponized government. We cannot stress this enough, Donald Trump believes the role of the attorney general will be one of the most critical roles in his administration, if not the most critical role. Donald Trump also has said multiple times that part of what he intends to do is get rid of the deep state. I'm putting that in quotes. When he discusses deep state, he is talking about the Department of Justice. There is an entire plan in place that is expected to be enacted when Donald Trump takes office that essentially moves the Department of Justice to be fully underneath the executive, meaning that Donald Trump would have oversight into the Department of Justice. That also means that, for attorney general, he's going to need somebody who is going to be able to go along with anything that he wants to do, who is essentially a bomb thrower. As we know, Matt Gaetz is a loyalist to him, but also somebody who even Matt Gaetz's own critics say is a very smart person, someone who can possibly learn how to navigate the very much likely roadblocks that are going to be in the way as Donald Trump tries to implement his plan to take over the Justice Department.",

A number of those Republicans on those committee tell me tonight, Wolf, that they are not yet sold that this is the way to go.

I was a prosecutor for a long time.And let me be specific as to why. The two fundamental qualities that you need in an attorney general are, one, qualifications, and, two, independence. Okay, qualifications, Matt Gaetz has never worked a day in his life as a prosecutor. He has no idea what it means to stand in a court and say representing the United States. He has no idea what it means to indict someone and to potentially take their individual liberty away. He's only practiced law for a few years at the very local level. We've had A.G.s before. We've never been prosecutors, but they've all had serious positions in the Justice Department in non- prosecutorial roles. Matt Gaetz is completely unknown to this profession. With respect to his independence, Matt Gaetz is a firebrand. Matt Gaetz is the Trumpiest Congressman on Capitol Hill. And that's not me talking. I pulled that word for word off of Matt Gaetz's Congressional bio about the congressman. He brags about that. He says he wears that as a badge of honor. He is there to weaponize.

He's made that totally clear. That tradition does not interest him. He wants a Justice Department that will do his bidding, that will go after people that he feel wronged him. I mean, I'm just relaying what Donald Trump told voters day in and day out on the campaign trail. And I think what we saw here was -- and listen, we don't know if Matt Gaetz is going to get confirmed. He obviously has problems inside the Republican Party, which, in the Senate, will control this process through the advice and consent role. But we do know that by Donald Trump putting his name forward, this is a marker. Donald Trump wants to have this fight. He wants to have it with his own party. He wants to stick it in the eye of any remnant of the establishment of norm of institutions. And that's what he's doing with this pick.

Congressman, thanks very much for joining us. Democratic Senator Chris Murphy calls Trump's pick of Matt Gaetz for attorney general a red alert moment, his words, a red alert moment for our democracy. How do you see it? REP. JIM HIMES (D-CT): I agree with Chris Murphy. Look, you know, there's a lot of attributes that the attorney general needs, equanimity, care, prudence, a deep respect for the rule of law. Matt Gaetz is the opposite of all of those things. And I know Matt Gaetz, and, by the way, his Republicans feel -- his Republican colleagues feel the same way that I do. He is a gonzo agent of chaos. I remember when he led the attack on the offices of the Intelligence Committee, because he didn't like the fact that the Intelligence Committee was investigating Donald Trump. He actually burst in with a group of people violating all sorts of protocols that are designed to protect the national security information in the United States. So, it's just -- you know, after an interesting day yesterday, you know, where they nominated Rubio and Mike Waltz and John Ratcliffe, all people I know well and have respect for, again, I wouldn't have made those nominations, to come out today with Matt Gaetz, you know, I'm listening to these Republicans say, oh, you know, the American people asked for disruption. That is a total failure of discernment, right? You know what else the president could do if he wanted disruption? He could stop guarding our nuclear weapons. He could tell air traffic control to have a few cocktails before they showed up for work. You know, it is time particularly for the Senate to be discriminating and to say, do we have a constitutional role to act as act as a check or a balance? Sadly, I don't have a ton of confidence based on what I'm hearing from Republican senators who now seem to be wholly owned subsidiaries of Donald J. Trump.",

You know, we do one thing around here, which is to pledge to uphold the Constitution, which says that we are in opposition to the executive branch and to the president of the United States. So, you already see the excuses and the rationalizations being made. Here's another way of thinking about it, though, Wolf. You know, I think that the president-elect, Donald Trump, has already pulled more people from the House of Representatives than the Republicans have as a majority. So, there's some possibility here that there will be a conversation between the speaker and Donald Trump, and maybe this Matt Gaetz nomination gets rescinded. Because I think, frankly, if they take Stefanik, if they take Mike Waltz, if they take Matt Gaetz, and there was one or two others, they're no longer in the majority.

It's not coming from anyone's mouth except for Tulsi Gabbard's, first of all. Second of all, it's very consistent with the appointments we've seen so far, I think by President Trump, that he doesn't want to have a debate inside his administration about U.S. support for Ukraine. That debate seems to be over. That's how I interpret his announcement on the front end that he wouldn't be appointing either Mike Pompeo or Nikki Haley to his cabinet. Remember, Pompeo didn't run against Donald Trump. What did he do? He's been a consistent supporter an outspoken supporter of Ukraine, as has Nikki Haley. Instead, he's brought in people, even Marco Rubio who used to be more supportive of Ukraine, who voted against any military assistance earlier this year. And I think that's the through line here.
