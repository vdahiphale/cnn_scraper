To reiterate, this was not an accident. This was a deliberate act, they say, this escape from the hospital. So the new information, besides the fact that they've caught these two people now is that they are investigating these two homicides that are possibly related. We do know that they were captured in the Twin Falls area in Idaho that is southeast of Boise, about 120 miles south east. So they have been on the run since about 02:00 a.m. Wednesday morning. And just to go over how this even happened to begin with, the Boise police say or the Department of Corrections rather say that Skylar Meade, that's the person you're seeing on the right side of the screen, he was serving time since 2016. He was in a very secure part of the prison system. And we need to confirm exactly which location, but he had apparently injured himself they say which required medical attention and that's why they transferred him to the hospital at around -- between 09:00 and 10:00 pm Tuesday night. And he was treated and then discharged at 02:00 am approximately. That's when this other person, they say, shot two corrections officers. They will recover from their injuries we're told. And when Boise police responded to that they accidentally shot a third corrections officer who thankfully will also recover from his injuries, Jake.",

What can you tell us about this group in general? And what role do you think members may have played in this escape plot? ROB D'AMICO, RETIRED FBI SUPERVISORY SPECIAL AGENT: Well, it's an act of prison gang. And as soon as you get into the prisons, you have all different kinds of gangs in there based on, you know, Hispanic gangs, you have black gangs, you have white gangs, and some people join it just for protection. They're not really hardcore gang members, they join it in order to protect themselves from the other gangs. But then you have like these guys, hardcore, they met in there, and I'm sure they plan -- started planning it in there. And when one got out, he continued probably with his group. I'm surprised they actually got caught so quick, but it was a violent encounter. I thought they would have had a better means to go to ground and get -- go dark for a while. But that didn't happen.",

You would have thought they had things laid out a bit different that they could, again, go dark get out from, you know, society to a point. But I did suspect that if they came across someone and turned violent, then that's when they would probably be captured, because that's where police would go to.

Well, I guess it's not official, but he's going to be the nominee. Paul Manafort, Trump's former 2016 campaign chairman, who, as you may remember, spent two years in prison for bank and tax fraud before Trump pardoned him, Manafort is now up for a job working with Republican national convention this summer. Not to be outdone, Corey Lewandowski also being considered for a top job at the convention. Lewandowski was fired as Trump's first campaign manager in 2016.He was also forced out of a Trump Super PAC after the wife of a donor accused him of making unwanted sexual advances, he denies that. And then there are the former Trump whispers, shall we call them, who are back as some of Trumps biggest defenders. That would include Republican operative Roger Stone who was indicted by Special Counsel Robert Muller, convicted of obstructing a congressional investigation into Trump's Russia ties. He was pardoned by Trump. Steve Bannon, who had pleaded not guilty to charges he defrauded donors in a We Build the Wall online fundraising campaign, he also pardoned by Trump -- by -- pardoned by Trump. And Michael Flynn, Trump's short lived former national security adviser was charged with lying to the FBI who was, everybody, pardoned by Trump. Without Trump's intervention, it is possible of course, that Manafort, Stone, Bannon and Flynn could have spent this election cycle serving time. My panel is back this hour to discuss.

And they are right now in the process of being processed by border patrol. They were put on buses. What we saw is mostly a massive group of young men, also women and children part of this group as well. And all of this, you know, we should be very clear is we're not exactly sure what instigated this or what sparked this particular tension to arise.

It could do so in as few as six months with no warning. That assessment today from a top U.S. general. This after Tuesday's hearing with two now retired senior generals who were in command during the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. Generals Milley and Mackenzie spoke at length that day about the strategic failures leading up to and during what they saw as a rushed withdrawal operation. Joining us now to discuss Lieutenant Colonel Scott Mann, a retired Green Berets, who was deployed in Afghanistan. He wrote the book \"Operation Pineapple Express,\" which details the true story of a group of Green Berets who saved the former comrade as well as 500 others Afghans targeted by the Taliban during the chaotic U.S. withdraw. Lieutenant Colonel, first of all, thank you so much for your service and for what you did to help people get out of Afghanistan. General Milley and McKenzie directly blamed the State Department for delaying the noncombatant evacuation operation for all the remaining U.S. citizens in Afghanistan, making it difficult to extricate them after Kabul fell to the Taliban. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GEN. KENNETH MCKENZIE, JR. (RET.), FORMER COMMANDER, U.S. CENTRAL COMMAND: I was concerned by the middle of July.

You and I were at the Press Club on the anniversary of the explosion this past year when you and Sean Ryan talk to the gold star families of the 13 who fell. You talk to members of Operation Allies Refuge who were at Abbey Gate. And what I will tell you man, as I'm traveling the country, and I'm talking to veterans, they are really, really upset and feel a sense of betrayal by the way this went down. And yes, the State Department was the proponent for it. They dropped the ball, they failed the plan. But I also have to say and I think I'm speaking for a lot of veterans that when I watched that testimony, these two general officers who both said they knew this was coming, they knew this was going to happen. The question that so many veterans have on their minds is why did a flag officer not throw his or her stars on the table and take a stand against this particularly seeing the way that ISIS-K and al-Qaeda are now reemerging in a place where 9/11 originated from?

ESPN reports that the number of allegedly stolen is $4.5 million. Born and raised in Japan, the pitcher and power hitter recently signed with the Dodgers for the biggest contract in baseball history, 10 years, $700 million. So who allegedly stole from him? Well, according to the Los Angeles Times, Ohtani's attorneys claim it was Ippei Mizuhara, Ohtani's longtime friend and interpreter who the Dodgers just fired yesterday.But wait, here's a curveball before the accusation, ESPN says they interviewed the interpreter about his gambling debts and that's where they say he claimed Ohtani knew about his gambling problem and had agreed to pay his debts and did so willingly through a wire transfer. And according to ESPN Ohtani's spokesperson initially told ESPN that Ohtani was covering his longtime friend's debt. Then a few hours later, the narrative changed. Then Ohtani's attorneys started accusing Mizuhara of stealing from Ohtani, talking about a changeup. Mizuhara then tells ESPN he lied. And then Ohtani never knew about his debts and did not make any payments. What? I want to bring in someone deeply sourced on the story and you also talked with Ohtani's former interpreter, ESPN investigative reporter Tisha Thompson. Tisha, welcome to THE LEAD. Great to have you. This is a really wild and messy scandal. What unresolved questions stand out to you the most? TISHA THOMPSON, INVESTIGATIVE &amp; ENTERPRISE REPORTER, ESPN: The conversations that were had with Ohtani after the Dodgers played their season opener in South Korea after I had interviewed Mizuhara in a 90- minute interview a few hours before that game. There was a -- there was a meeting in the Dodgers locker room right after the game. There was a series of comments that were made. The owner said there was a story coming. Mizuhara got up and apologized for gambling. And then according to two sources close to a Chinese camp who have told ESPN Ohtani knows enough English to start to wonder what was being said because an official with the Dodgers got up and said to the team that Ohtani had paid the bets based on what Mizuhara had been saying to us in the interview that we had done with him. At the same time, Ohtani's spokesperson was also checking out what Mizuhara had said because we're very close to publishing, and that's when that statement comes is that there's been massive theft and there was so much movement so quickly, even within just a couple of hours, Mizuhara was fired. So it moves very, very rapidly. There was a big 180 on what had happened. And then I myself call Mizuhara to try to figure out what's going on because we're getting one. You know, we're getting told one thing by Ohtoni's spokesperson. But I wanted to hear from Mizuhara what happened. And he didn't tell me much. But when I said, did you lie to me in the interview? He said, yes. And then I, through a series of questions and answers, he said to me, essentially that Ohtani had never known about the gaming debts. And that Ohtani had not made the wire transfers. But here's the thing, Jake, this is what's I think really important.",
