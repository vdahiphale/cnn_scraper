      "sentences": "Good morning. You are live in the CNN Newsroom. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.We do begin the hour with breaking news as yet another powerful hurricane barrels toward Florida. There it is. Milton is now a Category 4 and it's getting stronger quickly. It's aiming directly at the Tampa Bay area and could become a Category 5 storm at some point. Officials are warning of life threatening storm surge and damaging winds to communities still picking up the pieces from Helene. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis gave this warning just moments ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL):  We need as much of this debris picked up as possible. This creates a safety hazard and it also will increase the damage that Milton could do with flying debris. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

You could have another powerful hurricane come in and slam the coast and lift up this debris and, you know, fly it in a hundred different directions.

      "sentences": "Yes. Jim, I mean, state is now facing its second major hurricane strike in less than two weeks. That's just incredible. We were on the ground for Hurricane Helene when it came ashore, and we saw the damage that's left over that they are still busy cleaning up, as one would imagine. And now we're facing this real threat which has rapidly intensified now into a major Category 4 hurricane already still in the Bay of Campeche. And it's got a long way to go before it reaches Florida. We'll try to dissect all the information here.But the beauty of the information, the time that we live in is that we get these minute by minute updates really from the National Hurricane Center and the hurricane hunter who fly solely into the eye of the storm to determine just how strong it is getting, and they had in all caps locks and some of their most recent updates. They're experiencing extreme turbulence in the southwest quadrant of the storm and large hail as well. Now, that only happens in some of the most intense -- rapidly intensifying storms. I've flown with the hurricane hunters before, experienced it, when a storm levels off in strength, it doesn't have those properties. So, to put it into context, we're talking nearly 100 miles an hour increase in speed. That's the sustained winds in roughly 30 hours. That is phenomenal, doubling the criteria that we have laid out for rapid intensification. So, where does it go from here? Well, the latest update overnight from the National Hurricane Center has this brushing the Northern Yucatan Peninsula potentially as a low end Category 5. That's still to be determined at the rate that this thing's going. But what's also important about this is that it has slowed down in its forward speed. So, we're anticipating now a later arrival landfalling time late Wednesday into early Thursday, somewhere along the central western gulf coast of the Florida Peninsula. So, when we look at the hazards here, we know catastrophic wind and storm surge are a real threat. But here is Pinellas County. Here is Sarasota. Here is Lee County. Remember what happened with Fort Myers Beach in Hurricane Ian in September 2022? And I got to just squeeze this in here, 8 to 12 feet of storm surge, that's the initial forecast, that's going to eclipse what happened with the storm Hurricane Helene two weeks ago as it moved offshore from Tampa Bay. So, this is going to be significantly more concerning.",

Derek Van Dam, thank you very much.Hurricane Milton could make landfall just 12 days after Hurricane Helene ripped through the southeast. And joining me now to talk about this is Keith Turi with FEMA's Office of Response and Recovery. Keith, good morning. Thanks for being with us. What's the agency's plan for dealing with Milton?

We're providing any assistance that we can offer.But storms like this offer a range of hazards. There's going to be storm surge, there's going to be wind there's going to be rain and potential tornadoes. Even without that debris, it's an extremely dangerous storm. And one thing we just really want to stress that storm surge area and those evacuation orders, it's critically important that people follow those evacuation orders. Unfortunately, Hurricane Ian just a few years ago, Hurricane Helene just a few weeks ago, we have seen loss of life in these storms and people need to follow that direction and evacuate if directed to do so.",

As you know, our administrator has been on the ground in North Carolina to be able to help oversee those efforts.What we have right now is we have food, water, other commodities that are being brought to people. We have partners of the Department of Defense that are helping go in for get commodities from those locations to people where they may be. And we're working very aggressively with the state and local government to help get those utilities back up and running. In the meantime, we're providing disaster assistance directly to people who need it, and that includes financial assistance or the ability to relocate 1,700 individuals that are in hotels that we've been able to provide them an opportunity to get somewhere safe.

We have a rumor response page up on our website. We're working with local officials, with state officials, to try to make sure that accurate information gets out there, that you can register for assistance with FEMA, and there is assistance that is available to you.

And, of course, to continue to advocate for the 97 hostages who were taken on October 7th, who remain in Gaza today.And not only is it an opportunity for so many Israelis to try and remind the world about the massacre that happened on October 7th that killed about 1,200 people, the majority of whom were civilians, but inside Israel, so many are also seeing this as an opportunity to once again raise the pleas of the hostages being held in Gaza. I just spoke with Aviva Siegel, a former hostage herself, whose husband, Keith, is an American citizen still being held hostage in Gaza, and she told me that there were moments where she thought that she just wanted to die when she was being held hostage, and that was just 51 days. Her husband, Keith, has been held hostage for a year now. And she simply does not know what more she can do to get the leaders of the world, to get the Israeli government to prioritize a hostage deal, to get her husband, Keith, out of Gaza. And so this is -- as this is a country in mourning, it is also one that is continuing to try and advocate and also a country that is very much still at war. And we have been reminded of that time and time again today, as we have heard alert sirens, air raid sirens going off in Southern Israel near the Gaza border as Hamas has fired rockets there, as well as here in Tel Aviv, and, of course, in Northern Israel, where Hezbollah has continued to fire rockets. The Israeli government also continues currently deliberating on a potential response to that ballistic missile barrage from Iran. And so even as this is a country in mourning, a country commemorating a very sad event, it is also one that is still at war and still facing a very, very tense region that does not appear to be stabilizing on year after Israel in response to that October 7th massacre launched its war in Gaza.

I think that's where we're at the moment.Obviously, in Israel's position, you can't allow any country to allow 180 ballistic missiles to be launched your way and not retaliate. Obviously, if that happened in a European country, we would expect that European ally to retaliate. And so right now, the whole idea is to make sure that this doesn't spill over and become a regional war. But right now, yes, Israel is going to degrade the military capabilities of Iran and their proxies on their border. That's probably going to go on for another several weeks before we regroup and figure out if there could be some sort of deal to be had.",

You're going to have storm surge. That's going to be something that we haven't seen in 100 years. And there's been a lot of building there in the last a hundred years, a lot of people.And so I'm deeply concerned about people. They need to leave. They need to evacuate. If they're under evacuation orders, if they live in what you would say Zone A or in mobile homes, and they're being directed by their local emergency manager to evacuate, they should leave. And they don't need to go far. They just need to go inland, away from the coast. So, I'm deeply concerned about this very powerful storm coming into the Tampa Bay region, Pinellas County, all of that. The second thing I'm really concerned about, Jim, is this is not happening in a vacuum. There are five other states that have emergencies going on from Hurricane Helene, North Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, and obviously the cleanup that's still going on in Florida. There's going to be a resource issue. There is absolutely going to be a resource issue. We saw it when we had Harvey, Irma and Maria. We had a resource issue to respond, and we're going to see that same resource issue. And we're going to need resources to come all the way from the West Coast to help these communities respond, recover and rebuild. But right now, I'm really worried about loss of life.",
