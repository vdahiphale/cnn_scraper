Wolf, the U.N. agency relief and humanitarian agency that runs it inside of Gaza, say that it was sheltering about 16,000 civilians, people often go to these un schools in Gaza to get away from the possibility of being hit by missiles, because they think that the schools are safe because the U.N.-run their designated and they're safe.But what the U.N. is saying that in the sort of courtyard area where people had their tents pitched, that's where the missile struck, according to the U.N. And they say that 15 civilians were killed, 70 wounded. This school, Al-Fakhoura School is in the Jabalia refugee camp. And, of course, in the past couple of days, there have been -- there have been strikes there that were the IDF was targeting Hamas control and command center, a commander in an underground bunker on another occasion. And just yesterday, targeted a convoy of ambulances that the ICRC had said -- the International Committee for the Red Cross, who said was getting ready to be a humanitarian convoy to go to the south of Gaza. But the IDF said, look, inside one of those ambulances there was Hamas operatives, or Hamas -- or Hamas weapons inside one of those ambulances. That said, that attack caused, again, 15 civilian deaths, and 80 civilian casualties. So, again, to have something like this at a U.N.-run score in the Jabalia refugee camp, again, gets to the center of what Secretary of State Antony Blinken is talking about with counterparts from the region. We've heard from the Egyptian foreign minister, saying that Israel's strikes at the moment are not a legitimate form of defense. And, of course, this is part of the conversation with Secretary Blinken -- we heard him saying that it's not time for Israel to have a ceasefire. So, when you get a situation like that, again, in this school in Gaza today, it just, again, highlights the civilian casualty toll at a time when there is so much pressure increasing on Israel to call for a ceasefire.

We've seen those lists published now, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, today, that stop. They simply have been able to go to get out. No one has gotten out of Rafah today, ever since, as you say Hamas linked the ability of those foreign nationals to get through the Rafah crossing to get out of Gaza to the safe passage of ambulances from Gazan hospitals to the Rafah crossing.This is -- ever since that strikes, just outside the Al Shifa Hospital yesterday that saw 15 people killed, a strike claimed by the IDF. Greater Palestinian health authorities and the Red Cross say that, that has been a convoy that it had been heading down to Rafah to take the wounded. Very difficult to see how this can get unblocked from the start. The question of whether the Rafah crossing would be open to civilians, or be it only foreign ones was linked in negotiations by Hamas to the exiting of wounded Palestinians. Initially, Hamas had wanted some of their wounded to be included in that deal. That fell through is unacceptable to Israel. It was all unblocked last Tuesday, which allowed all those civilians to get out including the 100 Americans that you mentioned, because Hamas back down and said, fine, they won't be Hamas fighters, but they need to be wounded Palestinians. Since then, several dozen have gotten out. Now, that appears to have stopped. Now, we've been hearing today from David Satterfield, the U.S. special envoy to the Middle East, feeling about -- speaking about the necessity not just to reopen Rafah in terms of people coming out and the aid getting in, but actually to see more points to south of Gaza reopen, given the humanitarian needs that are involved in that nearly million people that Nic just mentioned now in the south of Gaza.

I mean, is this just the beginning as this conflict in the Middle East seems far from over? Or is it your worry or concern that there will, you know, be other incidents that rise to that level? IDRISS: Yes. I mean, I think, look, this war has been obscene from the very start. From the attacks, the slaughters committed by Hamas on October 7th, unspeakable attacks that were entirely unjustified. And to, you know, 2,000-pound bombs being dropped this week on a refugee camp, densely populated urban centers. And as a result, we're not going to have, you know, pieces and just made in the antiseptic halls of, you know, the backrooms in Geneva or whatever. It's also made by people who are deeply affected, deeply traumatized by the violence, coming into contact with one another and figuring out a better way forward. I am absolutely concerned, absolutely concerned that we'll see more extremist violence threats, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia. Unfortunately, Fred, you know, as I think, you know, and I think you've covered long before this war, we were already seeing years of increases in this kind of hate filled rhetoric on campuses and in our society more generally, here in the U.S. So, this is only fueling that. But I do think it's very important to highlight those incidences which are actually in the majority, where not only have campuses done the right thing, in terms of a no tolerance policy for that kind of violence and intimidation. But where oftentimes the campus and even the students have taken the lead in reaching out across the dividing lines. The Jewish students reaching out to Muslim students issuing joint statements of Muslim and Christian students reaching out to escort Jewish students who feel understandably uncomfortable on certain campuses right now.

I think when DeSantis takes the stage shortly, he has a challenge ahead of him. He needs to try to draw support away from Donald Trump, especially away from donors who in recent weeks have been flocking to the former president. I think you're going to hear him really hammer in on his record here in Florida and try to make the case for why he is a better candidate than the former president. But of course, he has to thread a very careful needle, because a lot of people in this room are fans of Donald Trump. They do not want to hear DeSantis speaking negatively about him or he could be booed like some of the other candidates today. So we're going to hear him shortly after Casey DeSantis leaves this stage. I think you're going to hear a big call for them to rally around him and his record in Florida. I do think you're going to see some cheers. We've heard many cheers from DeSantis supporters in the room. Holding signs saying, \"This is DeSantis country.\" So a lot more to come shortly -- Fred?",
