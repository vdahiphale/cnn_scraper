The temperature -- the air temperature negative nine degrees, but the wind chill is making the feels like temperature negative 31.Now I should mention the wind right now feels very similar to last night. The normal speeds around 20 miles per hour, but there are gusts of up to 36 miles per hour that's helping make things feel a little bit colder. And you'll remember it was -- we were forecast here in Boston to hit negative 36 with wind chill overnight. That did happened just a couple of hours ago. But I can tell you the good news here in Boston is that by around 10:00, we expect the temperature to hopefully get up to zero that will be considered progress. Of course, as you mentioned, a number of records broken in the region. You mentioned a Mountain Washington but also here in Boston, according to the National Weather Service Boston, a new record set of negative eight that must be for last night and negative five in 1881. Anyway, your point was that 20 million people remain under these wind chill warnings and advisories because this, these conditions are going to continue until at least late morning when they begin to move out. We're told that high temperatures across the Northeast and New England will still remain 10 to 30 degrees below normal today. So, an improvement but not a complete improvement. I can tell you that here in Massachusetts one of the concerns was power outages because of course you don't want to be without heat with these sorts of temperatures. The Massachusetts Emergency Management Authority said last night, there were about 45,000 people or customers I should say without power by later last night, that number had gone down to about 10,000. And so the work on that continues. But bottom line here is all of the warnings that we were giving yesterday remain in effect today. As much as you can, you should stay inside. If you do go outside where many, many layers try to limit your time outdoors. Obviously, check on your neighbors, bring your pets inside and that sort of thing.

That said, this explanation about this being a weather balloon, most experts agree is pretty dubious at best. Weather balloons in the United States certainly aren't the size of three buses 90 feet long, you know, visible from the ground when they're at an altitude of, you know, 60 plus 1,000 feet.But what China says, actually occurred, weather balloon explanation aside is actually plausible. A lot of experts say saying that it is being blown by the westerly winds, you know, the jet stream, basically, that it has limited ability to steer itself, and that it seriously deviated from this scheduled route. In other words, this was a mistake in accident, China admitted that. And when you look at this in the greater context of what China has been preparing for, for months, literally months since President Biden met with President Xi of China, back at the G20 in Bali in November, China has been very much looking forward to these meetings in Beijing. And it seems highly unlikely, according to every expert, I've talked to that the day before that meeting, they would fly this giant orb, you know, through the American heartland, including over Columbia, Missouri, where I went to college, there's not a whole lot of valuable intel that they would gain by hovering a balloon, you know, across the Midwest that they don't already have from their vast network of spy satellites. So, China, well, admitting this is a mistake. They're also accusing some American politicians and media of blowing this whole thing out of proportion, using it to attack and discredit China, which is basically what China says every time they're criticized. But just the fact that they came out and acknowledged an error is very significant, very rare, and indicates just how important this Blinken meeting is to them, which notably has been postponed but not canceled because the U.S. and China, Boris and Amara, have a lot to talk about Taiwan, the tensions here one major issue but also semiconductors human right, the laundry list goes on.

We want to get some perspective now with retired Air Force Colonel Cedric Leighton. Colonel Leighton, always great to have you bright and early on a Saturday morning, appreciate the time as always. First, these longer-range missiles included in the aid package, they can hit targets more than 90 miles away.

One of the key things here is that they're finally looking at this as a war that you would have to go after, the place where these missiles, these Russian missiles and rockets originate from. And that's what's been missing really from the whole aid equation that we've had up until this point.So, the one thing that you are looking at in terms of the actual weaponry, you're looking at these ground-launched small diameter bombs that are a part of that effort. They could be used as part of the HIMARS system, and they are the ones that have a range of up to around 95 miles. That can then really impact on Russian forces as they are launching missiles into places like Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Kramatorsk, all those areas. And so, this could potentially -- if the Ukrainians get enough of them and get them in time, could make a big difference for the Ukrainians in the war effort.

We've seen them trying to soften up targets by launching major artillery barrages and rocket barrages against Kherson, against Zaporizhzhia areas, and that is going to be, I think, a place where they could advance. They've certainly dug themselves in, but they have one big geographical boundary that they have to cross, that's the Dnipro River.

There are some that can reach that ceiling. But for the most part, they are at 50,000 feet or below.So, it's not easy to use a fighter jet to shoot it down. You could potentially use a system like the patriot or something like that, but that  would be a huge expenditure of munitions for something that is, you know, fairly small target in that sense.

And therefore, who else could it be? Says the prosecution through the expert witness. However, on cross-examination you hear that, you know, at the end of the day, it's inconclusive and we don't know. And so, the issue is going to be, Amara, which type of narrative this jury buys? Are you saying as we look there at all of the rifles, there are -- will the jury accept that? Listen, it seems pretty odd, right? And there are really coincidental that shell casings examined by an expert were all over the property and they seem to be very similar to the one used in the weapon, but then again the firearms instructor said or expert said it was inconclusive. What do we do? So inconclusive, the defense will yell, scream and shout, means reasonable doubt, the prosecution will say, you know what? It's not a coincidence, it was him.

The defense is saying that how is that relevant to whether or not he committed murder in terms of whatever financial shenanigans that he was engaged in or up to.We heard, of course, testimony outside the presence of the jury concerning those financial shenanigans, concerning him handling apparently with his housekeeper of 20 years. That personal injury case with a friend because she slipped and fell, and him not disclosing that with Murdaugh, that is to the family, that he had reached financial settlement. We heard about the fact that he stole his firm's money again outside the presence of the jury. The defense is saying OK, he is a dishonest person potentially, but does that make him a murderer? On the other hand, the prosecution is showing that, listen, his family could have turned on him as a result. You don't know what internal discussions they had in that regard. He was concerned about them closing in and therefore got rid of them. I don't particularly buy that as a motive. The wife has a spousal privilege, does not have to testify against her husband. The son, right? I mean, why would the son testify against his father? So that's not a particularly compelling motive. The judge has to decide whether to allow that in, so the jury can hear it and make a decision as to whether it could have been a motive here, not the strongest motive in my view.",

I mean, this news that he wants out of Brooklyn coming just a week after being voted as a starter in the upcoming NBA All-Star game with his team sitting in fourth place in the Eastern Conference.But just when things are so great, they're smoothing out in Brooklyn, something else drops. And according to those reports, he told the team, he does want to be traded within the next six days before that deadline on Thursday, or he's going to leave in free agency in July. The eight-time All-Star is in the final year of that four-year $136.4 million contract, but he has certainly had something of a tumultuous run with the Nets who rescinded a four-year $200 million extension offer in October of 2021 after he refused to meet New York's COVID-19 vaccine mandate. He ended up playing in just 29 games last season. And then 3 months ago, many people remember that he was suspended by the team for failing to disavow anti-Semitism in the wake of tweeting a link to a film that feature anti-Semitic troves. Kyrie eventually apologizing for that. He completed a list of team-issued tasks and then returned after missing eight games. CNN has reached out to the Nets and Kyrie's agent for comment on this most recent development. There are some rumors now that he could be headed to L.A. potentially to meet up with LeBron James who is in pursuit of the NBA's all-time scoring record, that is set to continue today when the Lakers travel to New Orleans to face the Pelicans. LeBron now just 63 points away from Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's record. But he would need to have a career-high performance to take the top spot in this game. His highest scoring effort 61 points while with the Miami Heat way back in 2014. There is also a chance that King James won't even play. He's recently been experiencing left ankle soreness. But we do know that, that record is very much on his mind. By the way, Kareem has held that record for nearly 39 years, and set the all-time scoring mark in 1984, that was 8 months before LeBron was even born. Elton John singing \"Saturday Night's Alright\". For fighting, where Friday night was good enough for the Orlando Magic and the Minnesota Timberwolves. Keep an eye on the top of your screen here. Minnesota guard Austin Rivers and 7 foot, 231 pound Magic center Mo Bamba getting into it in front of Orlando's bench. And then things just going from bad to worse. It got ugly in an all- out brawl, punches being thrown, when it was over, five players were ejected. The Magic ended up winning an ugly one, 127-120, the final there. And there is a lot of demand, guys, for Tom Brady memorabilia ever since he announced his second retirement for good, we think earlier this week. That apparently includes sand. Somebody found the exact location where the seven-time Super Bowl winner recorded his good-bye message to football, and listed the sand for sale on eBay. So the incredible part of all this is as of Saturday morning, the bidding for the bottle has reached nearly $100,000 with more than eight days until the auction closes. Of course, it remains to be seen if the winning bidder will actually pay that kind of money, but the fact that there has been 124 bids is just the latest example of how popular the quarterback is. You guys spend a lot more time on the beach than I do, a $100,000 for a jar of sand, it seems crazy to me --",
