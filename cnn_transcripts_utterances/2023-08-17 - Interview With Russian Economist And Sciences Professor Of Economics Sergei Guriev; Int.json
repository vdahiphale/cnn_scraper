I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. Ukraine has been pleading for over a year for a coveted American F-16 fighter jets to help defend its skies. But today, Kyiv says that it does not expect any deliveries in 2023, and that's according to a spokesperson for Ukrainian air force. Training for Ukrainian pilots on the much-anticipated planes was supposed to begin this month, but U.S. officials previously said that they were still waiting for a final plan from their European counterparts before that could begin. This as Ukraine continues to defend itself against Russian missile attacks. One in the east of the country today temporarily leaving 10,000 people without power. Now, despite all of that, the Ukrainian counteroffensive continues, advancing for the second time in two weeks to the southeast with the recapture the village of Urozhaine. That's 60 miles from Russian occupied Donetsk City. Correspondent Nick Paton Walsh has been if the Ukrainian Brigade involved in that fight and has this report.

Thecountry's currency, the ruble, has fallen to a 17-month low against the dollar. Russia's central bank is stepping in to try to halt the slide, raising interest rates by 3.5 percent. So, what's at play here and what does it mean for Russia and the war in Ukraine? Joining me now to discuss is Russian economist and professor of economics at Sciences Po, Sergei Guriev. Sergei, it's good to see you. So, as noted, Russia's central bank has really stepped in here, raising rates in hopes of propping up this declining ruble. The country is dealing with ballooning deficits in its efforts to try to pay for this war. And it's seen a drop in export revenues. But -- and there's a big but here, Russia's economy is still expected to grow, albeit slowly, but it hasn't contracted yet. And many analysts, including yourself, had predicted that at this point in the war, we would see that. So, give us a sense of where Russia's economy stands right now?",

As you rightly mentioned, the revenues Russian budget it's getting from oil and gas are hit. And in the first months of 2023, the Russian oil and gas revenues were down by half, which, of course, created the budget deficit as you mentioned. Now, this is not a macroeconomic disaster or a meltdown, but indeed, it constrains the capacity of Russian government to finance military spending and also support -- also sure the support for the war. Mr. Putin, of course, says that this war is hugely popular and he has 80 or 90 percent Russian household supporting him and his war, but this is not the case as we saw during Mr. Prigozhin's mutiny that nobody spoke for Mr. Putin, nobody took it to the street to support Mr. Putin. And in that sense, we see how sanctions create tensions within Russia. As I said, there many different dimensions of that. One of the things you mentioned, if we just look at top line GDP numbers, they look better than Russian households would feel because, of course, GDP numbers during wartime also include military production. So, whenever the Russian industry produces a tank or a rocket or ammunition, it looks like it produces fairly (ph) added, but of course, this is something that has been destroyed in Ukraine in order to kill Ukrainians and destroy Ukrainian citizens and does not add to quality of life of ordinary Russians. Their living standards have come down much more than GDP numbers would suggest.",

And I strongly support this policy. I think this is a very innovative and bold strategy to reduce oil and gas revenues for the Russian budget. I think more has to be done, and there are several things that the western coalition could have done in the months to come. One is to actually reduce oil price cap from $60 to say $55 or $50 to further tighten the impact of the oil price cap. And also, to clamp down, to intensify the fight against loopholes. You mentioned that other countries, not just Saudi Arabia, but third countries help Russia to circumvent sanctions both the import of sensitive technology but also circumventing the oil price cap constraints.

I want to get you to respond to whatAlex Gabuev, somebody who you know well, a Russian expert and director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center wrote recently in a piece about Putin looking for a bigger war in his view and not for an offramp in Ukraine. And here's what he said. He wrote, the Kremlin believes that it can afford a long war. The Russian economy is forecast to record growth this year, mostly thanks to military factories working around the clock. Critical component such as microchips needed for the defense ministry are arriving from China and other sources. Despite sanctions, the Kremlin's war chest is still overflowing with cash, thanks to windfall energy profits last year. So, this is sort of summing up what you and I have already been discussing, and I think for the majority of yours, a lot of them are sort of scratching their heads saying, wait a minute, we were talking about unprecedented sanctions leveled against Russia, virtually all big international western companies having left Russia and stop doing business there. And yet, from this point of view, it seems Putin is still doing rather well and can afford to keep this were going for much longer than many had expected. Would you agree with that sentiment?",

      "sentences": "So, we don't really know because we don't know how much of yuan Putin has. For example, a recent reporting suggested he sold so much oil toIndia, but now, he doesn't know what to do with $14 billion of rupees, worth of rupees. Rupees is not a convertible currency. So, he doesn't know what to do with Indian currency stocked in Indian banks. And to what extent he has resources to continue this war for many more years, we don't really know. But so far, he seems to be confident and yet, I would just make two arguments suggesting that sanctions are important. First, imagine the world without the sanctions, Bianna. If you think about the world where Putin has many more sources of revenue, if he continues to sell his oil and gas all over the world without oil price cap and European oil embargo, if he gets -- easily gets this technology semiconductor, not just from China, but from Europe and Taiwan, that would be a very different outcome in the battlefield. And I think sanctions have already made an impact making sure that Putin has not won this war. And the second thing I would mention is, if you think about Mr. Prigozhin's mutiny, his mutiny actually originated from Mr. Progression Prigozhin that he doesn't get enough munitions to advance in the Ukrainian battle. And so, those complaints and his mutiny eventually are an implication of the sanctions. Sanctions limited Putin's ability to pay for the ammunitions and tanks and rockets and second, to be able to produce those things. I think more has to be done. And here, I fully agree with you and Alex, we need to close down the loopholes for circumventing the sanctions, including getting semiconductors from China.",

She is a well-respected technocrat, and there had been reports in the past that when the war began, she had wanted to leave the country and Vladimir Putin said she can't. She had also told people previously that if there was any sort of currency manipulation pressed of her, she would resign. That hasn't happened. She has been done what has been asked of her, but there is this question about whether the Central Bank and her role there in the Kremlin are headed towards a collision course. We know what will happen if that's the fact, the Kremlin will be in charge of fiscal policy in Russia.

And so, he will not appoint KGB, (INAUDIBLE). Mr. Putin is smarter than that. He has complete trust in those loyal individuals, as we said, very capable and competent technocrats. So, I don't think Mr. Putin is that crazy. I think he will steer the ship in terms of military and geopolitical strategy, but he will leave macroeconomic policy to professionals, which, of course, is not good. I would just mentioned that some of Elvira's deputies have left the ship in some capacity. But so far, unfortunately, the critical mass of the team is still there. And when you mentioned that ruble is becoming weaker, it's actually part of the game because of Russian economy slowing down and being hit by sanctions. And again, oil revenue is being hit by sanctions. And Putin's ability to keep buy more stuff through third country, creates a difficult agreement in the ruble market. So, he has fewer petrodollars and he needs more dollars to buy for imported components, that's a normal market force that pressures on ruble to go weaker, and Elvira lets ruble go weaker, and that's completely normal. So, this is actually quite a competent decision.",

I felt very much that Shannon Schaeffer, who is this -- you know, played by West Duchovny, who's one of the pharma reps in the story, is another victim of this in some ways. You know, and her addiction was to money and, you know, to success and this was a very clear path. And again, I think a lot of people were misled, including many doctors. I don't believe that someone who chooses to devote their life to caring for people would willingly put them at risk, but the absence of information, the obfuscation, the failure to disclose the true properties of this are very much to blame. And so, this army of young people were programed with bad information and sent out into the world to sell the stuff. And, you know, it's one of a number of tragedies around this. And then, there's so much money that made it all OK for a while, and money has a way of doing that.

So, very early on, the police became feared for the African American community, and they weren't there to kind of serve and protect African Americans, they were there really to control African Americans.
