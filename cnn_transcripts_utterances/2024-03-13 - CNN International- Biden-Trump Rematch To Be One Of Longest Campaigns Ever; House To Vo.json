Before that, he was in Pennsylvania, and now he heads to Wisconsin to continue the drumbeat as his campaign also recognizes that this is going to be a close election.Wisconsin is a state that he narrowly won in 2020. It's one that they have their eyes set on in 2024. And when he is there, he's going to open a campaign headquarters. That's part of the campaign's general efforts to ramp up across the country, especially in these key battleground states to mobilize voters and work on voter outrage. But he's also going to be talking about infrastructure. This is something that often comes up as a theme of his campaign. He has touted the fact that his administration was able to get an infrastructure package through. And so when he is in Wisconsin, he's going to be talking about those projects. But then after that, he's going to go to Michigan. Again, another state he narrowly won, but one where he is trying to court voters to and peel off the voters that were are considering former President Donald Trump. And so this is the Biden campaign really pivoting toward the general election in earnest. And they felt pretty good last night because Georgia was among the states that took President Biden over the top. Georgia again, a really crucial state for President Biden. It's one that's going to be even more challenging this year because there aren't those key statewide races that would mobilize voters to the polls. So it's really only going to have to stem from enthusiasm for President Biden. But he was just there on Saturday, so seeing that quick outcome gave them confidence. And the president in a statement last night saying that he was, quote, \"honored\" to receive the Democratic nomination and saying, quote, \"Democratic Party across the country have put their faith in me once again to lead our party and our country in a moment when the threat Trump poses is greater than ever.\" So you can anticipate in the weeks and months to come that we're going to hear the same messaging from the president, but the stakes of it all are just going to become something that they stress even more on the campaign trail.

Several of them are also saying this is an issue of free speech, and some are warning that this could have an impact on Democrats abilities to win over young voters, especially given the fact that Biden has already said that if Congress can get this to his desk, he would sign it. Now, the future is much less certain in the United States Senate. That is where you have a number of lawmakers who have yet to say whether or not they are supportive of this specific House bill. Mark Warner is one of those members. Chuck Schumer, the majority leader, was also pressed yesterday as to whether or not he would make the decision to put this bill on the floor. He said he is still looking at it. He wants to see what that vote total looks like in the House. But this bill is going to come to the House floor under a suspension of the rules, which means it would need a two-thirds majority, a large number, a bipartisan number of members, to get it over to the United States Senate.

They say that they are -- they had a pilot scheme to allow aid through a particular area of the security fence. Israel has come under immense pressure from countries around the world for not allowing enough humanitarian aid through the land crossings. Just two are open at this point and with heavy restrictions on both of them. So there have been pushes, including from the U.S. President Joe Biden for more crosses to be opened. There was a pilot program. We understand from the IDF, they did manage to get six aid trucks through that particular part of the security fence and were able to get food and humanitarian aid to parts of northern Gaza. In fact, World Food Programme saying it's the first time since February 20th that they have been able to access that area and get food and aid and medicines to that area.

And obviously, it's no coincidence that it happened right before the Russian elections as you've just stated.I think one of the things that Vladimir Putin is trying to portray is that Russia is is stronger than ever before, at least since he's been in power and that Russia is on par and possibly even ahead of the United States as far as nuclear capabilities are concerned. Of course, one of the things he's having to deal with is despite the fact that the Russian economy has been fairly resilient in the face of those massive sanctions since Russia's full on invasion of Ukraine, there are a lot of people who are suffering economically. There's a lot of companies in Russia that are suffering economically. So essentially what he's saying is, look, we are a grand nation, a gigantic nation and one that is militarily on par with anyone, including the United States. So certainly, trying to portray strength and show strength there. And we saw that in some of the other things that he was also saying in that interview, warning the United States from sending troops into Ukraine. Of course, the United States has never said it wanted to do that warning Poland from sending troops into Ukraine. The Poles have also not said that they want to do that. So, Vladimir Putin definitely painting a Russia as the country that has the initiative right now on the ground in Ukraine, but also one that can deal internationally with things like sanctions and military pressure as well. Certainly, what he said there about Russia's nuclear arsenal definitely directed at the Russians, but certainly also, of course, a message to the United States saying, look, right now it's better to negotiate with Russia then to risk any sort of escalation. I think that would have been sort of the secondary message that he would have towards the United States. In total, very bullish, Vladimir Putin in that interview. And again, as you said, definitely not a coincidence that he gave that interview just a few days before that election is set to take place, Omar.",

Certainly, if Vladimir Putin performs the way that everybody thinks that he's going to perform, he will definitely have a much stronger mandate than even before to further escalate if he wants to.There's a lot of people who are talking about a possible mobilization on a large scale of Russians if -- after the election takes place. Although that has not been confirmed by the Russians yet. As far as things are on the ground are concerned, Vladimir Putin referenced that in his interview as well, saying he believes some of these drones attacks that are happening by the Ukrainians, like for instance, the one that apparently took place overnight, the Ukrainians are doing that because they're losing on the battlefield as he put it. The Ukrainians of course, saying something different. They say, this is part of a well-planned campaign. The Russians are claiming that it destroyed some 58 drones in various regions of Russia overnight. The Ukrainians saying that they attacked some oil infrastructure in the Ryazan region, that's just south of Moscow, not far from the Russian capital at all. So certainly some long distance drones that would have been involved in that, but also in the Leningrad region, which is around St. Petersburg, that is very far away from Russian or Russian controlled territory. So that also would've been a very long distance strike. The Ukrainians would've been trying to conduct there. It, of course, comes as we've seen some more momentum from at least the pro-Ukrainian side on the battlefield. Yesterday, of course, we talked a lot about those Russian fighters on the side of Ukraine that said that they went into Russia and now these drone attacks definitely something that the Ukrainians have been stepping up, Omar.",

It was headed from Australia to New Zealand when it plunged, sending some passengers flying. Medical personnel in Auckland, where the plane landed, said about 50 people had to be treated for injuries. CNN's Aviation Correspondent Pete Muntean has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PETE MUNTEAN, CNN AVIATION CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): New images show the aftermath of Monday's mysterious in flight jolt on a Chilean Boeing 787. LATAM Airlines says a technical event caused a strong movement on board, injuring 50 passengers who peppered the pilots with questions. BRIAN JOKAT, LATAM FLIGHT 800 PASSENGER: I immediately engaged with them and said, you know, what was that? And he openly admitted. He said, I lost control of the plane. My gauges just kind of went blank on me. And that's when the plane just took a dive. MUNTEAN (voice-over): Boeing says it is standing by to help investigate the incident. The latest involving a Boeing plane following the Alaska airlines door plug blowout in January, a wheel falling off a United flight last week, and hydraulic fluid traveling from another United flight during takeoff from Sydney this week. MARY SCHIAVO, FORMER U.S. TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT INSPECTOR GENERAL: People are pretty wary of Boeing right now. And when anything happens on a Boeing, people want to know. MUNTEAN (voice-over): Though, there was no clear link between each incident, Boeing remains under the microscope of federal investigator. The Federal Aviation Administration now says it has completed its review of the 737 production line with \"The New York Times\" reporting Boeing failed 33 of 89 quality control audits. MICHAEL WHITAKER, ADMINISTRATOR, U.S. FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION: It wasn't just paperwork issues and sometimes it's ordered that work is done. Sometimes its tool management at -- it sounds kind of pedestrian, but it's really important in a factory that you have a way of tracking your tools effectively, so that you have the right tool and you know you didn't leave it behind. MUNTEAN (voice-over): FAA scrutiny follows anger from the National Transportation Safety Board, which blasted Boeing on Capitol Hill last week for failing to provide records that detailed the omission of key bolts from the Alaska Airlines plane. Boeing says those records do not exist. JENNIFER HOMENDY, CHAIR, U.S. NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD: We don't have the records. We don't have the names of the 25 people that is in charge of doing that work in that facility. It's absurd that two months later, we don't have that. (END VIDEOTAPE) MUNTEAN (on-camera): The National Transportation Safety Board just announced a rare hearing on the Alaska Airlines door plug incident. That means Boeing officials could be subpoenaed to testify publicly. Boeing has not indicated how it will respond, but it is answering to the findings from the FAA's audit. A new Boeing memo underscores that workers must precisely follow every step when building airplanes. Pete Muntean, CNN, Washington.",

And that if it does happen, a reelection of Donald Trump will be very unpredictable. It's just simply not as easy as it sounds. There is clearly pressure within Europe to try and increase defense spending. But, you know, that is not new. It's, you know, largely accelerated by the war in Ukraine. It's certainly being, you know, put back at the front of the agenda by the possibility that Donald Trump would return. But it doesn't, in and of itself, solve the basic and urgent problem of the defense of Ukraine. It takes a long time to, you know, increase those levels of spending. It takes long to translate that into effective defense and deterrence. And, you know, that partnership with America is absolutely vital. It's hard to work around a country that spends, you know, well, more than $800 billion a year in defense and has been deeply embedded in Europe's partnerships. But that is exactly what many countries are trying to do to think about, you know, do you create a European pillar within NATO that has more significance and consequence? Does Europe internally find new mechanisms? These are really tough questions. And add to that, you know, this ongoing concern that America is becoming more protectionist.

He joins me live from New York. So, Lance, I just want to start with logistically speaking, how would the possible ban of an app like TikTok actually play out? LANCE ULANOFF, U.S. EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, TECHRADAR: Well, the app would disappear from app stores like Apple's App Store, Google Play which means you couldn't download it anymore. However, the app on, you know, 170 million U.S. users, it would still continue to work, but updates would no longer arrive. And so eventually, it would stop working.

China -- the whole way that China works with any company is that they have full access to anything in any data that any company that exists that works inside China. They can just say, show us your stuff, shows all -- show it all to us.ByteDance is obviously a Chinese company. But what they've done in the last year or so, Project Texas, is basically migrate all the data to the U.S. Sandbox it away from any part of the Chinese company and Chinese officials higher 7,000 U.S. employees. So -- and even sort of have an oversight group that is part of security, you know, independent security expert oversight, all of these things to sort of watch and keep that from happening. Now, I do want to say that the biggest question, one thing that I've noticed that a lot of legislators are stuck on is the algorithm. And the algorithm is kind of interesting because TikTok has one of the best algorithms out there. And what it does is it really decides what you're going to see next based on your interests. So tells a lot about you and it shapes a lot of your experience. And what's not clear yet from ByteDance and TikTok is how much that's cordoned off from Chinese officials. Because the developers, the people who built the algorithm in the first place, they've been in China. Are they now all in the U.S.? Are they only U.S. employees? And does China have any access to that algorithm which could define your experience and maybe how you come away feeling about things after spending two hours on TikTok?",

I mean, could we see TikTok ban outside of the U.S., or is this simply a product of, well, it's really an adversarial relationship between the U.S. and China?",

Are they creating software there? Do they have do the -- the officials there have access to the software and the data that's being created in these places? I don't know if any of that's true, but that's certainly a path that they could take forward here. The reality is, though, you know, I've never believed that China's intention here was to use TikTok to somehow infiltrate us. Because, you know, they're really going after infrastructure. They're going after us with ransomware attacks. There are other ways they can do it that are probably more effective than spending a lot of time trying to shape the thoughts and feelings of Americans.",
