If it's a manned aircraft, you don't want to go shooting something down unless you know -- unless you've given warnings and that sort of thing.It's also a complicated patchwork of regulation, because to Secretary Mayorkas' point, DHS has authorities in some spaces and the Justice Department, there's legislation that would expire, I think, around December the 20th, that they're looking to extend and expand, that would cover the management of drones in the sky. And then, there's the FAA's regulatory space, and there's another piece of legislation moving around in Congress that would expand the FAA's ability to regulate drones. And then, there's what the Pentagon can do. And then, there's what governors can or can't do. And you've seen a number of governors now including Democratic governors and states like New York, saying, hey, Feds, we need the drone technology because we need to be able to deal with this in our space.

Some of those positions that were occupied by Syria, also, they have been seen within Syria itself as well.Now, talk of, you know, greater numbers of settlements. It does clash slightly with what the Israeli defense forces chief said. We aren't intervening in what's happening in Syria. We have no intention of administering Syria. But, you know, this is Syrian territory, and if there are settlements there, they will have to be administered. So, we're just going to have to see how it's playing out. Having settlements there is a very different argument from the one that they've made up until now, which is securing the buffer zone, because you can see why Israel would need to do that in many ways, because it wants to -- it's worried about what's going to emerge in Syria.
