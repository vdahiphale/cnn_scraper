The deadly attack impacted the flow of aid in Gaza.

The group immediately suspended its mission there after the deaths of its workers and all its aid ships are now back at the Cyprus port.

I was at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis in January.Prior to the war, Nasser Hospital is the second largest hospital in the Gaza Strip. While we were there, Al Shifa Hospital, which is the largest and you may be familiar with because it was in the news again last week, had already been shut down. And so Nasser was overwhelmed. This is a hospital that's supposed to be able to perform multiple surgeries. But health care institution after health care institution has been raided, targeted and left defunct. And you can I can name you all of them. Shifa, Al-Awda, Al-Rantisi, Al-Nasser, the list goes on and on. 70 health care workers have been abducted. Over 400 health care workers have been killed. In fact, one of the surgeons that I worked with at Nasser Hospital, Dr. Khalid Al-Sir, who was working on getting Nasser up and running again, has just been detained by the Israeli military recently. And so there is a deliberate attack on health care infrastructure. And it's just one piece of making life hell in the Gaza Strip and why the humanitarian crisis is so bad. It's not just that there's a famine in the north and there's a possible invasion of Rafah in the south. It's that nothing can get in. We can't even get food or water into the Gaza Strip. It's being restricted by the Israelis. Hospitals cannot get fuel for their generators to power on their lights and treat their patients. We're out of medicine. We're out of supplies. We're out of even space in Rafah for people to stay. You can't even pitch a tent if you're a displaced person in the Gaza Strip right now. And so every aspect of life has come under attack. And all of civilian infrastructure has been devastated. It should be no surprise to anybody that at six months we're in this catastrophic situation here. And that's why people are calling for a ceasefire. That's why they're saying an invasion into Rafah is a red line. And they're saying that we need a maritime corridor. We need airdrops. But most importantly, every single access on land needs to be open and unrestricted. Trucks need to be able to get in with supplies that will save lives.",

And he cannot just accept any of the explanations that he has been hearing for the past six months. I'll remind you that with this World Central Kitchen convoy, the first explanation for the Israeli military was that it was just some an IED on the side of the road. I mean, that's the sort of answers that we're getting from this military. And so President Biden needs to be explicitly clear with Netanyahu that if they do not stop this war and they do not allow aid into starving Palestinians, and they don't guarantee that there is going to be a safe resolution to all of this, that there are consequences to this. And those consequences can deal with aid. They can deal with sanctions. There needs to be some teeth to the words that President Biden is going to use with Netanyahu. There has to absolutely be consequences because rhetoric for six months has gotten us 32,000 dead Palestinians. Rhetoric for the last six months has had aid workers murdered in plain sight. And so that's not going to work anymore. And I hope that that's something that my message and the message from the entire international NGO community and people like Chef Jose, that that's the message that's heard by President Biden and that he actually uses it in a conversation.",

The earthquake, it caused rock fall, landslides, collapsed structures, including those tilted buildings that we've been seeing out of Hualien.Over 600 people, we've learned, are stranded or unreachable, including dozens of miners who are still trapped at a quarry. We've learned that at least nine people have died. More than a thousand people are injured. And rescuers, they are working to free these people who are trapped or stranded by debris. And they're also just struggling to reach them. You know, the epicenter, as you pointed out, is in Hualien County on the east coast of Taiwan. And many in the region are in these remote coastal areas and mountain communities that can be hard to reach. And I want to show you this drone video. In this video, you could see 50 stranded hotel employees that are there just waiting for rescue. So they were on their way to work earlier on Wednesday morning before the earthquake struck at around 8 a.m. local time. And rescuers, they have to wait for the roads to be cleared before they can reach that group. Now, in the next video, you will see first responders reaching the scene of a major rock fall, a major landslide that happened after the earthquake. And they have to scramble through all of that, through this blocked highway to reach survivors. They did find a man at the scene who was found unconscious. And the man was later sent to hospital for treatment. Now, it's one day after the earthquake and residents in the region are still very nervous. Last night, a number of them slept in shelters and slept over outdoors because there have been dozens of aftershocks that have rocked the area, aftershocks that continue to this day. I want you to listen to this survivor. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNKNOWN (through translator): I'm afraid of aftershocks, and I don't know how bad the shaking will be. And then the house is already a mess.

Now, the Secretary General, as he typically does, didn't again get into detail, said, look, you've been briefed by someone, but not briefed by me. But what he wanted to achieve, and what NATO is trying to achieve here, is this financial commitment that allows Ukraine to plan for the coming years of the war, know that it can have enough ammunition, let's say if it chooses to have an offensive in 2025, and for defense providers, manufacturers throughout Europe, the United States, to know that there's long term commitment for them to produce the armaments.

And NATO's eastern member states are deeply concerned about the implications for them if Putin is not stopped in Ukraine. So the urgency is felt very clearly in Eastern Europe. But I think it's felt throughout the alliance. And what we see right now is unity among NATO allies about thinking about what role NATO can play in this war.

The government announced last week the dismissal of 15,000 state workers by the end of March, and sectors unions have already counted 11,000 dismissals throughout the public administration.But in the coming months, this number could reach up to 70,000, according to the government's own estimates. That is why they were here protesting this Wednesday. These layoffs occurred last week, just before the Easter holidays, and include employees in national offices located here in the capital, Buenos Aires, as well as throughout the country. The notifications arrived without prior notice through emails and WhatsApp messages, and include both workers who had been hired by the state during the previous government, as well as others with more than 20 years of seniority. These cutbacks are part of the shrinking of the state carried out by the libertarian president to eliminate the deficit and balance the national accounts. The government has stated that there are 70,000 people who, in total, could be dismissed. For this reason, once in office, the new government launched a policy of 90-day public contract that may or may not be renewed. These massive layoffs, then, correspond to the end of the first quarter, and many of those who remain in their jobs will still have to wait three more months to find out if they continue or not.

DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: Whatever documents the president decides to take with him, he has the right to do so. It's an absolute right. REID (voice-over): The post-Watergate law covers what documents belong to the government after an administration leaves the White House. But prosecutors have repeatedly said that law is not relevant because Trump is accused of obstruction and storing highly classified material in a bathroom and other unsecure locations at his Florida estate. Prosecutors also point out that telling a jury that Trump had the authority to take records he wanted from the White House would make it nearly impossible to secure a conviction. Prosecutors insist that legal premise is wrong and a jury instruction that reflects that premise would distort the trial. But Trump's attorneys, who were also asked to weigh in here, suggested that the judge tell jurors Trump was authorized to possess a category of documents defined as personal records, both during and after his term in office.

That's why we're seeing so many people scrambling to try to find the best weather and get in position to see this on Monday.There are a few other things that make this eclipse really unique, and the first is the length of time for totality. That's the moment when the moon completely blocks out the sun, and that's when day will literally turn to night, so dark that the stars come out, nocturnal animals come out. That is how dark it gets, and so that moment of totality for this eclipse is much longer than it was in previous eclipses. At the longest point it'll be about four minutes and 30 seconds, so that's a good amount of time to really get to soak in the power of nature in our solar system. Another really unique thing about this eclipse is the fact that it just happens to coincide with a period of peak activity on the surface of the sun, so during that moment of totality things like solar flares or coronal mass ejections are much more likely than in previous eclipses and could just make for some really cool viewing. But of course with any eclipse, but this one in particular, the weather is always a factor and unfortunately it's not looking like it's going to cooperate in large parts of the United States along this path of totality. Texas and Arkansas, really the weather not looking great there, but places like southern Missouri and Indianapolis and upstate New York and New England, the weather's looking pretty good there. So as always before an eclipse, the eclipse chasers, the diehards are trying to find that best weather viewing condition so that they can see this eclipse, because again if you don't see this one it's going to be 20 years before you get to see something like this if you live in the United States.
