And 35 hardline Republicans have sent additional demands to Speaker Kevin McCarthy. Those demands include scrapping funding for new FBI headquarters.

One of them a key issue that came up last night was this question about work requirements. Republicans still pushing very hard to include those requirements on programs like Medicaid, on programs like food stamps and other social safety net programs.There is also still a lot of discussion around how much money the federal government is going to spend over the next several years. That is a critical piece of this agreement. We have said over and over again, there is a question of whether or not there is going to be less spending next year than there currently is. They believe they are moving closer in the caps agreement, but there still is no hard agreement at this time. We should note that they believe that they could raise the debt ceiling for potentially two years as part of any agreement, but as you noted, there is still a lot of heartburn from both conservatives and progressives who are warning that they have concerns about the shape of the deal that is coming together behind closed doors. Part of this issue is that these negotiators have been working very quietly, not communicating broadly with their conference because of the sensitivity of these talks. But that's starting to create the sense that people don't know what is coming together, people don't know if they are going to be comfortable voting for it. And the reality is even if they get a deal, you still have to have 218 votes coming out of the House of Representatives. Likely that's going to come from the middle of the Republican conference, from the middle of the Democratic caucus. It's probably not going to come from progressives and hardline conservatives. But you still have to quell any major rebellion that might be forming right now because people just don't feel like they have a good sense of what's going to be in this deal. Erica?",

And that group is really there to help arm Ukraine with what it needs in this unprovoked war started by Russia.At the beginning of the war, we were giving -- surging supplies and capabilities to Ukraine that started with stingers and javelins. Over time that started, we knew -- we -- as the battlefield changed, we knew -- we knew that we needed to adjust our capabilities that we were providing so you saw us provide tanks and HIMARS. And now, as the battle continues, we are looking to provide longer-term capabilities which include training for F-16s. The United States supports that. The Netherlands and Denmark have agreed to be the leaders in that training. And so, the U.S. is supportive of that. But again, the F-16s are not something that the Ukrainians will be able to use as they launch their counteroffensive. This is a long-term commitment as we know that they will need a strong capable air force to continue to defend not just their airspace but their country in the long term.",

RON DESANTIS (R-FL): Well, first, I think what we need to do as a veteran is recognize that our military has become politicized. You talk about gender ideology, you talk about things like global warming that they are somehow concerned about, and that's not the military that I served in. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That is what the military is focused on every day.We are not focused on labels being thrown at us by others across the aisle. We are focused on the mission which is to continue to defend the homeland and make sure that we remain the most combat-capable ready military that the world has ever seen.
