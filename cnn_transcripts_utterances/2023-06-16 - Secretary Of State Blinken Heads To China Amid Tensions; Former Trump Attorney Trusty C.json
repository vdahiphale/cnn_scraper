The top U.S. diplomat will visit Beijing this weekend in hopes of tamping down a recent spike in tensions between the two countries. The trip was originally scheduled for this past February, but it was rescheduled because of that Chinese spy balloon incident. And that is just one of the close encounters that ratcheted up the friction.In May, the Pentagon says a Chinese jet made a, quote, unnecessarily aggressive maneuver near a U.S. spy plane over the South China Sea. And earlier this month two warships nearly collided in the Taiwan Strait. Our co-anchor, Jim Sciutto, is joining us from Taipei, Taiwan. Jim, Blinken is going to be the first Secretary of State to visit China since 2018. I think that's really important to note. Also the first Biden cabinet official to travel to the country. What are his goals going to be?",

      "sentences": "Listen, this has been a really deeply, deeply tense time in the U.S./China relationship with genuine fears of escalation, particularly as you have those close military encounters, but also fears of escalation over the standoff over Taiwan, where I am right now. And fears that China still has plans, desires, ambitions to take it by military force.So, this meeting doesn't have frankly high hopes. It's really U.S. officials say about opening communication channels between the two countries, with a particular emphasis on military-to-military communications. Because U.S. officials have said they want to allow for the chance to deescalate the encounters you've had, like that ship cutting off the U.S. destroyer or a jet flying close to a U.S. spy plane. So that those incidents don't become bigger. And then, Brianna, you have these other major issues including the U.S. continuing to push China not to supply arms to Russia for its war in Ukraine. That is a continuing bone of contention between the two countries and Blinken certainly to communicates U.S. concerns about Ukraine as well.",

It's not just about supplying arms to Taiwan, which is important, but it is also about diplomatic support, economic support as a way to really, frankly, deter China from taking the step of deciding potentially to invade this country.So they look at that relationship as key. And they also, frankly, one thing I've been hearing here, Brianna, they don't want to get in the middle, right, between China and the U.S. They have their own concerns here. They have their own interests and they don't want to be, you know, something of a pawn, right, between Beijing and Washington.",

And they also accuse the U.S. of hegemonic behavior, that's China's words, China's words there. They've accused the U.S. for a long time of basically trying to run things, control things in Asia.

The question is, can the president find one that's willing to represent him.He's had trouble keeping attorneys in part because as we have seen even in this case his attorneys have had to wave the privilege because this crime-fraud -- or has had a problem with the crime-fraud exception. Where he's saying then, as least as Justice Department alleges, hey, maybe we don't have these documents, maybe they're not here, maybe they got lost.

So I mean, you saw those individuals there. We were down in Jamaica. This is part of a therapeutic structured retreat. There's a screening process to get in. You can't be predisposed to certain medical conditions. And then once you're preparing for the retreat -- which in and of itself is several weeks -- you then goo through two dosing ceremonies as they call them. That's when you take the mushrooms. Though they're not mushrooms. They're grounded into psilocybin extracted, so to speak, and putting into chocolates, put into tea. And you go through that twice. And then on the backend there's an integration session. But for four to six hours -- and that's how long, Brianna, it tends to last for most of us -- you're essentially tripping. You're in the midst of this mind-altering journey. And it is different for everyone. And I think that is what was so unique about approaching this story. And fortunately we had a whole hour to tell it and we do that this Sunday. But each person comes at this from a different perspective. We have one young woman who we encountered who she doing this so she could find some sort of fulfillment. She felt like there was a void in her life, especially after COVID. She felt what many of us could relate with and that is isolation. And another guy was trying to curb his addiction to alcohol that had been years in this struggle for him.
