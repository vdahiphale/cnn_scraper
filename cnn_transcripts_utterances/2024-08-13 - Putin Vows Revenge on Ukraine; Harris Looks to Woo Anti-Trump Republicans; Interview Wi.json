      "sentences": "Well, I think it is a strong message.This submarine is not there to knock down rockets or missiles. It is there to punish. It is there to launch what they call TLAMs, Tomahawk missiles. I believe they have as many as 150 or 160 aboard the Georgia. Those will be directed towards targets, possibly in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, where we might have our forces put at risk from attacks on our forces there and in Syria. And they could go very well into Iran. So this is serious. This is why I think the Iranians have an opportunity to say, OK, we have a right to respond, in our judgment, under the rules of the game, so to speak. But we're not going to. We're going to hold back and see if we can't take -- and I want to use this phrase, very different context -- one small step for mankind. Let us not pursue this tit for tat that's going to escalate into a major war, where hundreds, if not tens of thousands will die, including American soldiers in the region. So I am asking the Iranians stop, look and listen. I said earlier in another interview, this is this is a very serious crossroads that we're at. And you can pursue this path of peace. And the Israelis have to understand as well they can't keep launching attacks and think that the Iranians are not going to respond. So what I want to see is both sides take this step that they can take on Thursday. Hamas should show up. They should be willing to sit down and say, we want a way to have a cease-fire, a return of hostages and no incentive to start killing each other. There's too much killing going on. There's too much killing going on. Too many innocent people are dying on the Israeli side and certainly on the Palestinian side. Those kinds of attacks cannot take place. We can talk about precision-guided munitions, trying to reduce collateral damage. But you can put a precision-guided munitions in a mosque or a synagogue with 100 or 200 people inside. And so then you say, well, why are you putting and killing people inside a mosque? Well, there might be 10, 20 Hamas militants there. Well, what's the calculation at that point? What if there were two militants there and 150 people? Is that the mad calculation? We're going to say, well, I'm going to kill them all anyway? So we have to really step back from this because there is tremendous firepower on the part of the Israelis. We now have firepower on the part of the United States and Iran has its tentacle spread in various ways, asymmetrical warfare at the very least, which could touch our troops in Iraq, in Syria, and off the shores of Israel at this particular moment. So this is a serious time. And I think the Iranians and Hamas...",

This is one of the biggest groups of a different party for a party for somebody like Kamala Harris that I have seen. There's a lot of momentum behind this. And, as you know, Wolf, I mean, the Republican Party has basically left a significant amount of people that identify as Republicans by changing its views on everything, including Ukraine, which is a very important issue, including the strength of our democracy.

I mean, it's like this. We have to have the purity of the cult. We don't want anybody that has the ability to have an independent thought or a thought outside of Donald Trump. So, if his strategy is to say, leave, I mean, I'd say it's not a very good strategy. Maybe there's a few people that are like, well, then I better just adopt whatever Donald Trump wants, because I can't get rid of this label as Republican. But I think there's going to be a significant amount of crossover, not the majority of Republicans, obviously, but a significant crossover for Nikki Haley.

And we see what's been coursing through, frankly, Donald Trump. You see it by his meltdown. He went from thinking he was going to coast to election to now recognizing he probably isn't going to win, or at least it's going to be a pretty tough road for him to hoe.
