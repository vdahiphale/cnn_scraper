He speaks this morning, as seconds ago the White House released new details of more than 500 new sanctions. They hit individuals the White House says are directly connected to the imprisonment and death of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, also Moscow's financial sector. The president telegraphed the sanctions after he met with Navalny's widow and daughter in California. He promised them, quote, \"Alexei's legacy will carry on through people across Russia and around the world.\"Let's get right to CNN White House reporter Priscilla Alvarez with some of the details on these new sanctions. Priscilla, what are you learning?",

And just a few details that we're getting here moments ago, that includes, for example, hundreds of entities involved in Russia's military industrial base, 26 3rd country entities facilitating Russian sanctioned invasion, and that includes firms in China, Serbia and the United Arab Emirates. Now, President Biden, in a statement this morning, saying that these sanctions \"will target individuals connected to Navalny's imprisonment, as well as Russia's financial sector, defense, industrial base, procurement networks, and sanction evaders across multiple continents.\" President Biden going on to say that \"they will ensure Putin pays an even steeper price for his aggression abroad and repression at home.\" Now, what the U.S. is trying to do here is essentially choke off Russia from certain goods and also try to slow them down from building weapons. This as U.S. officials tried to add one more tool to the toolbox here in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and also Alexei Navalny's death. Now, there has been skepticism about how effective these sanctions have been. Of course, the U.S. has been levying multiple sanctions against Russia since its invasion of Ukraine. And their response to that from the White House has been that all of this really affects the long-term here, it hampers Russia's economy and its ability to carry out this war. But all the same, while President Biden is touting these sanctions as a consequence to Russian President Vladimir Putin, he is also keeping the pressure on Congress. Again, $60 billion in additional funding to Ukraine still stalled in Congress as the House is out on a two-week recess. President Biden keeping that pressure and that steady drumbeat to say that while these sanctions can levy a consequence against Russia, those funds need to go to Ukraine. All of that necessary to fight off his aggression.",

The (INAUDIBLE) sanctions on countries that are buying oil. Well, that's India. China, Argentina, have all been continuing to purchase oil. Some European countries have been continuing to purchase liquefied natural gas. So, those are all things that they could do.But if you truly crack down on the Russian oil shipments, it could have -- send oil prices up and have an inflationary impact ahead of the election. So, I think the president probably would be hesitant there. And it could reduce the willingness of allies to contribute to cutting off arms and other technology to Russia. The second thing they could do, Sara, is seize that $300 billion that Russia foolishly left hanging around western Europe, a little bit in the United States, prior to the war. The U.S. and Germany have said they don't have the statutory authority to do that yet. But that issue has been kicking around for two years. It's probably something that could hurt Russia because the money could be then redirected to Ukraine.",

They weren't actively negotiating. And they said that Hamas hadn't moved a millimeter off of its latest position. But something appears to have changed this week because we heard after Hamas spent a couple of days in Cairo meeting with Egyptian and Qatari officials, we heard some optimism from Benny Gantz, a member of the Israeli war cabinet, talking about the possibility of progress. And then after that, the Israeli government's approved sending a delegation to Paris with expanded negotiating authority. Giving them the power to really dig into the details here, to try and strike a deal. And so today that will be a crucial meeting that will happen between the U.S., Israel, the Qataris, the Egyptians, all looking to try and see if a deal can be struck before Ramadan.",

We are seeing Democrats and President Joe Biden seizing on that and the Trump campaign really taking the incoming on that, really pointing to --Democrats pointing to Trump's outsized role in the overturning of Roe v. Wade, linking these two things together. As we know, Donald Trump has still not figured out a general election message on abortion. Something they're really going to have to figure out.

Trump is not ethical given all those criminal indictments, 68 percent of voters believed that Trump is not ethical. How about Biden's too old to serve another term, effectively serve another term, 67 percent. And so you see these two numbers very close together. And I think this gives you an understanding of why this race is so close is because a near equal percentage of the electorate doesn't like Trump for a big reason, and doesn't like Joe Biden for a very different reasons.

And Hillary Clinton was ahead by three points in the 2016 campaign. I'll note that in these particular years I took the averages.
