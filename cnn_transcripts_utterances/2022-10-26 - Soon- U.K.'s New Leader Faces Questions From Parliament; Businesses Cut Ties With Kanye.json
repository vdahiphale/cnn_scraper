I think he was trying not to seem jubilant or too celebratory because he hasn't been elected by the general public; he has been appointed by his own conservative lawmakers. And also, he wanted to underscore these profound economic challenges ahead. So, tonally, it was all about facing up to these difficulties and being the right man for the job, and promising to unite the party and the country.And today, he met with his cabinet for the first time, just about an hour ago -- and that's been a newly-appointed cabinet as of last night. And he's been trying to demonstrate with these appointments the fact that he's going to back up his calls for unity for with action. He's drawing from the right wing of the party, the left wing of the party. There's been some controversy over the reappointment of the Home Sec. Suella Braverman after she was sacked last week by the former prime minister for a security breach. Some suggesting perhaps that was the result of a backroom deal, but his team assures us that isn't the case. Today, the most daunting task that the new prime minister will face is prime minister's questions, which will take place in about an hour and a half. Now, even the most seasoned of leaders of this country say that is usually the scariest part of their agenda, even at the very end of their tenure. So the pressure on Sunak will be immense. He'll be facing around 600 lawmakers crammed into that small room in the House of Commons with jeering and cheering, boos and applause. So it will be really interesting to see how he handles this because he isn't known for being particularly spontaneous or especially charismatic, or commanding a room effectively. He's sometimes criticized for being robotic. But this could be a chance for him to start to define his prime ministerial style -- to gain the confidence of the benches behind him and the telegraph to the country and Parliament that he's got what it takes to be prime minister. But everyone will be watching --",

They have been living through this for weeks -- at least three weeks and counting.In fact, the warning is that in Bayelsa and at least four other states in Nigeria, there could be more rainfall until the end of November, which means the water levels could drive already hundreds of thousands of people at this place in this state alone across Nigeria. More than 1.5 million people are displaced and more than 600 people have died because this flooding is affecting 33 out of 36 states. It's very similar to what we saw earlier in Pakistan. There's a warmer climate that's causing more intense rainfall. But here, also, there's also a number of other factors -- poor infrastructure, a dam that's overflowing in neighboring Cameroon, but also climate change. And some Nigerians don't like that -- that the government is blaming this on climate change -- because they feel it's the result of negligence. But here in this city, imagine a big city like Philly or Oregon completely underwater like this. Their businesses and homes completely submerged. We have seen in this city -- some residents say they've seen bodies floating in these waters. And so, people are making do with it because they feel the government has not come to their aid. They're doing their best. They're using boats. They're using this little 3-seater, 3-wheeled cars to get around. But they have to find a way to rebuild their lives. If you look across the street you see a car that's completely submerged. You see a building that the first floor cannot be used. And that's a reality not just here in the state capital but across most of this state that remains cut off from most of Nigeria. And they fear that it could get worse. The likelihood -- if you look into this water, Christine, it's really black. It's a mixture of oil, it's a mixture of fecal matter -- all sorts of impurities. So one of the fears here is bilharzia, cholera, and other waterborne diseases. But that's the reality for people that live here.",
