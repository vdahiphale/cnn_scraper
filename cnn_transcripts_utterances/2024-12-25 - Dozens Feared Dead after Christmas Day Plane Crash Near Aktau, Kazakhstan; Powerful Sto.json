We're following breaking news this morning.Dozens of survivors, but dozens more feared dead after a Christmas Day plane crashed near Aktau, Kazakhstan, in central Asia. Now, we want to warn you, some of this video may be disturbing. This right here, this was taken moments after the plane crashed as rescuers scrambled to pull people out of the burned wreckage.

But as you mentioned, we have been seeing yet more video around the crash and the moments before the plane hit the ground, video showing that the plane had been circling the airfield somewhat erratically before making what appears to have been an emergency landing, crashing to the ground and bursting into flames.And remarkably, there were survivors. Despite the pretty devastating impact that we've seen in this video, there is video emerging showing survivors, some of them bloodied and injured, emerging from the wreckage. According to authorities, at least 29 people, including two children, survived that crash. They have been taken to hospital for immediate medical attention. And as you can imagine, there was, of course, a significant presence by emergency services rescue teams surrounding the crash site in the aftermath. But there are dozens feared dead. This plane was carrying 67 people, 62 passengers, five crew members, on board. We are yet to hear from authorities on the status of the remaining passengers on board, but again, dozens are feared dead, so we will be waiting for those updates. But this is, of course, a moment of -- an anxious moment, a sad moment for many of the family members of those who were on board, perhaps waiting still for more information on that. This was an Azerbaijan Airlines flight traveling from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku to Grozny in the Russian region of Chechnya. As you mentioned, it made that emergency landing about two miles from the Kazakh city of Aktau. At this stage, according to Russian aviation authorities, preliminary information suggests that the pilot may have been forced to attempt an emergency landing as a result of a bird strike. But we are still waiting for more updates and a fuller picture of what exactly led to this crash. Danny?",

But now we're seeing a wet Christmas down here across parts of Louisiana. There could be some strong to even severe weather today. But I think the real risk is some flooding, but in flooding that has been parched with the drought over the past couple of months. So I guess you'll just take it when you can get it. Just don't want it all to come down at one time. Moving ahead to Thursday, pretty good travel day. They'll be rain across parts of the south and also in the deep south itself. But then by the time we get into Sunday, when a lot of you are going to try to get back on airplanes in New York, we have rain and also all of that cloud cover. Look at what has happened in the west and what will still happen in the west with this storm, Danny. We are going to see spots that have one to two feet of additional snow.

Finally, some powder for skiers to play with, because it has been a couple of dry couple of years in a row where we haven't had real natural snow, and they've been skiing in that snow cone that they make with a manmade snow.",

The former president made gains across the country in blue states, in red states, in rural areas, in cities.And in fact, my colleagues here at CNN wrote the day after the election, this, quote, \"Trump made gains with nearly every demographic group compared with his 2020 loss, CNN's exit polls showed. And his apparent near mirroring of the 2016 map would indicate that he paid no political price for his lies about fraud in that election, his efforts to overturn it, or the criminal charges he has faced since then.\" And that is the crux of it. Enough of the electorate decided that change was more important than any concerns over Trump's behavior. And it's why, in part, this moment from Harris was so damaging.

The combination of that debate performance, and then the assassination attempt, which you saw in the favorability ratings, Trump sort of had his highest favorability of his entire political career after that moment. And then the Kamala Harris of it all, I think you can -- you obviously pointed out some mistakes that she made. You could say she should have gone on Joe Rogan, all these little tactical things.But in the end, the Kamala Harris 107-day campaign was a Hail Mary pass. And I think they actually got closer than some Democrats expected. She only lost across three states by 250,000 votes.

They are in the political wilderness. But out of the wilderness can arise opportunity. And I do think there are a lot of hard conversations happening about what the direction should look like. And I think there will be, I hope, positive growth from that. When you have those hard conversations, when you take a look at what isn't working, you come to, you come to a new direction.

But that was stunning to me because here was a billionaire attracting tens of thousands. We always argue about how many people were there. There were a hell of a lot of people there that day. And Trump comes out and he tells the story about how Frank Sinatra said, you never eat before you perform. But I just ate an enormous hot dog and the crowd roared in its approval, and I thought to myself that he could attract so many people in a state he's never going to win, no matter what he says. He's not competitive in New Jersey, but to go to Wildwood, New Jersey and put on a show and attract the number of people that he did, that struck a chord with me. That was a moment where I said, this populist appeal by a Republican is really something to behold, especially after he's been twice impeached and four times indicted, and the conviction and so forth.

You can see the blood on his face and obviously a very difficult moment for the country to be facing political violence, but also really an example of how Donald Trump reacts to the camera and steps onto the stage that even in a moment where there is violence directed toward him, his instinct was to do this, was to interact with the crowd.
