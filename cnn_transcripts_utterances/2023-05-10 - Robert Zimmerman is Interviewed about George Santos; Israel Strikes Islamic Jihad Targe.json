He's -- Santos is more than just a late-night punch line or a Washington topic. We are suffering in our congressional district because we don't have a member of Congress. And we have - and we don't have a congressional office addressing issues like affordability or getting funding in our district for infrastructure. These are critical issues. Making our community safer. This is where we need a strong, congressional voice. And that's what's so critical in our district and it's missing.

So, Israel has been waiting for the response. Both strikes yesterday, of course, were themselves in response, Israel says, to the more than 100 rockets that Islamic jihad fired towards Israel from the Gaza Strip a week earlier. Now, a response had been expected. Measures had been taken to prepare Israel. Reservists had been called up. Public bomb shelters had been opened. And, in fact, the home front command, after carrying out additional air strikes this morning it says to take out Islamic jihad members who are going to a rocket launch pad, they were told in those communities around the Gaza Strip to remain in their bomb shelters until further notice. But as I say, Israel has been braced for a response for the killing -- for those air strikes that killed the Islamic jihad commanders from that militant group yesterday. This is the first response that we've had from the Gaza Strip with rockets being fired towards Israel. I don't think anyone in Israel is under the illusion that these are the last. Poppy.",

And the third governor says falling debris from a shot-down enemy drone damaged a gas pipe and a house. There were no injuries reported.And this all comes after Russia claimed last week that Ukraine launched a drone attack on the Kremlin in what they claim to be an assassination attempt on Vladimir Putin. Obviously, a claim that Ukraine vehemently denies. MATTINGLY: Yes, and all that happening as the leader of the Wagner mercenary group is signaling that Russia may be struggling in this battle. He's once again criticizing Russian military leadership for their lack of support for his fighters ahead of an expected Ukrainian counter offensive. And joining us now to discuss, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. Mr. Secretary General, I appreciate your time. I want to start with something that I think everybody was observing yesterday, and that was the victory day parade in Moscow. There was a lot of attention paid to just how scaled down it was.

Concern tied to the fact that if there aren't some sweeping victories or significant pushes, that the alliance that is held together remarkably well over the course of 15 months supporting Ukraine may start to wither, may start to fracture a little bit.

And since then, Sweden has had this special status, an invitee, meaning that Sweden is participating in NATO meetings, structures, integrating more and more into our civilian (ph) (INAUDIBLE) structures.Several allies, including the United States, have issued bilateral security assurances which Finland in -- if we look at the map, you know, Sweden is now surrounded by NATO countries. So, it's absolutely inconceivable that there would be any attack or effect against Sweden without NATO reacting. So, we have got a long way already and I hope that we can finalize the (INAUDIBLE) process by Venice. And let me just add that, this is actually a third big strategic mistake that Vladimir Putin made. He invaded Ukraine and sent a clear message that he doesn't want more NATO on his borders. He's getting the exact opposite. He's getting more NATO presence in eastern part of the alliance (ph). And then he's getting two new members, Finland and Sweden.

Security is global. What happens in Europe matters for Asia. And what happens in Asia matters for Europe.
