Today also, Vice President Kamala Harris is gearing up to face undecided voters on CNN. She will be on this stage tonight in Pennsylvania for a CNN town hall.As for Donald Trump, he is facing new questions about what he really believes and what he has said. Overnight, Trump's longest serving chief of staff, retired Marine General John Kelly, went on the record, telling \"The New York Times\" that Trump is \"certainly an authoritarian, admires people who are dictators, -- he has said that. So he certainly falls into the general definition of fascist for sure,\" John Kelly says. Kelly also told \"The Atlantic\" in a separate interview about conversations that he had with Donald Trump after Trump reportedly said that he needed the kind of generals that Hitler had. General Kelly saying to that, that he asked Donald Trump, he basically said, surely, you can't mean Hitler's generals. Kelly says that Trump responded that that is exactly what he meant. \"Yes, yes. Hitler's generals,\" he said Trump responded. Trump's campaign is firing back CNN's political director David Chalian joining me right now, Trump's campaign saying this is fabricated and this is false. Still, it is what it is and it is out there now. But let's first start with where you are, David, and then we'll add this into it. You're there in Pennsylvania at the site of the CNN town hall where Kamala Harris will be this evening. What do you think is her main task tonight? What is the one big thing that you're watching for?",

I think we haven't seen a ton of her in that kind of setting, and this is an opportunity for her to both make the affirmative case for her candidacy, but as we've been seeing from her on the campaign trail every day, I have no doubt she's going to draw the contrast with Donald Trump every opportunity she gets.But in talking to her campaign, those two things, the affirmative case for her and the contrast with Trump, that's something they have to do every single day all the way through.",

People want to know, they're looking for any excuse to vote for Donald Trump, right? Those who are on the fence, they're looking for any excuse now to. So they're really looking at, OK, give me something to go on here. It doesn't necessarily mean -- she could hit on the Hitler thing all she wants, and I would, too, but I was focused on what moving forward looks like. We already know Donald Trump is and what he has said and what people in the military, senior leaders in the military have come out and said against him, people who worked with him closely for years have said against him. And so for those Trump supporters that are die- hard, they're going to stick with him no matter what. They don't believe it. But I think for those undecideds and for those who are looking for an excuse to vote for one way or the other, this is one reason they may not necessarily go vote for Kamala Harris. I don't think that some of them will. But for them not to vote for Donald Trump is a win for her, I would think.

And now she came from the middle-class grassroots that so many of these voters do.And then, two, she has to draw a very clear contrast with Donald Trump. She can do both of those things. In modern campaigns, and in this moment, she needs to do both of those things. And I think that's what you've seen her do day after day. These voters are just starting to pay attention here.

It's the notion that if it takes a while to count, then election officials must be up to something. It's widespread fraud among mail ballots, things that just aren't happening, but have become such popular claims especially in the conservative ecosystem and I want to play one that got spun out of control in the last couple of days and it's based on Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger.

And this official, this Iranian official who is named in these newly unsealed charging documents, his name Ruhollah Bazghandi. He is described as a brigadier general in the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps. He's described as a former -- leader of a counterintelligence unit for the IRGC as well. He was sanctioned back in 2023 by the Treasury Department for allegedly participating in similar murder-for-hire plots targeting other dissidents and others who spoke out against Iran as well. So, this is somebody who is well-known to US officials, to prosecutors, and now is being called out by name in this case related to Masih Alinejad, that Iranian journalist who is based in New York and prosecutors say that this plot was actually disrupted as one of the suspects was on their way to murder Alinejad in New York. That's just kind of gives you a sense of how close prosecutors described this of actually being successful being carried out. The others involved and charged in this case includes some Eastern European individuals who prosecutors say were part of a crime syndicate. These were the individuals who the Iranian officials directed to carry out the alleged plot. So, it remains to be seen what goes to the process here, but a significant moment as in a big picture sense, the FBI and US intelligence agencies have been warning Iran is becoming increasingly aggressive in trying to carry out plots like this, not just targeting journalists, but also government officials and others on US soil who have been very strong in their opposition to the Iranian regime.",
