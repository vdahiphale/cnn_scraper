And so in those hours after the storm has passed, we need everyone to really be thoughtful about making sure they watch out for downed power lines, they don`t walk through or drive through floodwaters. If your power is out, don`t use candles, use flashlights, and if you have a generator, make sure you use that safely. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The tropical storm system regenerated along the country`s southern Pacific coast. It`s forecast to bring an additional 10 to 20 inches of rain, even 30 inches in some places. Authorities in Mexico are warning about the danger of flash flooding, landslides, and storm surge. Pop quiz, hot shot. What type of bears do not spend their winters hibernating? Grizzly bear, panda bear, polar bear, or black bear? If you said panda bear, put your hands up. Their bamboo-heavy diet prevents them from storing enough fat to sleep through the winter. It`s no secret the unbearably cute, clumsy, and often sleepy giant panda is loved all over the world. China loans its native pandas to more than 20 countries and territories as envoys of friendship and a measure of good relations. It`s known as panda diplomacy. Well, Hong Kong, which is technically part of China, is the latest to roll out the red carpet this week for two giant panda VIPs. The pair of five-year-old pandas were welcomed to their new home like rock stars, including a welcome ceremony, a police motorcycle escort, CNN`s Kristie Lu Stout has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

They are national treasuresgifted by the Chinese central government to Hong Kong, ahead of the National Day holiday next week. The pandas arrived here in Hong Kong before midday on Thursday, they had a welcoming ceremony at the airport before coming to their new home here at Ocean Park. The two pandas, their names are An An and Ke Ke. They`re five years old. They`re from a Panda Conservation and Research Center in Sichuan province. An An is male, Ke Ke is female. They were both born in June of 2019, but they are not genetically related, and their personalities are said to be very complementary. Now, they`re said to be in good health, but they will undergo 30 days quarantine here in Ocean Park before going through another month of acclimation, of adjusting to their new environment. There will also be a dietary transition. They will start to eat new bamboo from neighboring Guangdong province, in addition to the bamboo from their home province of Sichuan. And the public won`t get a chance to see the dynamic duo until mid-December. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Residents of Sydney, Australiagot a shock looking at the city`s famous harbor. The water turned neon green in some neighborhoods. Authorities say they believe a dye commonly used by plumbers is to blame. It apparently leaked from a storm drain. Fire and rescue officials tested the water. They say it`s non-toxic and odorless, and that no fish were killed. Sydney is forecast to get rain next week, and officials hope that that will dissipate some of the fluorescent green water. All right, a disclaimer for today`s story getting a 10 out of 10. If you have arachnophobia, you might want to avert your eyes, because a house in Boston is creeping it real.
