It was back in 2022. And she was blocked by a judge from developing acase against a fake Trump elector because she had hosted a fundraiser for one of the political rivals of that fake elector. When you look at that, and they've mentioned it in court today, are there any parallels from her behavior there to the current case?

And so, you know, the public trust that the D.A. will be fair and impartial and prosecute someone, you know, even if that individual, you know, has some sort of connection to somebody they have a connection to.

I think the biggest challenge is, you know, the sort of idea that someone may have been untruthful. And I think lawyers are coming down on both side of that, you know, of that issue, whether or not, you know, she was untruthful, whether or not Nathan Wade was untruthful and for the court and, you know, all of the ethical implications and legal implications that come along with that.
