      "sentences": "Well, Brianna, Fani Willis was a no- show, but we didn't expect her to show up here. In fact, she had her attorney, they want a judge to decide whether or not this special Senate committee has the power to bring her to testify before them.The chairman of this committee, Republican State Senator Bill Cowsert, his clear. He thinks that they do have the authority. And he had two people testify at today's hearing to emphasize that point. Which included the former secretary of the Senate, who said that the panel has three recourses, one of which includes arresting Fani Willis, bringing her before the Senate bar and finding her in contempt. Now it goes without saying it would be extremely dramatic if that happened. There's no indication that that will be the next step. We don't know what's going to happen next. But the State Senator Bill Cowsert refused to come out and answer reporters' questions after the hearing was over. But we did hear from one of the Democratic members on the panel. This is a nine-member paneled, bipartisan, Republican led. But one of those Democrats, he was clear, he doesn't believe that they should be involved in this matter at all. This panel was initiated earlier this year to allegedly investigate improprieties by the D.A. when she hired her then-boyfriend, Nathan Wade, as the special prosecutor in the Trump criminal case. they've had a series of meetings. But this one was expected to be one of the more dramatic ones where they had called Fani Willis to testify before them. Again, she did not show up and it's really unclear what's going to happen next. We have reached out to the chairman here to get his comments and we've also reached out to the attorney for District Attorney Fani Willis to see what their reaction is to what happened here today -- Brianna?",

Those counts were also faced by some co-defendants in this case, including John Eastman, as well as Shawn Still. So they have their counts thrown comes. That comes about six months after Scott McAfee had thrown out other counts. So while we wait to see what happens next in the Trump criminal case, counts continually continue to be taken off this indictment. Technically, as I said, it does not apply to Trump, but that's not keeping his attorney here in Georgia, Steve Sadow, from touting this as a victory for the former president -- Brianna?",

And it's important because the Israelis say this is an area which has been used over the years and particularly over the past several months as a way of smuggling weapons into the Gaza Strip. Some of the smuggling has taken place over land, through presumably holes in the fence and through other border crossings, but a lot of it is taking place right under -- well, has been taking place right under our feet.

It completely reversed the idea of a stature gap between Kennedy and Nixon and put Kennedy, if not on the same platform as Nixon, the sitting vice president, even a higher one. On the other hand, I have to say my personal opinion is, in 2016, that Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump in all three of their debates that year, Trump won the election. So it depends.",

I asked her, does it concern her whether the public views the court as political than they don't see the line between legal reasoning and political reasoning? And she said, yes. At an institutional level, she said, that is a problem for the court and that all the justices are concerned about it because, Brianna, she said public perception is really what the court has at the end of the day.
