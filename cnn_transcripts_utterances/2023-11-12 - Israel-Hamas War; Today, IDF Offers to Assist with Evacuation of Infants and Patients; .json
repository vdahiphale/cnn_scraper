And with some 20,000 people sheltered in and around the hospital, the situation is desperate. The Hamas controlled health ministry in Gaza said, three newborn babies have died since Friday night at Al-Shifa Hospital after nearby shelling knocked out a generator supplying oxygen to the neonatal unit.A Gaza health official tells CNN, the other infants were hand carried to operating rooms which still had oxygen. Israel has now offered to help evacuate infants and patients sometime today, and says an evacuation corridor to the south from Al-Shifa complex will be open for a few hours. Like other hospitals across Gaza, Al-Shifa is nearly out of food, water, medicine, fuel and electricity, with staff often working by flashlight. The IDF denies the hospital is under siege or that it's been hit by Israeli forces. Meanwhile, Gaza authorities at the Rafah crossing into Egypt say it will open in the coming hours so people with foreign passports can leave if they're on a pre-approved list. CNN's Paula Hancocks is our former Jerusalem correspondent and knows the region well and she joins us from Seoul with the latest. So, Paula, for Gaza's hospitals, as I outlined there, a dire situation seemingly becoming worse by the hour.",

They have no longer been able to contact them, they point out.But what we have heard at this point is the Israeli military saying that there is currently an evacuation corridor, which is going from north to south along Salah al-Din Road, within Gaza Strip, asking people to head to the south. So, that will be between 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. local. But when it comes to the actual hospitals itself, Al- Shifa Hospital, the largest hospital, which is in this catastrophic situation, the Israelis say that there will be a self-evacuation corridor from 10:00 a.m. -- excuse me, not from 10:00 a.m. but within that time as well. So, we are having the first indication from the Israeli side that there will be an ability for some of those patients, doctors, nurses, and also thousands of internally displaced people within the compound to be able to head potentially to a safer area. Now, what we had been hearing was that the situation was dire. We heard from a senior health official speaking about what was still working within the hospital. Saying that the ICU, the pediatric department, the oxygen devices had stopped working because the generator had been hit by a shell. And so, they were unable to keep some babies alive. As you say, three, we understand from a senior health official, did die, but they had 36 others which they were -- we are being told, being kept alive by artificial respirations. Where effectively doctors and nurses having to manually pump oxygen and air into their lungs. They, overnight, we understand, were moved to the operating theatres within the hospital where oxygen supplies were still available. And the Israeli military said that they would help to evacuate those babies. We are yet to hear clarification on exactly what the situation is with that. We also, within CNN, spoke to a freelance journalist within the hospital who said the situation was dire. Food, water, medical equipment, electricity was simply not there. [04:05:00] Also, pointing out that there were dozens of bodies that were awaiting burial. So, not only were patients not able to come into the hospital for treatment, not only were doctors having to work in some cases by candlelight to keep patients alive, ambulances unable to leave to get to those injured. But it has been a very difficult situation for those inside as well. Now, the latest figures we have were 400 patients within just this Al- Shifa Hospital, 20,000, we understand, or this is what we have been told, were taking shelter in that area. This is something we have often seen, that those internally displaced will go to a hospital, for example, believing that that may be an area that is less likely to be targeted. But we have been seeing very heavy fighting between the Israeli military and Hamas. Operatives. Israel has consistently said that they believe Hamas operatives use the undergrounds of these hospitals for their command centers and use patients as human shields. Now. this is something CNN cannot independently verify. Kim.",

It's only been six weeks since the House passed a temporary spending bill to avoid a government shutdown. Ad in less than a week, we could be right back at the same place waiting to see if a deal is in place to keep the government running.Now, you might remember the last stopgap bill cost Republican Speaker Kevin McCarthy his job. Now, with days to go, McCarthy's replacement, the new Speaker, Mike Johnson, is laying out his plan to keep the government funded. Now, the future of the funding bill is uncertain. At least three congressional Republicans have already indicated they won't support it. And with their slim majority in the House, the bill can only afford to lose a total of four Republican votes if all Democrats vote against it. CNN's Annie Grayer looks at the uphill battle facing Congress. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "House Speaker Mike Johnson unveiled his plan on Saturday for how he wants to keep the government open past the November 17th funding deadline. His plan breaks the government funding into two parts. Fund some of the government until January 19th, and the rest until February 2nd. It would keep funding at its current levels, and there would not be additional funding for wars in Israel or Ukraine. Members of the right flank wanted Johnson to take this two-step approach to government funding, but wanted Johnson to add spending cuts to his plan, which we do not see so far.So, we are going to have to see how this plays out this week when it is expected to get a vote on the House floor. And the other unknown here is how the White House and the Senate, which is controlled by Democrats, is going to react to this plan. Annie Grayer, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
