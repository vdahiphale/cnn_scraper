Security Council. President Biden, this time around, is the only leader from the members of the Permanent Security Council who is actually there at the U.N. Is there anything to read into that? Does it seem to you that the United Nations perhaps, an effectiveness is waning? Because Biden alluded to that in his speech for a moment. WILLIAM TAYLOR, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO UKRAINE: As he should. Because the United Nations Security Council has failed. It failed to do the basic role, mission of the U.N., which is to stop or prevent wars. And the reason it failed, one of the five that could hold that hold a veto is the aggressor. So, yes, the U.N. Security Council has lost credibility.",

But time is also a big weapon for Volodymyr Zelenskyy, David.And I wonder what you think right now about, as you have the U.S. considering these long-range missiles, as you have the patience, of course, domestically here in the U.S., about support for Ukraine being tested. And we have an election here around the corner. You know, what is the landscape of that for Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his calculus? DAVID SANGER, CNN POLITICAL &amp; NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: That's a great question, Brianna. I think as you and Boris and I have discussed before, time is not necessarily on Zelenskyy's side here. If you're Putin, you're thinking to yourself, I win this if the Ukrainians run out of ammunition. So far, the U.S. and the allies have not let them do that. But obviously, if this funding falls apart over time, just sustaining their regular ammunition is a part of it. I'm sure that Putin thinks, if the Europeans crack, I win this. And so not having the French and the Germans and other big NATO leaders, even the British there -- they may have many reasons for not coming to the U.N. General Assembly, doesn't usually accomplish a huge amount, but just as a show of solidarity, interesting. Then the third way he wins -- Jim alluded to this before -- is, if we elect a president who simply says this is not America's conflict. The exact opposite of what you heard from President Biden today. And at that moment, not only does the support collapse, but the U.S. will have looked like it is once again in a big zigzag. And there's nothing that destroys alliances faster than that.",

Gary Shapley, the IRS whistleblower, had testified before the House Republicans saying that he attended this October 2022 meeting with a bunch of law enforcement officials, including U.S. Attorney David Weiss.He said, at this meeting, Weiss said he didn't have the ultimate decision-making authority on whether or not to bring a case against Hunter Biden and asked for and was denied status as special counsel. So now they've talked to a number of agents, including the agent conducting the investigation against Hunter Biden, his number two, and also Gary Shapley's former boss at the IRS. These officials have testified they don't remember it the way Shapley does. Specifically, the FBI supervisor said, \"In my recollection, if he would have said that, I would have remembered that.\" That's specifically talking about Weiss saying he doesn't have decision-making authorities. Those other officials also saying they don't recall that coming up in meetings. Shapley's lawyers say, unlike the others, Shapley took handwritten notes during the meeting and he memorialized those notes in an email to the supervisor. They're holding firm in their position. Now, these officials don't discount everything that Shapley said. In fact, they say there's some things that Shapley testified to that they recall happening as well. That is that Weiss couldn't get the attorney's office in Washington, D.C., or Los Angeles to team up with them in order to bring this case. Of course, this is not the end of the road here. The committees are also subpoenaing other officials to testify. And Merrick Garland, the attorney general, is on Capitol Hill tomorrow where he will certain will face questions about this -- Boris?",

We're told it's going to focus on allegations of corruption and abuse of public office. While the witness list has yet to be finalized, Chairman James Comer told my colleague that he wants to bring in two witnesses. He wants to bring in a financial expert that can speak to the bank records pertaining to the Biden family business deals and also a constitutional expert who is going to speak to why they think an impeachment committee is warranted. And meanwhile, the committee is going to issue their first subpoenas potentially as early as this week. They want to obtain personal and business records from Hunter Biden and James Biden, which would be the first outreach from Republicans to members of the Biden family. But the White House is emphasizing that Republicans have yet to directly link President Joe Biden to those family business deals. And they also see this effort as a distraction from all of the House's GOP problems right now. I want to read you a statement from Ian Sams. He is a White House spokesperson. He said, \"Staging a political stunt hearing in the waning days before they may shutdown the government reveals their true priorities. To them, baseless personal attacks on President Biden are more important that preventing a government shutdown and the pain it would inflict on American families.\" And no doubt, Congress is barreling towards a government shutdown right now.
