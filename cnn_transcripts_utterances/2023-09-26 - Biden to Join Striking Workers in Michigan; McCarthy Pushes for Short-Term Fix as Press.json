Two warehouse workers were killed, an abandoned hotel smashed, in what could've been an almost routine attack by Russia, but for this. Kyiv knows to claim to kill the commander of Russia's Black Sea fleet, Admiral Viktor Sokolov. Ukraine says it also killed another 33 Russian officers in the missile strike against the fleet headquarters in Sevastopol on Friday. The Ukrainians have targeted senior Russian officers throughout this war, often using intelligence from NATO. And specialist units have been tasked by Kyiv with these killings. They're aimed at sapping morale and undermining command systems. CNN has no independent confirmation of Ukraine's claim to have killed Russia's admiral, but it would be its biggest success in this campaign and part of an ongoing effort to breakthrough Russia's defense lines to ultimately strike at Crimea.
