My first professional gig was this phenomenon, then I got a record deal from the opportunities and the accolades we got from \"Rent.\" And then I worked on that for about a year and a half. And I wrote all this music and I went in a recording studio, and then I got out there and then the album just didn't take off. The song didn't get on the radio. I didn't get a lot of promotion. I'd show up at these different venues and there'd be like three people there. So then I got dropped from the record label, and then by then my momentum was gone with the \"Rent\" thing, and I've kind of just had to start all over again.",
