That two targets were struck, which were, according to the Israeli military, adjacent to areas where Hamas operatives, according to the Israel military, were located. Now, of course, the al-Maghazi refugee camp has been struck on a number of occasions. The Israeli military says it is carrying out further investigations into this particular airstrike. But there have been repeated warnings around the targeting of civilian areas as we know. The Gaza Strip is densely populated. And, of course, the -- while the Israeli ministry says it is targeting Hamas positions and has told civilians to evacuate southwards, it has proven extremely difficult for many civilians to move southwards, to evacuate to these safe zones. And, of course, important to underscore that many of these so-called safe zones in many parts of southern Gaza, where the vast majority of Palestinian civilians are now taking shelter, have also been targeted by airstrikes.

It's a regret.\"Speaking to \"The Washington Post,\" four current senators and three former senators now say they do regret some of their votes on gun safety laws following the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary that killed 26 people, including 20 children, all younger than eight. And these are their faces. After Sandy Hook, effort by the Senate to pass a comprehensive gun safety package failed. No expansion of federal background checks. No limits on firearm magazines. No ban on assault weapons. We don't know what would have happened had even one of those measures passed, but they may have prevented some of America's most deadly mass shootings since then, including the 2016 Pulse nightclub shooting where 49 people were murdered by a shooter armed with a semi-automatic rifle, the 2017 Mandalay Bay shooting at that music festival where 58 people were killed by a man using multiple guns and high-capacity magazines, the 2018 Parkland High School shooting where 17 people were killed with an AR-15, and the 2022 shooting at Robb Elementary School where 21 people, mostly children, were also killed by a gunman using an AR- 15. All of the gunmen in those shootings obtained their weapons legally. Mark Begich was a Democratic senator during Sandy Hook. He voted against those three gun safety measures after Sandy Hook and today he says he likely would have voted differently. He joins me this morning. And I am deeply grateful for your time, sir. It is not often that we hear people reflect and change positions in Washington, or even after they have served. And I wonder why now? Why do you feel differently now? MARK BEGICH (D), FORMER U.S. SENATOR: Well, I think, you know, it's easy to look back in time and say what you could have done and would have done .But I think one thing is clear is the amount of these kind of mass shootings, and any one single shooting is a tragedy, but I think - I don't think anyone would have predicted where we are today versus back in 2013. And, you know, we, as you just said, every one of those individuals that you mentioned bought their guns legally. And so the background check system still is not working. And so there is, you know, some common denominators.",

Look at what's happening right now on the support as you just reported on, international wars that are occurring.I think what I got back then was, you know, I did vote for a piece of legislation. There were a lot of things I supported. Supported by Senator Graham and myself, who worked on many issues - as a matter of fact, one of the pieces, again, on mental health, we had support across the board, NRA, administration, Democrats, the mental health providers, even Gabby Giffords' group, they all support it, but I couldn't get it into the Manchin-Toomey bill, which made no sense to me. And I think what was happening behind the scenes was I heard it from people within my own party that, well, if we do that then it's a cop out. Well, my view was, do something, and here are some suggestions to do it. I think this is a growing problem within Congress on many issues because it is so hyper partisan now and localized - or hyper partisan but also people just want to get a message up, get a campaign commercial for or against something and then move on.
