Really the first step. We got to do and we got to do it big, you got to get out. You can't sit home.

You have not endorsed, as my understanding in this cycle, but you have predicted in the Washington Times that Trump is going to be the nominee after Iowa. How do you think it works that Trump can win a state like Iowa spending perhaps the least amount of time there? SCOTT WALKER, (R) FORMER WISCONSIN GOVERNOR: Well, I think voters in that state like a lot of across the country recognize that Ron DeSantis has done a fabulous job as governor in Florida, Nikki Haley, a colleague of mine from the past one as governor did an outstanding job as Ambassador of United Nations. But in the end, voters want someone who's proven and I think that shows, certainly with caucus voters, I think we're going to see it not only in New Hampshire and Nevada, but even in places like South Carolina former President Trump's likely to win big. And that's because in the Midwest in particular, but across the country, a lot of voters look and say, you know, there's politicians candidates who say all the right things, but then go to Washington failed to deliver. Donald Trump may not always say or tweet the things that we do, or the way we do, but I think a lot of voters do look and say but he gets the job done and that's why he's so far ahead.",

But I think the problem for each of them as challengers, is in five of those six key battleground states, Donald Trump pulls ahead of Joe Biden. And so, even though they might make the case that they're a little bit better, a little bit more likely to win, as it stands, and again, we just saw last week, Michigan, a key battleground state the last couple of cycles, Joe Biden is losing to Donald Trump in that state by eight points.

And I think that's true not only with Republican voters overall, even those who aren't necessarily voting in the caucus of the primaries for the former president.I see it in swing states like mine in Wisconsin that people get that. They can see through this, they see the nonsense. And again, in some regards, I heard your previous segment, if he's tied up normally conventional wisdom would be that would be tough for campaigning, but everyone in America is going to vote, knows who Joe Biden is and they know who Donald Trump is. This isn't a matter of introducing themselves. And in some regards, the more time and attention put on Joe Biden as opposed to Donald Trump, if that takes his time away from campaigning is probably a good thing for those of us who want to see someone other than Joe Biden in the White House.",

When that sun hits the snow, it's not going to warm the land very much because there's just going to bounce back up and that snow. The coldest we've known about now here for the last couple of elections 2004 at 16. And we know that this 2004 was affected by that 16.

That's the kickoff of how we nominate our delegates who are going to represent us at the national convention next summer, which is where we're going to choose our nominee for president who's going to be going up against Joe Biden to take back the White House.

And if a candidate can simply buy their way to the nomination on television, then certain voices might not get an opportunity to be heard.
