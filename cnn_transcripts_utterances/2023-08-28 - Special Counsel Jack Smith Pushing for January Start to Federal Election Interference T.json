What's going to be happening today in this federal court in downtown Atlanta is that Mark Meadows and his lawyers, his lawyers at the very least, are going to be here. And they're going to be trying to show a judge that what he was doing after the election that has become part of the allegations against Donald Trump and 18 others in this racketeering case that Georgia has brought against them, they're going to try and show that Mark Meadows was doing his job as the White House chief of staff, something that was under his official duties, that he was operating in good faith.The District Attorney Fani Willis, she does not want him to be able to show that. And so she's going to be presenting evidence that we know of already, including witness testimony from Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, from an investigator from Georgia, from two lawyers that were affiliated with Donald Trump after the election. And that witness testimony, what she's going to be trying to do with that is show that Mark Meadows, as he was facilitating calls between Donald Trump and Georgia, Georgia Secretary of State Raffensperger, others, and also as Mark Meadows was potentially reaching out to state legislators, all of that effort was political. And it will be up to a judge ultimately to decide who wins. We might not get a ruling today, but it's important here what the judge does and what the judge says, because when the judge makes a determination on this, it is the question of, does this case stay in state court, where the D.A. has charged it, or does this become a proceeding in federal court, where Meadows and others who worked for the federal government, potentially even Donald Trump himself, have more protection around them because they were federal officials at the time of this 2020 election allegations.",

Evan, what does the Trump legal team want, and what do we expect the special counsel is looking for today?[08:05:02] EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Phil, what they're trying to do is buy some time for the former president. As you know, he's running for office, he's running for president again, and he is trying everything he can to delay all of these proceedings before he has to stand before the voters in November of 2024. They've asked for an April 2026 trial date. That's something that judge, Judge Tonya Chutkan has indicated she is inclined to try to set a trial date at this hearing today, perhaps as soon as today. And we know that Jack Smith, the special counsel, he's asking for a trial in January of 2024. Now, the former president's legal team is saying, look, we're buried under millions and millions of pages of documents that were produced as part of this case, and of course, his other case. This case is very narrow in comparison to the one that was brought in Georgia, the one that Katelyn is covering. He's facing four charges. One of them is defrauding the United States, obstructing Congress, and of course, disenfranchising voters in the states where the former president was trying to overturn the elections. We expect that Judge Chutkan is going to force the two sides to perhaps defend why they want these trials on their particular days. But what we expect, Phil and Sara, is that Judge Chutkan wants to have this trial perhaps next spring, next summer, before the election. She's already signaled that she believes this is a case of importance for voters and for the American public for the determination to be made before the election. Guys?",

He will testify. Also from this investigator, Frances Watson, who was pressured by Mark Meadows and others to try to recount some of the votes. So this is going to be the first time we see live testimony in relation to any of these cases. On the D.C. case, the trial date is so important. There's this widegap where Trump's team has asked for 2026, and DOJ wants it in January of 2024. Both of those, I think, are unrealistic.

How did you see it? Did you see anything in there that you were surprised to learn, or was this the same-old, same-old?PHILIP BUMP, NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, \"THE WASHINGTON POST\":  Exactly, I was not particularly surprised. And you're right, basically what happened is Donald Trump went down to Fulton County. Right afterward he stopped before he got on his plane to fly back to New Hampshire and he made these comments. We've seen him do this before. We've seen this with the arraignments in Florida, for example, he went out afterward and went to that bakery and was schmoozing people, right? And so yes, what he did, though, is he made this very pointed political calculation. Astead is absolutely correct that there are these other nonpolitical concerns, but politics is at the heart of that. He needs to maintain this energy with his base, and he needs to maintain them giving him money, right? And so he makes these arguments as he's standing on the tarmac in Georgia that are really centered on how he is the target of this oppressive force, the elites are out to get him. It's the same standard pattern that we've seen before, with some very specific things to Georgia about this case as opposed to the federal ones. But this is what he's trying to do. He saw this big jump in both support and fundraising after the indictment in Manhattan. He didn't see as much after the federal indictments, and I think he's hoping that once again this local indictment, where he can really focus on someone who isn't Jack Smith, and who is a black woman, that he can focus on that as being -- he can parlay that into money.",

But from the donor perspective, like, they're not getting that money from big donors, and I'm not totally sure how sustainable it is long-term. Are big Republican donors looking around saying, four indictments, look, we'll be there in the general? Because that's the question money wise that I have right now.

And then also he can claim that this is politicization, he can use this as a shield and say that they're coming after him because he's a candidate. But if I'm a big donor, I don't necessarily want to donate to him, because I see that he's using these donations to go toward not just funding his own legal fees, but his co-defendants legal fees. And I think I would hold off until the general.And I think that these big donors are having trouble identifying, though, who they want to put their money into for a primary right now. There's been a lot of different names thrown out. DeSantis was kind of the first person that they were eyeing. And now that his poll numbers have seemed to decline, I think they're looking for someone else to put their money into to potentially defeat Donald Trump in a primary. But that hasn't happened yet.",

And there's no way to stop that if you're the prosecution, because under Georgia law, if a person invokes their speedy trial right as a defendant, you get your speedy trial, in this case it has to start by November.And what that means is that all the other people who go second, I would be happy to be second if I was in their shoes. You sit back, you watch, you take notes, you see all the government's witnesses take the stand, see how they're cross-examined. So there's an enormous tactical advantage to going second here.
