Officials say he was gunned down at a campaign event in the capital Quito on Wednesday. That happened 10 days ahead of Ecuador's first round presidential vote. The country's attorney general says security forces later exchanged fire with the suspect and he died in custody. Journalist David Shortell is following the developments from Mexico City and joins us now live. Thanks for being with us. This was a presidential candidate married with five children and shot and killed as he left that event, 10 days before elections. What can you tell us about that attack?",

The suspected assassin as you mentioned now confirmed to be dead, that according to the country's attorney general's office, who said that he died while in police custody. Now, motivation for the killing still very much unclear in these early hours. But Ecuador's president appears to indicate in his statement earlier Wednesday that it could be connected to gang activity organized crime within the country. He wrote that organized crime has gone too far. And they will feel the full weight of the law. Now, Ecuador has seen a surge in violence in recent years as it's really been caught in the crosshairs of a turf war between two rival gangs. The country, the small Andean state located between Peru and Colombia, which are two of the world's largest producers of drugs. Earlier this week, the country's interior minister telling reporters that amid that climate of violence, seven of the eight presidential candidates were under police protection, including Villavicencio. Villavicencio was a formal journalist, a former assemblyman who had been known within the country for his outspoken crusade against corruption in government. In an interview with CNN in Espanol earlier this year, Villavicencio called Ecuador a narco state, and said that he had presented evidence to federal authorities that he claimed linked political leadership within the country to the payroll of narco traffickers. Linda, in that interview, he also said that if you were elected president, he would work to restore security within the country by boosting the number of police officers and armed forces on the streets, Linda.",

The International Organization for Migration says that so far this year alone, more than 2,000 people have drowned trying to cross the Mediterranean to get to Europe. That brings to nearly 26,000 the number of people who have died in the Mediterranean since 2014. Now this year has seen a massive surge of refugees and migrants trying to reach Italian shores. As of the first week of August, the total number of people who tried to reach Italy this year so far is nearly 94,000. That's more than twice the number of people who tried to reach Italy in the same period last year. The European Union has spent hundreds of millions of dollars in countries including Libya and Tunisia to try to help those countries prevent people from taking to the sea and reaching Europe, but clearly the desire to escape war and hopelessness in their home countries is far greater than the fear of drowning in the Mediterranean.
