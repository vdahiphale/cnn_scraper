And when you look at these numbers, what do you see? I mean, first off, obviously. in Wisconsin, you have a race that's way too close to call at this point with no clear leader, just a point. But Michigan and Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania, the big enchilada, we spoke about it last Friday. The fact that you're seeing five-point advantages for Kamala Harris in Michigan, and in Pennsylvania, which is arguably the most important state in this entire election, there's just no other word than saying that these polls are good for the vice president.",

You talk about immigration, you talk about the economy. Who do you trust more on those issues? Well, when you average across the three states, you see that more voters trust Donald Trump than trust Kamala Harris. But look at the margins, the margins are incredibly small.We're talking about just three points on the economy, just four points in immigration. Donald Trump should be run running away on these issues. And the fact that Kamala Harris is keeping it, staying in the ballgame on here says everything.

Another really important thing though, about this polling is that she's way ahead obviously on abortion in all of these swing states that were polled. So, in my mind, abortion, abortion, abortion, abortion to try and get the Independents and the suburban moms. At the same time, I also think she needs to give more details about her stance on immigration and the economy. I know her aides right now are saying no because that's too much of a risk to go out there and actually do something that might be a flip- flop or that she might have said something different before. But we saw after the debate that she went up in the polls, people thought she won that handily, because she gave some details about how she felt about certain issues.

I remember the first time appeared with you on air was back in 2020 and this poll is big trouble for Joe Biden because it shows that he's basically doing about the same as Hillary Clinton in Iowa. Guess what that poll showed this past weekend, it showed Kamala Harris only down four points in a state that Joe Biden lost by eight points, a tremendous improvement. You talk about another poll, how about UNH, their final poll of 2020 had a race that essentially matched the final result perfectly.
