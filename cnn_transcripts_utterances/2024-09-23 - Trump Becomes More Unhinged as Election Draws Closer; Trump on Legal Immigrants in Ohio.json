Here is a sampling of just some of his posts in the last 48 hours. He baselessly says that the FBI is purposefully mishandling the second assassination attempt against him. He baselessly says Democrats are rigging votes from Americans overseas. He and his allies are actively working to change election laws in several states. He's making false claims about women. He's saying that Vice President Harris is against Catholics. He's still pushing debunked pet-eating conspiracies. And he posted then deleted a conspiracy about Diddy and Harris. He's attacking Jimmy Kimmel, ABC, even Oprah. There's a lot going on here with Trump. It seems like the weekend, he's free, he's got a lot of time on his hands, maybe he's golfing, but he has a lot to say, and no character limits on Truth Social, apparently. I mean, some of these posts are like giant paragraphs, and they don't make a lot of sense. You will no longer be thinking about abortion, he says to women, because it is now where it has always had to be, with the states. I mean, that's just one of many things that he had to say this weekend, but almost none of it is to the point of what I think Republicans want this election to be about, presumptively.",

But I can't even take that seriously because of what all this other nonsense is about it.And so now what he's doing is level-setting. All he's doing is saying like, hey, they're trying to cheat, hey, they're trying to cheat, which is so funny to me, because in some of these same in the last election and some of these same races where Republicans won. So, let me get this right. They're only trying to cheat when you lose. But when Republicans win, that's when the cheating doesn't happen. So, I'm just trying to keep up.

We talked about it in the way that you should being smart about crime, but we didn't necessarily address the way that people feel about it.Like my mom would always say that I don't want less police officers. That's why people chose Joe Biden in the 2020 primary because nobody wanted to defund the police, not Democratic voters. They just wanted better police, right? It wasn't about taking police off the street or defunding them. They just wanted -- they wanted me to be able to come home safely while police were out there patrolling the neighborhoods. And so I think everybody at this table is correct, that this is a serious issue that you can no longer put your head in the sand about. But, I think that there are different ways in which you go about doing it. Like for example, Kamala Harris being smart on crime, being a prosecutor, prosecuting drug rings, human trafficking is one thing. Donald Trump abusing the law and then saying he wants to give law enforcement, particularly to black men watching this, all right? Donald Trump is somebody who says he wants to give immunity to law enforcement officers regardless of the act that they commit. Do you know how patently absurd that is? And so you have differences on policy, but the fact is, and this is a good question, and I'm glad I think we all agree, crime is a very serious issue.
