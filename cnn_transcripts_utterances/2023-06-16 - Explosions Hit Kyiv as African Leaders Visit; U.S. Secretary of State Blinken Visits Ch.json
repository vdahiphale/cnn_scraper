And Bill in Beijing billionaire Bill Gates holding talks with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Friday as Xi's first known meeting in years with a top U.S. business leader, all this as, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken heads to China for talks this weekend, a live report just ahead. And on the global markets, U.S. stocks on target for a solidly higher open after an across the board rally on Thursday, the S&amp;P 500 coming off its 6th straight day of gains and beginning today's session at a 14 month high, stocks holding up well amid the debate over the Federal Reserve's next moves. European markets higher too even as the ECB vows there will be more rate hikes the IMF saying today it's in favor of the ECB tightening further. Asia closing out the week on a high note as the Japanese Central Bank leaves rates unchanged, lots to get through this out, and let's begin though with the latest on Ukraine. Rockets over Kyiv even as leaders from seven African nations arrived in the Ukrainian capital as part of a peace mission. The African delegation, which includes South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, will meet with Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy today, before heading to Russia for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday.

The first is that theRussians are prosecuting a military agenda without regard for the diplomatic fallout for -- , the plan of firing missiles into a capital city at a time when heads of government ministers and heads of state indeed, are visiting from an important continent. That the Kremlin itself is trying to court or they're sending a message to those African leaders that they are trying to call it that they don't matter, because in the past, there's been a bit of an understanding that when major world dignitaries, heads of government, heads of state, come to Kyiv. The Russians appear to ease off in terms of their strikes. But that wasn't the case last night with them firing, among other things, six Kinzhal missiles which were brought down, one assumes by Patriot missiles. The Germans have just announced they're going to give an extra 40 missiles not missile systems with 40 missiles to replenish the stocks that are fast dwindling for the Ukrainians. There are other pledges, of course, coming from other allies, but the Africans in particular, the form of South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, have been very close to the Kremlin in many ways, recently with joint military exercises with South Africa. South African Head of the Armed Forces visiting Moscow, the Sergei Lavrov, the South African Foreign Minister, attending a diplomatic meetings in South Africa and the United States accusing South Africa, of effectively supplying arms in breach of an arms embargo, potentially, against Russia. So, all of this adding up to what should have been rather cordial relations and therefore an easing off of the airstrikes against the African leaders that have come here.

There's no prospect whatsoever, of the Ukrainians joining any kind of diplomatic initiative that doesn't begin with a total withdrawal of every single Russian soldier from every inch of Ukrainian territory. That is their position right now. That is a position that their NATO partners are full throated in their support of whether that's a position that prevails over the next few years, depending on how this war goes. I think we'll be open to question but they are intent on driving the Russians out of their territory. They've launched this counter offensive, heavy fighting in the southeast, as you said there, Max, and in the east that is expected to increase. There is increasing amount of support coming from NATO partners to allow that counter offensive by the Ukrainians to be prosecuted. There is a hope among the allies that the Russians will be driven out.

After he left the hospital, he went to the Basilica of St. Mary major here in Rome. This is a place he always goes before and after his trips abroad. And it was appropriately it felt obvious today at the time to go give thanks there and spend a few minutes in prayer before going back to Vatican City, where we presume he's resting today getting back, you know, used to being at home after this long hospital stay. He underwent a three hour surgery last Wednesday, which doctors, say wasn't an emergency surgery, but instead was meant to try to alleviate worsening pain. All of this, of course leading up to a really big schedule coming up in August. He's to go to World Youth Day in Portugal the first week of August. And then a few weeks later end of August.

Now this Russian criminal hacking group is known for extorting ransoms from its victims. And right now, what we're told is that they have not asked for any ransoms from U.S. federal agencies. However, they have done so for other entities, including universities, and other state and local entities. And so what appears to have happened here is that this file transfer software widely used file transfer software had this flaw in it that these Russian hackers exploited. Now we're hearing from the company that owns that file transfer software that that there actually could be a second vulnerability. So they are working to patch that right now. But yesterday, we were told that several federal agencies have been impacted by this hack, including the Department of Energy. Now two entities within the Department of Energy apparently had some of their files stolen, and they're still doing a damage assessment to figure out just what was taken. But broadly, U.S. officials told reporters yesterday that there is not expected to be a huge impact on U.S. government agencies. At the federal level, it is not clear what they have been able to access or steal. But it could have a bigger impact on individuals at the local level. So according to state officials from Louisiana, and Oregon, millions of people might have had their data exposed in this hack. And so they're trying to figure out exactly the extent of what might have been exposed, including potentially social security numbers and driver's licenses. So a really wide ranging hacks here that has hit really entities across the world down to the individual people who might have had their data exposed.

And there are certain areas like area around Bakhmut andin the south east around Zaporizhzhia, where the Ukrainians have actually made a little bit of progress. But this isn't the kind of progress Max that you would see in a D-Day like situation or anything like that. What you're seeing here is an incremental use of their forces. They're basically doing what's known as a reconnaissance in force in some of these areas. And what they're trying to do is probe the Russian -- probe the Russian defenses to see what points of weakness there are.",

In other words, the land bridge between occupied Crimeaand the occupied portions of the Donbas, this land bridge connects those two areas.

So what that would mean is they would be able to perhaps go to a town like Mariupol, which is on the Sea of Azov, and take that. If they were able to do that, then that would inflict a bit of a defeat on the Russians. And it would make it much more difficult for them to maintain their forces in this area.",

It could be one in which you see offensive operations or counter offensive, so like the one that we're seeing right now. Or it could be one in which things are relatively static, like it was for the last few months. So this could be something that goes on for the next, unfortunately, decade or so. If that happens, that would really test the NATO resolve to support Ukraine, it would, you know, create some tensions. And there would obviously the risk that the Western powers would tire of supporting Ukraine., That can't happen if they're willing to defend Ukraine and if they're willing to go in to this area, so they must you make sure that they have the right Munitions for the Ukrainians that they provide the right support, and that they make the enforces more interoperable with Western forces.",

Because the trained pipeline for let's say, an F-16, which is the most commonly discussedfighter jet for the Ukrainians to possibly receive, they're talking a minimum of four to five months on a very sped up timeline. Normally, an American fighter pilot takes about a year of regular pilot training, which the Ukrainians already have, but then another 10 months or so, to learn the intricacies of the F-16. So that, you know, would be a very different timeline than what we're operating under right now.
