      "sentences": "Good morning. I'm Michael Smerconish in Philadelphia. America has a long-standing homeless problem. At least that's what we call it. I think it's much more complicated than a matter of shelter. And on last week's program, I gave credit to New York City Mayor Eric Adams for taking it on.Others are not so supportive of his efforts. The mayor himself will join me in just a moment. Adams has tasked first responders with enforcing a state law that was enacted in 2021, allowing them to involuntarily commit people experiencing a mental health crisis. The mayor called it a myth that the law only covered a, quote, overt act that the person may be suicidal, violent or a danger to others. He said it also pertains to those whose illness, quote, prevents them from meeting their own basic human needs to the extent that they are a danger to themselves. I said last week that the same standard actually exists in theory all over the country. What sets Mayor Adams apart is his willingness to act on it. Mayor Adams says we have a moral obligation to try and help and yet his move immediately caused controversy. In an opinion piece for The New York Times, Anthony Almojera, a lieutenant paramedic with New York's Fire Department Bureau of Emergency Medical Services wrote these words. \"In nearly 20 years as a medical responder, I've never witnessed a mental health crisis like the one New York is currently experiencing. During the last week of November 911 dispatchers received on average 425 calls a day for emotionally disturbed persons. But dispatching medical responders to wrangle mentally disturbed people living on the street and ferry them to overcrowded psychiatric facilities is not the answer.\" He lists overworked responders, swamped hospitals and the breach of trust that will cause among the homeless population. New York City Mayor Eric Adams joins me now. Mayor, thank you so much for being here. As I said, you're getting lots of attention. It's mixed. When I looked at the directive, it occurred to me that your standard, are they at risk to themselves or others, is the same as any other city. It's just that you're acting on the authority you have. Is that a fair encapsulation? MAYOR ERIC ADAMS (D), NEW YORK: Yes, it is. And it's a very clear one. And we should be clear, if we are saying let's leave the status quo, those who are saying that this basically stating, leaving people on the streets cannot take care of their basic needs, and they are in danger to themselves or others. That's inhumane. I am not going to do that. I'm going to make sure we give people the care they need and the care they deserve. And in many cases, they don't need -- they don't know they need that care because of their mental health illness.",

We cannot wait until they do something harmful to themselves, or harmful to others. And we gave that clarity to our first responders. And you know what I've learned, changes hard. And anytime, you want to make a change, especially in New York with 8.8 million people, 30 million different opinions. But we know this is the right humane thing to do.

A Virginia restaurant recently refused service to a group because of its anti-abortion and anti-LGBTQ religious beliefs. And news of it happening just the same week as the Supreme Court hearing arguments about a Colorado web designer who doesn't want to make wedding sites for same sex couples.In the Colorado case, designer Lorie Smith is challenging a Public Accommodations law that would compel her to design wedding sites for same sex couples. Smith's claims this means she'd be forced to express messages inconsistent with her beliefs, which she says violates her first amendment rights. Opponents argue that she's seeking a license to discriminate and that the law pertains to conduct not to speech. Four years ago, you may recall that the Court ruled in favor of a Colorado baker who refused to make a cake for a same sex wedding citing religious objections. In the midst of all of this comes the Virginia restaurant dustup, a Christian group, the family foundation of Virginia had reserved a private room for a dessert reception at a Richmond restaurant only to have it canceled about 90 minutes ahead of time. The restaurant Metzger Bar and Butchery is helm by co-owner Brittany Anderson, a veteran of TV cooking shows including Top Chef and Chopped. It released this statement on Instagram about the cancellation, quote, \"We have always refused service to anyone for making our staff uncomfortable or unsafe. And this was the driving force behind our decision. Many of our staff are women and/or members of the LGBTQ plus community. All of our staff are people with rights who deserve dignity, and a safe work environment. We respect our staff's established rights as humans, and strive to create a work environment where they can do their jobs with dignity, comfort and safety.\" On the foundation website is a list of its beliefs and causes including Virginians, being quote, free to live out their faith in the public square and in the marketplace, to enhance the value of human life through increased restrictions on elective abortion and greater information for support for mothers who find themselves wrestling with an unexpected pregnancy. That marriage is a lifelong union between one man and one woman, an institution of God and a foundation for civil society and that each person's gender beautifully expresses either male or female as God created them, and fighting the false ideology of transgenderism in our schools and workplaces. Joining us now is the President of a Family Foundation of Virginia, Victoria Cobb, who wrote this blog post describing the incident, quote, we've been canceled again. So Victoria, thank you for being here. I don't think that you should have been denied service in Virginia at the restaurant. Similarly, I don't think that the baker or the web designer should deny service to a gay couple. And I want to know if you are similarly consistent.",

If so, you and many other Americans could soon be facing a steep tax bill for your side hustle income.This week, the IRS sent out a reminder to taxpayers that the threshold for reporting such miscellaneous income for 2022 has been lowered from $20,000 to just $600. This means that anyone who receives more than $600 in business transactions through third-party payment apps will need to report those earnings as taxable income. And the platforms are required to report transactions exceeding that amount to the IRS. Previously, they were only required to do so if a user had more than 200 commercial transactions and more than $20,000 in payments over the course of a year.

Bachelor's degrees still earn on average more than some associate's degree or middle skill degrees. But we are telling people that if you haven't started yet, you should really consider middle skills.Almost one in four people with some college only are going to earn more than half of people with bachelor's degree. And closer to one in six high school graduates with some type of training beyond high school can earn more than half of BAs. So this is really calling into question what you take, when you take it, where you work with it.",

You said nine percent of graduates, 23 percent of workers with some college education but no degree, and 28 percent of associate's degree holders earn more than what half of workers with a bachelor's degree earn. Expand on that, please.",

We all know depending on what you take, where you work in terms of the occupation, where you work in terms of industry, whether you're unionized, all of these things matter in determining what your income is. But we know that there are many bachelor's degrees that take a long time for you to settle in. That take a long time for you to figure out what's your defined pathway, where you are going to step off to get those jobs. And in the meantime we have many middle skills jobs, particularly in sales, many jobs in health care support, health care professional and technical, customer service that can pay more than some of these bachelor's degrees in the short term. So a quick cost benefit analysis particularly when you care about student loan debt and how much debt people are incurring as a result of trying to get this bachelor's degree, it makes sense to consider alternatives.",

I wouldn't necessarily say we oversold it because many of the people in the building trades will eventually try to get some sort of managerial training so that they can move into their own business.I think the concern here is that everyone right out of high school does not necessarily have to go straight to a four-year program. You can think of it as stepping stones. Let's try this particular two-year program, let's see how this works, let's try to figure out what works for us. So this time it's more of a very, I guess, forward-thinking approach to how you create your career pathway rather than just following everyone else's footsteps.",
