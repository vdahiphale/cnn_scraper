Manu, what are you hearing about what happened in that room, how those two, those two holdouts flipped? Did Donald Trump call? MANU RAJU, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, that is one of the things that we are -- we are still chasing down here, Dana. It does seem that there was some pressure that was exerted from them, from the person who has endorsed Mike Johnson. That's, of course, Donald Trump. We do know that Mike Johnson just came out of the House floor and spoke to our colleague, Annie Grayer, and said that there is -- he did not cut any backroom deals. That's one thing that he has been saying all along that he didn't cut any backroom deals. And in fact, I just caught up with some other folks who were familiar with what's happening, and they indicated that as well, that that was not part of the negotiations. So they said there was no horse trading. We still have to learn a bit more of the details there. But that is one key piece here, Dana, that the speaker said that he didn't give anything up. Remember when Kevin McCarthy won the speakership? There were a lot of concessions that he ultimately had to make, putting some people in some key committee positions or making other commitments as well. Some of those we're not even written down. They were just discussions between some members and the like, that ultimately got him the speakership. We'll see. Johnson contends he didn't make any deals, Dana, but we'll try to learn more as we talk to more sources about all those conversations that happened, because there were a lot, as we saw play out in real time on the floor.",

Exactly what did happen.It is my impression that there was a phone call that came into that room. I don't know for sure who that phone call was from. I can't imagine that it wasn't somebody who has a lot of sway. And there's really only one person who has a lot of sway right now, and that -- and that is Donald Trump.",

So that would certainly be expected that Trump is really the one person in which some of these members would listen to. Keith Self is a very conservative member from Texas, someone who is very much aligned ideologically with Donald Trump. Ralph Norman actually endorsed Nikki Haley in the Republican primary. He then, too, of course, from South Carolina. But Norman ultimately did back, ultimately did bac -- ultimately did back Trump in the primary. We're going to try to grab some of these members to here as they're running off the floor, Dana. And some of them were involved in some of these discussions. We'll probably get some more details.

But this -- this challenge of this one vote that took a long time shows that it's going to be a dicey run for this House Republican majority. Just to be fair about it. But it's enabled. And his speakership is enabled by having President Donald Trump in office. And without Donald Trump, this vote might have been a different outcome, based off the final two holdouts and the -- the reportage that Manu just shared from the CNN team. So it really is a -- it's a special statement about having it be one vote. That's a rewarding thing, I can tell you, after two years ago. And, but winning is the key.
