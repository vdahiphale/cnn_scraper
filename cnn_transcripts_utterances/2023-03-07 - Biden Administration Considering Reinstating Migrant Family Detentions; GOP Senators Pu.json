Now this was a practice that was used in the Obama administration and the Trump administration. But it's significant that President Biden may want to bring this back because he ended it at the start of his administration. So, it marks a pivot by administration officials to consider bringing this back. Now White House press secretary was pressed on this earlier today in the briefing. Take a listen to what she had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: I'm not saying any -- but I'm not saying it is and I'm not saying it is not. I'm saying that I'm not going to speak to rumors. There are rumors out there. Clearly the Department of Homeland Security is working through ways on how to move forward once Title 42 is lifted.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TUCKER CARLSON, HOST, FOX NEWS (voice-over): The crowd was enormous. A small percentage of them were hooligans, they committed vandalism. You've seen their pictures again and again. But the overwhelming majority weren't. They were peaceful, they were orderly and meek. These were not insurrectionists. They were sight seers.

Saying all media sources and the whole public should have access to whole swath of the more than 40,000 hours of security footage. And others criticized Carlson and Fox News for down playing the significance of the attack. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SEN. KEVIN CRAMER (R-ND): I think, particularly when you come into the chambers, when you start opening members' desks, when you stand up in their balcony, to somehow put that in the same category as a, you know, permitted peaceful protest is just a lie.",

It should be given to all media sources because others could be encouraged also to act in if they believe it was not as serious as it actually was.We still have not heard yet from the Speaker himself about the decision. Last week he down played giving it to Carlson saying he plans to give it to all media outlets and he doesn't care about an individual's point of view on this particular subject matter. McCarthy said he would answer questions later tonight so we'll see what he has to say about Carlson's depiction of the events -- guys.",

Actually, I could ask them, have they ever heard any public speech that I made that supports what they are charging me with?You could examine my 37 years as an elected official and you will not find a single speech of that sort.

Now remember that 120,000 Japanese Americans were incarcerated during World War II, they targeted the leaders first.
