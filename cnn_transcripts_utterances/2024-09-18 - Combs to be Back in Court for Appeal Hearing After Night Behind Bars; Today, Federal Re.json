Combs is in custody on federal charges of racketeering and sex trafficking. He was denied bail after prosecutors called him a threat, this after airing out disturbing accusations and a stunning indictment.We now know what was seized from his home during those raids, guns, drugs, and supplies for his alleged sex crimes, something investigators say Combs called freak offs, which were elaborate sex performances, they say, during which Combs allegedly used drugs to keep victims compliant.

It was a two-hour hearing where it was a fight between the prosecution and Marc Aginifilo, Diddy's attorney, were arguing that he should be released. The judge said that she didn't think there were any conditions that made her comfortable to release him. And part of the argument that prosecutors put on is that they said these victims and witnesses, they're all scare. The risk of danger is acute. And that is from all the allegations that were described in the indictment.And what Sean Combs' attorney was arguing is he was saying that you know this wasn't the crime that the prosecutors were making it out to be there. He said that this wasn't sex trafficking that this was a ten-year relationship between Combs and victim one, as she is identified in the indictment, where they would occasionally invite a second male into their relationship. And he said that he had interviewed a half a dozen of these men that were brought into the relationship, and he said none of them said anything was forced. He spoke more about that with Kaitlan last night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He said, this isn't sex trafficking. This is evidence of Combs having more than one girlfriend and getting caught. What he says precluded this, was that the woman in the tape had just learned that Combs had had another girlfriend, that she hit Combs with her cell phone and then ran out of the hotel room, and he's saying what we see of Combs dragging her and hitting her was the result of that, not sex trafficking.",

Here we are, less than seven hours away from the decision, and almost no one knows for sure what the Fed is going to do. That's really rare. Normally, this stuff is well telegraphed days or even weeks in advance.Now, we know there's going to be a rate cut because the Fed no longer thinks inflation is a clear and present danger, but by how much. And at last look, the market is pricing in 39 percent chance of a small cut, of a quarter of a point, and a 61 percent chance of a big cut, of a half a percentage chance, so 60-40. It's basically split here. Either way, this is a major milestone. This would be the first rate cut since March of 2020. And remember, the Fed has had interest rates really high, right? They spiked interest rates to try to put this inflation fire out. Look at that chart. Starting two-plus years ago, they raised interest rates at a pace we haven't seen in decades. And then they held them there. They've been on hold for the past year. So, the fact that they're cutting means that borrowers will finally get a break here. But what the Fed signals here is really important because if they end up going small, with a 25 basis point cut. It would suggest that Fed officials have confidence. They don't feel like they need to rush to come to the rescue of the jobs market. But if they go big, it does signal some greater concern and a fear that they're going to fall behind, which is not what they want to do. Some in Washington, especially on the left, like Elizabeth Warren, they want the Fed to go big, really big. Others on Wall Street, they want the Fed to take it slow. David Kelly from JPMorgan, I think he put it best, he said, cutting short term interest rates from a peak is a little like hauling a piano down a flight of stairs. The operation is best done slowly and with care. Kate, we'll see if Jerome Powell agrees with that.",

And he then went on to compare him disfavorably to other foreign leaders and adversaries who he says are much stronger.But as you said, this event was largely focused on the economy when he was asked questions from this Michigan audience. At one point, he was asked by a person who asked him what he could do to get down food prices. And his answer was what we saw a lot from him last night, which was some variation of trade wars and tariffs. He said that, for example, they should bring in and import less food. I think you'd find some economists who say they would actually bring up the cost of food. He was also asked about the Michigan auto industry, which is obviously so crucial to that swing state. And here's what he had to say about how he anticipates his tariffs affecting that industry. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

That seems on the back foot now, certainly.And indeed, the Israeli defense minister met the U.S. envoy just on Monday, and said, look, a time for a diplomatic solution to solve their clashes with Hezbollah, they've been going on since October the 7th, appears to have passed, and it's the military that may have to take up the reins here. And then suddenly, hours later, we have this extraordinary, unprecedented, sophisticated assault widespread, hitting Israeli -- sorry, Lebanese civilians as well. Is that a prelude to something larger that Israel has planned? Is it a message in itself to Hezbollah to remind them of how easily penetrated their supposedly secured networks are by their foe to the south? We don't know. I think as the days elapsed since this attack and Israel doesn't launch a major military operation, we may be looking possibly at this attack itself being a message that's self-contained.
