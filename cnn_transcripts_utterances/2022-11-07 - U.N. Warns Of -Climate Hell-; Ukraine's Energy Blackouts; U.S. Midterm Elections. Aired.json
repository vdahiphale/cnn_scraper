And the final days of campaigning, the U.S. midterm elections begin on Tuesday. A crucial, critical test for President Joe Biden. The secretary general has issued a stark call to arms as the COP27 climate opens in Egypt. Antonio Guterres as warned that the planets quickly reaching a massively destructive point of no return, countries do not live up to their climate commitments. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONIO GUTERRES, U.N. SECRETARY-GENERAL:  And the clock is ticking. We are in the fight of our lives. We're losing. Greenhouse gas emissions keep growing. Global temperatures keep rising. And our planet is fast approaching tipping points that will make climate chaos irreversible. We are on a highway to climate, with our foot still on the accelerator.

And in that environment, of the Ukraine war, energy security, whatever the prime minister of the UK says, it is a difficult prospect for many economies. I think one of the major themes of today, is developing countries feel that they need the money, the funding, not only to shift away from the carbon heavy fuel sources, but also to help their populations.

And sort of ride the wake of innovation towards a brighter future, but they're not even talking to each other. So, any movement on that, to let the rest of the world know that the big boys care, and want to work together instead of being a climate rival. So much of the U.S. is cost of solar panels, as a result of Chinese manufacturing. If it breaks down, it can change that whole thing. And as a result of that, a year ago, Richard, we're in Glasgow, 193 countries said will come back and Sharm el Sheikh, with new implementation plans, with boulder initiatives, acknowledging all the time lost, to delay and COVID -- but only 24 of those 193 countries actually have that in writing right now.
