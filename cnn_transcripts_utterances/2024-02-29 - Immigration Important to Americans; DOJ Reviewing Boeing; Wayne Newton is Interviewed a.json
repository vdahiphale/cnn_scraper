Both President Biden and Donald Trump will be there to highlight their own records and proposals on illegal immigration.A new Gallup survey shows American say immigration is now the most important issue facing the country. That number you're looking at right there is a CNN poll that finds that 79 percent of people say the situation at the border is a crisis. With us now is press adviser to former Speaker of the House John Boehner, and most recently Adam Kinzinger, Maura Gillespie, and CNN political commentator and former Obama administration official Van Jones. Van, can we start with you. President Biden is going to the border. Obviously, a ton of focus on this today because Donald Trump is there as well. How much room is there for Democrats, including President Biden, to fight on this issue?",

In other words, they made this an issue, they shipped human beings to blue cities and blue states to politicize the issue, then, when there was a chance to put the fire out, to pass legislation, bipartisan legislation, they blocked it. So, they say there's a fire, they're spreading the fire, but they've blocked the fire trucks.So now Biden can go as the person who had the solution, who wants a solution, who's been willing to compromise, but Donald Trump stepped on that solution, so Donald Trump is now - it's now Donald Trump's open border. It's Republicans' open border. If there's an open border, its Republicans and Donald Trump. And I hope he says that today.",

And, you know, Mayorkas was out there touting it, that they took and wheeled back a lot of those immigration policies. And also that - you know, put Vice President Harris in charge of the border.So, I mean, Republicans have missed opportunities to harken back to that because of their complete failure on messaging right here and now.

For some people, one person, build a wall, we don't want. For somebody else it might be at thousand, 20,000, a billion. At some point everybody says it's too much.Democrats now are agreeing it's too much. And Democrats have been willing to give up a lot of our own principles and demands to get something done about it and been shocked to find Republicans will not take yes for an answer. And I think the country, it's going to take, it's going to take a while to process the idea that Republicans literally refused to do anything about this. Democrats are going to have to make that case. You are correct, right now Republican are trusted more on this issue than Democrats because they've made it an issue, but they also refuse to solve the issue. And so - and we proved in New York second district, congressional district, that Democrats can run on immigration, can be tough and smart on immigration and actually win. And so, in the most recent election, Democrats ran on the issue of immigration, won on immigration. And I think that's a possible pathway for Joe Biden.",

It's the McConnell Supreme Court. And he focused like a laser beam on packing the court with as many right-wing judges as he possibly could. In other words, you can't win the game, so you just basically buy the refs.Now that Supreme Court is ramping down policies that Americans do not agree with. That Supreme Court struck down the Voting Rights Act, even though Congress had passed - had passed it on a bipartisan basis to reauthorize it. That's the Supreme Court that, you know, attacked women's rights to control their own bodies. And now the whole county's on a banana peel around IVF.
