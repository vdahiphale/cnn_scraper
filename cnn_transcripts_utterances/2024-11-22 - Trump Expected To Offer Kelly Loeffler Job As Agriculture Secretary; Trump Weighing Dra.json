And obviously there have been a lot of questions and some concerned farmers who wonder what he wants to do, how that affects them. And two, obviously immigration. If Trump does carry out his plan to have these mass deportations, that's really going to affect the agriculture industry as well.So, Kelly Loeffler is someone who obviously was in the Senate previously briefly before she ran again unsuccessfully, she probably could get confirmed pretty easily based on what we've heard.

There are a lot of leading experts in that industry who are concerned about what that could look like and what he's been promising and how that affects them. Obviously, rural voters and farmers are big supporters of Donald Trump. So we've seen that play out and how he's prioritized that. We'll see what it looks like.

But basically no one I've spoken to expects him to serve that out. The question is who is he going to replace him with? Because Trump has been interviewing candidates the last several days at Mar-a-Lago. He talked -- Mike Rogers was actually down there last week based on what I had heard.And he's having trouble finding someone who is going to do what he wants at the FBI, but also who can get confirmed by the Senate. And we've seen obviously how critical that is, how that plays out and how it's top of mind for Trump right now. So what I had heard, this one plan that was being floated was maybe putting Mike Rogers in and making him the director and then essentially telling him that if he gets that nod, he'd have to put in Kash Patel, an extreme MAGA loyalist who doesn't have experience at the FBI in as the number two. Now that was something that had been floated down at Mar-a-Lago. But after we reported that last night, allies of Cash Patel were not happy with it. They did not want to see someone like a Mike Rogers at the top, who's more -- you know, he worked at the FBI previously. He's more of a traditional conservative voice, though today he was pledging to make reforms at the FBI. He was critical of Chris Wray. And then Dan Scavino tweeted this morning, it was right when I was landing in New York, saying that he personally spoke to Trump and Trump said Mike Rogers would not be leading at the FBI. I think there were a few parts of that. Some people pointed to Andrew McCabe saying that, you know, he'd be an experienced director because he previously worked at the FBI.",

And no matter what the margin is, that's going to be the case likely coming into this election -- this next Congress.We have the budget that's still not done. Mike Johnson is irresponsibly trying to kick the budget into March. That's going to cause the Trump administration massive problems trying to get a budget across the finish line with such a tiny margin. We have to deal with the raising of the debt ceiling so we don't crash our economy like the Republicans almost did into the side of a cliff. Doing that with such a tiny margin, they're going to need Democratic votes. So we have quite a bit of leverage. That's why I keep saying this was not a Republican red wave.

But Republicans and conservatives here in Texas have been rather dismissive of the idea that this violates some doctrine of church and state. Governor Greg Abbott putting out a statement today saying that this curriculum is a critical step in getting students back to the basics. Others have hailed it as an opportunity to round out student's educations and historical perspectives that will give them a better understanding of the things that they are learning.But there are many critics of all of this. The American Civil Liberties Union saying that this curriculum is a flagrant disregard of religious freedom in the state. And they're urging school districts across the state to reject this curriculum. And one Democratic member of the state school board or the state board of education says they're concerned whether or not this curriculum can withstand legal scrutiny. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STACI CHILDS, (D) TEXAS STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION: If a parent or a teacher who didn't feel comfortable teaching this were to bring this up to a court, I believe they would be successful. And in my good conscience in protecting my bar license, I just do not feel that these materials are yet reflective of the experiences and the nuance of Texas students.

It doesn't matter who the appointee is or the nominee, I should say. I think the members of the Senate have shown that they're taking this very seriously. And, you know, now we're talking about someone who served as the Attorney General of one of the largest states in the union. She's gone after the pill mills that were writing prescriptions for opioids and oxycontin. She's, she's done heavy lifting with an oil spill off of Florida and negotiating that on the civil side.
