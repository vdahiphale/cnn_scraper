Another provocative, controversial flag seen flying outside a home owned by Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito. \"The New York Times\" publishing this photo of the flag outside Alito's New Jersey beach home last summer. The flag, which features a pine tree and the phrase, \"Appeal to heaven,\" dates back to the Revolutionary War. But today, as \"The Times\" wrote, the flag has become, quote, \"a symbol of support for former President Donald J. Trump for a religious strand of the Stop the Steal campaign, and for a push to remake American government in Christian terms.\" This is video from the January 6 riot. On the right of the screen amid the mob forcing its way into the Capitol to try to prevent the peaceful transfer of power, you see the same pine tree flag flying. Just last week, \"The Times\" published a photo of an upside-down American flag outside Alito's Virginia home. That is another symbol of the Stop the Steal pro-Trump movement. Justice Alito has not commented publicly on the pine tree flag. He did release a statement last week about the upside-down flag. He claimed his wife flew it after a fight with neighbors.

Another 2024 presidential poll revealing the race is too close to call.Former president -- former -- President Biden, and former President Trump separated by a single percentage point -- of course, well within the margin of error -- in this new polling from Quinnipiac University. But one thing we did notice is that it looks different from this Q Poll back in January, which had Biden at 50 and Trump at 44 percent. And you can see that Donald Trump's support does seem to be growing here in this particular survey. Panel is back. Mark Preston, I wanted that graph because I don't like to put too much stock in any single poll. But when you kind of map it out, you can see some of the changes here. We've seen this reporting that President Biden doesn't believe the polls, and that's why they want to just stay the course here. But when you look at this, it just seems to me hard to deny that in the last few months -- And let's remember, you know, this polling did come out as the country's been absorbing the Trump trial.

Because the Biden-Trump number was really close. The Senate wasn't. Look at the Pennsylvania numbers. It had Biden up at 44 and Trump at 47. So Biden's trailing, in this poll, Trump. But then look at that. That's Bob Casey and Dave McCormick. Bob Casey, the Democratic incumbent, sitting at 46, right? He's running well ahead of Trump [SIC]. Now let's look at Arizona. Same thing: Biden 42 in Arizona, Trump 49. Ruben Gallego, the Democrat, 45; Kari Lake, 41. The difference almost. That's important is not even, you know, the Gallego versus Lake difference. It's that you're seeing Gallego run ahead of Biden here. Usually -- I mean, oftentimes, the trend -- that's not the trend. The trend can be reversed. Why do you think that is?
