New this morning, we're learning that Donald Trump is expected to be in a New York City courtroom on Thursday for a hearing on the Stormy Daniels hush money criminal case. That means he won't be in a Georgia courtroom for another hearing that same day on alleged misconduct by the Fulton County DA who is prosecuting him. CNN's Kristen Holmes is in West Palm Beach, Florida. We have got two hearings happening at the same time, two very, very different cases. And we were hearing Donald Trump might show up in Georgia. Now we're hearing he is going to show up here. What do you know about the decisions being made here?",

So, in New York, that is what they're really focused on. And something else to keep in mind here, if this trial date holds that the judge set, it would be March 25, meaning it would be the first criminal trial that Donald Trump will face. He's obviously facing four criminal trials, but this would be the first one. So, again, they think it's very important that he be there in that courtroom.",

They will help him with ground game, with fund-raising. And we have also seen those fund-raising numbers were very low at the RNC. So just to take a step back, what we do know is that Ronna McDaniel, someone that Trump appointed back in 2016, is currently the chair of the RNC. Trump has grown dissatisfied with her, made that very clear. And Ronna has told him that she will leave when he becomes the nominee. Now he has put out a statement endorsing several people, one of which, for co-chair, Laura Trump, his daughter-in-law, the other Michael Whatley, who runs the North Carolina Republican Party. Now, the thing about Michael is that he is somebody who really perpetuated Donald Trump's lies about the election in 2020. But I was told by a source last night that he actually continued that in 2022. When people were trying to move away from Trump's rhetoric about a rigged election, he was actually still talking to Trump, talking about what implementations they were putting in place to make sure that the election was free and fair, something that Donald Trump obviously cares about. Now, the other really notable part of this moving parts with the Republican National Committee is that Trump's co-campaign manager, Chris LaCivita, is going to be going over to the RNC and serving as a chief operating officer. Now, he's still going to run the campaign, but that goes to show you who is being endorsed there. Now, one thing to be clear, the RNC is going to have to vote on all of this. They're going to have to make sure that these pieces work, particularly for co-chair and chairman. However, Donald Trump has a lot of sway over there right now, particularly as he inches towards the nomination.",

And, for the most part, that control has been because of his ability to mobilize his voters to make their grievances known to elected officials. Now his control really will indeed now be firm with the more traditional apparatus of the party. So, my prediction here is that, Laura, if confirmed by the committee men and women who will have to vote on this, as S.E. noted, she will sort of serve as an overseer, if you will, sort of making sure that the implementations of the former president's vision electorally is implemented. As it pertains to Mr. Whatley, we could sort of get into the veracity of his claims about the election, but I think we all know what the truth is there. He is a successful chairman in North Carolina, and that cannot be denied. It's a very strong party. He also has a pretty strong relationship with more of the activist members of the party in North Carolina, as well as many activist leaders across the country. And so this is someone, regardless of what we may think about his different positioning, if you will, he has the experience to lead a party. He's shown that.

I think, if you're going back, it can't just be to skewer Trump. It's got to be to skewer it all, because this election choice is terrible.

We didn't get that onset of rain that we initially thought was going to happen, but it is a heavy, wet snow. We call it heart attack snow because it is so exhausting to shovel on your own. And just to give an idea, a testament to just how heavy and what it is. Look how it's attached to the tree limbs in Central Park. Yes, it's a beautiful sight, but every few moments we're getting splattered with large clumps of snow, my photographer here holding an umbrella over his camera right now to protect the equipment and himself as well. But, look, bottom line is, this was an impactful storm, but I really believe that hardened New Yorkers were just yearning for a storm like this, because it has been exactly 744 days since we have had two inches of snow on the ground or more, 744 days. We're going back to January 2022 since this area was under a winter storm warning, which is currently in effect across the city, and so much of the tristate area. Look at these snowfall totals. They're impressive for many locations. We have exceeded a foot for some areas into Pennsylvania, into Chester, New York, at 10 inches. That's significant. And, yes, that's a nor'easter, maybe not the biggest nor'easter, but certainly changing the landscape and making this area look like a real-life snow globe. But the back end of this snow is coming, unfortunately, and we have probably another two hours or so of snowfall in New York City. What was originally not supposed to be such an impactful storm for Boston has really brought the snowfall to Boston, but into the cape as well. That's where we will have the longest-duration snow event and the wind picking up as well. Look at the larger snowflakes falling from the sky here.

And what happened was, there was someone who had called in a 911 call, saying, \"There's an intruder in my apartment.\" So, deputies go to that apartment. They go inside. They clear it, did not find an intruder. As they were leaving, somebody in that apartment complex flagged them down and said, \"Hey, I think there's another break-in at another apartment.\" So deputies go to the second apartment and they see broken glass. They see a screen is removed. They see that the window blinds are up. As you see in the video, they knock on the door. They announce themselves as representatives of the sheriff's office, in this case, Harris County Sheriff's Office. They step back and, according to the Harris County Sheriff's Office, they see through the window a woman holding a firearm. And then, as you saw in that video, they open fire dozens of times. The -- what had happened, what they found out later was that Eboni Pouncy was a guest of the renter of that apartment. And the reason the window was broken and the screen was removed was because the renter of that apartment and Eboni Pouncy didn't have keys to the apartment.
