I had on today's program,prayers for a Pope thousands gathered in Vatican City for the funeral mass of Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI, the latest on today's historic ceremony just ahead. Plus, Congress and chaos Kevin McCarthy is still unable to seal the deal and win over hard line conservatives in his bid to become U.S. House speaker. His unprecedented fight now entering its third day the layoffs, Washington straight ahead. Also the turmoil and Tech, Amazon announcing thousands more job cuts than initially planned. And that's just hours after software giant Salesforce announced a 10 percent reduction in each workforce. Tech layoffs in the wider U.S. jobs picture a main focus for Wall Street Investors today take a look at U.S. futures falling after a new report shows robust hiring and the wider U.S. economy. Beyond tech payroll firm ADP reporting that private U.S. employers added 235,000 jobs last month that is about 80,000 more positions than was expected and also just released jobless claims numbers. Well, that's also pointing to continued strength in the labor market. So let's get more now on the jobs picture with CNN's Chief Business Correspondent, Christine Romans. Christine, great to have you on this day walk me through this report because when you look beyond the headline numbers, you do actually see that the recovery is not quite so even you have some of the larger companies starting to pull back on hiring, walk me through this.",

But when youlook within the numbers, you can start to see where there are areas that are adding aggressively leisure and hospitality for example. I mean, people want to do things and spend money on experiences and the goods producing part of the economy is showing signs. I would say cooling, not a faltering but of cooling in these ADP numbers. It is the Chief Economist there who uses that word fragmented. You look at overall with the numbers that good producing sector increases only 22,000. But leisure and hospitality is the big bright spot also some gains from professional business services. But overall a 235,000 print on an ADP private sector payroll number, that is surprising. I think, given the fact that the Fed has been raising interest rates aggressively for six months. This is still a labor market where bottom lines a lot of employers are still struggling to find workers. You can see that in the jobless claims as well. You're not seeing layoffs, layoffs are historically low, there are back with pre pandemic levels. What both of these numbers together show me is that the job market remained robust into the end of the year.",

As you said the Square was packed with people earlier today who were watching all this really history in the making. As you've also said, and I think this is something that was really unique about the funeral service that took place here. That was the current Pope presiding over the funeral of his predecessor, of course, Pope Benedict XVI had stepped down in 2013. And so it was Pope Francis, who's presiding over the ceremony, even though much of it was not carried out by him himself. Of course, his health has also been difficult for the past couple of months and so he sat for most of the servers. However, he did speak at times there were several heads of state and other dignitaries who were here in the crowd. Although not as many as, for instance, in 2005, for the burial and for the funeral of John Paul II. The Germans, however, with a large delegation here in Rome, you have the German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the German Chancellor, and also all the Heads of Germany's constitutional bodies that were here as well. One of the things that we have to remember about Pope Benedict XVI, he was, of course, someone who played a massive role here in the Vatican, not just as Pope, but as before that as well as one of the Chief Cardinals here in the Vatican for decades, who really set the stage and set the tone for much of the doctrine of the Catholic Church over the past. I would say about four decades, so certainly a huge loss for the Catholic Church and a huge loss for the Vatican. But he was, of course, also a citizen of Germany and very much rooted in his home area in Germany, of the very end, they also had a really strong faction here on the ground as well. The Bavarian governor was here also the two former Bavarian governors in fact they chartered a plane for many of the dignitaries from that German state alone to come here. And if you look at the crowd, it was interesting because as the sort of funeral ceremony was coming to an end, there were some who were chanting Santo Subito essentially make him a saint immediately. That to me, seemed to be coming from that area, where the sort of German crowd was I saw some Bavarian flags there next to the sign, calling for Pope Benedict to be declared a saint very quickly. So you do see that there is a lot of support for Pope Benedict. You know, one of the things that we've said about his pontificate is that, of course, there were a lot of difficulties in it. Especially if you look at some of the abuse scandals that came to light where some felt that he wasn't doing enough to address that but he certainly does have a massive and staunch following, especially in large parts of Germany, but then also in large parts of the Catholic Church, especially because of his teachings and because he was such a top theologian as well, Rahel.",

Headcount was down in terms of new jobs by 151,000, for people for establishments that had more than 500 workers.

So wage growth as measured by ADP was down to 7 percent year on year that's based on 10 million workers for the month. We saw that number come down from about 7.6 percent in November. Yes, that's progress, but not nearly enough. When we are looking at wage growth before the pandemic, it was around 3 percent. So we're still more than double what has been the normal pace of wages.

So we can't expect that one number alone is a forecast of the other even though they appear in very close together in the same week, but if you add up all the jobs data, if you look at jobless claims that came out this morning, very low lowest than September. If you look at the jolts data, job openings still strong, even as the economy is slowing, if you look at the ADP numbers, and where we're seeing the sources of strength and consumer facing industries, you add all that up, you already see a labor market that's tight. So what the tomorrow's number will do? It will give us more context. It'll show us more places where we're seeing fragility, but also more places where we're seeing strength.

Someone who's potentially renting an apartment and maybe doesn't own a property so I felt really unfair that there is no kind of way for people to have access to renewable energy, if they're not the owners of the property. The system works a really simple way. We have a set of certain amount of solar panels. They're very, very lightweight, about like one kilogram each. And they are placed onto your balcony with specific straps. After that there is a specific engine that is called a micro inverter, which transitions the solar energy into grid energy. And with that, it pushes it into your grid just by plugging it into a normal power socket. So many people unfortunately - yes, and many people don't know how that works. But there is a way to actually push solar energy into your household and solar power always has a bigger push them the actual grid energy.",

So they had a very equal partnership, as far as it could be equal within the monarchy, which is built on a hierarchy. He's got an issue Harry with the system effectively, which is that there are people more senior in the pecking order to him and he didn't like playing second fiddle.
