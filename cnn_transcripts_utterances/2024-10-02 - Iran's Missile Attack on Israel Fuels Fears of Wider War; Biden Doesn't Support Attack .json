Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel is in a war against Iran's axis of evil following Tuesday's missile strikes. The federal judge unseals never before seen evidence in Donald Trump's election subversion case. And flights are grounded, schools, offices and financial markets are closed in Taiwan as it braces for a typhoon. And Tesla's slips on disappointing deliveries amid tougher competition from China. All that and plenty more coming up. But first, you begin with a tense watch and wait for signs of Israel's retaliation for Tuesday's missile attacks by Iran. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says that his country is in the midst of a war with Iran's, quote, \"axis of evil.\" And his military chief of staff is threatening to strike anywhere in the Middle East. Iran told the U.N. Security Council Wednesday its barrage of about 200 ballistic missiles was necessary after the killings of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah and Hamas political leaders Ismail Haniyeh. While U.S. President Joe Biden is urging Israel not to strike nuclear sites in Iran, U.S. officials say they recognize Israel's right to respond after an attack. Nic Robertson is in Tel Aviv for us. So, the big question, Nic, is how exactly does Israel respond in a way that really sends a strong and clear message but does not lead to a broader war, which is the last thing, of course, anyone wants at this point.",

And moments ago, a CNN crew heard loud explosions over Central Beirut and smoke was seen in the night sky. Early explosions were heard over the southern suburbs as well. Ben Wedeman is in Beirut for us. So, Ben, just based on what we're hearing, Beirut's southern suburbs, at this point in time, have basically been reduced to a ghost town. Just in terms of the ground incursion into Southern Lebanon, Israel is saying that it's going to be a limited incursion, but what can we learn from? 2006 and obviously that was not an easy war for Israel just in terms of the number of losses they incurred, especially early on.

Cedric, thank you so much for being with us. As Ben was just reporting there, you know, parts of Southern Beirut, especially the suburbs, are just pretty much a ghost town at this point, a lot of areas decimated, Central Beirut as well. When you think about the ground incursion into Southern Lebanon and what the Israelis would have learned from 2006, 2006 wasn't -- it wasn't a walk in the park for the Israelis. They incurred a lot of losses, especially early on. I posed this very question to our Ben Wedeman, but he had trouble hearing me. So, I was wondering if you could answer that as well. COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON, CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Yes, Zain, I think one of the key things is that the lessons of 2006 are critically important for the Israelis to follow if they want to avoid the quagmire that they basically ended up in, in 2006. And you had an effort back then to go in and, in essence, try to cleanse the area, if you will, to use a kind of a clinical term of a Hezbollah type forces. Going into Beirut is -- adds another dimension to this. And what you see by going into Beirut, in those southern suburbs, which are primarily Shia-based ethnically-based suburbs, they present a real problem because there's a lot of Hezbollah support for -- you know, in those areas, and that presents a huge problem for the IDF. They had this problem, you know, several times, and especially most recently in 2006, where they tried to go in, try to, in essence, create this sanitary in this area. And in this particular case, they are trying to recreate that, but do it with, I think, a more permanent presence, not necessarily military presence there, but what they want to do is they want to move Hezbollah out of the Southern Lebanon areas, basically the area south of the Litani River and do, you know, something where they can create a buffer zone that prevents the northern areas of Israel from being attacked.",

And this is where this particular operation gets into a very dangerousphase because you may intend, as a force like the IDF, to go into an area and try to, you know, go after certain specific targets and then leave. Those are great intentions from a military standpoint, but the problem is, is that the enemy gets to respond. And in this particular case, Hezbollah is going to come in and they're going to create the kinds of attacks that we saw today with those eight IDF soldiers killed, that is going to be a situation where Hezbollah is going to take advantage of any type of troop concentration. On the part of the Israelis, they're going to try to ambush them. They're going to try to, you know, do things like lay mines, do all kinds of things that really impede the forward flow of the Israeli troops. And one thing that Hezbollah and other forces like it have learned is they've adapted to guerrilla tactics when they need to, and they can do it quite effectively. And once the enemy adapts, you know, the adversary force adapts to guerrilla tactics, what then happens is the quagmire starts to be formed, starts to be created. And when that happens, then there's almost no way of extricating yourself unless you have a plan for that kind of an environment. And anybody who's engaged in this kind of combat needs to understand that once you get into a situation where they start ambushing, you start doing things like picking off certain small units, things like that, then it becomes a matter of time -- unless you know how to do a counterinsurgency operation, it becomes a matter of time before you get into a quagmire situation.",

      "sentences": "Welcome back to \"First Move.\" A U.S. federal judge has just released the most comprehensive narrative yet on the 2020 election caseagainst Donald Trump. In the filing, prosecutors alleged Trump said he would declare victory before all the votes were counted. Special Counsel Jack Smith arguing Trump was acting as a private citizen, not as president. It's a bid to get around the presidential immunity rules outlined by the Supreme Court earlier this year. Trump responding, calling the filing a, quote, \"hit job.\" Our Evan Perez joins us live now from Washington. So, essentially, Jack Smith once again trying to prove that Donald Trump should not be immune from prosecution. Just walk us through some of the new details and some of the new evidence outlined here, Evan. EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR U.S. JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Zain, I think the work that is inside these 165 pages is really to try to persuade the judge that that this case can go forward despite that immunity ruling that you pointed out from the Supreme Court this past summer. Now, one of the hurdles that they have to go through is perhaps -- is, for example, using evidence related to Mike Pence, who, of course, was the vice president of the United States back at the time. Although, here, they refer to -- in this document, they refer to Mike Pence as the president of the Senate, because remember, on January 6th, he was acting in a ceremonial capacity as the president of the Senate in order to certify the election results. One of the things that they opened this document with here, I'll read you just a part of what they -- the prosecutors write, they say, when the defendant lost a 2020 presidential election, he resorted to crimes to try to stay in office and that he acted with his co-conspirators, again, repeatedly pointing out that it was in their private capacity, not in his capacity as the president of the United States. Now, one of the things that emerges here is they go state by state, Zain, of Donald Trump's efforts to try to persuade state officials to essentially support his claim that there was fraud. And one of them I homed in on is the State of Georgia, where you see that the prosecutors say that they have text messages from Mark Meadows, who is Donald -- who, at the time, was Donald Trump's chief of staff. And they're telling him, and they're discussing how there is nothing to support this idea that there were 10,000 dead voters who had cast ballots, and that there was not enough here to change the determination of the outcome of the election. And that -- those claims persisted, including from Donald Trump, that is some of the evidence that prosecutors say they want to be able to bring at trial. There is also evidence that -- from a witness who is inside Marine One, the helicopter, with the former president of the United States, with his family members, Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner, all of them, Melania Trump, and he says, it doesn't matter whether you win or lose, you still have to fight. Again, trying to drive home the point that Donald Trump knew he had lost the election, but persisted in essentially floating these lies as a way to stay in office. Zain.",

Clearly, this case is not going to be resolved before the election. If Donald Trump wins in November, he is clearly going to order the Justice Department to dismiss this case, to drop the case. He won't even have to pardon himself because he won't be convicted and the case won't go forward. If Kamala Harris wins, this case will go forward, I suspect, and we will at least have the opportunity to determine in a court of law, the way it would occur with any other actor, including many of the actors who were those co- conspirators in this scheme, but somehow Donald Trump, by virtue of a combination of delay tactics and innovative unprecedented legal rulings, has managed to avoid even that specter of accountability, and that's not a conviction, just an opportunity to be tried.",

So, we're a long way from this case being resolved, even in a scenario where it does eventually get resolved. But the reality of this filing is it fills in a lot of the blanks of the January 6th Committee, it provides a narrative for historical purposes, and it is as close as we are going to get to an official documenting of what happened in -- not just on January 6th, but leading up to January 6th in terms of the attempt to overturn a free and fair election.

The contest being characterized as pretty much the most civil and policy-oriented affair, a rarity of course in the current political climate, but there were some fireworks over Donald Trump's continued refusal to concede the 2020 election. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. TIM WALZ (D-MN), DEMOCRATIC VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  He is still saying he didn't lose the election. I would just ask that, did he lose the 2020 election? SEN. JD VANCE (R-OH), REPUBLICAN VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  Tim, I'm focused on the future. Did Kamala Harris censor Americans from speaking their mind in the wake of the 2020 COVID situation?",

      "sentences": "Yes. Well, you know, I've said I kind of view the vicepresidential debate to the U.S. presidential campaign as the bronze medal game is to the Olympics. It's occasionally fun, but it's always pretty peripheral and forgettable. People are voting for the top of the ticket primarily. And, you know, there have been some pretty decisive vice presidential debate wins. In 1988, Lloyd Bentsen, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, pretty much flattened Dan Quayle of the Republican with the, I know John Kennedy, John Kennedy was a friend of mine, you know John Kennedy. We weren't talking about President Dukakis after that. So, you know, the impact is pretty small. I do think it was striking for most of the evening. J. D. Vance was more fluent, more comfortable. He is a senator as opposed to a governor, and a senator does deal with the kind of issues you discuss in a debate like this more on a daily basis. But I'll tell you, Tim Walz finished strong. And that final exchange, I think, really kind of turned around the night on the question of whether Trump won in 2020, January 6th, and whether Vance would certify a Democratic win.",

I think there were Democrats who felt that Walz maybe had a little too much of Joe Lieberman 2000 in him, trying to show himself as reasonable in a way that let Vance off the hook on some things. I mean, Vance really did rewrite his history on a number of issues and rewrite Trump's history, abortion, for example, where Vance denied that he supported a national abortion ban. You know, Walz didn't really hold into account for spreading these baseless lies about Haitian migrants in Springfield. But both of them were pretty amiable. You know, compared to -- particularly for Vance compared to someone who was kind of introduced to the country complaining about childless cat ladies, and I think they both did themselves some good in the sense that people kind of saw a more reasonable softer side of each.

They let him get away with a lot of stuff. I mean, you know, he said a lot of things that weren't quite true and, you know, without much pushback.

And it was striking.It's very unusual to have a debate where the favorable ratings of both candidates go up, but that's what we saw in polling after. I mean, I kind of think of another example of that. That's pretty unusual. I'm not sure how much it changes the dynamic for Trump. I mean, the way I look at this, you know, Trump is putting more chips on one number than any other, which is convincing women in the critical swing states, particularly in the Rust Belt of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, that he will keep them safe and Harris won't, that they are under siege from undocumented immigrants and from crime. He literally said migrants will come into your kitchen and cut your throat the other day. That is, I think, what they are betting on above all, trying to convince enough, particularly blue collar, white women who are now oriented toward Harris, both because of abortion and because they're kind of exhausted by Trump, that she will not keep you safe. It's kind of a textbook campaign, almost really, you know, by the numbers that Republicans run against Democrats in those states, coastal liberal, weak on crime, weak on immigration. And her comeback is abortion and turn the page, and I think that's where the battle is being fought out. I think you saw that reflected in what Vance was trying to do last night. You saw it in the way that Walz talked about democracy and abortion, which are big hurdles for Trump with those voters who might trust him more on the economy, might trust him more on keeping them safe. But I -- you know, I don't know how much Tuesday changed that dynamic, but that really to me is the dynamic that will decide this race. Can Harris hold as much support as she now has among white women in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin? If she can, she will be the president. If she can't, Trump has a chance to win this thing.",
