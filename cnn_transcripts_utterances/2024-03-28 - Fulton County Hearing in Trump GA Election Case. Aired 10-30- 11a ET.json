      "speaker": "STEVE SADOW, ATTORNEY FOR FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP",
      "sentences": "-- conduct or speech. We have false statements alleged in overt acts, and again, all of which are political core value, political discourse, you have false statements in overt acts 1, 5, 7, 8, 17, 93, 97, 108, 113, 133, 135, and 157.The only allegations there are falsity. There's no allegation beyond the fact that those statements are made, and I'm suggesting that heightened political speech has to be looked at differently. When it comes to tweets, which is at least the way the state sets it forth, is also political speech, and here certainly by the then- president of the United States, you have tweets in 22, 26, 27, 32, 75, 100, 101, 106, 114, 128, 138, and 139. So, the majority of the overt acts involve false statements or tweets, which are clearly political speech. How best to deal with that under the circumstances, to prosecute those under a broad RICO charge supposedly with contesting an election by, I guess, illegitimate speech or expressive conduct, or is the way that we are set up as a country is that the First Amendment plays through this by others, by those that are complaining that it's false, proving it's false, bringing forth the truth. That's the essence of what Alvarez has said. That's the essence of what a case called Brown versus Hartlage, which is cited in Alvarez. It's 456 U.S. 45 at 61, a 1982 decision. All of those speak in terms of when you're dealing with that speech, that political speech, you're best to deal with it through the pushing forth a counterview of truth, not prosecuting the speech maker or the person that is articulating his political views. Here we've done just the opposite. We have decided that because of those views were unpopular and in state's opinion false, we must prosecute them to stop them from happening again, which is, again, the essence of why it's unconstitutional as applied because that's not what the law says. Finally, the rest of the overt acts, either telephone calls or meetings or requests, no false statements. They're just acts, expressive acts, and they're in there as well. Those are political acts. And for the court's benefit, because I know there's a lot of overt acts, those are 9, 14, 19, 28, 30, 31, 40, 42, 43, 44, 90, 95, 112, what was in the old indictment is 123, number two is now I think is 125. 130, 131, 140, and 156. There is nothing alleged factually against President Trump that is not political speech. What this court has to decide is, is the state's position that fraud or false statements under these circumstances, which I suggest really is alone, is that enough to get it by an as applied challenge? Our position is it's not. Is there another way to look at this? They're going to argue at the same time that it's integral to criminal conduct, but it's the speech that's being punished. That is the criminal conduct. If it's not the criminal conduct, there would never be an indictment for the RICO against President Trump or any of these other counts. Take out the political speech, no criminal charges. Political speech disagreed with basis for all charges. I think that is the best way for me to sum up where our position is.",

      "sentences": "We have been listening to this oral argument before the judge in this hearing today that's trying to lay out reasons that he -- that the Trump team and another defendant believe that this should be dismissed on First Amendment grounds.I want to go to our panel here who is champion at the bit to weigh in. There's a lot to unpack here on what we have seen. The primary point, of course, being that they believe that the First Amendment -- the Trump council believe the First Amendment and protected speech should not should not be overturned or not be by the indictment. Let's go to Elie Honig first. Elie, tell me what you are seeing here and hearing through these arguments today. ELIE HONIG, FORMER ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK:  So, Laura, the core argument that we just heard from Donald Trump's lawyers is that everything he's being prosecuted for here is protected First Amendment political speech. And you heard the lawyer argue that even if the speech is false, even if it's unpopular, it's still protected. Now, the response from the prosecutors, from the D.A.'s here, is that no, he crossed the line to where his speech became part of the charged criminal acts. Now, there's a sort of separate dispute here about whether the court has to accept the indictments as -- the allegations as they are in the indictment. Donald Trump's team says, why do we just have to take it as a given that this was illegal because that's what it says in the indictment, don't we get to contest that? And, Laura, that led to sort of the last point that we heard there, which is the question of when does this First Amendment issue get decided? And you heard the judge sort of say, well, why don't we -- isn't the way we decide this as we put it in front of the jury and we let the jury decide at trial? Donald Trump's lawyer objected to that. He said, no, we'd like you to throw it out now. Why go through with the whole exercise of a trial if this indictment ultimately is going to be no good? Really important one other thing to note, Laura, this same argument was made by Donald Trump in his federal case in Washington, D.C., relating to election subversion. And the federal judge there, and you heard reference to this, Judge Chutkan, she rejected that First Amendment argument. She said, no, I find this is not protected speech. It crossed the line into criminality and we'll leave it for the jury. So, Trump's team is fighting an uphill battle here legally, but the judge is willing to hear them out.",

It wasn't just that Judge Chutkan said she rejected it, she was saying, look, if it turns out that you cannot prove it was a false statement or a knowing false statement, then he hasn't been convicted. It doesn't mean the indictment itself is problematic.Sara, let me go to you here. You've been covering this story really since the beginning of it all. You're hearing arguments being made that suggest that all of this was just political speech. It's what's done, Sara, and everyone else is naive if you think this is not how the game is played.",

But I will say this, you know, I'm talking to Donald Trump s team, this isn't an argument that they're banking on. They are not expecting this 100 percent to work.This is, as they continue to remind me, that they are paying lawyers in all of these cases a lot of money, and they should be exhausting every single avenue and spending as much time as they possibly can to draw this out. And if they aren't, then they aren't doing their job. And remember, the main tactic here, as we have said over and over again, is to delay this beyond the November election. And that is the point of why they continue to file separate motions, all of these pre- trial hearings. You're not going to see it stop, because what they're trying to do is push -- you know, we heard Fani Willis saying she still wants that August court date, they were trying push beyond November.",

So, we start from that, so we've got that out there, does not defining the public officer. Now -- but the still pleading does say that the issue of what -- who is and is not a public officer is addressed in other contexts in Georgia law, usually in the \"merit proceedings\" where somebody is trying to find out the legitimacy of somebody having or holding a particular office. And in that context, there are cases citing in this still pleading that address this very matter. They cite Brown v. Scott and -- as a case in which the Brown v. Scott case, you know, whether or not an individual has designation or title given to him by law or exercises functions concerning the public assigned to them by the law, they cite Brown, that doesn't -- the inquiry doesn't really end there. The George Supreme Court has termed -- noted the term public officer involves the idea of tenure, duration, fees, emoluments, and powers as well as that of duty. And so that's a McDuffie v. Ferguson and that has to do really with grand jurors. So, when someone says, well, it is a grand juror, a public author, and the court, you know, breaks down an analysis talking about that saying, not really because grand jurors may only meet for a few days. You know, they're not essentially -- you know, they're not there for some sort of duration or tenure. They don't take the same oath of office as prescribed for public officers.
