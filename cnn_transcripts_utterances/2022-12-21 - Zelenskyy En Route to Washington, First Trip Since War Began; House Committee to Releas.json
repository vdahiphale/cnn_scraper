In a tweet Mr. Zelenskyy confirmed that he's heading to the U.S. to, quote, strengthen resilience and defense capabilities. He's also set to visit Capitol Hill. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi formally invited the Ukrainian leader to address a joint member of Congress.Saying in a letter: During this dark moment you're courageous, patriotic, indefatigable leadership has rallied not only your people, but the world, to join the front lines of the fight for freedom. And with Mr. Zelenskyy in Washington the U.S. president is expected to announce another huge military aid package for Ukraine worth almost $2 billion.

The Kremlin spokesman said that they would be seen as a legitimate target. They said that pretty much about all U.S. weapons provided. The Foreign Ministry spokesman went even further saying that this would be seen as an escalation and would risk bringing U.S. forces into the conflict.Russia has spent so many months really been painting this conflict as a war between itself and not Ukraine but the West and NATO as a whole. So that will further that argument. But significant as well, Max, that alongside this meeting Putin is holding with his defense ministry today, we're seen Dmitry Medvedev, the head of his security council, the former deputy head, the former president himself, in China meeting with Xi Jinping at the same time that Russia and China are holding joint naval exercises. Clearly this sets up this counterpoint. Russia is shifting its alliances, while Ukraine strengthens its Western alliance particularly with the U.S.",

But also, it is risky because he's doing this in conjunction with this massive weapons package from the U.S. alone with the Patriots. With him out of the country I think this escalation as Russia will see it. They will certainly see this as an escalation comes with even more risk.

Democrats in Congress have been trying to get their hands on Donald Trump's tax returns for years and now the American public will finally get a look. The House Ways and Means Committee has voted to release Trump's 2015 through 2020 returns and an accompanying report shows the former president claimed huge operating losses to reduce his tax liabilities to zero. And it raises questions about millions of dollars and charitable contributions. The committee says the Internal Revenue Service never properly scrutinized Trump's returns as is required by the mandatory presidential audit program. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. RICHARD NEAL (D-MA): The tax forms were really never audited and only my signing a letter at one point prompted sort of a rear-view mirror response. REP. JUDY CHU (D-CA): The start of this examination wasn't even begun until after Trump left office. So, there is something clearly wrong here. The American people have a right to know about this alarming state of noncompliance with the mandatory presidential audit. But you know what, they can't take our word for it. They need to see the returns themselves. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He lost that fight. Ultimately those returns turned over to Democrats just a matter of weeks ago, but in a party line vote, the House Democrats in their final days in power, the Ways and Means Committee voted to release those tax returns from six years -- six recent years as well as not just his individual returns but his business returns as well. That vote 24-16 along party lines to release both a report from the committee investigating this as well as all of those returns.Now first on the report those two that were released late on Tuesday night. One of which is the committee's investigation that found that the mandatory presidential audit system. [04:10:00] Of that the IRS employs for all sitting presidents, they said that it was dormant during the Trump years. They say that is an essential program because they need to ensure that a president is not compromised in any way in signing legislation into law. But they said it was not essentially in use until April of 2019. That is when the Richard Neal, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, a Democrat, started to inquire about Donald Trump's tax returns. They say at that point that's when the IRS audit program kicked into gear and they said it never was completed over the six years of returns that they ultimately obtained. Then in a separate report by the joint committee on taxation analyzing those returns. It raises some questions about some of the deductions that Donald Trump took. Suggested that perhaps more investigation might be warranted. It did not make a judgment one way or the other but got into the numbers of his deductions, his losses and the income that he reported. But we expect a lot more, including all details of those tax returns in the days ahead. Right now, the committee is trying to redact some of the sensitive security information, some of the confidential information like social security numbers and the like. Once that is done, they will be released. It will come out before Democrats are no longer in power in the House. January 3rd is when Republicans take over. Republicans attacking Democrats for misusing their power in releasing Donald Trump's returns. Donald Trump's spokesperson also attacking committee Democrats. But nevertheless, they are moving forward and also moving forward on legislation to mandate how presidents are audited by the IRS. That is something Nancy Pelosi in her final days of Speaker plans to bring to the floor. Manu Raju, CNN, Capitol Hill. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

In fact, travel experts tell us that some of you may want to consider changing your flights already depending where you're going. Some airlines are even encouraging you to change your flights. You may have received the email from one of those airlines.United airlines says 140 airports are now included on the latest travel waiver. That means you can change your flight completely free of charge if your flight is to, from, or through one of those airports. That means no change fee. No increase in fare. American and Southwest airlines have also issued similar travel wavers. The issue here is this weather is so widespread but the bulk of the storm is coming for some major hubs like Chicago O'Hare. That's a big hub for American and United Airlines. Scott Keys of Scott's Cheap Flights says airlines may try and reroute connections around some of the most impacted airports but there's just not as much slack in the system nowadays as there was back before the pandemic. There are fewer seats available that will make this a lot tougher for folks traveling towards the end of this week. Pete Muntean, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
