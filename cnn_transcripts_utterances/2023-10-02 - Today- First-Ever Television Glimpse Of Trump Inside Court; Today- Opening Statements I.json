      "sentences": "Today on Inside Politics, a moment memorialized for all of history. For the very first time, television cameras capture the former president of the United States sitting stoic inside a courtroom.And let's be clear, his entrance was a made for TV set up all about his campaign. But beyond Trump's stagecraft, the trial itself poses a very real threat to his business empire. Plus, will he get by with a little help from some new friends? The House speaker readies for a revolt that will try to take his gavel staying and his job may depend on Democrats. And Governor Gavin Newsom honors a promise to pick a black woman to fill a Senate seat left vacant by the passing of Dianne Feinstein. A candidate already running for this seat who was critical of Newsom's approach. Congresswoman Barbara Lee will join me in minutes. I'm Dana Bash, let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. Up first, the cameras, the court and the campaign. The former president flanked by his lawyers captured sitting behind the defense table in a New York City courtroom. That glimpse will be the only one we get of Donald Trump at least from inside this courtroom. The judge overseeing his civil fraud trial decided to keep the media from broadcasting opening arguments live. The trial is about money, power, and yes, of course politics. Before the trial began, the choreography made that very last part really clear. The former president's entourage his son Eric and senior advisors striding into court as if this was a campaign event. They were followed by the former president himself who stopped -- and stopped and talked, and talked, and talked, delaying the start of his trial by nine minutes. His rant was both typical and remarkable for its venom, aimed at the New York attorney general. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, 45TH U.S. PRESIDENT: This is a continuation of the single greatest witch hunt of all time. We have a rogue judge who ruled that properties are worth a tiny fraction of one one-hundredth, a tiny fraction of what they actually are. We have a racist attorney general who's a horror show who ran on the basis that she was going to get Trump before she even knew anything about me. She used this to run for governor. She failed in her attempt to run for governor. She had virtually no bawling. She came back and she said, well, now I'll go back to get Trump again. And this is what we have. It's a scam. It's a sham.

Here with me to talk more about it, are some legal and political reporting and insights, CNN's Carrie Cordero, Defense Attorney Joey Jackson, and CNN's Kristen Holmes.I want to start here with you, Carrie. Talking about what's at stake. We're talking about properties, Trump properties like the Trump Tower, Trump International Hotel, Central Park, the Westchester golf club, 40 Wall Street. And then, I just want to look at some of the claims that we are discussing that are part of this persistent and repeated fraud, falsifying business records, conspiracy to falsified business records, issuing false financial statements conspiracy to falsify financial statements, insurance fraud, conspiracy to commit insurance fraud. CARRIE CORDERO, CNN LEGAL &amp; NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Yes. I mean, I think what this case is really about in this stage of the case is really about is the Trump organization's ability to continue to do business in the state of New York. The judge already issued a decision last week that pertained to some of the charges that found that they did can engage in fraud already. And so, now there are some of the remaining allegations that the state attorney general is making. And there is the issue of liabilities and damages, and how much they will need to pay and whether they'll be able to continue to retain their entities and do business in New York.",

Now, this is his life's work, his business. So, it's understandable that someone would want to be in a courtroom. It is also not a surprise that the former president is using this image.We've never seen an image like this before. It was brief because they didn't want cameras to stay in the courtroom. But that image to be a spectacle, a very Trump ask spectacle that he is trying to use to his advantage. Already fundraising off of the fact that he is in this courtroom, Kristen?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Dana. It appears that they are treating this trial as though it is a campaign event. And remember, Trump and his team are very good at manipulating the optics and they want good visuals. They want the media coverage on them, no matter what the media coverage is.And I for months, I've been asking them, how are you going to navigate a presidential campaign alongside these multiple looming trials? And the answer continued to be, we don't know yet. We're working it out. Does it look like shorter days and rallies at night? But it appears that they have at least figured out one part of that, which is turning these trials least in this case into a campaign event. And a senior adviser to Trump essentially told me as much, conceded that that is what they had done in this case. They knew exactly where the cameras were in that room. He knew exactly where to go. He knew to pause before he spoke, so that the cameras were rolling that they were -- that he gave them time to take him, and they were going to take him on newscasts. He is very aware of how to do this and how to take control of a narrative. And this is how they're going to do it. And I do want to note one thing here. Yes, that can be true. And it is true based on the advisors and the allies that I've talked to that that's what they're doing here. But the other part of this is that this piece is central to Donald Trump's brand and identity, not just as a human being but as a politician. If you go back to 2016, one of the arguments that got him into the White House was this idea that I am a rich businessman, because I am a rich businessman, I can actually make these deals on your behalf. The deals that have been making me rich, will now make you rich. Look at how I've run this business so successfully. Now I can run the country as successfully. And I hear voters talking about that. So, this does go to the very identity of the man who was elected back in 2016.",

I'm very rich. I built an unbelievable company. The money you're talking about is a lot, but it's peanuts for me. I'm much richer, right? You see, much richer. All my life, I made money. I made money. I've always been good in making money. Number one best sellers. One of the best-selling books of all time, tremendous television success. I've been success. Well, wait a minute, Jake. I've been successful in every business I've been in. If you think real estate. I have made billions of dollars in business making deals. I'm my own donor, essentially.

I mean, he has a giant plane, and he has made money. The question has been about whether he has inflated that, and it's again when this -- with this trial is about is it isn't just a political question about whether he is speaking in hyperbole, which everybody will look at this and say, duh, he's Donald Trump.That is certainly baked in politically.

He worked with Democrats on the debt limit bill, and only Democrats are really campaigning on that bill. Republicans aren't campaigning on the debt limit bill. That was a Democrat bill passed with mostly Democrat votes.Then we get to the appropriations process and Speaker McCarthy purposefully delayed us. He tried to back us up against shutdown politics. He tried to not pass single subject spending bills. And at the end of the day, he had to utilize Democrats to pass a continuing resolution. So, if Kevin McCarthy works for Democrats and utilizes Democrats in order to keep power that would be consistent with everything we've seen from him. (CROSSTALK)",

He blew past that.Kevin McCarthy agreed to a rule that we would not put anything over $100 million on the suspension agenda, so that it couldn't be amended. He blew past that. Kevin McCarthy agreed to the Hastert Rule, which is that you would never use a majority -- the Democrats to roll a majority of the majority. On the last Ukraine supplemental, 101 Republicans voted for it, 117 Republicans voted against it. So, this doesn't -- does this sound personal to you? I'm pointing to specific things that Kevin agreed to that he hasn't complied with. He's just trying to subjugate his real and significant breaches of our agreement as some sort of personal dispute.
