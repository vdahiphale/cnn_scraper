But, I think you have a basic problem is that this is a regime that isn't very popular, and there has always been resentment against it, and certainly once the ball gets rolling, once a force like this with the rebels start to advance dramatically, as they have, the fragile morale of the Syrian army could simply collapse altogether, and you could see sort of retreats across broad fronts.So, they're in a very vulnerable position, and it's questionable to what extent its traditional backers, Hezbollah, Iran and Russia, can actually come to their rescue.

Ben Wedeman, glad to have you with us, as you continue to follow the story, and we'll continue to check in with you. Thank you.I want to go now to H. A. Hellyer. He is a Senior Associate Fellow at the Royal United Services Institute for Defense and Security Studies. I am curious to learn -- thank you for joining us. I am curious to learn from you how surprised you are at this, given what Ben described. Obviously, they were the skirmishes. The rebels were always trying to gain more of a foothold. But, to actually enter Aleppo, Syria's second largest city at this time in the fashion they have, I mean, what's your take? H. A. HELLYER, SR. ASSOC. FELLOW, ROYAL UNITED SERVICE INSTITUTE OF DEFENCE AND SECURITY STUDIES: First, thank you very much, Paula, for having me. Always a pleasure to be here, and good to hear from Ben, who, of course, has great experience in this area, but I think that his analysis is correct. The Syrian regime continues to be deeply unpopular among huge swathes of the Syrian population. Of course, it also has popularity in other areas as well, but there is that deep- rooted dissent and antipathy towards it, and it managed to hold sway in large parts of Syria as a result of, frankly, external support, in terms of Hezbollah, in terms of the Iranian regime as well. What we've seen over recent months is the, quote, unquote, \"Axis of Resistance\" really showing that actually the strength of it is not what people considered it to be. And I think that this particular offensive would have been in the works for quite some time, where the rebels would have thought, actually, we have an opportunity to take back some territory in Syria, while Hezbollah is being pounded in Lebanon as a result of the Israeli invasion and offensive where the Iranians are trying to simply hold on to regime stability within Iran itself. So, I think that it's an opportune moment that they saw, and I think you'll see a lot of people being very conservative about their predictions from here on in because really, I don't think anybody knows how far this can go.",

I mean, all of this is going to be part of a wider set of moves that the Turks are going to be very nervous about, and opposed to much like the rest of the region, frankly. So, throughout that, and then, of course, when we talk about Lebanon,there is an incredibly tenuous ceasefire deal that's currently holding in Lebanon, even though it's been violated several times already over the last few days by the Israelis.

They are all incredibly skeptical of this ceasefire agreement, largely because they watched in 2006 when a ceasefire agreement was reached between Israel and Hezbollah that ultimately Hezbollah ended up building up a whole range of infrastructure, military infrastructure right on the border, including not only these rocket launchers and anti-tank missiles that they have fired at their homes, but also these tunnels and attack infrastructure that has been discovered by the Israeli military very close to the border.And so, their fear is that Hezbollah will not abide by this agreement, will once again build up, again, covertly under the noses of the United Nations and Israel and others involved in this process, and that Israel won't actually be able to prevent that from happening. The Israeli government right now, what they are doing is they are trying to prove to the residents of northern Israel that they are going to be capable of enforcing this ceasefire agreement, and also that they have maintained their freedom of action in the skies above Lebanon. And indeed, we've seen that over the course of the last few days in actions where the Israeli military, including one that was just confirmed now by them, has carried out airstrikes in southern Lebanon against what they are saying are Hezbollah positions, and what they are claiming are violations of the ceasefire by Hezbollah. The Lebanese side, for its part, is calling these actions by the Israeli military the real violations of this ceasefire, and that, of course, speaks to how complex and how risky these actions by the Israeli military and the potential for it to blow up this ceasefire will be going forward, in the sense that Israel is not only a party to this ceasefire agreement, but also trying to be the party that actually goes ahead and enforces it. But, Israeli government officials have made very clear to me that they would not have agreed to this ceasefire if they did not believe that they would retain and that the United States had provided assurances that Israel could retain this kind of freedom of action in the skies above Lebanon. But, so far, despite some of these violations that have been claimed by both sides, this ceasefire, for now, appears to be holding. Paula.",

I got to go inside with him at that moment to see it for myself, and it really is very different to what it was before the fire. Gone are those -- that somber solemnity. It is sparkling clean.

It's interesting that there is such a curious amount of disconnect in a phone call that both sides described as relatively positive and an important sort of flash point in the relationship going forward. However, there is a chasm in how they are describing this call. You read what President-elect Trump said. Well, here is what Mexico's President Sheinbaum said. She wrote, \"Everyone has their own way of communicating, but I can assure you, I give you the certainty that we would never, and we would be incapable of it, propose that we would close the border. It has never been our approach, and of course, we don't agree with it.\"Now, I will point out that Trump's statement said that Sheinbaum had agreed to, quote, \"effectively close the border.\" So, perhaps that word effectively is doing a lot of work, and his description of closing the border to migrants and drugs, maybe perhaps is different from her description of allowing trade and tourism to continue. However, one thing that remains unclear and amongst a lot of unclarity is whether or not Trump feels satisfied by the call enough to lift his threats of a 25 percent tariff on Mexican goods. He said that that would persist until the country had done more to help the U.S. maintain the border, stop the flow of migrants and the flow of drugs across the border. And while he believes he got concessions out of the Mexican President, he has not yet said if it's enough for him to lift that threat of a tariff, Paula.",

      "sentences": "Absolutely. It speaks to this hyper-partisan, hyper-politicized environment we're currently in, and one that has really created deep divisions within American society. But look, these five Democrats that we know of that say they were targeted with bomb threats on Thanksgiving morning, all really describing a similar experience that they were notified by law enforcement of the threat. Law enforcement eventually went and investigated and found no evidence of an actual bomb.But, it's interesting, because even without an actual bomb being present, and thankfully so, this still does cause damage, and this still does really raise fears and concerns amongst both those lawmakers and government officials who find themselves often targeted in this way, and also law enforcement, who is really struggling and grappling with how to respond to these incidents and how to better prevent them from happening. Now, the latest lawmaker from Connecticut to say that he was targeted on Thanksgiving Day is Democrat Senator Chris Murphy. Now, Chris Murphy's spokesperson, in a statement to me, said that this appears to be, quote, \"part of a coordinated effort involving members of Congress, multiple members of Congress, and public figures\", suggesting that there could be some linkage between the bomb threats to these five, at least five Connecticut lawmakers, the ones that are part of the delegation that represent Connecticut, and it remains to be seen. Law enforcement is still very much investigating what happened here, investigating both the language of these threats and also investigating potential -- who potentially could be behind them. At the end of the day, like you said, this is a bipartisan concern. This is something that just as recently as this week, one day prior to these Democrats receiving threats, several of Trump's cabinet officials and cabinet picks received similar threats too. So, something that both Republicans and Democrats in this country are dealing with, and something law enforcement views as a challenge and one that they have to deal with increasingly -- with increasing focus as this continues to happen, and frankly, it continues to happen more and more with each passing day.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. I think a few things have happened. One, of course, is that there has been this longer term shift to online shopping, which was accelerated by the pandemic, and you're seeing a lot of deals going out even in the past week or two, in advance of both Black Friday and Cyber Monday, meaning that it's sort of that -- those promos have sort of been spread out over a longer period of time. So, I think you're less likely to see the traditional big spike in retail sales on Black Friday because those deals are available earlier, and they're available from not leaving your couch.Beyond that, you've also seen that consumers have spent down a lot of their so-called excess savings from the pandemic, which is now a few years ago, but people had acquired -- had accumulated, rather, quite a bit of savings because of not being able to travel, not going out, because of those transfer payments that were coming from the federal government, because of higher wages coming in. But, a lot of that cushion has been spent down. So, consumers have been a little bit pickier, I guess I would say, this year, than they have been in years past, because they have less cash to play with. And finally, on top of all of this, you will have a lot shorter shopping season than is usually the case between Thanksgiving and Christmas, all of which suggests that retailers may see a somewhat slower holiday shopping season this year than they would like.",

And believe it or not, that is actually significant for holidays in terms of how long those stores are actually open, how many days they have to rack in those sales.Catherine, I know you've spoken so much of this in the last few days. Top of mind are these tariffs, right? We all know that so much of what -- so many of us, not just in the United States, buy, comes from, let's say, just to name one country, China, but obviously also in some cases, Mexico. What are we looking for in terms of the effects of those kinds of tariffs on what people are buying? And I also want to point out that this could mean a larger and spreading trade war among many countries.",

I mean, hopefully that won't happen, and if it does, it won't be 25 percent or 10 percent additional on China. But, in terms of people shopping patterns, I guess the distortion could already be in effect. I mean, I know I've heard from small business people already saying that they have a lot of concern and have seen their orders have been affected, but also consumers, right, may say, might be time for me to buy an appliance, a big ticket item now, just in case.",

      "sentences": "Right. And I think that's somewhat what retailers are hoping for. Look, the best-case scenario is if consumers get spooked and buy a bunch of stuff now and then the tariffs don't materialize. The worst-case scenario is if consumers say, I don't have the cash to spend right now. Maybe I'm not going to purchase those big ticket items. Maybe I'll wait a little bit, and then the prices go up, and then sales fall off. Some people will still ultimately have to replace their dishwasher, or refrigerator, or whatever other major expenditure there is, but a lot of people will just continue to put it off.So, there is a lot of uncertainty right now that's built into this threat of trade wars, particularly since we don't know where the tariffs might be implemented, right? Maybe it'll be on China. Maybe companies can hedge against that by shifting some of their supply chains to other big manufacturing bases in Malaysia or Vietnam or other places. But, maybe Trump will tariff those places as well. So, it's not clear in this game of whack-a-mole where it's safe for both the retailers and their wholesalers and everybody else in that supply chain, as well as the consumers who ultimately, again, are going to bear a lot of the cost of those tariffs. At least that's what we saw last time around when Trump waged these trade wars. There was quite a bit of research showing that the costs were either mostly or entirely passed along for American consumers.",
