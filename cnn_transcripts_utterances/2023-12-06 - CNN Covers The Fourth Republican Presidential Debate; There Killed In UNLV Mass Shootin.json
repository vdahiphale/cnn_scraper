And you mentioned a little bit earlier, the Democratic Party coalition is under some particular stresses and strains now because you have some working-class men of color that are beginning to follow the white working-class men into the republican column. You have some Muslims who are beginning to feel discouraged by Biden's position, but you also have Jewish Americans who also feel discouraged by what's going on in the party.

And you don't want civilians being put in harm's way, either directly on purpose by Hamas or indirectly in a reckless way by Bibi.I think most people, if you just sat down and talked about it for more than 15 minutes, you'd arrive there. The problem is you have these social media algorithms that are pulling people into more and more extreme positions. And you have very little conversation. You have yelling. You have people talking about each other, not to each other. And much more importantly, this young generation on these campuses, when I was young and on campus, I said a lot of dumb stuff. You know who I said it to? The guys in my dorm room. And you know what? The sophomores told us, freshmen, sit down, shut up, and listen. And we kept that ignorance contained, and we learned and got better. The problem you have now is you have people who are getting bombarded with these devices. The algorithm is giving them a bunch of information. They're saying stuff that is completely ridiculous, and the whole world hears it. And so, we have a responsibility. It's not ageism. But we have a responsibility to say to this next generation, you may not know, but you're getting pimped and used by Iran on some of this stuff. You may not know, but there are influence operations that are designed to get you to upset and to say things are going to hurt people's feelings. It might lead to violence on whatever these issues are. And we need to be more careful with what we're doing here. Now, I hope those college presidents are more effective at addressing the young people on their campus than they were with Congress. But if they're not, somebody needs to, because young people are being misled. Their passions are correct. What's happening overseas is awful. What's happening to the Palestinians in Gaza is awful. And the whole world sees that. Hearts are being broken. But you can't use the pain of that to then smuggle in antisemitism or smuggle in all Israelis is this or all Jews that. When that starts to happen or Israel itself, the whole country, even when you got millions of people out there marching for democracy in Israel, just a few months ago, all Israelis are this negative way, that's called bigotry.
