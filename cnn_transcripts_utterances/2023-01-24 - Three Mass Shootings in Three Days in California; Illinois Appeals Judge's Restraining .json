Here is what we know. On Saturday, 11 people were killed in Monterey Park. Overnight, at least one person was killed, seven others injured in Oakland, and that happened just hours after a gunman opened fire killing at least seven people at two separate locations, this shooting, the third one in Half Moon Bay. This regularity is something we see more and more. You hear the headlines from us. It is hard to communicate and I'm sure it is hard for you to hear.",

He was sitting in his car apparently at a police substation, and that is when 67-year-old Chunli Zhao was taken into custody relatively without incident. There is still no clear motive at this time. They don't know why this happened. But they do believe that Zhao worked at one of the locations where this took place, where those shootings took place. They also believe that he acted alone and that there is no current threat to the community. Here is what the vice mayor had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The state attorney general is now asking an appellate court to step in after a judge granted a temporary restraining order, barring the enforcement of the state's new gun control law.The law was passed in the wake of yet another mass shooting, this was on July 4th in Highland Park. It caps the sale of high capacity ammunition magazines. We saw those used in Monterey Park shooting. Bans switches that allow semiautomatic firearms fire rounds automatically, also extends the ability, of course, to prevent dangerous individuals from possessing a gun through firearm restraining orders. Joining me now to discuss, Illinois State Representative Bob Morgan, he represents Highland Park, sadly a witness to that July 4th mass shooting and supported that legislation. State Rep Morgan, nice to have you on this morning. STATE REP. BOB MORGAN (D-IL):  It is good to see you again, Jim.",

It was about six months ago, I think you and I spoke the day after the shooting in Highland Park. And so to see what Illinois has done where we took our pain and turned it into purpose and passed really meaningful, as you mentioned, broad-based legislation to reduce gun violence. The data suggests that when we have a national assault weapon ban, mass shootings went down. There were fewer of them. We know the high-capacity magazines result in more bystander violence. We know the red flag laws work.So, there are a number of elements of this legislation that will reduce gun violence in Illinois. But it's horrific.

The only question was which community or communities, right, would face the next one. And here we see it in a span of just a few days.A consistent feature of many shootings is that oftentimes even if a state law would have banned a certain weapon, the gunman could get it from outside of state or under more restrictive state laws they could still get a gun. Tell us specifically why you believe a state law, even if your preference is national legislation, but a state law like the one you passed in Illinois will make a difference.",

But what we did in this legislation is not just ban the sale of semiautomatic rifles and high-capacity magazines, we also really put into place into state law a core function of the Illinois State Police to go after gun trafficking. One of the things that data and researchers showed is that over 40 percent of gun crimes in Illinois come from guns that originate in other states, Indiana, Missouri and other states like that. So, we're really going to work closer with ATF and DOJ and also our Illinois State Police to make sure that we're combating some of these illegal gun trafficking, which is directly connected to our (INAUDIBLE).",

You could jeopardize, you could reveal your cooperators, your informants and witnesses, you could put people in danger, you could jeopardize your investigative tactics, what documents have you looked at, do you have wiretaps, all of that could be out there.Second of all, as a prosecutor, you have an obligation to the people you're investigating. You can't just go out there putting out negative information about people who aren't even charged yet, never mind convicted. So, from a prosecutorial point of view, I would not want this out.

The D.A. has not formally taken a position just yet on what she wants to happen here. And also the judge has to weigh are there any individuals here, whether it is Donald Trump or anyone else who may be mentioned in this report who perhaps there could be recommendations against.

It moved very slowly. The D.A. essentially did nothing for a year and changed. This grand jury has only been sitting since last May. But we've seen a slew of subpoenas to Rudy Giuliani, to Mark Meadows, to other powerful players, and the D.A. has to understand that time is very, very short here. Arguably, it has already taken too long. We're rounding into the sort of heart of 2024 campaign.
