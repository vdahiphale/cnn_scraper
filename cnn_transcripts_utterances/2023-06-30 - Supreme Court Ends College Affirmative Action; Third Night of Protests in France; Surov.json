And they both have completely plausible reasoning for what they took away from affirmative action. I'm not going to quibble with either of them.The - the thing - the point with Justice Thomas, though, is that there is a demonstrable impact on admissions when you take affirmative action away. And so by way of example, if you restrict or limit or sort of reduce the number of black people who come to a university, you're - you're significantly limiting the number of women as well because about two-thirds of black people in college today are young women. And so you're going to have to contend with some of these real impacts on changing the face, pun intended, of a future student body.

We just don't know where he is.But these documents that were given to CNN exclusively do show that General Surovikin, who is the deputy commander, remember, of Russian forces in Ukraine, was on a list of VIP members of the Wagner mercenary group. There were 30 other people there, high level military and intelligence officials, according to the dossier center, which is a Russian investigative group, that has obtained these documents. It's not clear what VIP membership actually entails. Whether it means they're on the payroll or whether there's any other kind of financial benefits. There's no evidence of that that has been disclosed. But it does imply an overly close relationship between the senior figures in the Russian military and the Wagner mercenary group that staged that attempted uprising here in Russia at the weekend. And, of course, remember that Wagner was able to move without opposition from the military into at least one major Russian city. And so this raises the question of potential divided loyalties.
