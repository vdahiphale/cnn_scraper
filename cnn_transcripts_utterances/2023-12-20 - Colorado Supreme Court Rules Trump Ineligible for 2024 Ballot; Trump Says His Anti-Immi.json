I'm John Avlon, in for Kasie Hunt.Now, the Trump campaign already planning to appeal a ruling by the Colorado Supreme Court that the former president is ineligible to return to the Oval Office under the 14th Amendment of the Constitution. The Colorado high court ordering Trump removed from the Republican primary ballot, saying that he engaged in insurrection on January 6th in violation of Section Three of the 14th Amendment. Now, the justices put a hold on their ruling until January 4th, pending Trump's expected appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court. The next day, January 5th, is the deadline for Colorado secretary of state to finalize that primary ballot. She says she'll file court orders whatever they are. Although, she has her own views (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So I feel that we're ready for another one. It was interesting to see that, you know, the other candidates who aregoing against Donald Trump really rallied behind him in some ways or at least rallied against the Colorado's Supreme Court for doing this. Vivek Ramaswamy said that he would take his name off the ballot. But the one thing they think that this ruling emphasizes, especially with its appeal to the Supreme Court, is that you are going to see, perhaps, the most legalistic election in at least recent history, but not all of American history. Because the Supreme Court now has at least two cases, and sort of two and a half cases that are going to have direct effects on the president. You have -- they are going to determine if he had legal immunity on January 6. You have this case, and there's another case with felony charges when it comes to January 6th. So the Supreme Court is going to have a very business busy election. I also bet you that Colorado is not the last state will have a case like this.",

It was that first indictment against Donald Trump last May. Since, then he has never been within single digits of any other candidate. And they know that. They know the fact is that this could have the effect of rallying the Republican base. In some ways, this ruling could end up ensuring that he gets the GOP nomination, which is why you're seeing them try to do this tricky dance, while they are criticizing the Supreme Court but also making this point about chaos following him.",

That he cannot do as much as he did 10 to 15 years ago. But he really believes that, you know, he tells people all the time that he feels so much younger than 81 years old. And so, that sort of the delicate dance, as a result aides sort of see this vicious cycle of times in which he will over commit to doing things, and then he'll end up exhausting himself, or fatiguing itself.

He -- he doesn't prepare his comments. He says the first thing that comes through his mind, and he often uses rhetoric that is -- really just extreme rhetoric that is more shocking than the policies he actually wants to implement.

He says things that he thinks tap into a feeling. And my assumption is that that's what he's trying to do now. And let's remember, really, one of the issues that made him popular was the very fact that he would say these over the line things about immigration, right? So, these things, as nasty as the sound to me, and as much as I think no one should ever speak about immigration, and in particular immigrants using that kind of language, this could -- this could -- this could work for him.",

Again, not -- this is a percentage increase, not -- he did not win that demographic, and Hispanics.And I wonder, because you've done such important work and you're a (INAUDIBLE) thinker which I appreciate about you -- about the dangers of identity politics. It seems to me that one of the things that Trump represents is what happens when identity politics starts to get real power. In this case, it's white identity politics. So you've got these twin threads where, I think folks don't understand, or appreciate how he's gaining support among certain minority communities given this rhetoric.

I think part of the appeal of Trump is a kind of pendulum swinging the other direction. It is a feeling on the part of many white Republicans, white moderates, that look, if identity is the name of the game, then I'm going to go with my identity, right?

The majority of Americans of all races actually say no, right? At least they certainly did at that time, which is surprising to think about because, you think the majority of Black people, the majority of Hispanics would take the position that, that sort of identity politics dictates that they would take. The reality is that a lot of voters like what Donald Trump is selling, or they are dissatisfied with what Biden is selling. And he can -- he can actually make gains on those communities.",

There hasn't been as much, but I think in the wake of some of these protesters, there is more about the need for the left, the Democratic Party to police its extremes.
