New ways to sort of attack their Democratic opponents.But what you are seeing though is Democrats still having an advantage, particularly in battleground states where, for example -- even where in states where Donald Trump is slightly ahead, the Democratic Senate candidate is way ahead of the Republican challenger. Pennsylvania is a good example of this. There was a poll that came out last week that showed Donald Trump up by three points in that state, but the incumbent Sen. Bob Casey, a Democrat, up by 11 points over his Republican challenger. Democrats want to keep these races focused on candidate versus candidate races.

But let's not lose sight of Netanyahu's precarious position at home as the ceasefire and hostage negotiations hang in the balance. JOEL RUBIN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST, FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE FOR HOUSE AFFAIRS UNDER PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA (via Webex by Cisco):  Yeah, Kasie. It's great to be with you. The prime minister is here, as you described, at what could not be a hotter time in American politics. But it's hot over in Israel as well. He's deeply unpopular. There are significant protests happening on a repetitive basis calling for him to cut the deal -- to finalize the ceasefire with Hamas to get hostages home. And so his visit here -- it can be seen through that kind of a view, which is basically, he's trying to shore up his base at home and show Israelis that he still has the American alliance at his back. But what he's walking into is a real dicey situation where he's become so deeply unpopular here, certainly amongst Democrats, that he has to kind of show that he can reach out. Put out that olive branch and try to show that he does care about the bipartisan support for Israel.

And I think meeting with the prime minister is very important.But going to the speech, that's not necessarily a requirement. This is an add-on. And the prime minister -- he has the administration's support for Israel's security. But I think what we're seeing with the comments that you're pointing out, some of these statements are incredibly serious and strongly worded about the prime minister being here. Because there's real concern that he's not trying to finalize a ceasefire agreement and move this war towards a path that is protecting Palestinian lives, protecting Israeli security, and getting to the ultimate goal of stability in the region, which includes a Palestinian state -- and that he has not closed that deal. And so, part of her meeting today, which I think is very important, is to get that message across that he has to have an endgame. That this cannot be a continual open, unending, long war that Israel prosecutes, and that we can't expect the U.S. to support that inevitably or for in perpetuity.",
