      "sentences": "It's 8And let's get right to the news. The people call Michael Cohen. Donald Trump's wants loyal confidant, sometimes attack dog, is testifying under oath in the first criminal trial of a former U.S. president. Cohen, one of the star witnesses of this trial as prosecutors tried to show a direct link between Trump and the hush money payments made to Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. Sell companies, frantic calls, delayed payments -- the jury getting new insight into the behind the scenes operation to keep Stormy Daniels quiet, and why exactly and under whose direction Cohen made those payments. Joining me now to discuss all this, Jeff Swartz, law professor, former Miami-Dade County court judge; Janet Jackson, criminal defense attorney, CNN reporter Alayna Treene, covers the Trump campaign, and Molly Ball, senior political correspondent for \"The Wall Street Journal\". Good to have you all on. Jeff Swartz, it strikes me -- of course, key to the prosecutions case is to get to Trump's directly involvement in and knowledge of these payments. We have a moment today with Cohen testifying that Trump said, quote, we need to stop this from getting out, speaks to intent and to push it out as long as you can just get past the election speaks to the tide of the election. Because if I win, well have no relevance because I'm president and if I lose, I don't even care. It shows his involvement, does it not? I wonder as you heard that testimony from Cohen, how central it is to the prosecution's case. JEFF SWARTZ, FORMER MIAMI-DADE COUNTY COURT JUDGE: It deeply shows his involvement in the context that he's directing people to get something done for him in the purpose he wants it done. The testimony that has come later this afternoon has really tied him up with it. Cohen has testified that, in fact, he spoke to Donald and that Donald knew everything that was going to happen, exactly the scheme of how its going to get paid, and explicitly authorized him to get this done. And then Cohen describes how he falsified documents with the bank to isolate Donald Trump so that there would be no paper trail for him involving all of that. So it really becomes abundantly clear during all of this that Donald Trump is actually directing this entire operation.",

I mean, to the point where he said stretch out the payments so you wouldn't have to make all those payments, which speaks to character issue, but I suppose in terms of relevance to the case, it's about direct knowledge and involvement in the minutiae.Janet Jackson, the defense's case rests in part on saying the intent here of these payments was not to influence the election. It was simply to protect a man's family. So let's look at Cohen's testimony this morning. He testified that Trump was worried about the campaign, not Melania Trump saying, quote, don't worry, how long do you think I'll be on the market for, not long. I wonder, how significant it was for the jury to hear that testimony?",

That was the relationship between the two of them.Remember, Michael Cohen in the past has also said that he would take a bullet for Donald Trump. And we've heard from several of the witnesses leading up to this, the prosecution did a good well, setting up the relationship before Michael Cohen even took the stand about exactly how close they were, how Michael Cohen wouldn't act unless he got Trump's approval. And that's really what we're seeing lay out today, and most of this morning before they even gotten into the, you know, direct conversation around the payment all morning, they were laying out their relationships. So, the two were very close. I think it's also fascinating to just watch what's happening in the courtroom now, to have Donald Trump and Michael Cohen face-to-face after years of not seeing each other because the hatred between them is clearly very palpable. Our reporters in the courtroom were doing great job of describing that, of how channel Trump won't even look at Michael Cohen because of this. And so, he knows a lot about Donald Trump and he is a credible witness on that sense. I mean, of course, there are many questions about what Michael Cohen is saying, whether it's true because of that hatred between them. But he knew so much about Donald Trump and he really was key to a lot of this.",

That is, they're going to go through all of the crimes he committed, all the bad acts that he did, why he did them, he will blame them all in the furtherance to helping Donald Trump and he will further go to the point of saying that if it wasn't for Trump, he wouldn't have done those things and I regret them, and I was wrong and all the apologies that we anticipate coming. So that's what they're going to do next. And that's how they're going to follow through. So that that part of it doesn't mean that they're trying to hide it from the jury. The jury is going to see that the state brought it out themselves and it takes some of the staying out of the cross-examination. The only thing we have to watch for is, can Michael continue to hold his temper? Can he continue to be business-like? And if he can, he will win the day. And that's the issue here.",

And so, you know, to the extent that it's possible to win, when you're the first ever former president on criminal trial. There is a feeling that number one, he successfully used it to wrap the loyalty of the Republican Party around himself, the senators going there and everyone adding them, defending him. And number two, that it doesn't seem to be penetrating sort of the larger public consciousness as some new reason that they should turn around and oppose Trump.

For his part, Senator Menendez, you heard part of it there with Manu. He is remaining defined throughout all of this. He has maintained his innocence. He says the government is overreaching. And we got a hint of perhaps what some of the defense might be. We're looking at some of the pretrial documents. There's one passage in particular that stands out. It says Senator Menendez intends to present a defense arguing in part that he lacked the requisite knowledge of much of the conduct and statements of his wife Nadine, and did not agree to join any of the charged conspiracies. So perhaps when this trial does get underway, we'll be hearing from the defense that Senator Menendez, if there was wrongdoing, didn't know anything about it, and perhaps his wife did. His wife, Nadine Menendez, as you know, is going to be tried separately. In terms of this trial, still have to get a jury sat. Again, there'll be back at that tomorrow -- Jim.",

So, right now, they've been making these cuts, very precise, in chunks, in different parts of the steel of that ship. What you see they are, those are charges that they're going to be putting inside of it, then covering it with essentially tape, and then right around 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time, weather permitting, they're going to detonate them all right at the same time. And we should see the still pretty much instantaneously break into many pieces and be thrust away from the ship. To be clear, Jim, this is not going to look like a giant fireball, at least it showed and its not going to look like in the movies, its going to be these small puffs of smoke, like little fireworks going off. But this official say is what they need to get the ship and tow it out of there to keep it from being weighed down as it has been now for seven weeks. And the new information we've gotten today is that if all goes according to plan, hopefully within 48 hours, they are going to be able to tow the Dali to shore and finally get the crew off of it, which of course is huge for them.
