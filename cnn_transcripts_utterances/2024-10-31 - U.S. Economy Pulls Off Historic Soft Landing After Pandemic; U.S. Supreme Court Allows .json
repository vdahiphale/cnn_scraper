Well, with Election Day in the U.S. now, just five days away, the presidential nominees are campaigning hard in battleground states that will determine who wins the White House. Kamala Harris and Donald Trump both spent part of their Wednesday in the Midwestern State of Wisconsin, one of three so-called blue wall states. It turned blue for President Joe Biden four years ago, but went to red for Trump in 2016.Pennsylvania remains the grand prize with its 19 electors, the most of any swing state. And as you can see, CNN's poll of polls shows an even split among likely voters. In Michigan, the third blue wall state, Harris has a slight edge over Trump. And farther south, in North Carolina, in the Sun Belt, the polar polls gives Trump a razor thin edge over Harris. Well, Kamala Harris is trying to distance herself from a remark by the U.S. President that the Trump team is trying to capitalize on. During an event on Tuesday, it sounded like Joe Biden referred to Trump supporters as garbage. He and the White House have since tried to walk that back, saying President Biden was referring to the hateful rhetoric of a single Trump supporter as garbage, and not all Trump supporters. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS (D), VICE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: First of all, he clarified his comments. But let me be clear, I strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they vote for. I believe that the work that I do is about representing all the people, whether they support me or not. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Trump, on the other hand has been consistent from day one.It's all in on fear to try to present kind of very dark rhetoric, more and more ominous rhetoric.

On the other hand, there are a couple of states, Pennsylvania being one of them, where there is a significant Puerto Rican contingency of voters and the leaders of the community are really getting them involved.Bad Bunny of all people has gone very vocal about this and condemning Trump. And so, this could really backfire on Trump, because if it is as close as it looks, and it looks like in the key swing states, it's as close as two coat to paint. A small thing like that could help make all the difference, because it will be a turnout election and the turnout election means it's a grassroots election, which means whoever can get up the vote wins.

It is the case that if you look at how consumers feel about the economy and how the economy looks on paper by those traditional metrics, there is something of a gap. Part of the issue is that inflation was very painful in 2022, 2023, and we saw a lot of price growth during that time. Now since then, inflation has cooled, but that just means prices are growing more slowly.It doesn't mean that they're falling and we actually don't want them to be falling, generally an economy with the overall price level that's declining -- deflation is the term for it -- is a sign of a very sick economy. We saw it during the Great Depression, for example. But that doesn't mean that that's an intuitive thing. And I think that there are a lot of consumers, voters out there who are wrongly, unfortunately, expecting for prices to go back to what they were a few years ago, which again, is not something that even the Fed is aiming for at this point. So I think it's just going to take some time. And we have seen wages go up, wages are now outpacing inflation and have been for about a year now. And I think that will go a long way to help people feel a little bit better about the economy. But that time just needs to pass. People need to get more acclimated. And you're seeing some of that in the data that people are a little bit less pessimistic than they had been maybe a few months ago or a year ago.

O'SULLIVAN (voice-over):  Election officials had responded to the video. O'SULLIVAN:  Now, Tarrant County has put out a press release, 51 retweets compared to millions of views for the video. The original ballot was spoiled and the voter re-marked a new ballot with his preferred choice reflected. Essentially what they're saying is, this guy made a mistake and that's the whole point of having the paper receipt. You can make sure, and he was able to cast his vote correctly.",

My goggles have gotten so soaked over the course of this, whether it's champagne, whether it's beer. If you question how the Dodgers were going to celebrate, I don't think you need to question much longer, as they brought home their eighth championship in this World Series win here in New York, deflating the crowd that at the beginning of this game felt like they probably were going to send this back to Los Angeles.It's going back to Los Angeles, but in the form of a parade, not a continuation of this World Series. And as you see, the trophy up top there, this is a moment they have been working for this entire season. And really, if you go back to their last one in 2020, because of the pandemic, this will be their first chance to fully celebrate in the way that I believe they've wanted to for years now. And of course, another significant moment, this was the first year that Shohei Ohtani was on the Dodgers, brings home a World Series. Freddie Freeman sets a record in this World Series for consecutive home runs in games, becomes World Series MVP. This is a team that came in setting a lot of records, had high expectations, and delivered. This is the manifestation of all that work. You get the celebration, you get the beer poured on it, and most importantly, you get the World Series trophy. Back to you.",
