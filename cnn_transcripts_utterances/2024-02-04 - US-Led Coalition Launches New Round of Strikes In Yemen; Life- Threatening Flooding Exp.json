I'm Nick Watt live in Los Angeles.Ahead on CNN Newsroom, more airstrikes in the Middle East. The US-led coalition hit multiple targets in Yemen, but the Houthi say they aren't backing down. Plus, President Biden is projected to win the South Carolina primary. And people here in California are getting ready. Severe weather is on the way and expected to impact millions. The United States has carried out more strikes in the Middle East against Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen. The US said a short time ago that it struck anti-ship missile that was \"prepared to launch.\" Earlier Saturday, American and British forces struck 36 targets in Yemen at 13 different locations. FA-18 jets and a pair of US Destroyers hit what the US says were facilities involved in attacks on international shipping. British jets also took part in those attacks. A Houthi official says the group \"will meet escalation with escalation.\" Iran says the airstrikes have \"made it more difficult to reach a political solution.\" The strikes in Yemen come one day after US airstrikes in Iraq and Syria. The US said those were retaliation for a drone attack that killed three US soldiers in Jordan earlier in the week. CNN's Paula Hancocks joins us now from Abu Dhabi. Paula, what's the reaction been so far to these later strikes in Yemen?",

      "sentences": "Well, Nick, for the strikes that happened overnight local time, they have been met from the Houthi side, unsurprisingly with a defiant note that these attacks will continue. And it's what we've seen in the past as well. This is the third time that the US and UK navies have joined together to carry out significant strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen, this one in multiple locations. And yet we do see that the Iranian-backed group is still able to target commercial vessels and to continue to fire missiles into the Red Sea, causing chaos in that vital waterway when it comes to international trade.Now, we did hear also from Iran. Now, this was before the overnight attacks on the Houthis happened. It was in reaction also to those significant attacks that the US carried out on Friday, overnight into Saturday against Iranian-backed groups, once again in retaliation for that deadly drone attack at the end of January. So they are two separate events. They are targeting two separate elements for very different reasons, but they are both targeting Iranian-funded, Iranian-backed groups. And Iran said, when speaking to a UN special envoy for Yemen, said that what the US is doing in the region is making a possibility of political agreement more difficult, talking about the \"aggressive nature of US policy in the Middle East.\" The US saying that they had flagged for some time that there would be retaliation for the death of those three US service members, also pointing out that this is just the start, this is not the end of it so we should expect more attacks in the future.

Both the US and Iran say they don't want a war in the region, but they continue to point fingers at each other over the current heightened tensions. There are thousands of American troops on the ground across the Middle East, as well as many of those Iranian-backed militia groups.President Biden blames Iran for the deaths of those three American soldiers killed in the drone attack in Jordan. He said Iran is \"supplying the weapons to the people who did it.\" US officials have not determined what kind of drone was used in the attack, but some analysts believe it was a type of Shahed drone. Now, joining us now is Fabian Hinz, Research Fellow for Defense and Military Analysis at the International Institute for Strategic Studies.

The only thing these groups could really do would be to fire artillery rockets with a range of a few dozen kilometers, or have guerrilla hits and run attacks. But these new technologies really enable them to strike targets hundreds of kilometers away.If you look at the Houthis, for example, they have missiles and drones with ranges over 1000 kilometers. They are able to hit the adversary very far away. And of course, that changes the strategic picture quite a bit.",

It's easy to hide them. When you look at Yemen, of course, the US seems to have quite a few successes when it comes to targeting anti-ship missiles, for example. But the Houthis are still using them and they're still using drones, so it's difficult to counter them with offensive action.The defensive systems that the Americans have employed seem to work well, but again, they don't work 100%. And one must not forget that all of these drones that are used by pro-Iranian groups are used as part of some sort of asymmetric strategy. So even if you intercept them, they're still a psychological effect, there's still a political effect, and that's exactly what these groups want. So it's a very tricky challenge that Americans have to deal with.",

You can always try to hit the storage areas in the hope of degrading that arsenal. You can never eliminate that arsenal entirely because these systems are just too easily dispersed. But you can try to degrade it. But that requires really, really good intelligence.And the question is whether the US has that kind of intelligence, do they know where certain Iraqi groups hide their drones? Do they know the same about the Houthis? That's a real challenge here.",

When you have debris that pops up somewhere, when you have a propaganda video released by these groups, you can identify the type. And because we know quite a lot about the uranium drone arsenal, for example, we can prove very easily that these drones are coming from Iran, that basically all the drones these Iraqi groups have used in the ongoing asymmetric campaign against the US have been coming from Iran. The same is true for the Houthi anti-ship missile technology and for the Houthi drones themselves of.And, of course, how exactly the political connection, potential command and control between Iran these groups looks like? It's very controversial. And it's very hard to gather evidence about it because these are decisions that are made behind closed doors. But if you look at the systems themselves, there's no doubt that they're relying on Iran to a very, very high degree. And then, of course, you can draw conclusions. If these attacks have been ongoing for a long time, then you need resupply at one point and the Iranians are continuing that supply. They could just say, OK, we might still support you financially, but we don't give you these specific systems for these kinds of attacks anymore. But we're not seeing that. In the contrary, we're seeing Iran resupplying these groups in a current confrontation.",

      "sentences": "So, look, there are essentially two protests going on there, Nick. There is the anti-government protest and there is the rally that's been happening for several weeks now in the renamed Hostage Square to demand that the government do everything in its power to bring the more than 100 hostages who were abducted in the Hamas-led massacre of October the 7th, who are still being held in captivity in the Gaza Strip.But because of their physical proximity and also their ultimate objectives, they tend to kind of bleed into one another. So many of those people demanding the hostages be brought home and Israel do whatever it takes to get them home, feel that Prime Minister Netanyahu and his government are one of the main stumbling blocks. They will point to a number of things. There was a leak from a conversation between Netanyahu and representatives of the families who have loved ones in captivity in the Gaza Strip. They blamed that on the government. We had Netanyahu this week saying that Israel wouldn't be releasing thousands of terrorists, in his words, in order to facilitate a hostage exchange. And then you also had Itamar Ben-Gvir, Netanyahu's far right national security minister, saying that if a reckless deal, in his words, were done with Hamas, then that would mean the end of the government. And what these protesters feel, some of them, is that Netanyahu doesn't want to do a deal that would ultimately lead to an end in the fighting or a long pause, because then that would mean that the inevitable inquiry into what happened on October the 7th on Netanyahu's watch would come about and that there would be fresh elections, which opinion polls show would see Netanyahu booted out office. But if we just remind ourselves what framework is on the table, because there's no actual deal on the table just yet. It's basically a kind of six week pause in exchange for a number of hostages being released by Hamas for about a ratio of three to one, three times as many Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails would be released during that period. And then the next phase would see Israeli soldiers being released for a higher ratio of Palestinian prisoners, perhaps with a longer ceasefire. And then ultimately the bodies that are being held by Hamas would be released. But both sides seem to still have maximalist positions. Hamas, as you say, is insisting that Israel not only stop fighting, but also withdraw from the Gaza Strip in order for a hostage deal to be done. And Netanyahu seems to be insisting that Israel won't be releasing large numbers of prisoners in order to get them home. So still hopes for a deal, but no sign of one just yet, Nick.

So you really can't take these words lightly. Dangerous, life-threatening are really the words to describe what can unfold the next couple of days. There's the flood watch that's in effect from Sacramento down to San Diego for widespread, three to six inches of rain for more than 40 million people. And you can see why there's that moisture plume that just sits over California over the next couple of days. That's part of the problem is it's going to sit and it's going to stall. And it's also fueled by really warm ocean temperatures. Those ocean temperatures are one to three degrees above average right now and that can really pump that sponge even more. So, dangerous and life threatening flash flooding is really on the table. And we're talking about flooding at rivers and urban in the streets as well. Mud and debris flow could cause some landslides as well, especially over previous burn scars. Down trees and power lines can also be an issue, especially where you're saturated from all the rain that you've got the last couple of days.

We have high wind warnings in effect where we can see gusts 65, 70, even 80 mph possible, could see some lighter gust in that lighter tan shade there, 45 miles per hour gusts. But something to really watch out for, especially as that ground is so saturated. You can see some of those colors pop up, some of those wind gusts over 40 to 50 mph. Here's that storm kind of hitting land by Sunday morning. The heaviest rain goes north first, then slings into Southern California as we go into the afternoon and evening hours. LA kind of getting the brunt as the Grammys will be going on. We'll find some of that heavy rain continuing to pile in Monday and Tuesday as that fire hose just continues to sit there.

With the highest murder rate in the world, it was gangs like the infamous Mara Salvatrucha or MS-13 who set the rules. To this day, Zenaya doesn't know who killed Jocelyn (ph).She is sure, however, on who turned the tide on crime. Nayib Bukele became president in 2019 and quickly tied his name to a security crackdown that sent tens of thousands to jail and effectively taking the gangs off the street. A state of emergency was declared in 2022, granting the government exceptional powers to deploy the army and allowing the police to detain any citizen without charge for up to 15 days, besides curtailing civil rights such as due process. The government claims El Salvador is finally safe, and Bukele is cruising to reelection this Sunday. But his critics, such as Human Rights Watch, accuse him of mass indiscriminate detentions and even torture. At CNN, we spoke with a woman who was arrested on November 11, 2022. The police claimed that she was part of a gang. She denies the crime and says she never saw a judge. Six months later, she was found not guilty and was released. But she says that she was put through inhumane conditions inside the prison. We're hiding her identity for security reasons. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translation): Not a day went by that I didn't find a bug or a fly in my food. And we had to eat that food because there was nothing else.",

Stefano Pozzebon, CNN, Bogota.(END VIDEOTAPE) [02:45:17] WATT: For the first time ever in Northern Ireland, a nationalist politician is the first minister. Michelle O'Neill of Sinn Fein was sworn in on Saturday, marking a seismic shift in Northern Ireland's history. Her party was once considered the political arm of the Irish Republican Army during the violent period known as the Troubles. Now she will share power with a unionist deputy first minister. The two pledge to work together and serve all of Northern Ireland, regardless of party affiliation, religion or background.
