Vice President Kamala Harris and Governor Tim Walz, they sit down for their first interview of the campaign with CNN's Dana Bash. That airs tonight at 9Meanwhile, the candidates are waking up to new polls that show they have gained ground on Donald Trump in Sun Belt states. President Biden had been trailing in all of these states. Harris is up one point in Arizona, two in Nevada and Georgia, Trump up a point in North Carolina. This is all within the margin of error. No clear leader here. But it is a completely different race than it was a few months ago. You can get a sense of the different shape of the campaign. Harris now leads in most of these states on who is trusted to bring change. The sitting vice president is seen as the change candidate. She continues her tour through Southern Georgia today.

      "sentences": "Well, John, as you mentioned, the campaign is feeling pretty good about where they could try to close margins with Republicans, but they also note that these polls show that it is still within the margin of error and that there is no clear leader. But it is the reason why they are employing aggressive strategies in the state of Georgia, a crucial battleground state. And what has been notable about this visit is where they have been going, hitting South Georgia, those rural, counties that typically lean Republican.Now, I have spoken to senior campaign officials about this strategy, and essentially, what they're trying to do here is shave off votes from Republicans, essentially lose by less. And by doing that, assuming they still win big in Metro Atlanta, they can try to carve out that pathway to victory in Georgia, a state that President Biden only won by less than 12,000 votes. So, this is really a place where every vote is going to count. And that is what they have been focused on over the course of this bus tour. Of course, the vice president kicking it off with Governor Walz yesterday, hitting a high school where the vice president had an inspirational message for the students there. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I was in a band when I was your age. So, I know a little bit about -- coach knows about the players, right? And all that you all are doing, it requires a whole lot of rehearsal, a whole lot of practice. But all that practice makes for beautiful music. And that is a metaphor. That is symbolic for everything that you all do in your lives.are doing. (CROSSTALKS)",

Of course, it wasn't expected after President Biden stepped aside and the vice president became the lead of the party's ticket. And every step has been quite choreographed, even as the vice president has spoken to reporters on the sidelines of her events.So, today offers a window, an opportunity for the two to talk candidly, to talk about the issues. And we know the issues that are top of mind for voters, immigration, the economy, Israel-Hamas war, healthcare, abortion. Two of those issues, Trump tends to have the lead in polls, especially on immigration and the economy. So, the challenge for the campaign is how do they provide policy distinctions from former President Donald Trump, and where, if any, are there distinctions with President Biden? So, all of that yet to be answered, but an opportunity with that interview with our Dana Bash.",

And the importance here is that this underscores the anxiety that Trump allies and Trump strategists feel about how closely the former president can stay on message. They feel that in this very, very tight presidential race, he needs to focus on policy, shed the personal attacks, and really dig into the areas where polling shows that Democrats are vulnerable. But he hasn't been able to do that. And going forward, it causes real concern among rank and file Republican leaders.",

And there has been an ongoing question about whether the former president would have Kemp's support at any single moment in time.Now, very recently, Trump and his team, including Senator J.D. Vance, have been making efforts to try and cool down tensions between the two. And the fact that he's going to this event really shows that. I think we have audio here of Vance talking about that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. J.D. VANCE (R-OH), VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  I certainly gave him a phone call. I think 150 other people have given Brian Kemp a phone call and talked about the need to have a unified Republican team. The media wants to tell a story that somehow I have been the peace broker between Brian Kemp and Donald Trump. It's just not true. I reached out to Brian Kemp. I encouraged him to support the president, and he didn't take much persuasion. He wanted to support the president because he thinks Kamala Harris is going to be a disaster. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

One of those points is the invasion into Kursk. Well, that seems to be going reasonably well. Ukraine has taken casualties, but it's pushing into another region, Belgorod, reports suggest now, in which, Russians are being evacuated from the Borzya region, too. So, that's not slowing down. And be it no mistake, it's very embarrassing for Vladimir Putin.The other three points seem to involve the economy, seem to involve a desire to use U.S. supplied weapons to strike deeper inside the United States. Whether he gets that or not, the aim here is to pressure all presidential candidates and the Biden administration to try and make being a Russia hawk part of the campaign here. And I think he sees that he needs to see some sort of progress before winter in case negotiation and diplomacy become a key part of this conflict. John?",
