But there's no getting away from the calls for him to end his campaign, and those calls just got louder.Sources tell CNN that the family gathering isn't aimed at making a decision on that. Still, we're told the topic of just how badly the debate went is expected to come up. These are the people who, more than anyone, hold significant influence over such decisions. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris spent part of Saturday trying to reassure donors that he is still the best candidate for the Democratic Party. At a fundraiser Saturday, Biden told those gathered that he'll fight harder. Now, he'll need to. The largest newspaper here in the battleground State of Georgia is the latest to call for Biden to drop out of the race. The Atlanta Journal- Constitution's editorial board writing, if he displays the courage and dignity that have defined his political career, he might follow in the footsteps of the nation's first president and welcome his retirement secure in the knowledge that he again served his country with honor. Hours later, former Atlanta mayor and senior adviser with the Biden campaign, Keisha Lance Bottoms, slammed the AJC in a tweet saying \"please stick to covering the news instead of trying to make it and let the voters decide. While the AJC joins the New York Times, the New Yorker magazine, and the Chicago Tribune in calling for the president to end his campaign, CNN's Arlette Saenz has more on the president's latest efforts to put the debate behind him.

At each of those events, he acknowledged his poor debate performance, but tried to assure donors that his candidacy remains on track. It comes as Biden's advisers have fielded phone calls from anxious Democrats and donors concerned about the state of the race and what it could mean to keep Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket after that debate performance. Sources tell CNN that Democrats are conducting polling and research over the weekend and early into next week to try to gauge the exact Impact that debate will have on this re-election bid. They said they're not just looking at Biden's re- election bid, but also how House and Senate Democrats who are in competitive races could be affected as well. Now, the Biden campaign so far has doubled down on the fact that President Biden is remaining in the 2024 race. They say that he intends to debate Donald Trump in September. And a memo from the Biden campaign's chair, Jen O'Malley Dillon, said that they believe that this will be a very close race, but do believe that their team will put in the work to help Joe Biden beat Donald Trump in November. Now, President Biden is going to spend Saturday at Camp David with the first lady and other members of their family, all at a time when many questions are swirling about what could come next for Biden in this campaign.

So, we just heard some measured views there, but it's impossible to ignore the growing sense of panic among Democrats. Strategists are racing around conducting new polls. The president's meeting with his family this weekend. Do we do -- you expect him to make any big announcement that perhaps he will step aside?RICHARD JOHNSON, LECTURER IN U.S. POLITICS, QUEEN MARY UNIVERSITY OF LONDON:  I mean, the timetable I've been hearing is he's got a week to prove himself. And I mean, the important date to keep in mind is the convention beginning on the 19th of August, and, you know, at the moment, Joe Biden is not the Democratic nominee. That will be a choice made by the convention. The convention consists of about 4,000 delegates. Now, Joe Biden has -- 99 percent of those delegates have pledged to Joe Biden. The rules of the Democratic Party say that those delegates should vote in good conscience for the candidate that they are pledged to vote for but they don't actually have to vote for Biden. That was a rule that was changed in the 1980s after Ted Kennedy's challenge of Jimmy Carter, it's called the robot rule by critics who said you just have to robotically vote for who you were pledged to vote for. So, there is some room for Biden's own delegates to vote against him. But I think it's unlikely that they would vote against him. And so, the question really then is a much more closer question, a much more proximate question, which is would Joe Biden himself pull back and in effect, open up the process for a replacement?",

When he selected Kamala Harris four years ago as his vice-presidential nominee, many people thought that, in effect, he was going to prepare her to be his successor.But from the start of his presidency, doubts emerged about her ability to connect with the electorate, perceptions of her competence and so on, some fair, some not so fair. And I think Joe Biden, in effect, decided, at some point, during his presidency that Kamala Harris would not be a strong candidate against Donald Trump. And that's -- that -- in that determination, really, I think, meant that he had to run for re-election because Biden couldn't say, I'm not going to run for re- election, but I also don't have confidence in my vice president to succeed me as the nominee, and that is, I think, still his problem right now is, I think, the probably the biggest barrier to him pulling back is his lack of confidence in Kamala Harris.",

Trump's inner circle told him to just to plow on, to ignore it. The fundamentals of the election were what mattered more. And in that sense, they were vindicated.I think the Republicans took a certain lesson from that, and I wonder if the Biden inner circle will take a similar lesson. Obviously, it's a very different set of circumstances, but the Biden campaign might basically say, look, what really matters is the fundamentals of the election. The economy, the fact that you have been the president, people know you can be president because you are the president at the moment. And I think there is a chance that Biden does pull through. I'm not saying it's the right decision for November, but I think that there will be strong voices who might even look at the Trump example and say, you can weather this storm and still win.",

Beryl is now the first tropical system to reach hurricane strength for the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season, and it's actually expected to intensify even more up to major hurricane status over the next day or so.Now, one of the things to note, though, is the average first second name storm usually doesn't occur until July 17th, and the average date of the first hurricane isn't usually until August 11th. So, Beryl is really kind of in very rare territory here, and one of the main reasons for that is how warm the sea surface temperatures are. On average, the location of Beryl is running about three to five degrees above average, and that may not seem like that much, but it's just enough to really allow storms like this to flourish in these very warm conditions. Also, two to note, it's very aware of where it developed. This far east of the Windward Islands early in to the season, say, for example, June is not very common. So, it's just that it's strengthened very quickly, but also the location in which it formed make this a very uncommon storm. Now, it's expected to make its way towards the Windward Islands over the next 12 to 24 hours. And by late Sunday or even early Monday, this storm is forecast to get to major hurricane strength as it makes its way into the Caribbean Sea. We already have watches and warnings in place for the Windward Islands, but several other locations may end up seeing some additional watches and warnings take place as the storm continues to track westward in the coming days.",

Look, we're almost a month to the day since President Biden, to great fanfare, announced this ceasefire plan, which he said Israel had signed off on and which Israel subsequently confirmed that it had indeed signed off on. The response from Hamas has been at best lukewarm.In fact, on Saturday, a spokesman for the militant group said that the proposals still fall short of its demands, which are for a complete cessation of hostilities and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces. Israel, for its part, even though it says it's fine with the wording of this proposal that President Biden announced about a month ago says that the agreement doesn't prevent it from fulfilling its two -- two of its main war objectives, which are to destroy Hamas' military and governance capabilities. And so, when you do have the two sides effectively insisting on things which are diametrically opposed to one another, Israel wanting to effectively destroy Hamas, Hamas effectively wanting to ensure its survival, then it's very hard to see how and where a breakthrough is going to come from. And so, we have this situation where almost nine months on these 120 hostages remain captive in Gaza, around a third of them believed to be dead. You've still got the war ongoing and the death toll rising in the Gaza Strip as well. And you also have these continued protests in Tel Aviv and across the country, demanding that the Israeli government do everything that it possibly can to bring those hostages home.

Eight months ago, CNN's Anna Coren reported from Afghanistan about one of the heartbreaking impacts of this misogyny, the surging rate of suicide among women. Well, now we have an update on what led one young Afghan girl to such despair and her second chance at life.Now, we just want to warn you this report concerning suicide may be upsetting to some viewers. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANNA COREN, CNN ANCHOR (voice-over):  Huddled on the floor over school books, 16-year-old Arzo meticulously copies the English sentences. Her neat cursive writing, a display of devotion to furthering her education. Learning new words makes me happy, she explains. But this scene was unthinkable just eight months ago when we first met Arzo in the same room on the outskirts of Karachi in Pakistan. Don't worry. You'll be fine, says her brother, kissing her hand. We are with you always. Arzo was bedridden, her skeletal frame wasting away. Every breath she took and movement she made causing unbearable pain. Arzo is from neighboring Afghanistan and it's there in her home in July of last year, she tried to kill herself.",

And that's why I drank battery acid convinced it would end my life. Arzo, seen here in pink in happier times, is one of countless Afghan girls who have attempted suicide, an alarming trend spreading across the country since the Taliban returned to power almost three years ago.

A call backed up by U.N. officials. RICHARD BENNETT, U.N. SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR ON HUMAN RIGHTS IN AFGHANISTAN:  The Taliban's institutionalized system of gender oppression established and enforced through its violations of women and girls' fundamental rights. It's widespread and systematic and amounting to crimes against humanity. COREN (voice-over):  But despite this powerful language, the U.N. has appeased the Taliban for this weekend's U.N. conference on Afghanistan in Doha, agreeing to its demands that women's rights are off the official agenda, guaranteeing its attendance for the very first time.

And it was a success. The animals became star attractions at zoos across the country, and several cubs were born. But in recent years, most of the pandas and their cubs have returned to China under the terms of the loan agreements. The last two pandas at the San Diego Zoo left in 2019. Three pandas at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. returned to China last year, leaving Atlanta, the only zoo at the time in the U.S. to still have pandas, and those are scheduled to leave too. The number of the furry envoys of friendship dwindled as relations between Washington and Beijing became less friendly. But last year, after a face-to-face meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden, Chinese President Xi Jinping suggested new pandas could be on their way. Their preservation, something both countries can agree on.
