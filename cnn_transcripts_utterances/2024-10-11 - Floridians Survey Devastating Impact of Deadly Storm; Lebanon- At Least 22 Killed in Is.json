Roughly 1,000 people have been rescued so far, and those search efforts are ongoing. Thousands of National Guard and hundreds of emergency crews have been deployed, with more help on the way. The storm blamed so far for at least 15 deaths. More than 2.6 million homes and businesses remain in the dark.

And how does it compare with what you've seen before? JONATHAN PETRAMALA, STORM CHASER: I'll tell you what. The lead-up to Hurricane Milton was probably the most frightening that I've seen, at least since Hurricane Irma here in this part of Florida, when they thought that that hurricane was going to come into the Gulf of Mexico and hook right back into Tampa Bay. Instead, of course, it went South, but it's just another close call. We thought it was going to be a worst-case scenario here where the storm surge was going to be catastrophic, and it was going to devastate just the entire Tampa Bay area. Fortunately, it went to the South for the Tampa Bay folks. But then you look further South. That's where I spent most of my day today, talking to people in, you know, the small communities just along the coast South of Siesta Key, where the majority, the most part of that storm surge went in. And you saw in that report just a second ago, the Hurricane Helene debris stacked up on the side of the road, is now strewn about. I was talking with homeowners today who were telling me we don't recognize anything in our yard. That's how chaotic it became. Because the officials just couldn't get through in time to pick up the debris from the previous hurricane, unfortunately, before Milton came in.

Hurricanes like the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, which is one of the strongest, if not the strongest to ever come ashore here in the continental United States. So, hurricanes have been around. They're always strong. But you have to imagine, with the environment that exists right now, you have very warm waters, which is like the battery that we use to charge our phones. That's the energy that these storms need to really produce and get strong. And we saw with Hurricane Milton just how quickly it was able to strengthen in that Category 5 status. Last year over in the Eastern Pacific, which is right along the Mexican coast. Hurricane Otis did the same thing, just rapidly strengthened, right before landfall, and devastated Acapulco. That was a storm that -- as someone who obviously goes in and tries to get ahead of these storms, we couldn't even make it in in time.

According to CNN's tally, the death toll from the storm has risen to 15 across six counties. Hours of fierce winds and heavy rains knocking down trees and power lines. And more than 2.6 million homes and businesses still without power across the state, according to PowerOutage.us. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis says nearly 1,000 people have been rescued since Milton made landfall. More than 100 animals have also been brought to safety. Now, the devastation from Hurricane Milton likely caused between $30 and $50 billion worth of insured losses. And that doesn't include losses that were not insured. And a lot of places in Florida aren't. The estimate comes from Fitch Ratings, one of the biggest credit agencies in the U.S. Virtually all climate scientists believe devastating storms like Milton are the result of human-caused climate change, but not everyone is convinced, as CNN's Bill Weir found. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): As Earth overheats, these are the kinds of storms that take lives and livelihoods. But as families reel in private grief, it's the material loss that is so obvious everywhere in Pinellas County: from the tower construction crane that crashed down on neighboring buildings, to Tropicana Field, peeled like an orange by Milton's winds. The Tampa Bay Rays already have plans in the works to build a new stadium, with taxpayers kicking in hundreds of millions of dollars.
