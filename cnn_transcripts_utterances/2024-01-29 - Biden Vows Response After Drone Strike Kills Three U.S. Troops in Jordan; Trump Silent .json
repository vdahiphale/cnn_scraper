But whether he will address the deadly attack on U.S. troops in Jordan is still unclear at the moment, right now, though, President Biden said to be still weighing his options on exactly how to respond. But there will be a response, he promised.Three U.S. service members were killed, dozens others injured. U.S. CENTCOM says the strike came from Syria, hitting near the living quarters at a military base known as Tower 22. The U.S. has not yet named a specific group responsible for that attack. CNN's Oren Lieberman is following this for us from the Pentagon. Oren, what can you tell us on the latest on the strike? And it's still a question as to exactly which group is responsible for this, correct?",

Now, if you look at another battlefield in Ukraine where drones have been used by both sides enormously, you've seen enormous progress over the course of this war, nearly two years, both in terms of the drone's capability, but also in terms of air defenses. But that, John, is a constant battle with constant adjustment over time, allowing drones that a month ago weren't able to evade certain air defenses to do so the next time around. The concern here right now as they investigate this is, was there a step along those lines, or was this an outlier? And that, of course, has implications going forward, because force protection for U.S. forces in the region at a number of bases, not just in Syria, is the primary priority at this point, and you could imagine going forward to avoid something like this being repeated.",

They have to respond, and they have to respond to a greater degree than they have in the past.To Oren's point, the outlier here is to strike Iranian targets inside Iranian territory. The concern there, that puts the U.S. directly, not necessarily at war, but certainly shooting at each other directly, and that poses a whole host of risks in terms of escalation. Now, you have options short of that, and beyond what you've seen so far. So, listen, and this is a judgment, John, that goes into it. When you attack, say, the base of an Iranian-backed militia, are you aiming for facilities or people or both? Do you intend to kill Iranian fighters in response to this? And this is a judgment they've made in the past, where they either attempt -- and, by the way, every attack has the risk of doing that, but do you attempt to avoid that, or do you make that part of the plan? That would be a step up, even if you don't strike Iranian territory per se, because there are a whole host of Iranian, not just Iranian-backed, say, fighters in Syria who are Syrian or in Iran who are Iraqi, but there are Iranian leaders and commanders based in those places, and that could specifically be your strike. Now, there's precedent here. You'll remember this, John, going back to the Soleimani strike, when the Trump administration ordered his assassination, the head of the IRGC, that was not on Iran. It was in Iraq while he was visiting Iraq, but certainly an Iranian target, a very senior leader. Of course, the Trump administration had a similar question there, whether that would lead to further escalation, and there was a whole host of concern about how Iran would strike back after the Soleimani assassination, none of which met the worst concerns at that point. It doesn't mean that's repeated, right, if you were to take a decision like that. But these attacks have been carried out before. The administration now has a choice as to how far they go.",
