Police have arrested a suspect in the killing of a healthcare CEO after he was spotted at a Pennsylvania McDonald's. The fall of Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian regime's prime minister, agrees to hand power to rebels. A former U.S. Marine charged over the chokehold death of a homeless man in New York is acquitted. And baseball boom. Superstar Juan Soto heads to the New York Mets in a deal reportedly worth $765 million. That conversation and plenty more coming up. But first, a court appearance is scheduled this hour for the suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. The suspect has been named 26-year-old Luigi Mangione, and we're told that this is a preliminary arraignment. It's going to happen near Altoona, Pennsylvania, and following that, in about 30 minutes, we expect a press briefing outside the courthouse. Of course, if that happens over the next hour, we will bring that to you. But according to police, the suspect was recognized by a worker in a McDonald's restaurant in Pennsylvania. And details of the suspect's background now emerging, as Brian Todd reports.

And I think it's absolutely critical that the United States maintain it's deployment, it's forced deployment in an effort to continue the counterterrorism campaign against ISIS. We've got to look to our friends, partners, and allies, the central government of Iraq, the Jordanians and the Israelis, and there's a certain degree of nervousness in all of those quarters. And I think in the end we're not going to be the driving force to rebuild Syria. It will cost billions. Clearly, the next administration and the president-elect has made his views clear in a couple of tweets, maybe that will change, maybe it won't. But I think Syria is going to have to rely on regional partners for funds. It's broke. It's indebted to the Iranians as a consequence of that asymmetrical relationship. There is oil in Syria. And that's going to require security and stability in order to develop those resources for the benefit of the Syrian people. Again, it really comes down to leadership and whether or not those who now are in positions of influence in power, largely Sunni Islamists, have a vision of Syria that's congruent with the wishes and aspirations of the majority of the Syrian people. And I don't think that's -- it's an extraordinary moment. I do not want to trivialize it, and I don't want to prejudge it, but it's going to be of a huge challenge creating the kind of political system, security, and ushering in prosperity that you know, 22, 23 million Syrians have long been denied.",

For more on this, let's bring in Brian Stelter. Brian, great to have you. So, what's next for Murdoch? Is this the type of thing that he can appeal, or what happens now? BRIAN STELTER, CNN CHIEF MEDIA ANALYST AND AUTHOR, \"NETWORK OF LIES\":  Yes, he can appeal this, and his lawyer told the New York Times that he does intend to appeal. But this is a huge setback for the family patriarch, the head of Fox News and Wall Street Journal, the guy who runs all of it, who really controls all of it, the 93-year-old Rupert Murdoch. The Times was the first to report on this sealed court ruling. I've confirmed that, yes, he did lose. That means that his children won. His children Prudence, Elizabeth, and James Murdoch were battling their father in court, trying to stop their dad from giving complete control of the companies to their brother, Lachlan. Lachlan is the more conservative son. He's currently in charge of these companies. He will remain in charge for the foreseeable future. But in the event of Rupert Murdoch's death, anything can happen. And what this commissioner in Nevada essentially said is, daddy doesn't necessarily know best. He doesn't get to blow up the trust that he wrote 25 years ago. It will come down to all four adult children in the event of Rupert's death to decide what to do about these assets.",

They could decide what to do. Now, people close to James Murdoch say he is not scheming to take over Fox News. He doesn't have a plan to moderate or liberalize Fox News, but we do know James Murdoch has donated to Biden and other Democrats. He's given to progressive causes, and I know from my reporting over the past five years, he is disturbed and disgusted by what airs on Fox News. He thinks the right-wing programming is hurting America. So, long-term, maybe James Murdoch will try to effect regime change. This Nevada ruling will help him do so because it stops his dad from changing the terms of the deal. As the source said to me this afternoon, this ruling eviscerated Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch. It said they were acting in bad faith by trying to blow up the terms of the family trust. I guess it's irrevocable for a reason. It cannot be revoked.

On Sunday night, it was amended to identify Jay-Z, whose real name is Shawn Carter, as that celebrity. JAY-Z, RAPPER:  You know what I'm saying -- SCANNELL (voice-over):  The rapper is accused of raping a 13-year-old girl at an after party following the MTV Video Music Awards in 2000. The woman alleges she was drugged and, according to the lawsuit, at that point Carter began removing plaintiff's clothes as she grew more and more disoriented. Then, the lawsuit alleges Jay-Z raped her while a female, identified as Celebrity B, watched. The lawsuit was brought by plaintiff's lawyer, Tony Buzbee, who has filed 20 lawsuits against Combs. Combs has vigorously denied any wrongdoing. The Texas lawyer said they contacted Jay-Z to try to resolve the matter through mediation before filing the lawsuit. Jay-Z denied the rape allegations, calling them heinous. He said the lawsuit followed an attempt at blackmail and said Buzbee is a deplorable human being. My heart and support goes out to true victims in the world who have to watch how their life story is dressed in costume for profitability by this ambulance chaser in a cheap suit. The musician, who is married to Beyonce, said his heartbreak is having to explain to his children the cruelty and greed of people. Buzbee responded on X saying, the alleged victim never demanded a penny from Jay-Z and accused the rapper of trying to bully them into silence. We will let the filing speak for itself and will litigate the facts in court, not in the media, he said. Kara Scannell, CNN, New York. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

A sugar rush, though, for Hershey investors. The candy giant up nearly 11 percent on a Bloomberg News report that Mondelez is considering a takeover after a failed bid eight years ago. Shares of Interpublic grew higher after agreeing to be bought out by rival Omnicom, a $13 billion deal that would create the world's largest ad agency. Omnicom shares falling 10 percent on that news. And taking a look at the broader markets in Asia, the Hang Seng rallied in late day trading after China promised bolder stimulus measures next year. The South Korean KOSPI fell more than 2.5 percent after its embattled president survived an impeachment vote. And in other business news, shares of A.I. chip giant NVIDIA fell two and a half percent in Monday's session. This is on word of a new shot fired in the U.S.-China tech wars. China opening an antitrust investigation into NVIDIA's purchase of an Israeli firm called Mellanox. All of this after the U.S. announced new tech restrictions against China last week.

So, I don't know that this is going to have a significant long-term impact for NVIDIA. And look, China is a big and important market for the company. But NVIDIA has already been restricted in terms of the advanced A.I. technology that it can sell to China. And as NVIDIA has grown, we've seen that the total share of sales that China contributes to the company has been shrinking. I think the way to view this as part of this larger U.S.-China tech trade war that we've seen escalating in the past few years, we've seen the Biden administration and the Chinese government sort of trading these jabs. Just last week, the Biden administration implemented its third round of tech chip sales restrictions on China, this time on high-tech memory chips. China retaliated by restricting the sales of some manufacturing materials that are needed to make chips at this time, when we know the U.S. government is trying to boost domestic chip manufacturing. Now, it makes sense to me that the Chinese government would go after NVIDIA. This is sort of the golden child of the U.S. tech industry at this point, and we'll see how this develops if it escalates. But China still needs NVIDIA. This is a company that, you know, continues to outstrip rivals in terms of its ability to build A.I. technology. And even though it can't sell its most advanced A.I. chips to China, it sells them an approved version that gets around those export restrictions. You have to imagine that China isn't going to want to lose the opportunity to buy that technology. Rahel.",

You know, what I guess is really interesting is that in the World Series, that we've just watched, which the Dodgers won, Soto and the Yankees went up against Shohei Ohtani. Just last year, Ohtani made the move from the Angels to the Dodgers. He probably didn't even have to sell his house because he was staying in L.A. and he got that massive bump to the $700 million contract. And now, a very similar thing happening just 12 months later with Soto moving, as you say, just a matter of miles across New York for this huge, huge payday. So, a lot of excitement in New York, a lot of excitement in baseball. He has already won the World Series before with the Nationals a few years ago, so he's a very, very established player.
