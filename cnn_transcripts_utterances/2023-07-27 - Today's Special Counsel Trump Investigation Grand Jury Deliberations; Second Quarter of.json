Any time that they gather in the courthouse at this point they could be asked to approve an indictment, specifically one against the Former President Donald Trump. That's because 11 days ago, Donald Trump got the target letter from the Justice Department indicating to him that he was very likely to be charged. You're right. The grand jury was not in earlier this week. They met a couple of times last week and saw a couple of different witnesses that they had spoken to throughout the day who gave them testimony. But now we are still waiting to see what happened. Our own Casey Gannon is over there watching the courthouse. She has seen not only the grand juries coming in to that secret proceeding convening this morning, but also, she's seen a person working with the special counsel's office over there at the courthouse.And so now, we watch to see what else might come today. Will there be other witnesses? Who else could the special counsel's office even want to talk to still for this grand jury? There have been so many witnesses that have gone in, John, including Mike Pence, the former vice president under Trump. Many different top people from his White House such as his Chief of Staff Mark Meadows. Cassidy Hutchinson, that star witness at the House Select Committee hearings. Pat Cipollone, his White House counsel. And then that doesn't even include the fake electors who have testified, the state officials who have spoken to the special counsel's office.

Remember, Mitch McConnell is 81 years old, who walks with a slight limp, is a survivor of polio from time as a child. Has had issues walking for much of his life and it's been more pronounced this the year.There have been at least three instances that we know of this year through our reporting in some and the one, a very public one, that occurred back in March when he fell and he hit his head, suffered a concussion, broke some ribs, he was out from the Senate for six weeks. But there are two other incidents that happened as well. One from -- in February when he was traveling overseas with a U.S. delegation to meet with the president of Finland. As he was getting out of his car walking, it was a bit of a snowy day, I was told, he slipped and fell. He was not injured. He walked and you see him brushed himself off, he didn't seek any immediate medical attention there and continued on with his meeting. And then we -- that major incident that I referred to in March that we know about. And then later the -- another one that occurred just this month, or over this month, when he was getting off the plane at Reagan National Airport. He was walking off the plane and he did fall as well, I am told. Now, that -- after that incident, he returned to the Capitol and continued his work day. Now, this all came before the incident we saw yesterday in which Senator McConnell was at his press conference, made some remarks, and then suddenly froze for some time. And then came back and later answered questions, including one from myself asking him what happened there. He said that he is fine. He later told reporters again that he is fine but he has not yet explained what happened yesterday exactly. What was the actual root cause of the reason why he froze and whether that had anything to do with that fall from earlier this year, any other lingering health issues. The -- his office had said that he felt lightheaded, which is the reason why he stepped aside at yesterday's press conference. But no doubt questions continue to persist about the 81-year-old Republican leader. He says he's fine, but also how long will he stay as Republican leader and as -- in his seat as his term expires at the end of 2026, and he's Republican leader until the end of this Congress.

The judge telling both sides about the prosecution and Biden's team. They need to do work. They need to -- they have 30 days to file legal briefs on this.And there were a couple of issues that she really honed in on, on these agreements. Remember there are two agreements. One was for the tax misdemeanor charge, that was the plea agreement where he would plead guilty to those two charges. Now, she had questions about the scope of immunity included in that and really poked holes through it, revealing a disagreement between the prosecution and Biden's team. So, she wanted them to really solidify what was covered in that. You know, in part because she told Hunter Biden, you know, she knew he was eager to wrap this up, but she also wanted to make sure what he was pleading guilty to. That he understood the terms of those deals. So, that'll be something that they were hammering out in court yesterday. Limiting the immunity in this deal to just the tax charges, gun charges and drug use charges. Not a blanket immunity from everything that the government had been looking for the five years that they were investigating Hunter Biden. But also, she had questions about the gun diversion, that was this deal where Hunter Biden would essentially avoid prosecution for possessing a gun while he was addicted to a controlled substance. He's been very public about his struggles with cocaine and other substance abuse. So, in that deal, the judge had questions about the constitutionality of it. So, she wants legal briefings on that issue of whether she should play a role in this. She said most of the time needs diversion agreements are between the parties, but the -- both sides said that they wanted to give her a role in case there was a dispute over whether he breached it because she would be a neutral arbiter. She was saying she's not sure as someone in the judicial branch that she should have a role in an executive branch function. So, she wanted some legal briefings on that, saying she wasn't comfortable approving this deal if it wasn't constitutionally sound. In some ways this is -- it could be good news for Hunter Biden to make sure that this deal is solidified and couldn't be challenged if there is a change in administration. But certainly, it is not where they expect it to be. So, 30 days to file the briefs and then we'll see if the judge brings everyone back in here or if she rules on the papers. John.",

Judge Noreika set the case brought by the owner of a computer repair shop to Delaware superior court.As for her political spending, it's been bipartisan. According to records, she's donated more than $15,000 to candidates dating back to 1999. In 2008, she gave $1,000 to Hillary Clinton's quest to become Democratic presidential nominee, but later donated $2,300 to the 2008 Republican Nominee John McCain. And she stuck with the Republicans in 2012, giving $2,500 to Mitt Romney's White House bid.

I thought it was really important that the judge identified that there had not been a true meeting of the minds about what immunity he was being given.And that's really important because if there hasn't been a meeting of the minds then Hunter Biden could later come back and say his plea was not knowing and voluntary and he could seek to withdraw it. Or if the government sought to prosecute him for crimes that he thought he was getting protected for but they didn't think he was, then there could be an argument that such prosecutions were barred by the terms of the plea agreement. So, I thought it was really important that the judge identified that issue. So, it looked like by the end of the hearing, they had a meeting of the minds. Now, they have to have that reflected in the agreement. On the other issue she identified which was whether or not she could play a role with respect to whether or not he had satisfied the conditions of the deferred prosecution agreement for the gun charge, that's something they're going to have to brief for her to her satisfaction. If they want to stick with that term, she raised a constitutional question based on separation of powers. They may not be able to address that to her satisfaction.
