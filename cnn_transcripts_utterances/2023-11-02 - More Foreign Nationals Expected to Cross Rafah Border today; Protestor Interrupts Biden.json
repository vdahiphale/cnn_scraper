He did say, though, that more Americans would be able to leave today and in the next days and that the State Department had communicated directly with American citizens in Gaza so that they would be ready to go. There was also confirmation from President Biden himself. He wrote Wednesday on X that the U.S. had secured safe passage for wounded Palestinians and for foreign nationals to exit Gaza. And we're expecting some American citizens to exit right away, with more departing over the next coming days. How many Americans were stuck in Gaza, you may ask? Well, at a Senate Appropriations Committee hearing, Secretary of State Blinken said there were approximately 400 plus their families, about a thousand people in total. He also said that there are about 5,000 other third-country nationals in Gaza who want to get out, as well -- Poppy, Phil.",

So the president really extending what U.S. officials have already said, which is that they would like to see Israel engage in a humanitarian pause to get aid into Gaza and also to get these hostages out of Gaza. But they have always been very, very careful about using the term cease-fire, saying cease-fire, and even implying at all that they are telling Israel what to do and how to conduct its military operations. So what President Biden said last night was really an extension of what we have been hearing from U.S. officials, but again, it underscores how politically difficult this is for the president. That happening at a campaign fundraiser in Minneapolis. And also the president reminding the crowd that this is a complicated conflict, that Hamas is a terrorist organization, and also noting that he is the guy that got aid into Gaza. So making quite a few points there: one, that this is all very fast- developing and ongoing. But also, that he is the person to talk to these loaders and try to arrange for aid to get into Gaza and also work to get those hostages out of Gaza.

Under the General's leadership, the Hoosiers won three national championships, including the undefeated 1976 season, which remains the last men's college basketball team to not lose a game all season. Knight also led the USA to a gold medal, coaching Michael Jordan and the rest of the men's basketball team at the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles. After 29 years, Knight's behavior on and off the court strained his relationship with the administration at Indiana University. In May of 2000, Knight was placed on a zero-tolerance policy after CNN aired a video of a practice, three years earlier, where it appeared Knight placed his hand on the neck of a player named Neil Reed.
