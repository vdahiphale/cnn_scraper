And later, candidate Trump promised to let Robert F. Kennedy Jr. go wild on health. The question tonight, will that include going after the vaccine that nearly wiped polio off the face of the earth? Good evening. John Berman here in for Anderson. And though there is still no definitive answer as to what is with all the large drones people in New Jersey and other nearby states think they are spotting in the skies at night, at least one Jersey locality is being told that if one happens to fall from the sky to handle it with care, extreme care, as in call the county bomb squad. That is what Michael Melham told us. He is the mayor of Belleville, just North of Newark. He says, that advice, which his emergency coordinator shared with him after recent state level meetings, also included this item. Local fire departments, he says, were told to wear hazmat suits when they respond. As we said, it's not just New Jersey anymore. There have now been spotting in New York and Connecticut where state police have just set up a drone detection system, and Maryland. Take a look at this. This is footage from the former governor, Larry Hogan, who lives about 45 miles south of Baltimore. He says he saw what appeared to be dozens of large drones in the sky for about 45 minutes, starting at about quarter to ten last night. He says people are clamoring for answers from the government, but are not, he says, getting any, a notion the White House today acknowledged. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ADM. JOHN KIRBY (RET), COORDINATOR FOR STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS AT THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL:  I wish I could tell you exactly why we don't have an answer for you here in the afternoon on the 13th of December, but I can tell you that we are working on it very, very hard to know because we want to answer those questions the same as those folks in New Jersey want answers -- (END VIDEO CLIP)",

You might see a drone overhead. First, though, CNN chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst John Miller and Juliette Kayyem, CNN senior national security analyst and former assistant DHS secretary. So, John, you think we'd get a little more from Secretary Mayorkas. They've deployed teams, they've deployed technology. They have no confirmed drone sightings. They have some airplanes and some maybe drones, but really no definitive answer as to exactly what they are, exactly what people are seeing.

But beyond that, there was no definitive this-is-what-people-are- seeing. So one of the concerns people have is, is transparency.How would you rate the level of transparency now were getting from DHS? JULIETTE KAYYEM, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Well, I think the administration was a little slow in picking up how social media and how all of us, how people respond to this, especially since it's been going on in November. I also think John Kirby was a little bit more ambiguous than when Secretary Mayorkas comes on a couple of hours later and basically was, no pun intended, shooting it down. I mean, he basically was saying everything that we can see now has an explanation. The best way the people -- viewers can understand this is, is for those of us who are in the water or surfers or whatever, there's an app that shows shark activity and it's a sort of crowdsourced app. And so everyone says, oh, there's a shark and there's a shark and there's a shark. And then you realize all of a sudden people are just reporting that there's sharks in the water, right? And Mayorkas is basically saying there are drones in the sky. And now that we're all looking at it, people are seeing more drones. I'm not saying he's accurate or that that, as John rightly put, some of these drones are over areas you don't want them to be. But I was surprised how adamant Mayorkas was finally. And I do want to say something about the president-elect. We have strict rules on shooting down things in the air for a variety of reasons of most local and state and certainly the private sector can't do it. The public ought not to do it. So I don't know how to understand his message. It sort of suggests that the public should try to do it. You don't do it because the debris lands on homes and people, and it's a very dangerous response. So, shooting them down is not a response. But if there is more to learn, certainly it should be disclosed.",

But I think there is also the FBI, then opens an investigation into the drones out of the Newark office. So there's a lot of arms of the government. The White House is saying we have no evidence to suggest that its foreign or a threat to public safety. And I think in the local government, to get to the core of your question, they're kind of taking a step back and saying, you know what, let the Feds answer this. And then the question is, is it a foreign incursion? That could be less likely Is it the Department of Defense red teaming some of these spaces to test their reaction time and trying to keep a lid on it so it remains effective?

They send it to the New York office. The New York office sends it to a violent crime squad, where you have a mix of FBI agents and NYPD officers who were task forcing together and they look at it and they do a workup on the name, you know, checking, you know, any indicators that that guy has been in New York, and then they send it over to NYPD. So it gets into the NYPD officers at the FBI on Saturday, they do their work up. It gets into the NYPD on Sunday, and then it joins 200 viable leads that are being worked by that team. But then Monday morning at 9:15 in the McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania, another tip leads to the capture. So, you see, these leads are piling up, being tasked out and being worked.

Under New York law, if you have an intentional murder, you start at second degree only under certain circumstances does it get bumped up to first degree, most of which are not applicable here. But there's one that might be that I'll talk about in a second.So some of the factors that can bump it up to first degree, if your victim is a judge, if your victim is a cop, if your victim is a first responder, if there's torture involved, if it's a murder for hire. The one that I do think might give a hook, maybe, to bump it up to first degree is if it's a terroristic act, meaning if the purpose is to intimidate a civilian population, or if the purpose is to try to influence a government agency or government policy. So if we look at some of the rantings about the healthcare system, there may be an argument there. I wouldn't do that if I was a prosecutor, because you're making your own job that much harder. You have a second degree murder, intentional murder. The evidence seems overwhelming on that point, so I wouldn't want to go out on a limb, but that would be if they wanted to try to ratchet it up to first degree, that would be the way they might try.",

After Hegseth was announced, after a bunch of these Cabinet appointees were announced, they were -- or nominees were announced, they were not permitted to go on television. And that essentially left them with their hands tied behind their back. In the case of Hegseth, he had -- and basically a death or near death by a thousand cuts. There had been just one negative headline after another alleging problematic behavior across a broad spectrum. Trump told Hegseth, fine, go out and fight and let's see if we can get past this. Hegseth gave an interview to Megyn Kelly, his mother, who had written him a 2018 email describing him as behaving poorly toward women over a long period of time, also gave an interview.

And as -- I'm not only -- you know, we've been talking about COVID vaccines for years now. I not only make vaccines, but I'm also a pediatrician, and I've taken care of children with congenital rubella syndrome. So the MMR, the R part stands for rubella. It's devastating, right? It's microcephaly, it's cataracts, it's horrific heart disease and pneumonitis. I've taken care of kids with pertussis. It's called whooping cough because the Bordetella pertussis bacterium literally destroys the airways with a toxin in the child, and in desperation to catch some oxygen, gives a big whoop of inspiration. I've taken care of kids intubated with measles. I've held the hand of parents who've watched their child die of Hib meningitis.

And we're not being out there enough, really countering the anti-vaccine rhetoric. And there is no relationship with any of these vaccines and autism. And that's why I get so frustrated with people like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. He keeps on switching up what his actual assertions are. You know, he - it came out in 1998, there was a false claim that the measles, mumps, rubella, MMR vaccine was the cause of autism. That was a paper that was retracted by The Lancet, the British medical journal, or was published. But not only that, the scientific community did large studies with hundreds and thousands of kids to show that kids who got the MMR vaccine were no more likely to acquire autism than kids who didn't. That should have been the end of it. Then Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in 2005 wrote an article in Rolling Stone magazine, also co-published in Salon, claiming, OK, it's not the MMR vaccine, it's the thimerosal preservative that used to be in vaccine. Once again, the scientific community spent a lot of resources and energy to disprove it. OK, then it was spacing vaccines too close together. Once again, we had to counter it. Then it was alum in vaccines. Then they said, OK, let's switch it up to the HPV vaccine for cervical cancer and other cancers that's causing infertility and autoimmunity, they claim. There was total BS. There was no basis for it. Now they're saying it's something called chronic disease. So this is the modus operandi and we've got to put a stop to it.",
