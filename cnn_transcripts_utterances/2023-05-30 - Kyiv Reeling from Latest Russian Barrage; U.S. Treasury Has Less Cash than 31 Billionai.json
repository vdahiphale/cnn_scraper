More than 30drones were fired at the Ukrainian city, before dawn, Ukraine says it shot most of them down after killing one person, in an apartment building. This is the 17th attack on the Ukrainian capital just this month. Russia stepping up its bombardment, as Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he now has a date for Ukraine's highly anticipated counteroffensive. Meantime in an unusual sight, the war apparently going to the heart of Russia. Smoke, here rising over Moscow after Russian officials say they shot down eight drones. They report minor injuries and minor damage in residential areas. Now the Russian defense ministry, is blaming Ukraine, calling this a terrorist attack. Ukraine denies being directly involved. CNN's Clare Sebastian following all of this from London. Let's pick apart what we know at this, point a lot going on here. What do we know about these drones, fired at residential areas of Moscow? We have not seen this before in this war. Who is responsible, at this point? What more do we know?",

They are also saying, as you said, they shot down all eight of those drones. Five of them actually were shot, down three of them they say they took down using electronic countermeasures. But still had to activate their air defenses. Three residential buildings were named by state media, two of them in the southwest of Moscow, one on the outskirts of the town near the Vnukovo airport. We're also hearing from a Russian MP, who named a few locations where he said drones were shot down, in the Rublyovka area in southwest Moscow, a very elite suburb not far from the president's official country residence of Novo-Ogaryovo. So that is potentially significant. Something to watch there as well. President Putin, who was in the Kremlin at the time according to a spokesperson, we're getting the first comments from him. He's taking a somewhat familiar path, taking the accusations that tend to be leveled against Russia with good reason and turning them back on Ukraine. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VLADIMIR PUTIN, PRESIDENT OF RUSSIA (through translator):  Kyiv chose the path of intimidation of Russian citizens and attacks on residential buildings. It is a clear sign of terrorist activity. The Moscow air defense system worked satisfactorily. However, there is still work to be done to make it better. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

This is the exact, video that I'm talking. About showcasing Western weapons on display. They're HIMARS Leopard tanks, things like that, saying the time has come to take back what's ours. So they are letting the suspense, build about this counteroffensive. Of course we, see as well, actions in the field, an increase in strikes on Russian military installations, far behind the front lines. Mariupol, Berdyansk, Russian occupied cities, within Ukraine. These are something that military analysts interpret as a shaping, softening operations, probing Russian defenses ahead of this upcoming counteroffensive. So it would seem we are getting closer.",

Republicans, some of, them feel there is not enough cuts to spending in this agreement that was hammered out between President Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. This afternoon, there will be a key test for this agreement, as the House Rules Committee is set to hold a hearing to consider this measure. At least two Republicans on that committee have already said they oppose the bill. So right now they are watching to see whether there will be any further Republican -- removal -- or Republicans who oppose that bill and whether that might solve this piece of legislation, in that committee. On the Democratic side, we have heard from progressives, who are very visibly frustrated, with the fact that this bill includes tougher work requirements for some recipients of food stamps. The White House has argued to them, they need to think about what isn't in the bill. The fact that the White House was able to keep even tougher work requirements for other social safety net programs like Medicaid. President Biden, has said he feels very good about the prospects of this. Bill but it is clear that the next few days, will be very challenging as they are eyeing a vote in the House tomorrow. And then, the bill would still need to make its way over to the, Senate where any one senator could stall proceedings.

The vast majority of people in Kosovo are  ethnic Albanians. But there is a majority Serb population in a handful of municipalities, mostly in the northern part of Kosovo. So a decade ago, Kosovo and Serbia actually agreed. They agreed again earlier this year to something similar, to basically make these regions semiautonomous. But that has never actually been implemented on the ground. So last month during local elections, ethnic Serbs in that area boycotted local elections. You can imagine what happened next. You get a whole bunch of ethnic Albanian mayors that were elected there. So last week you started to see Serbian protesters, ethnics Serb protesters, blocking those mayors from trying to even get in the buildings they had been elected to serve. Now obviously, things have escalated. You have differing stories between what the Serbian defense, officials are saying and what Italians are saying as well; 30 NATO peacekeepers, according to the force called K4 had been injured here, sustaining burns and broken bones and trauma wounds because of these incendiary devices.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN REPORTER (voice-over):  Outside of jail near Tehran, families of prisoners gathered chant, \"Do not hang them.\" Their pleas come as Iran resumes the execution of protesters after a months-long hiatus. The brutal practice restarted this month with the hanging of three young men accused of killing three members of the security forces during antigovernment protests in November. The news sparked more demonstrations. But activist and human rights groups say the allegations against the trio are baseless. Majid Kazemi was forced to watch video of interrogators torturing his brother and he was subjected to at least 15 mock executions according to Amnesty International. In an audio note obtained by the organization, he maintained his innocence. CNN cannot independently verify the clip. \"They kept beating me and ordering me to say, 'This weapon is mine,'\" he says. \"I told them I would say whatever they wanted, just please leave my family alone.\" Before his execution, the family of 36-year-old Saleh Mirhashemi, a karate coach from Isfahan, tried to draw attention to his plight. This picture of his father spread on social media. \"My son is innocent,\" the sign reads. But to no avail, activists shared this heartbreaking video they say is Mirhashemi's dad, hugging his picture as he lay by his son's grave. Iran has not responded to CNN's request for comment. The total number of demonstrators known to have been executed since last year now stands at seven, according to CNN reporting and more executions are likely imminent. \"Over 100 protesters have been sentenced to death or are facing charges punishable by death,\" says this human rights activist. MAHMOOD AMIRY-MOGHADDAM, DIRECTOR, IRAN HUMAN RIGHTS NGO:  When authorities fear protests or right after protests, number of executions go up.
