Well we start in Gaza with reports of heavy fighting on the ground mass exodus and mass casualties. Gaza's Ministry of Health says more than 35,000 Palestinians have been killed in the now shattered enclaves since the start of the war. A U.N. Agency for Palestinian refugees says at least 360,000 people have fled the city of Rafah as Israel ordered evacuations of more neighborhoods there. People are also fleeing the Jabalya refugee camp in Northern Gaza against a background of Israeli gunfire and explosions. This is Israel marks Memorial Day to remember its fallen soldiers -- ceremony. Earlier Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that the current war was a choice between Israel and the quote monsters of Hamas. CNN's Jeremy Diamond is live for you from Jerusalem, Alex Marquardt joining us this hour from Washington. And Alex, let me start with you. Antony Blinken, the Secretary of State at spoke with the Israeli Defense Minister, Yoav Gallant on Sunday. As we understand it, reaffirming the U.S. opposition to a major ground operation in Rafah. What do we understand we the details of that conversation and -- has is being reported. Is this effectively, the strongest warning yet?",

And this has been a series of the strongest warnings yet by the U.S. to Israel, not just saying we don't want you to go into Rafah in a major way, we still need to see a plan. But now you have this threat on the table by the Biden administration to cut off weaponry for a Rafah operation. Obviously, there's been a huge uproar within Israel, but also among supporters of Israel here in the United States. And for the past few days, you've had top Biden administration officials essentially defending themselves against these allegations. That they are cutting off Israel or leaving Israel high and dry, saying we simply don't want these American weapons to be used in Rafah. More than a million people these officials point out have been told to go to Rafah to seek shelter from elsewhere in Gaza. Now they're being told to move again to places that don't have much support. But there are two main reasons now that the Biden administration -- Biden administration is saying that Israel should not mount this major operation. First, because there's no plan to move the civilians and there could be major civilian casualties, but also because the Biden administration doesn't think that an Israeli operation into Rafah. The kind that they're talking about would actually be all that effective in removing Hamas from Rafah and really dismantling Hamas altogether in Gaza. Take a listen to what Secretary Blinken had to say yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAHER AL-RABAIA, DISPLACED FROM RAFAH: We are tired and lost. We don't know where to go and --",

So Blinken here is saying more and more that there needs to be bigger conversations about the day after governance of the Gaza Strip.

And in addition to Rafah where the Israeli military is kind of inching closer to the center of the city, trying to avoid it seems crossing that red line that President Biden set last week. We're also seeing intensified fighting in northern Gaza and the Jabalya refugee camp where Israeli forces had withdrawn from several months ago. They are now going back in there because of that power vacuum that, Alex, is talking about there, which is the fact that Hamas fighters have now once again returned to that Jabalya refugee camp and Israeli forces say that they are going in there to route them once again very intense shelling and gunfire has been reported in the area of Jabalya.

Schools are all underground, for example, but most analysts will tell you that it is not so much about that there are more immediate goals here. One, as President Zelenskyy noted in his overnight address is to draw Ukrainian forces and attention away from the Donetsk region where Russia has been making its biggest push in recent months since the capture of Avdiivka in mid-February. And the second is to try to expand or create a buffer zone on the border to prevent these relentless attacks that they now see across the border, mainly into the Belgorod region on the Russian side of the border. So essentially to try to push Ukrainian forces further away from the border, so they can't shell Belgorod as easily. Of course, Russia is now blaming Ukraine for an attack on a residential building in Belgorod on Sunday, which they say now, has killed at least 15 people. This is also another piece of evidence of the fundamental landscape shift that was caused by that delay in U.S. aid reaching Ukraine.

Then, of course, the full scale invasion before that he was a government minister since 1991. So it doesn't really get much more, veteran than that. So this is definitely a sign of Putin perhaps cleaning house. There was just a corruption scandal at the defense ministry, affecting a really top aide to show your deputy defense minister. There is also potentially a sign of Putin tightening his grip on power as he enters his fifth time. But I think you really have to look closely at the nominated successor Andrei Belousov. He's an economist. He is a sort of rather gray suited individual who's already been up in Parliament today, talking about improving conditions, payments, hospital treatments for servicemen. But I think, the thinking here and certainly if you pass Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin Spokesman comments is that this is really about tightening the links between the economy and the war really trying to ensure that supply chain of weapons and troops is sustainable and that there is this firm hand to manage the sheer level of spending that is now happening for this war 6.7 percent of GDP, said Dmitry Peskov in a rare admission by the Kremlin.

One of the witnesses we already heard from though in this trial said he was the fixer because he would break things and then have to fix them. It'll be interesting. A lot of people will be watching, I think how Donald Trump reacts to Michael Cohen's testimony, and the prosecution has set him up as someone who is challenging. He's a challenging witness, but he is, key here for the prosecution, Becky, because what he needs to do and what the prosecution has been trying to do, in putting their case out there with all this various witness testimony over the last several weeks is they need Michael Cohen to tie it all together. They need him to show that Donald Trump was in fact a part of this idea to cover up those hush money payments and the reimbursement to Michael Cohen, who paid that $130,000 to Stormy Daniels ahead of the election. But they need to show that Donald Trump was part of this plan to then cover up the reimbursement to Michael Cohen as legal fees, not as reimbursement for that hush money payment. I should point out that the prosecution even in their opening statement, Becky, they were very clear about knowing who they're dealing with here. Michael Cohen is a guy who has credibility issues, he's gone to jail, he lied to Congress, he's a convicted liar, and you're going to hear a lot of that from the defense as well. What they send their opening statement, though, is that Michael Cohen made those payments at and this is, key for their case, the defendant's direction, according to the prosecution, and that he did it to influence the presidential election. So we'll see what he has in terms of the goods there Becky and the receipts, if you will, to make that connection. This is day one. We're expecting Michael Cohen to be on the stand for a couple of days. So you can expect a lot of discussion about this.",

And at that time, it's called as the best performing open source model out there when it launched.

And that was to further prove to ourselves can we do it. Since that time, there have been few key decisions that we have made in the country. One, we've announced the launch of the Falcon foundation to clearly cement our dedication and our commitment to open source. So that's like the Linux Foundation.

I'm Erica Hill in New York, the man who signed the check who got themoney to Stormy Daniels expected to take the stand any minute now in this historic criminal trial. The prosecution star witness Michael Cohen arriving at court a short time ago, the judge has actually just called for the jury to be brought into the courtroom. Michael Cohen, of course, is, key here. He's the prosecution's key witness and -- does he have a lot of history with Donald Trump. He was once his lawyer and self-described fixer. He's also the person who made that $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels to cover up that alleged sexual encounter with Donald Trump. That payment of course happened in the final days of the 2016 presidential campaign. Donald Trump, for his part maintains there was no sex with Stormy Daniels. Let's get some analysis here as to what we can expect today in court from Former State and Federal Prosecutor, David Weinstein, David, good to see you as always. Michael Cohen has a really important job here for the prosecution. He has to tie all these threads together. And he has to show that Donald Trump was in on this that Donald Trump do exactly what they were doing when reimbursing Michael Cohen for making that $130,000 payment and saying that that reimbursement was not in fact for the hush money payment. But that it was for legal fees and retainers for Michael Cohen. What is the sense that he's going to be able to do that? DAVID WEINSTEIN, FORMER STATE &amp; FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: Well, you're exactly right, Erica, he has to tie it all together. Look, we know the payments were made. We heard testimony last week from Stormy Daniels that there was an affair, whether the jury chooses to believe that or not, it's up to them. She did very well on cross examination. The checks had been signed, they were submitted, you know, the defense is contending they were in fact for legal fees. They were not as reimbursement for the hush money payments. So that is why Michael Cohen is such an important witness. He's testified before in other proceedings, he's pled guilty to the same crimes. He is however, a witness who is a convicted felon and whom the defense is labeled as someone who is a liar. And who will bend the truth. So it suits his, own means all of that is fine. The question is which version of Michael Cohen does this jury believe? Do they believe someone who was on the inside, who knew exactly what had taken place and who could provide that linchpin to show that the former president was part of the decisions, knew the decisions that were being made, signed those checks and knew exactly what they were for? So quite frankly, it all comes down to the cross examination. The testimony that's going to come in today, indirect is going to be about all the warts and lumps and bruises on Michael Cohen and who he is, and the prosecution is going to embrace him. How does he survive on cross? That's the bigger question.",

Someone who is still upset has an unhealthy obsession, they say with the former president, and was upset about not getting a job in Donald Trump's administration in 2017. So they're going to -- be that's going to be their angle, right, the way that the defense is going to go in. There was a lot made of the cross examination of Stormy Daniels. A number of legal experts I spoke to said it went on a little too long. Is that also a risk for the defense when it comes to the cross examination of Michael Cohen?",

And then after a while, all that happens is thejury hears from the witness who's being cross examined, reinforcing whatever it is they testified to, and you gave them another opportunity to say, no, they're telling the truth, and you're just picking on them. I don't think anybody's going to think they're picking on Michael Cohen. But he needs to keep his cool and the defense needs to go far enough to show that he is self-motivated, that he will say what he needs to say to save his own skin and that he can't stand the defendant who's on trial here. But if they beat on him too long, they're going to lose traction. It's not going to be as effective. So they need to be very surgical about what they ask, when they ask and how long they asked him?",

There was though at least one arrest according to \"The New York Times\", I want to show you a video from Pomona College in Southern California where according to \"The New York Times\", there was a skirmish there that led to at least one arrest and they famously moved their graduation ceremony 30 miles away from the center of campus. We also saw what happened to Jerry Seinfeld, a famous comedian at Duke University, he spoke at their commencement address, there were a few dozen Palestinian protesters that walked out during his ceremony over the weekend, and of course, at UC Berkeley, there was also a brief pause in the Commencement there.
