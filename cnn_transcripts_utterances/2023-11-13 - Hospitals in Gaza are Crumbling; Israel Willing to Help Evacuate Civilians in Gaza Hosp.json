Just ahead, Gaza's hospitals are collapsing under the weight of war. With electricity and supplies running out, doctors say there is little they can do to save the most vulnerable patients.Washington is once again staring down a government shutdown with less than a week left to reach a deal and keep the government open. And Iceland braces for potential disaster, a state of emergency now in effect as the nation faces the threat of a volcanic eruption. Thanks for being with us and we begin in the Middle East where the medical situation in Gaza is growing even more dire by the hour as Israel steps up its war against Hamas. Israeli forces say they went deeper into Gaza City on Sunday, reaching the outskirts of the Al- Shati refugee camp and conducting raids in multiple areas. The IDF says it has arrested 20 alleged Hamas's members, including some accused of taking part in the October 7 attacks on Israel. Meantime, multiple hospitals in Gaza are closing due to airstrikes and lack of fuel. Health officials and aid agencies say patients, staff, and thousands of displaced civilians are trapped inside Gaza's biggest hospital, Al-Shifa, due to fighting nearby. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MOHAMMED ZAQUOT, DIRECTOR-GENERAL OF HOSPITALS IN THE PALESTINIAN TERRITORY (through translation):  Garbage and medical waste are piling up in Al-Shifa Hospital, and there's no water available in the hospital wards or toilets.

It said the two leaders talked about the war in Gaza, including Qatari brokered efforts to free the hostages. Mr. Biden said he hopes for a future where Israelis and Palestinians can live side by side. But he added that, quote, \"Hamas has long been an impediment to that outcome.\" Well, Israel says it's now in talks with the U.S. about a long-term plan for Gaza, and the Israeli ambassador to the U.S. is making clear Israel expects the Palestinians will govern themselves. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MICHAEL HERZOG, ISRAELI AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S:  We are not in Gaza in order to occupy Gaza or to govern Gaza. We are there to remove the Hamas military threat against Israel and their ability to rebuild their capabilities and strike again and again as they are saying they would like to do. That's our intent. Long term, we have a lot of -- we put a lot of thinking into that and we are entering a dialogue with the U.S. administration about that. We understand it is our position that Palestinians will have to govern themselves. What will be the exact role of the Palestinian Authority remains to be seen because everybody understands that the PA in its current composition, they can hardly govern Ramallah, so certainly not Gaza.

So far, however, Biden has absolutely refused to use that leverage and has only pushed for much more insignificant measures that will not make a significant difference on the situation.Certainly, it's not going to alleviate the suffering, nor is it going to get the release of the hostages. And at the same time, this status quo, this approach, will further increase the risk of the conflict spreading and potentially involving Hezbollah in Lebanon, Iraqi militias, as well as potentially Iran.

There was a very large number of the people who were attacked that were civilians and taking hostages, taking children hostages, these are all war crimes and they should be condemned and they were by the world. But what followed, this indiscriminate bombing of civilians, the complete destruction of large parts of Gaza. Talk by Israeli cabinet ministers of a new Nakba, a new disaster, you know, essentially the ethnic cleansing that took place in the formation of Israel.All of this has caused Israel to be completely isolated in the world on this issue. When you take a look at what happened in the United Nations General Assembly, resolution calling for a ceasefire was supported by more than 120 countries. Only 14 countries voted with Israel and the United States. The United States was the country that vetoed the resolution, calling for humanitarian pause introduced by Brazil, the same measure that Biden now supports. This has cost Israel tremendously internationally. It is also costing the United States tremendously internationally. Just take a look at the large protests worldwide. This is not just in the Middle East. It's in Latin America. It's in Indonesia. It's in South Africa.

But again, expectations are low. Remember when the two men last met in Bali, it was also when relations plunged to a historic low after then U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan. And things appeared to be looking up after that meeting, but then again, the suspected Chinese spy balloon popped up.That's why a lot of analysts say it is a big deal for the two men to meet in San Francisco, but the biggest deliverable out of that meeting could be just resumption of communications, government to government, including at very senior levels, but perhaps more importantly now people to people exchanges. We have seen some positive signs at that front, including the resumption of more nonstop flights between the two sides and more American academic and cultural delegations visit China. But the problem is fundamentally how each side views their own strengths and the other's intentions have not changed. In Washington, China remains perhaps the only bipartisan consensus being viewed as America's most menacing strategic competitor. And here Xi Jinping has made clear the U.S. is out to contain China's global rise, suppressing its interests. That's why they have to fight back. And we have seen that translated into policy measures, including a growing emphasis on self-reliance in key economic sectors, especially in tech, but also whitening counter-espionage campaigns that have now affected foreign, including American companies, operations and confidence here, not to mention growing close encounters between the two militaries that has become more dangerous day after day. And that, in a way, points to the importance of resuming military-to- military communications which were cut off by the Chinese after the Pelosi visit to Taiwan. So that could be part of the potential deliverables, along with more cooperation on climate change and fentanyl. But at the end of the day, Rosemary, Xi Jinping doesn't have incentive to soften the stance and, in a way, hit the brakes on some of the things because domestic economic hit wins. And one suggestion a lot of people have said, Rosemary, just give for the Americans more pandas. Rosemary?",

Saturday, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah proclaimed that the region's 75-year struggle with Israel has reached a turning point. Regardless of what the Zionists do, he said, after October 7th, Israel is a different Israel, existentially, strategically, historically, and in terms of security. The day he made the speech saw the heaviest cross border exchanges yet, the weapons both sides are using ever more deadly, reaching deeper into one another's territory.
