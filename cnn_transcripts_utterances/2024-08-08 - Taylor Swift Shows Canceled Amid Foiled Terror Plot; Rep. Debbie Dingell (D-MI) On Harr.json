One month ago a Marist poll of registered voters found Trump leading Biden with Independents by four points. The day after Biden dropped out many voters said they were undecided with just 32 percent of Independents backing Harris. But in the latest poll out this week Harris has surged to 53 percent support from Independents -- a 21- point swing in just a matter of weeks. Trump's support among Independents dropping six points in the past month. Still, the former president seems to think there's an opening to go on the attack against Harris' choice for vice president. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  He's a very, uh, very liberal man and he's a shocking pick and I'm thrilled. I could not be more thrilled. Nobody knew how radical left she was, but he's a smarter version of her. If you want to know the truth, he's probably about the same as Bernie Sander. This is a ticket that would want this country go -- to go communist immediately if not sooner. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Harris at the top of the ticket is still relatively new and I think that she's still having this boost from the rapid change in the ticket, her being able to reintroduce herself, the VP pick. It will probably continue to surge or maintain during the DNC. Then I'm hearing from a bunch of Republicans who are saying they expect this -- what they call the honeymoon phase -- to die down a little bit once you hit September. So I think that could be one factor. But another factor is that Harris is being able to now introduce herself on the national stage in a different way as the presidential candidate. Of course, she was known when she was a senator and when she was a vice president, but she was sort of not in the limelight. She was behind President Biden. She had -- you know, her tough moments in the media during the time. She's having an opportunity to reintroduce herself in a new way as a -- like I said, she's at the top of the ticket. It seems that Independent voters are interested in that and into that. If it maintains, we'll have to see. But as of now -- I mean, it's a great sign for her campaign.",

I would say Democrats -- the Democratic Party as a whole is very energized and enthusiastic about Kamala Harris right now. As Mychael mentioned, she's still relatively new and has this opportunity to redefine herself and make herself known independent of being Joe Biden's vice president.What we are hearing from Democrats in swing states and running these tougher races is that they're worried that she has a short timeframe to introduce herself as well and make that case to voters in these tougher districts. So I think it's really kind of a mixed reaction but overall, I would say lawmakers have been pretty enthusiastic, especially at her ability to tap into these different demographics that were not as excited about Joe Biden.",

A) there was a seamless transition at the top of the ticket. Walz being rolled out as VP and now Democrats on the ground and in Congress being excited about that.

Now, she was scheduled to perform three shows in Vienna today, August 8, as well as the 9th and the 10th. And police say that they were expecting about 65,000 people at each show and up to 15,000 additional fans outside the stadium without tickets, and that contributed further to security concerns. Now, Barracuda Music -- this is the promoter for Swift's concerts in Austria -- issued the following statement on social media. Let's bring it up. They said this. \"With confirmation from government officials of a planned terrorist attack at Ernst-Happel Stadion, we have no choice but to cancel the three scheduled shows for everyone's safety.\" Now, Swift's official website says all the tickets will be automatically refunded. Now, on Wednesday morning, that was when police made their first arrest. They arrested a 19-year-old Austrian citizen who is a sympathizer who pledged allegiance to the Islamic State. Now, that arrest took place in Ternitz, which is located south of Vienna. And there, officials found chemical substances at the suspect's home and that's a possible link to bombmaking there. And then later in the day on Wednesday, they detained another person in Vienna. The police say that these two suspects -- they were radicalized by the internet, and they were taking, in their words, concrete measures for a terror attack. And the assumed target here were events in the greater Vienna region. And Austrian police say further detentions have been made in relation to this alleged plot and they have also increased surveillance. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GERHARD PUERSTL, PRESIDENT, VIENNA STATE POLICE (through translator): The concrete danger has been minimized, but there is an abstract increased danger. We have, therefore, increased surveillance to the extent that we will, in any case, carry out increased searches both on site and during access controls. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
