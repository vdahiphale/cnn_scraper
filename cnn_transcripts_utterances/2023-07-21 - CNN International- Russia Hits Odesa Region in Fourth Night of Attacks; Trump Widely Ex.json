Case in point, 19 missiles were fired at Odesa in the region, only 15 of them were shot down so little -- sorry, only 5 of them were shot down. So only a little better than a quarter there. And the difficulty, as you point out, is the types of missiles that are being used. These are used to sink ships. They fly at such a speed and at such a trajectory and an altitude that it makes it extremely difficult to shoot them down.And you know, Ukrainians are being accustomed by this point to going about their daily lives with the exception of when the sirens are going off. But I can tell you from personal experience, sometimes you hear the sirens after you hear the actual explosion. And that seems to be the case this morning as well. Ukrainians say the two missiles that struck these grain facilities for agricultural storage facilities, came in at such a low altitude that the air defenses didn't actually detect them until late and that's why you had the sirens going off simultaneously to the actual blast. So basically, the Ukrainians are saying, look, we have at least two patriot batteries already, we need a lot more to adequately protect the country.",

But yes, you mentioned they're controversial because this is a fundamentally different kind of weapon. This is a bomb that essentially breaks up into, you know, 80, 90 smaller bombs that spread across the area of about a football field and not all those little bombs actually detonate which causes problems down the road similar to land mines. And that's why countries like the U.K. and other European countries they actually outlawed them. Obviously, the Americans have not, neither have the Ukrainians.Putin -- Vladimir Putin has denied that the Russians has used these at all, but he said that he would consider using them if Ukrainians start to. So perhaps that's something that we may see on the battlefield now that we have confirmation that the Ukrainians have used them. As for how effective they've been, John Kirby, that White House official I mentioned, talked about this with reporters yesterday. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Kirby is now concerned and the CIA director made similar comments yesterday that the Russians may strike civilian ships going into port and then blamed the Ukrainians.

Now some of those have already been completed -- like the interview with Rudy Giuliani. But other people couldn't get a date on the calendar until well into next month. Now they can still indict former President Trump before they finish all their interviews. In fact, we saw that in Mar-a-Lago. They indicted former President Trump and his co-defendant Walt Nauta and then investigators continued their work. They've even sent out at least one additional target letter as they continue to gather evidence in that probe.

And we call them heat domes where it just traps the heat inside and until a big shift occurs and the large-scale weather pattern, we really won't see much change at all.So we're going to continue to see extremely hot temperatures across the U.S. You can see in the Deep South and in the Southwest, same story continues -- the same story continues, excessive heat warnings, heat advisories in place. However, we will see a dip in temperatures across the Southern Plains. And this will be for Friday into Saturday. You can see a little bit of that heat goes away across the Gulf Coast. But still seeing above average temperatures for much of the Southwest, much of Texas and then expanding well to the north by the time we get into the beginning part of next week. So still in breaking record territory with 170 or more possible records broken once again through the rest of the week. We're looking at high temperatures in the triple digits in Dallas. We do drop slightly on Saturday, but then close to 100 on Sunday. Houston triple digits, Del Rio triple digits and so really hot continuing. 21 consecutive days of high temperatures above 110 for Phoenix. We are still on that streak, that record-breaking streak for them and temperatures are going to stay above 110 for the foreseeable future. You can see it all the way through Thursday at least. High temperatures hitting 124 in Death Valley. Palm Springs hitting 120. Phoenix close to 120 on Friday. And temperatures are expected to stay above average all of next week and beyond. This from the Climate Prediction Center. We also have a risk of severe weather. This is for portions of the South, the mid-Atlantic, the Northeast. We could see damaging winds, large hail, this is for Friday. You can see from the forecast radar just some storms racing through by the time we get into Friday night, even into Saturday.
