We're going to bring you the president's remarks live Plus, tone deaf. New CNN reporting that that's exactly how some Democrats are describing the Biden campaign's response to calls for the president to drop out of the 2024 race. I'll speak with the top Democratic donor about whether he plans to stick by the president. And Trump's take. Does a former president believes he's better off facing off against Joe Biden in November or someone else. We have new reporting tonight. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erica Hill, in for Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, breaking news, President Biden about to break his silence on that major support Supreme Court decision, which gives Donald Trump sweeping immunity for some official actions during his presidency. And that may include some of Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Biden's speech from the White House expected to take place this hour. And we will bring that to you live. Today's decision by the Supreme Court essentially puts a stop to Donald Trump's January 6 case. You're recall it was scheduled to start back on March 4th. Of course, that didn't happen. This ruling though could also affect his other cases. The former president celebrating tonight, writing the Supreme Court decision is a much more powerful one than some had expected to be. It is brilliantly written and wise, and clears the stench from the Biden trials and hoaxes, all of them that have been used as an unfair attack on crooked Joe Biden's political opponent, me. Now, I probably don't need to say this again, but I will. There is absolutely no evidence that Biden is behind Trump's legal problems. Also important to note to these opinion does not clear Trump from most of the charges he is facing. Our Ryan Goodman with \"Just Security\" says Trump could actually still be prosecuted for his false electors scheme , his ellipse speech on January 6, and for possibly putting pressure on Mike Pence to overturn the election. As for special counsel, Jack Smith, well, his team now grappling with what charges and what evidence could actually be considered an official action of the president. In the majority opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts, writing: Like everyone else, the president is subject to prosecution in his unofficial capacity. But unlike anyone else, the president is a branch of government. And the Constitution vests in him sweeping powers and duties. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, in a scathing dissent, calling the majority, quote, deeply wrong, added the court effectively creates a law-free zone around the president, upsetting the status quo that has existed since the founding. Katelyn Polantz is OUTFRONT live outside the Supreme Court tonight. So, Katelyn, what happens now in terms of the January 6 trial and the charges that Donald Trump was facing with the immunity decision now coming into play?",

I'm disappointed a little bit and confused bit by the elimination of the Jeffrey Clark piece of the case and also the inability to use evidence pertaining to official acts with regard to some of the crimes. But they were always going to draw a constitutional line here, a separation of powers line, and they drew it, and it's a tight line, but it's not aligned that eliminates this case. Jack Smith can proceed, you know, should he decide to? I'm sure he will in some form. Whether he streamlines the case, whether he does a superseding indictment, those are all strategic decisions that well see in the upcoming weeks. But this case is not dead.",

Separation the powers is the cornerstone of the Constitution and as much as I wish, Trump would get his come up and sin is due for his evil conduct the reality is you just can't go out and have a result-oriented effort by the Supreme Court needs to be based on principle and precedent.

I think that they're going to be motions to dismiss based on immunity in that case that will further drag that case out and it's already complicated, of course, by the compromising conduct of the district attorney and her and her former chief prosecutor. So I think that case is really, really struggling, and I think they immunity issues here on the federal side will be very complicated to apply there. I also -- also think, you know, you'll see Trump uses emotions everywhere. But as far as the New York case goes, keep in mind the whole picks, conversations the White House conversations were not the gravamen of her evidence.

He is staying in the race and that Thursday night was really just one bad debate. But some of the language and the tone that the Biden campaign has been using in its defensiveness has really angered and dismayed some top Democrats.One term in particular that I've heard from a lot of Democrats is the term bedwetting. You might recall on Saturday night, the campaign released a fundraising email that basically started out by saying, look, we know that a lot of your concerned right now and later in the message, it said, quote, the bedwetting brigade is calling for Joe Biden to drop out. That is the best possible way for Donald Trump to win, and for us to lose. Well, top Democrats have told me and, Erica, to be clear: these are Democrats that are fully supportive of the president. They said that that kind of language is, quote, disgusting. Somebody else said that it was disrespectful and basically their point has been that this is totally tone deaf and doesn't sort of take into account just how much panic there is and how widespread and serious the concern is coming out from the Democratic Party. The Biden campaign, of course, has been in a bit of survival mode I think over the last couple of days and forcefully of rejecting any calls for the president to drop out has been a part of that strategy. Now, as we wait for the president to deliver those remarks on the Supreme Court's ruling on presidential immunity. I think we're about to see, of course, whether he seizes that as a potential opportunity to take some questions from reporters that are going to be in the room and a address any of the concerns that we have seen coming out of the Democratic Party.",

Congresswoman, it's good to have you here tonight. I know you just heard some of MJ's reporting that the Biden campaign is being tone deaf, other words, disrespectful disgusting, in the wake of the debate and concerns. I know you yourself have him having a lot of candid conversations about the future of the campaign. I'm wondering if what you are hearing matches what MJ is hearing in her reporting. REP. DEBBIE DINGELL (D-MI): Look, I have this attitude, Thursday night was a bad night, and the president now has to go out and show the American people he can do the job, he's got the stamina and he's up to it. I think President Trump, former president Trump also had a bad night. I think he doubled down on a lot of issues that the American people have concerns about from Roe versus Wade, women being able to make their own health care decisions, giving his billionaire friends, tax cut to quite frankly January 6. And thinking that January 6 was okay and I'm not quite sure what today's Supreme Court cases going to how that can impact people. That's what I can impact, making sure people know what the choice is. Donald Trump being president again, of this country is a danger to democracy. And that's what I'm telling all of my colleagues. We've got to focus on what that contrast is, and stay united in making sure we know what the choice people have is in the potential devastating consequences are in November. So to your point then, MJ's reporting also is that the president, the White House at the campaign rather is considering a sit-down interview for President Biden, to show people that in their view, that was just a one-off. It was just a bad debate night. Do you think that is the right path forward? And should they you have done it sooner?",

This was one really bad performance. We understand that concern. But in the end, the president has done a great job for three-and-a- half years. He just won the primary and at the end of the day, he is the only Democrat in the last 18 months that has beaten Trump in any polling. He is our best shot to win. Lastly, on a contested convention, or should he drop out, I think some Democratic donors are living in fantasy land. That is not going to happen. Going to a contested convention would be a terrible idea. We would expose all the divisions within the party and whoever won that would, would emerge weaker like they did in 1968, I think in that Democratic convention.",

And secondly, on the polling, they did talk about some internal polling on the call just now that actually showing that the president is flat, which is very interesting. So I think the bigger issue is that a contested convention, you would have some for the vice president, some for Gavin Newsom, Gretchen Whitmer, that's where the division would really emerge.

And just so remarkable coming from the president, given the events of the past few days just as we had expected, he used this ruling to take Americans back to four years ago. He said the former President Donald Trump sat back and watched a violent mob attack the Capitol. And then he talked about the ruling. In particular saying that this means that there are now virtually no limits on what a president can do, even though he said this is a country where no one person can rule as king.He said, in really remarkable statements that this sets, in his view a dangerous precedent for the country. He said the decision today continues the court's attacks on a wide range of principles that are fundamental to this nation. And he said it undermines the rule of law. He said the public has a right to know so what exactly happened on January 6 and really lamented the fact that as a result of this decision that the public is likely not going to get the full answer. And that is when he pivoted to say it is now up to the American people to make a judgment. It is essentially up to them to vote against Donald Trump something, make sure that he doesn't come into office come back into office, I should say and in one of the more remarkable moments from this speech, the president said the American people should descend. I dissent. I just want to stress here this is a president and a White House that have been so careful whenever we have talked about legal decisions and rulings to make sure that he makes clear -- he says he respects very much the judicial system, and this is the closest that we have ever heard him. I think walk right up to the line of saying, I just fundamentally disagree. Obviously, the president made clear that he is resigned to the fact that there's nothing he can do about this ruling, but that he vehemently opposes and disagrees with this decision. And again, use this as a rallying cry for American voters to use their power to vote in November. And again, just incredibly interesting, given what kind of political trouble he is in right now after that very poor performance at the debate last week.",

It is very unusual for a president to be that direct, I dissent in the face of a Supreme Court decision, but I think he's pointing to a fear in an alarm that exist in this country right now because it does look like the Supreme Court just handed a license for lawlessness to whoever happens to be in the Oval Office, and if Donald Trump, who ran over every norm, every rule, every tradition before, when he thought he might face consequences, what would he do now? And so, this is not a tangential issue to the president -- to the presidential campaign. It -- the Supreme Court just threw down the gauntlet and said, a president can be as long as he wants to be and that makes us a choice much more stark. I think that that Joe Biden, that we just saw talking about character, talking about judgment, talking about American tradition, talking about George Washington is the Joe Biden that deserves to win and the question is, is the public going to see that Joe Biden, as the guy they're voting for, or the person from last week?

I think we have to know that that was the version of the president that the campaign had very much hope to show on display last Thursday night and it wasn't the version of the president that we ended up seeing. And furthermore, this was the issue.One of the top issues that they believed that he could be the most forceful on the most impactful on in terms of driving at that contrast between himself and his predecessor, of course, this is a very different setting. He is back at the White House. Certainly, he was using the prompter for remarks that were pre-written. So it's hard to compare the two, but I think obviously that toothpaste is already out of the tube. It was a bad debate. It has been a couple of days and we've seen the full range of the panic and, you know, you were referring to advisors discussing whether he should sit down for a high-profile interview. I mean, that is just one of the many things that Democrats and the advisers that are close to him are discussing as different ways to make amends for the fact that the party is really in panic mode right now. They saw a president that many said they were actually shocked to see. And it was not the performance that they had hoped to give again, when they felt like they had issues like this one that they see as being so black and white, such a potential for there to be that stark contrast between himself often the former president, and he wasn't able to do it in the way that the campaign had hoped a few days ago. And I think the question is going to be, will these moments that again Van described as just being decisive and forceful, will those, if you string them enough of them together, will they be enough to erase the panic that has been caused by the debate performance that we saw a couple nights ago. I think we just don't know the answer to that yet.",
