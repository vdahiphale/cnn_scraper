Welcome to CNN Tonight.The Supreme Court is on the cusp of making monumental decisions that could change life as we've known it for decades, starting with whether to restrict access to an abortion medication that's been used for two decades. Next to come, affirmative action and voting rights, all of this amidst new revelations today about Clarence Thomas. It was not just luxury trips that he accepted from a Republican mega donor. He also allegedly took cash in exchange for real estate. Our panel tells us if that's unethical or illegal or both. Plus, we know how dangerous concussions can be for athletes and how they can lead to brain damage known as CTE. Well, now the family of the shooter in the Louisville bank massacre wants his brain examined for CTE after he reportedly had multiple concussions in high school. And lots changed since the olden days, a father knows best. Many women now make as much money or more than their husbands. So, why are women still doing the lion's share of housework? We'll get our panel's perspective on a new study. And stay tuned for our Friday night news quiz. See if you know more about what happened this week than our panelists. But let's start with the Supreme Court. We want to bring in our panel. We have former Watergate Prosecutor Nick Akerman, we have Jessica Washington from The Root, Jay Michaelson, who clerked for Merrick Garland and was on the Supreme Court beat at The Daily Beast for many years, and former Senate Candidate Joe Pinion. Guys, happy Friday, great to have you all here. So, Jay, with your credentials, you're clerking for Merrick Garland, your Supreme Court beat, let's -- Jay just looked at the Watergate prosecutor, like my credentials of Supreme Court specifically. So, just tell us what you read the tea leaves for us of what's happening right now at the Supreme Court.",

That doesn't mean anything in terms of what they're going to do.But certainly, when we look at the docket, this is what you get when you have a court process that's really been taken over by an extreme edge of one of the parties, the Republican Party, and all of these, certainly the abortion medication pill case and the voting rights case should be slam dunks, but anything goes.",

You get all your medications to the mail. The only thing you don't get through a mail these days is a heart operation. I mean, you just get all your medications through the mail. And now it's up to the Supreme Court where all of these the five justices who overruled what Roe versus Wade, all of whom are anti- abortion, are now stuck in a dilemma. What do they do?

This is a medication that does have other uses. But also, I mean, people need to be able to access if they want to have self-medicated abortions. It's not 100 percent necessary, but it is helpful in that process. And one thing I do want to mention is, as we're talking about this in the media, I do want to be careful not to make it sound like where if the Supreme Court goes the other way, we're about to have abortion access completely illegal in the United States. I think sometimes when we talk about abortion access, we talk about kind of Roe v. Wade, we have a tendency to scare people into thinking that abortion is completely illegal.

This is saying not -- and this is not -- again, this is not about the Constitution having or not having a right to privacy within it. This is just judicial activism. And this is exactly what conservatives decried liberal judges and justices for doing for decades. And now this is about to happen. I want to suggest, though, I think this is a huge cell phone from the conservative wing of the Republican Party. Most Americans are not on board with this radical agenda. And I think that's also true on voting rights and also on some other issues, also on guns, that we're seeing the results of a very concerted effort, you know, just exactly what Nick said, to put justices on the court to overturn Roe versus Wade, and that is having consequences that are really going to have political ramifications in the next election.",
