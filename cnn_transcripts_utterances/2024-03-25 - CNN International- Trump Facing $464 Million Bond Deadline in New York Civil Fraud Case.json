Max Foster has the day off.It's Monday, March 25th, 4 p.m. here in Hong Kong, 4 a.m. in New York, where in the coming hours Donald Trump will face two major legal threats. First, the former president is facing a critical deadline to post nearly half a billion dollars in bond money for the civil fraud judgment against him. Trump says he has the funds boasting on Truth Social. I currently have almost $500 million in cash. However, his lawyer says he does not have that kind of money on hand. If Trump fails to secure this massive bond, the state attorney general could begin seizing assets like his multi-million dollar properties. But experts say his bank accounts should be handled first as they would be much easier to take. Well meanwhile, Trump could also learn the new trial date for his delayed criminal hush money case. There will be a hearing where his lawyers can argue for a longer postponement or have the charges dismissed altogether. The earliest the trial could begin is April 15th. Bernada Villalona is a criminal defense attorney and former New York prosecutor. She joins us now live from New York. Great to have you with us. Donald Trump facing two major legal threats on the one day. Which one do you believe is most concerning for the former president?",

That is what he built himself as being the money, money, money man. And actually landed him the presidency the first time around.So that is the most concerning to him because it can completely take him down to zeros of dollars. Especially if his property is seized. And we're talking about Trump Tower. We're talking about the International Hotel 40 Wall Street. His property in Westchester, Long Island. And let's not forget that probably the property also in Florida can be at jeopardy as well if he can't pony up the money. That half a billion dollars. So that's the most concerning because even if he were to be convicted in the criminal case in New York. I think it's highly unlikely that any judge will place him in custody.",

So while that's pending appeal, nothing's going to move on that case. So a trial date is not going to be set.Aside from that, even if a trial date were to be set, let's think about the amount of time it would take to select the jury, which can be months.

All are being held in pretrial detention. Investigators say the men are from Tajikistan and have been in Russia on either temporary or expired visas. Outside the concert hall, thousands of people gathered in the rain on Sunday to remember the victims. The death toll from the terror attack now stands at 137. More than 100 others are injured. Inside, what's left of the venue, crews are searching through debris from the devastating fire the gunmen are accused of setting. They're using robots and dogs trying to find any more bodies still in the rubble.

And on the one hand this sets up a relatively delicate situation for Russia. They rely on migrant workers. It's an important part of the workforce, especially now at a time of critical labor shortages which are hampering its efforts to sort of ramp up the war economy. So they will not want to deter migrant workers from coming in the wake of this.The second thing is, of course, that they did all arrive, as you say, in various states of injury, one with a bandage to the side of his head, another in a wheelchair and unresponsive. And we see this video that's been released by Russia's investigative committee showing them being sort of forcibly marched into that Moscow courthouse. The security apparatus now attempting to show that it's getting tough, that it's in control of this situation, obviously amid questions over why this huge terror attack, the biggest in Russia in over two decades, was missed. I think one more point to make about this legal process is that there are already signs that it may not play out in a climate of full transparency. The press were not allowed to listen to the entirety of these hearings on Sunday. So these suspects have now been held in pre- trial detention for a period of at least two months. We know that precedent would suggest that pre-trial detention in Russia can be a lot longer than that. But I think there's a chance that we will not be able to witness all of how these trials play out -- Anna.",

He also points out that Russians have spent years being told that their rights are being eroded for this purpose, to increase their security, to prevent terrorism. And now this, he says, accusing the FSB of spending more time surveilling citizens and jailing opposition leaders than actually working on real threats. And, of course, you have the irony, which some are pointing out, that these four suspects are facing terror charges, which, of course, Navalny was also facing. And Russia's extremist and terrorist list is populated now with opposition leaders and writers and people who oppose the war. So the Russian state is facing questions. Obviously, we don't know, as I said, what the average Russian feels at this point. There is a sense of shock and outpouring of grief. But what we do see is a clear effort from the Russian state, both the security apparatus and the sort of information arm, the propaganda, trying to prevent this from becoming a political problem for Putin -- Anna.",

Later in the week, Benjamin Netanyahu's top confidant, Ron Demer, will arrive in the U.S. to talk about Rafah. Israel says a ground invasion there is necessary to go after Hamas. But the White House is pressing Israel to first come up with a credible plan to protect about 1.4 million Palestinians sheltering in Rafah.

The decision-makers have all left, but clearly if they come back in, it suggests that there has been some kind of response from Hamas.So one of the issues has been the number of Palestinian prisoners, and not just the number, but of course also the nature of the Palestinian prisoners. If there are, of course, those that are in prison because they have killed Israeli nationals. That is a very different matter from the Israeli side. So what we heard just 10 days ago from Hamas with their counterproposal is they suggested between 700 and 1,000 Palestinian prisoners to be released for those approximately 40 hostages being held in Gaza. And what we've heard from our CNN analysts, what we hear from other media as well in Israel is that the number 700 is what the U.S. bridging proposal has rested on. So we have to wait now, of course, without those making the decisions here in Doha. It does take a little longer to be able to get some kind of decision. We heard from a source familiar with these talks, though, that there is steady progress that is being made. There are gaps that still remain, and a diplomat with knowledge of the talks also saying that it does appear that things are moving forward at this point. So once again, it does appear to be a bit of a waiting gate to see what the response might be. Anna.",
