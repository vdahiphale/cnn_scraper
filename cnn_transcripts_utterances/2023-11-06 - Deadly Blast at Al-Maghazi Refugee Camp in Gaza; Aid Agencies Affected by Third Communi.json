The IDF also says its soldiers have now reached Gaza's coast in an effort to cut the Northern part off of the enclave.This comes as the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has once again rejected calls for a ceasefire, saying all hostages must first be released. Meanwhile, an intense diplomatic push is underway to prevent a wider conflict in the region. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken landing in Turkey a short time ago. And the director of the CIA also is traveling to several countries in the Middle East to meet with, quote, \"multiple intelligence counterparts and country leaders.\" All of this coming as dozens of people were killed in a blast at the Al-Maghazi refugee camp in Gaza, according to an official at a nearby hospital. He says it was the result of an Israeli airstrike. The IDF says it is looking into the circumstances around the explosion. Nada Bashir is following this developing story. A warning: her report includes graphic images. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NADA BASHIR, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): At this hospital in central Gaza, another day of seemingly unending horror. Bodies, some tiny, arriving in their dozens. No one is spared the devastation of this war. Journalist Muhammed Alaloul, seen here at Gaza's Al Aqsa Hospital, not to report on his latest attack, but to identify his children amongst the dead. MUHAMMED ALALOUL, JOURNALIST (through translator): I saw my son Kenaan; my daughter, Rahaf; and my sons Ahmad and Qais. I saw my three siblings killed. I saw friends who were at my house, all killed. BASHIR (voice-over): Hospital officials tell CNN this latest disaster was caused by yet another Israeli airstrike. Among the numerous bodies, countless women and children. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): Fifty-two killed, and more than 70 injured. Most of those killed and injured are children, women, and elderly, and still a large number are buried under the rubble. BASHIR (voice-over): In the now shuttered Al-Maghazi refugee camp, once home to tens of thousands of Palestinians, residents searched desperately for any sign of survivors. Many digging frantically with their bare hands. This residential community is located in one of the zones deemed safe to evacuate to by the Israeli military. But Israel's airstrikes have proven unrelenting. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): All of a sudden, I saw the entire house upside-down. I can't see. I don't even know where I am. BASHIR (voice-over): Homes which are crowded on Saturday with entire families, have now been reduced to blackened rubble. This crater, a reminder of the force with which Israel continues to bombard the besieged Gaza Strip. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): I saw all my sisters screaming. Then I saw my father. When I found myself alive, I looked to see who is still alive. We turned on the torch, and my siblings were alive, but I did not find my father. I finally found him next to me. I moved him. I moved his hands. I moved his face. He did not respond. BASHIR (voice-over): Gaza's hospitals are overwhelmed. The shortages mean it is virtually impossible to adequately treat those wounded. But hospitals like Al Aqsa are also struggling to keep up with the mounting death toll. The bodies of those killed lay outside, awaiting identification. A gut-wrenching image, now an all-too-familiar reality here in Gaza. Nada Bashir, CNN, Jerusalem. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

So that's been a night of bombardment.At the same time, as you mentioned just a couple of moments ago in your introduction, Michael, Israel says that it has now reached the coast of the Gaza Strip, effectively bisecting the enclave in two and helping it with its objective right now, or one of its objectives of surrounding Gaza City, where it is searching out for militants' infrastructure, and of course, trying to free some of those 240 or so hostages still being held by Hamas. The bombardment continues, and we've seen some of the images there in that report as to the effects of those strikes. At the same time, there has been this communications blackout, the third time there has been one since October the 7th. Now not only is that affecting people's ability within this trip to communicate with one another, to find out if their loved ones are OK, or even alive, but obviously, friends and loved ones overseas. But as far as the humanitarian organizations are concerned, they are also very worried. The head of the World Health Organization saying that without connectivity, people who need immediate medical attention cannot contact hospitals, and ambulances. All channels of communication must be restored immediately. Now I reached out to the IDF to understand a little bit more about what was going on, but for now at least, Michael, they say they have no comment.",

According to Turkish state news, protesters carrying Turkish and Palestinian flags chanted anti-Israel and anti-U.S. slogans. This was at the Incirlik Air Base in Southern Turkey. Police stepped in after some protesters broke down barricades and attempted to enter the base, as you can see there. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, meanwhile, has arrived in Turkey, the last stop on his tour of the region before heading to East Asia and India this week. Blinken is expected to meet with Turkish officials this morning to discuss the war. President Erdogan has been highly critical of Israel's offensive in Gaza, calling its actions crimes against humanity. While in Iraq, Blinken met with the prime minister, Mohammed Shia Al- Sudani, who called for a ceasefire and the reopening of border crossings to keep the humanitarian crisis from getting even worse. Blinken on Saturday found himself at odds with Arab leaders, who are calling for an immediate ceasefire, instead voicing support for humanitarian pauses, which he reiterated on Sunday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: I think everyone would welcome humanitarian pauses. There's no doubt about that. There are obviously different views, including on the question of a ceasefire, but there's no doubt from my conversations with all of our colleagues who were in Amman yesterday, that everyone would welcome the humanitarian pause, because again, it could advance things that we're all trying to accomplish.

I think nobody's taken into account how Hamas and its puppet masters in Tehran really are manipulating public opinion in the United States and elsewhere. This is a very serious matter that's going on here. And there is no connection between what Israel is doing in the Northern part of the Gaza Strip, and opening the border for proper shipments of humanitarian aid. This is a problem Hamas has caused on both sides, letting the aid in, and letting people out who want to get out. So I think Israel is entirely justified here in saying Hamas is so utterly untrustworthy that they don't get the benefit of a humanitarian pause, and certainly not a ceasefire. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That's coming as both Lebanon and Israel announced civilian casualties from Sunday strikes along the border there, the Israeli- Lebanese border.There's been a near daily exchange of fire there since October the 8th between Israel and militants from Hezbollah. That's something that the U.S. secretary of state raised deep concerns about as he met with Lebanon's caretaker prime minister in Amman, Jordan. He thanked him for his leadership in preventing Lebanon from being pulled into a wider conflict, as well as for Lebanon's efforts in working with regional partners to pursue peace. All right. Let's discuss more now with James Zogby, who is the president and founder of the Arab-American Institute, and author of \"Arab Voices: What They are Saying to Us and Why It Matters.\" He joins me from Washington. It's good to see you, Jim. So U.S. Secretary of State Blinken, he met with the Palestinian Authority leader, Mahmoud Abbas on Sunday. By all accounts, it didn't go well. He had that almost awkward gap Saturday between Blinken and, for one example, the Jordanian foreign minister. How angry are Arab governments with the U.S. and its unwillingness to support a ceasefire? JAMES ZOGBY, PRESIDENT/FOUNDER, ARAB-AMERICAN INSTITUTE: Well, there's a lot of anger there. And there's even more anger in their public opinion. We've been doing some polling in the region, and frankly, the bottom has fallen out in terms of attitudes toward the U.S. and attitudes towards Israel. Countries that had made peace with Israel, like Jordan, like Egypt, like others, are today furious, because they feel betrayed. And -- and their voices don't matter, either to Israel, obviously, or to the United States. And I think that's what's most concerning here.",

And Israel's policy seems to be -- I hate to use the word, but it's pathological. They simply want to destroy Gaza. And the idea that they're going to destroy Hamas and do away with it makes as much sense as 1982, when they tried to do away with the PLO, and they ended up with Hezbollah, or when they tried to do away with appeal with the PLO and -- with Hezbollah in 2006, and they got a stronger Hezbollah.

And we should have asked that question of ourselves and the Israelis before we ended up turning on the spigot and giving them the go-ahead to do this. Frankly, it's going to be very difficult to figure out what kind of track we can be on. Look, there are today about half the population of Gaza, no housing at all, because that much has been destroyed in the North. They have been pushed to the South, where there isn't an infrastructure to absorb them. At least 10,000 dead. Those families are not going to be ready to make peace. And there are going to be hundreds of thousands of people living both in despair, but also, at the same time, in desperate conditions. And we have not thought of that. And at least -- look, if Israel can't think straight, if Hamas can't think straight, we've got to be the adult in the room. But the U.S. has not behaved that way. Instead, we've been a coat holder and cheerleader.

To tell Israel that you support them. You have their back. You understand their trauma, and you understand the devastation of the attack. And then, to use that political capital to counsel them on a wise source, on a restrained course, on a strategic course. Biden has gotten the first part right. He's tried very hard on the second part. And it's my understanding that the Biden administration counseled the Israeli government not to do a ground offensive, to do a more targeted, selective series of incursions. But it doesn't seem to be working. So what the Biden administration has to ask itself is now, that it has called for these humanitarian pauses. And you're right; this is all semantics. The Israelis are, fact, doing none of that. What is the Biden administration going to do? Are they going to maybe be more public, more vocal? Are they going to make clear that this is important to them? You know, Bibi Netanyahu has a history of pocketing American support and rebuffing any American pressure. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
