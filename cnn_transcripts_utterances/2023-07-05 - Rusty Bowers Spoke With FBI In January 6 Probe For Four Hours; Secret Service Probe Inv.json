And while we know that Georgia has been a key focus, we hadn't heard as much about Arizona, until now. Tonight, there is new reporting that Jack Smith's office has subpoenaed the office, of the top election official, in the State, as part of his investigation, into efforts, to overturn the 2020 election results. The Arizona Republic is reporting that this subpoena came as recently as May, and it was seeking information, on two lawsuits, one from the Trump campaign, and another from the former Arizona Republican Party Chair, Kelli Ward that alleged fraud and errors, in the election results. This also comes on the heels of reporting that Donald Trump pressured the former Republican Governor of Arizona, Doug Ducey, to overturn the election results, with Ducey later telling a donor, he was surprised that the Special Counsel, Jack Smith, hadn't called him. My first guest, tonight, testified before the January 6 committee, about a call that he got, from Trump, pressuring him, to do things he couldn't do, to overturn the election results, when he was Arizona's Republican Speaker of the House. And Rusty Bowers joins me now. Rusty, as you are looking at this, and we're learning about the subpoena, to the Secretary of State's office, what does it say to you about the state of this investigation? RUSTY BOWERS, (R) FORMER ARIZONA HOUSE SPEAKER: Well, A, that it keeps going. And it appears that a justice, whatever that means, on any given issue, in America, grinds on. And it's taken a while, but it just seems to keep going. And ultimately, I hope that all concerned have their time before justice. And I don't wish anybody any ill. But justice grinds on.",

And that if, in the absence of any proof, there was nothing we would do. We would not do anything without proof. And he congratulated me for that letter. But he never mentioned his own call, with the President. I remember he did hang. He didn't take the call, one time, when \"Hail to the Chief\" came on, on his phone, during one of the certifications.

Nicole Hockley lost her son, Dylan, in the Sandy Hook shooting. She is now the Co-founder and CEO of Sandy Hook Promise. And Nicole, thank you, for joining me, tonight, on something that is obviously all too personal, with you. When you see the spate of shootings, like what we've seen, in the last several days, do you see them as resonating, with the American public, in the same way that a school shooting does, or the Walmart shooting that we saw, where the killer there is now on trial? NICOLE HOCKLEY, CO-FOUNDER AND CEO OF SANDY HOOK PROMISE, MOTHER OF DYLAN HOCKLEY: I think, unfortunately, gun violence has become such a perceived normal part of American life that far too many people just take all these shootings into their stride. And even a lot of school shootings don't make the headlines anymore, never mind the daily shootings. And, I mean, this weekend alone, we had, what, 17 different mass shootings across the country? And we're hearing about some of them, but not all of them. And that's 17 more communities devastated. People need to realize that this is not normal. It's not normal at any day in America.

It's just become far too easy, to just reach for the gun, and take anything out, on those that you feel are doing something, against you, or your values, or beliefs. And it's -- this is, we're now in a war, with our own country. And we're not looking at it that way. But we got this health epidemic that we're not doing anything about. And we're just allowing it to keep happening. There are people trying to make things happen, don't get me wrong. But we need more voices, we need gun owners, to really add their voice, to this movement, and say, \"We don't want these happening, in our neighborhoods and communities, either.

Our families deserve to be safe.\" We need sensible legislation, to help curb this, before it just continues to get even worse and more out of hand than it already is.",
