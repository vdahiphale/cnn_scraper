Free speech, religious liberty and the right for same-sex couples to not be discriminated against, well, they're tied up in a case before the Supreme Court this very day. And the big question everyone is asking and certainly those justices were asking today is, does a graphic designer have the right to refuse to create websites that celebrate same-sex weddings based on her own religious beliefs? Just a moment I'll talk to the plaintiff in that very case.Plus we are, if you haven't noticed, just a few hours away from yet another Election Day, I told you, between election season. And the final election day of the midterms is upon us tomorrow, and it is really down to the wire now. In less than just nine hours, voters will be going to the polls in Georgia's Senate runoff between Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock and Republican challenger Herschel Walker. Let's get right to the Supreme Court case right now. I'm joined by the plaintiff, website designer Lorie Smith, and her lawyer, Kristen Waggoner. Ladies welcome to the program. I'm glad you're both here. I have been really curious about this case, as so many people have. And, frankly, there's been a little divide about this issue in the sense of who can tell who what to do and what they can do about it. It's kind of the old question of the time. And I want to start with you, Lorie, and really understand your position a little bit more, but this is not a case that was filed against her. This is not somebody who is suing you. This is almost a proactive opportunity you're taking, I understand, to figure out, look, can I expand to the wedding website business and not run afoul of Colorado's law that says you cannot discriminate against same-sex couples. Tell me about why you wanted to bring this case now before you actually even entered the wedding website business, really. LORIE SMITH, PLAINTIFF IN 303 CREATIVE LLC V. ELENIS:  Sure. Well, I am a custom graphic and website designer. I create unique one,-of-a- kind websites and speech. And, yes, I want to design for weddings and I want to design in a way that is consistent with my faith. But Colorado is censoring a compelling my speech and forcing me to create custom artwork, custom expression that goes against the core of who I am and what I believe. So, everyone has the right to not only speak but to create consistently with what they believe, and at the core of my case is just that. Everyone should be free to create artwork, unique artwork. That goes along with what they believe, whether their views or similar to mine or perhaps different on the topic of marriage. Nobody should be forced to create a message that goes against the core of who they are.",

I'm starting from scratch and creating custom artwork, lettering, words. I'm telling the story in a way that I think is artistic and creative, creating imagery, photo, everything from start and that is custom and unique, and it is speech. Everything that I create is expressive. And Colorado agrees that what I create is speech. COATES:  Well -- and I want to hear you talk, but there is that a moment, Justice Amy Coney Barrett, of course, seemed to talked about the strongest part of your argument was the idea that being related to custom, you can imagine if it were a template, a very different scenario probably ensuing at that point in time. I know you wanted to make point. I am curious though in terms of -- you mentioned LGBTQ-plus people would be protected as well in terms of what your vision is and that they would not have to create things that they were opposed to as well. Do you think that members of the LGBTQ- plus committee believe that you message is actually promoting what they would stand for as well?

There were conversations at some point about where they playing thesame game or too nice or too harsh. There is a marked shift in how the ads are now running. But in terms of Governor Brian Kemp, you know, he's talking about this as a turnout, you know, who's more motivated? You've got the former president, Donald Trump not appearing in person, but neither is President Biden in person. What do you make of that? CARRIE SHEFFIELD, WRITER &amp; POLITICAL ANALYST:  Yes, I think it's clear. I mean, Brian Kemp won by a healthy margin. He's a very popular governor. I think that the bigger problem for conservative candidates is looking at the ground game because it's shifted since COVID. We are now in election month instead of election day, and conservatives are behind the times when it comes to that. They think, OK, we can make up the gap. We can make up the gap if we show up en mass on election day doesn't always materialize. And so, I think that's where I think some people are discouraged about that. And that's something I'm going to be watching for. I'm also going to be watching for the Demographic shift here within young African American and Latino voters. There's been a marked shift toward the conservative movement, and I think that's really exciting. And I think that when you saw the failure of Stacey Abrams and her false claims of racial animus within the state of Georgia apparatus. That's just not true.
