Thank you very much.As the first hostages are now being taken to hospitals in Israel, Israeli officials are preparing for a second group, hopefully to be released tomorrow. CNN's Matthew Chance is in Tel Aviv with a closer look at how everything unfolded over these last dramatic hours. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): They kidnapped and killed but now Hamas is showing its gunman releasing Israelis in Gaza. For many, these are disturbing scenes. Nine year old, Ohad Munder being embraced, as he set free, then a woman being carried by a masked man as Palestinians cheer. For 49 long days of captivity in Gaza, aid workers from the Red Cross drive them through the border into Egypt and to freedom. Egyptian television shows a convoy of vehicles heading to the crossing. Then the hostages including 10 Thais, a Filipino and the 13 Israeli women and children disembarking for checks. Israeli military posted this grainy video of the moment they all finally reentered the country. A step says the Israeli Prime Minister towards bringing all hostages home. BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAEL PRIME MINISTER (through translator): We have just completed the return of the first of our hostages, children, their mothers and additional women. Each one of them is a whole world. But I emphasize to you the families and to you, citizens of Israel, we are committed to return all our hostages. CHANCE (voice-over): Most of the hostages released in this first group under the temporary truce were taken from Nir Oz, one of the small Israeli communities near Gaza ravaged by Hamas on October the seventh. At least 38 people there were killed and more than 70 abducted. People like Daniel Aloni, and her five year old daughter, Emilia, both freed in this latest release, but the relatives they were visiting when Hamas attacked remain unaccounted for as hostages. Doron Katz Asher and her two young daughters have also now been set free, but her partner remains in Gaza. Behind every release, a poignant reminder of those left behind. Like the family of Omri Almog, his brother in law and niece killed, his sister and her three children still hostages. Yet Omri is now optimistic.",

Not just with the medical checks and the medical treatment that these 13 Israelis are going to be receiving right now in hospitals around the country, but also the psychological help they're going to be getting and it's going to be intense because you've got to remember, you know, a lot of these people we're told have come out into a world where they didn't even know that their loved ones have been killed and aren't anymore.

They did say though, that they were, quote, \"thrilled\" to be able to welcome a total of three families, including four children, three mothers, one grandmother. We believe that those families are the Asher family, the Aloni family and the Munder family. The hospital saying that they are all in good physical condition.But of course we know from conversations that we've been having with hospital staffers throughout the day that they are very much prepared for the likely reality that they will not be in such good psychological condition after the trauma that they've experienced. And as you heard Oren describing there some of the measures that the Wolfson Hospital has taken. Schneider also has taken great lengths to ensure that the special unit that they have set up for these families feels not like a hospital, not cold, not clinical, not intimidating, but warm and intimate. They tried to create the sense they said of a beautiful hotel, there are lots of toys in place. And most importantly, perhaps, they have hand selected the top psychiatrists and staffers that they have within their units, to be those who will work together with these families to try to process and break down some of what they have endured. They have also, we've been told, just enjoyed their first dinner. They are now able to be reunited with their loved ones. But there has definitely been, understandably not just because of what they've been through but because so many of them are minors, a real emphasis on privacy. And you saw that in those moments as the helicopter landed here. They put screens out to ensure that they could have some privacy as they disembarked and arrived here at the hospital, Wolf.",

So we're welcoming the fact that now we have more humanitarian supplies getting through it to Gaza, as you said, 137 trucks with lifesaving goods, including water, food, medical supplies. That's the biggest convoy, humanitarian convoy we've had in seven weeks. So it's a very good start.And we're hoping that the operation will continue as the days come. And on the ground, our colleagues are saying that having this falls is essential to be able to get to the families to the children who've been suffering for so many weeks and under attack, but it's not going to finish the job, so to speak. So we need more aid to come in. We need more safety for humanitarian workers to operate. Let's remember that at least 100 U.N. colleagues died since the October 7th events.
