And I was so fascinated to read today that the credit card companies had a plan. I'll read it to you. Visa, Mastercard and Discover this month paused a plan to implement a new merchant category code for the nation's gun retailers after political pressure from Republicans. The measure is designed to help flag potential mass shooters and gun traffickers.But two dozen Republican attorneys general warned the credit card companies that they should not go ahead with their plans. The Republican officials said that adopting a new sales code for gun stores would harm the constitutional rights of gun owners. In other words, they could have flagged when somebody was gun shopping.

We've left the safety part out. And I think it's embarrassing. I also very worried that we're becoming numb as a society to these happening day in day out, and it's just now sort of another shooting, and that should not be the way we act nationally (ph).And then, lastly, I think that we are really not -- or as Jessica came on and talked about, gun deaths are now the leading cause of death for children. But Pew Research also released a more detailed study that said, if you were black youth, you are five times more likely to be killed by a gun than any other demographic.

And during those contentious trials, both sides get to air the issues. Even before that, Alisyn, you have something called jury selection, where you assemble a jury of your peers in both sides. Prosecution and defense have an opportunity to pick the jurors they believe to be most suited to hear the evidence. After that, there's opening statements where there are narratives from both sides with respect to what they believe the evidence will show. Thereafter, ton of witnesses, cross-examination you're allowed, you know, fair and full opportunity to voice all those issues and concerns. And then we have a jury instructed as to the law, in this case, stand your ground, meaning you have no duty to retreat in the event you feel you're in imminent fear of death or serious bodily injury. You can use force proportionate to whatever threat is posed, right, can't shoot someone for punching you, and that you act reasonably. A jury then, after eight days, goes and they hear everything, they deliberate for 17 hours, comes back, guilty of murder. And now based upon a narrative, which apparently the governor has board into -- he wasn't at the trial, by the way, right, didn't sit through the testimony of the trial, by the way, I didn't hear the compelling arguments of both sides, by the way, now says there's nothing to see.

And that's again, the sort of abdication of morality in this segment of the population. EVAN SIEGFRIED, PRESIDENT, SOMM CONSULTINGimportant to understand why do they hitched themselves to Trump and why have they since 2015 and 2016? I actually had a lot of conversations during that time with Republican voters who were the base now who they hadn't gone to the fully, oh, the election was stolen. This was still 2016. And they told me, you know, part of it is a systemic problem that Republicans and Democrats every election come and say, vote for me and I'm going to fix all your problems. And then when they vote for them, which is a very sacred thing to give someone your vote. When they vote for them, they don't feel any tangible results, and you see a lot of portions of the country that we had terrible policy planning because we knew we were shifting from a manufacturing economy to consumer economy, and these people were left behind economically and they felt abused. Abuse was a word that I heard repeatedly, and the way they felt by voting for Donald Trump when they see the establishment and the media, the big boogie men of our age these days reacting and saying this is horrific how he behaves, they feel when they vote for Trump, it's them being able to get back and get even and give some abuse back, and that is scary. And the other thing is with Frank Luntz's piece, I agree with Jay, it is pie in the sky. It's not going to happen. We saw this in 2016. Jeb Bush tried to do policy. He tried to talk about your grandkids. Same with John Kasich. Where are they now? Nowhere. And Donald Trump became president and he's running again.
