      "sentences": "Yes, it is a big day. It's the last chance for the attorneys to speak to the jury and try to frame the evidence in the way that they want them to see it. And Trump's lawyers will be up first. His attorney, Todd Blanche, expected to address the jury and he is expected to attack the credibility of Michael Cohen. He is the only witness to testify about Donald Trump's direct involvement in the falsification of the records, the alleged cover-up in this case. And they're expected to try to hone in on Cohen's credibility in this trial and suggest to the jury that they cannot convict Donald Trump based on the testimony of a convicted liar. Now, the prosecution is expected to tell the jury that Michael Cohen has a lot of baggage. He is one of Donald Trump's former close associates, and that's the type of person that Trump chose to associate himself with. They will also argue to the jury that Michael Cohen does not stand alone, that there's other evidence, other witness testimony, text messages, phone records, even handwritten notes and the 34 false - allegedly falsified documents themselves. Trying to tie all that together to tell the jury they don't have to rely entirely on Michael Cohen, but they can look at some of the other evidence in this case.Now, closings are expected to go all day tomorrow. The judge saying he could even possibly have the jury stay for them to finish closings if they don't wrap up by the usual end time of 4:30. Then the judge will instruct the jury on Wednesday on the law. That is what the prosecutors need to prove in order to convict, to get a guilty plea - I'm sorry, to get a guilty verdict by the jury against Donald Trump. Then the deliberations will begin. They will go for as long as the jury needs for them to render this verdict and what will be a historic verdict in this case.",

Great to see all of you today as we get ready for what will be a big week in this trial. It will be very interesting to see how it all plays out. Michael, first to you, how does the prosecution tie together the many details, the testimony from 20 witnesses into this nice package? They've got to weave it all together and make sure that they hit every high point with that jury.",

They want to see a pattern of behavior so that Michael Cohen fits within that.It would be very dangerous for the prosecution if the case rested just on Cohen. That's why they needed all of that other evidence and all those other witnesses to support the information that Cohen was driving home. So they want to zoom out. On the other hand, what the defense needs to do is zoom in. The allegations here are very specific. What the jury needs to find is very specific. So what the defense wants to do then is focus on those specific allegations. And if the jurors can't - don't find Cohen credible, that breaks that chain. So that's really where the defense wants to focus in and that's why they are so keyed in on Cohen, because Cohen is the one that creates that link from the big picture story the prosecution is saying to the specific allegations in this case.",

You know, I suspect that either way, however this comes out, either a conviction or a hung jury, acquittal doesn't seem like a reasonable prospect, although I defer to my lawyer colleagues. Either way, the political impact will be a slow burn.You know, we've known from the beginning that Americans are less likely to view this case as a significant violation of the law than the other cases that he faces, which have all been, you know, put on the shelf through interventions primarily by Republican judges. So if there is an impact of this politically, I think it will take time and it will be Americans grappling with the notion of electing a convicted felon if that is what happens. But there's no question, as you say, that Trump has not made his legal condition any easier by trying to fortify his political response to the trial.",

So I think this is the context where those instructions can have a lot of power if they're clear and if they really help guide these jurors, especially again, two lawyers on the panel who are going to be - you know, find that the rules and the specific following of the rules are going to be very important may be able to draw on them.

      "sentences": "Well, we are very dug in as a country, Boris. There's nothing - almost nothing you can conceive of that would move large numbers of voters. But this is truly unprecedented and so I don't think we can, you know, assuredly answer what the effect would be.As I said, Americans have tended to view this case as less serious than the other ones that the Supreme Court and other, you know, judicial bodies have put off in particular the, the January 6th insurrection. By the way, the speed of this trial is a reminder of what could have been unfolding on the January 6th trial if the Supreme Court had not, you know, held that up. But I do think that over time, if Trump is convicted, the issue will be less the specifics of what he's convicted of than the implications of electing a convicted felon. If there is a hung jury, I'm not sure how much it changes the dynamic of the election, but it certainly gives him and his supporters energy. I do think they are preparing to argue it round or argue it flat. If there is a hung jury, it's that - even in a blue jurisdictions like this, the case was so bogus, they couldn't convict him. And if he is convicted, they're prepared to argue, well, what do you expect in such a blue jurisdiction. In effect, arguing that not only the prosecutors, but average voters and jury members would be biased against him. So it is an unprecedented situation. I don't think we can affirmatively be confident about how it would go, but I do think the question of whether Americans are willing to elect a convicted felon would loom larger over time than it might in the immediate reaction to the trial if he is convicted.

The Palestine Red Crescent responded to the Israeli attack of shelling civilians' tents northwest of Rafah in Tel al-Sultan area, a place that is designated as a safe zone for displaced civilians. Families were in tents preparing to go to bed when the shelling began and then tents caught fire. People, including children, get stuck in the fire, causing severe burns as well as injuries. As you highlighted, at least 45 were killed, including 23 children, women, as well as elderly people, and 249 others were injured. Our teams evacuated the casualties to field hospitals in Rafah because there is no one hospital that is still operating that can address these many casualties. We are still concerned that many of those critically wounded might lose their life because there is no surgical capacity enough to treat all of these wounded. At the same time, there is no opportunity to evacuate the critically wounded outside of Gaza Strip because the Rafah crossing, which is the only way to get in or out of Gaza is - remain closed. We continue to call the Palestine Red Crescent, continue to call on the international community to take serious steps to ensure the protection of civilians under international humanitarian law, to hold Israel accountable. What is happening is unacceptable. It comes two days later after the International Court of Justice ordered Israel to cease its operation in Rafah. Once again, despite this area being designated as a safe zone, it was very crowded with 10s of thousands of civilians taking shelter in tents. It was targeted. Once again, we see there is no safe place in Gaza, civilians being attacked everywhere. Honorable schools, hospitals, shelters, any place, there is no safe place left for civilians in Gaza.",

Now, hospitals left are field hospitals that they can barely deal with this increasing number of casualties. Most of Gaza hospitals were taken out of service. Now, only a few hospitals are still operational, and even those who are operational are working partially. They are overcrowded with wounded people. You can see wounded people at the hospital's corridor on the ground waiting until to receive treatment. All of them, they lack medications, medical supplies, as well as a fuel which is needed to the power generator. We are in almost a complete collapse of the health care system. Now we're talking about injuries, but also for your information, many patients, including pregnant women, people with chronic diseases, and people who have also infectious diseases, which is rapidly spreading among the displaced - people are not receiving the necessary health care because hospitals can barely save the lives of those who are critically wounded.",
