Both sides have been asking the judge to just end this thing and make a decision without sending the suit to trial. Dominion is arguing that the internal emails and texts from FOX anchors and executives that they've put out there have already proven malice, that they were promoting false claims about Dominion rigging the 2020 election.",

      "sentences": "We're hearing these arguments that have been ongoing since 9So while all of this is swirling inside the courthouse behind me, there's also that lawsuit from that FOX News producer, Abby Grossburg. She's alleging that lawyers for FOX News coerced her into giving misleading testimony when she was doing her deposition for this lawsuit. She says that she was coerced into giving statements that could really shift culpability away from FOX News executives and FOX hosts. She said FOX News attorneys coerced Ms. Grossburg to deliver shaded and/or incomplete answers during her sworn deposition testimony, which answers were clearly to her determent but greatly benefitted FOX News. Now FOX News is responding to this citing attorney-client privilege and saying that they cannot exactly comment on this. Interestingly, just in the last few minutes, there's been a development in that case. FOX News had filed for a restraining order against her, trying to prevent her from saying that she was coerced into misleading statements by these FOX News attorneys. FOX News has dropped their request for a restraining order. In the meantime, this producer is on administrative leave and all of this plays into this huge $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit. Dominion's lawyers have been up in court arguing that the FOX News host and as their executives full well knew that the information they were putting out there repeatedly on FOX News was false when they said that Dominion Voting Systems had rigged the 2020 election. FOX News has consistently pushed back here saying that everything they have done is fully protected under the First Amendment. So that is something that the judge could decide today or sometime in the next few days. If he lets this case go to trial, though, the trial will begin before a jury at some point likely in April - Guys?",

One of the attorneys for the deputies has put a lot of this at the feet of the staff at the mental hospital, saying it was the hospital staff that was supposed to handle the intake of Irvo Otieno and to restrain him.

Just under 24 hours, the Fed is going to announce its decision here.And over the past year or so, they've been waging this really aggressive war on inflation. We always knew there was a risk that that could backfire because history shows that the faster they raise interest rates and the higher they go, the more likely that they break something. And so now we learn that something has broken, specifically the banking market with these bank failures. And so now there's a question, what is the Fed going to do? A former FDIC chair, Sheila Bear, she wants the Fed to pause and survey the damage. And Goldman Sachs has predicted they will pause, not raise interest rates so they don't worsen the pressure in the banking market. But there actually is growing confidence among investors that the Fed is going to go ahead and raise interest rates despite the bank failures. There's an 84 percent chance being priced into the market that the Fed races interest rates by 25 basis points tomorrow. And just about a 16 percent chance of no interest rate hike. So we'll have to wait and see what the actual decision is going to be. But the stakes here are very high.",
