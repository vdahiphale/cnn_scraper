Sources tell CNN Trump is weighing a major change at the FBI as his allies lobby him to replace current FBI Director Chris Wray with MAGA Fire Brandon, Trump loyalist, Kash Patel.Now, Trump also just announced that Steven Cheung, his campaign spokesman, has been named as Assistant to the President and Director of Communications. And new details are surfacing about Trump's defense secretary pick. Officials in California confirming former Fox host and veteran Pete Hegseth was involved in a police investigation of a sexual assault allegation back in 2017. Now, all of this as Trump's pick for Attorney General is also facing growing skepticism and doubts he can get confirmed. Lawmakers in both parties are demanding to see findings of a House ethics investigation of former Congressman Matt Gaetz for allegations of sexual misconduct and illegal drug use. There's a lot there, but that's why we've got CNN's Kristen Holmes, who's joining us now. So, Kristen, in addition to Steven Cheung, Trump just brought on Sergio Gor as assistant to the president. I mean, we're throwing a lot of names out for people that may just be hearing them for the first time. So can you just give us a sense of what these additions actually mean for the shaping of this incoming administration?",

So protecting Matt Gaetz is part of being loyal to Donald Trump, here's what he said today when asked about that ethics report. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE JOHNSON, HOUSE SPEAKER: I do not. No, I think it's a terrible breach of protocol. The rules of the House have always been that a former member is beyond the jurisdiction of the Ethics Committee. And so I don't think that's relevant. I'm going to strongly request that the Ethics Committee not issue the report. That is not the way we do things in the House, and I think that would be a terrible precedent. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

By this point, what you have typically is the FBI is already starting to dig in some of these background checks.What you want is an incoming administration to be ready to hit the ground running, right? If there is a crisis that erupts, you want people in these jobs who already have the clearances, who already know everything that the current administration knows so that they can make the right decisions. And so there's vulnerabilities here that are built in if you don't do this. And so what we understand is happening is that behind the scenes, you know, they are -- the incoming transition has some doubts about how they're going to handle this. They haven't submitted some of these names. They haven't signed up -- signed these memorandums of understanding that would lead the way for the FBI to start doing this. Now, yes, a private company can do a lot of these checks. There's a lot of public information databases that they have access to. The FBI has more information that is not public, that they may not have access to. That's the reason why you would want this. There's a couple of reasons, right? There's national security risks about someone's contacts, certainly foreign contacts, their businesses that they might have that could potentially cause conflicts of interest. And you want to protect the country and the President, the President from embarrassment. And so we expect at least from two people we've talked to in the transition that they will submit names to the FBI eventually. They haven't done so yet, but there are some names that they are considering just bypassing the system entirely. Now the question is, will the Senate require background checks from the FBI for people who come for nominations? That's where this could change, right? The FBI could still end up doing it because the Senate requires it. That is, if the Senate Republicans agree to do it.",

And he has a long history of peddling things that aren't true and that have been disproven completely. Debunked by the science. And that to me is the most concerning part.I think it's fine if you want to raise questions. That's part of the scientific method is you ask question, you challenge scientific dogma and you say, is this still the case? Should we be doing more research? Those are fine questions to ask. But in the case of something like, are vaccines safe and effective? Are childhood vaccines for polio, measles, mumps, rubella that have been around for dozens of years, are they safe and effective? I mean, that answer has been settled. And it's extremely concerning to have someone overseeing health of the country who does not believe that. And that makes you wonder, what else is he going to do? What else does he not believe? How can we have someone who is insurance charge of science and health who doesn't actually understand or willingly disregards the scientific process?",

Stopping fluoridation does not rise to the same level of concern as, for example, defunding schools that require childhood vaccines. Medical experts and the American public need to save their outrage for when it's really warranted. So I just want you to expand on that a little bit.

This includes its aggressive suppression of psychedelics, peptides, stem cells, raw milk, hyperbaric therapies, collating compounds, Ivermectin, Hydroxychloroquine, vitamins, clean foods, sunshine, and exercise.

People need to be able to trust that the medications that are prescribed have gone through rigorous scientific studies as they are. Someone who is seeding doubt into that process, someone who questions the scientific process that is very well established, that's a really big problem.I think if he said, look, we want to make regulations or we want to decrease the administrative burden to get some of these newer therapies on board, no one would have a problem with that. Or if he's said, look, let's talk about the ultra-processed food and how that's contributing to the childhood obesity epidemic, no one would have a problem with that. The issue, though, is questioning the very foundation of how people can trust the information that they receive. And I would say that that would make my job as a physician and our jobs as public health communicators much more challenging. If we now cannot trust what is coming from our federal health agencies.",

I've been talking to sources who say the preparations underway include setting up a ton of executive actions that are similar to what he did the first time around. Think, for example, the remain in Mexico policy that's going to make a comeback. Asylum restrictions, more of those. Mandatory detention, ending the release of migrants.It's those types of executive actions that sources say will lay the groundwork for this mass attention to mass deportation. And we mentioned detention because you cannot deport if you're not detaining someone who you have arrested. And on that front, sources tell me that they have been looking at their regional capabilities. They have been looking at metropolitan areas to see where they can expand their facilities. That's not new, though. Homeland Security officials have done that before. And that's where, if you look at the bottom line of this, these ideas are not novel. There are ways to do it. Homeland Security officials have looked at these ways before when anticipating border surges or in the thick of border surges. But they want to build all of it to scale. And that's where it is different. And that is where there have been concerns and controversy over how exactly this would unfold. Now, one of the other things they're looking at is a national emergency declaration. Remember, they did that the first time around to unlock those Pentagon funds for the border wall. Well, they want to do that again, but this time to use military assets for this type of operation. Now, that face lawsuits the first time. They're prepared for that this time. But certainly all indicators are that they are looking at what they've done before, brushing it off, bringing it back and just doing it in what they see as a more effective way and at scale.",
