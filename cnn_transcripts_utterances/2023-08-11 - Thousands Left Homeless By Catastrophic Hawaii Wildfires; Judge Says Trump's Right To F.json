It was a horizontal fire that was chasing you.And the harbor was pitch black smoke. We got people off their boats in the harbor. They wanted to try to save their boats and, you know, we're like you're going to die. You got to come with us now. And so we got them out and driving out of the harbor it's pitch black dark because of the smoke. And you can just feel the heat. And we got them offshore that were -- there were some boats just that were empty and they were at anchor and we got them on those boats. And in the 70 mile an hour winds our -- I was going to go back into try to save my boat and the Dini motor in the 70 mile an hour winds. We took a wave and it killed the motor. And we were adrift heading out to sea but were luckily able -- as we were flying past a boat, I was able to throw a line and get that line to that boat. And we just watched our boats burn. The boat I have it's not a pleasure craft it's a boat that serves the community. And I just want everyone to know that I'm so sorry. And I tried my hardest to get to that boat to save it and I'm so sorry that I'm -- I feel like I let people down. It -- we took shelter on the 120 foot boat. And we got a call couple hours later that the Coast Guard had 100 people in the water and they needed help if there were any boats out there. I'm out there with Emma (ph), Nelson (ph), and Leshana (ph). We're -- all three of us were captain. And we knew that Dini motor was not reliable, but we got it to start again. And we made the decision to go help people. So that's that video that you saw of us going into the harbor where it's on fire looking for survivors.",

But even the things that she's done so far, have given limitations to Donald Trump and made clear that he needs to watch what he says publicly, versus what he's learning behind the scenes as he prepares for trial, even though he's a political candidate out there giving speeches and posting on social media.One of the things that she has already said that is going to happen is that when Donald Trump learns any information he didn't know before, from witness interviews that the Justice Department did, sensitive witness interviews, he's not going to be able to disclose that. That's an order from the court. And that is an order from the court that is going to be above and beyond any sort of free speech claims that Donald Trump may make. The judge here has been quite clear, saying that his speech is able to be limited, the First Amendment does have limitations to it, and that she is not going to be doing things based on what is happening in the political sphere. She is a judge, it is separate. One of the quotes that really jumps out from this hearing today, the fact that he is running a political campaign currently has to yield to the administration of justice. And if that means he can't say exactly what he wants to say in a political speech, that is just how it's going to have to be. And then also, she says I cannot and I will not factor into my decision what effect it will have on a political campaign for either side. And so there are still many arguments being made here. And they're talking about how Trump will be able to disclose or not disclosed largely not disclosed, information he's learning as he's getting evidence, and his lawyers are getting evidence in this case, and they prepare for trial. But also, Judge Chutkan is clearly issuing quite a warning to Trump and his defense team that he needs to be careful not to obstruct justices, not to intimidate witnesses. And that is a real thing, a real line that he could cross if he keeps talking publicly about witnesses in this case. She's really tried to avoid it being specifically about any witness in particular. His lawyers have brought up Mike Pence. That's something the Justice Department also had flagged here. But this is quite a clear sign from the judge. And on top of that, they're still working out some details in this situation, how much Trump can review evidence where he can review evidence, who can be with him. Also how they will designate the evidence in this case, as it gets handed over. What are the things that Trump specifically can't share more widely versus what can he incorporate into his political speech. And but so far, this is quite a set of things that the judge has said really taking on a lot more than just the legal issues in this case, which I might note have largely been in line with what Donald Trump's lawyers have agreed to or have proposed so far.",

She's going to treat running for president like she would treat any job, which is to say that, you know, the Iowa caucuses don't mean anything more to me than a business appointment that a defendant might have.So don't expect -- the implication there is don't expect the Iowa caucuses in and of themselves to delay a trial day. She also said the fact that he's running a political campaign currently has to yield to the administration of justice.

She's going to put into place the protective order. Trump is going to get all of the discovery immediately, discovery well beyond what he would be entitled to normally including witness statements that by law, don't even have to be turned over until after a witness testifies. I never did this before, in all my years as a prosecutor, never gave out this kind of information this far in advance.She's also signaled that on the 28th of August, when they discuss the trial date, this is going to go ahead quickly. Like I said before, it's going to be January or February. This case is going to move along. She's taken control. And it's so obvious if you look at the docket sheet, she was responding on Saturdays, Sundays. She was on top of this docket and what was being presented to her by the minute. I mean, it was just phenomenal. I never had a federal judge in any case, where there is a defense lawyer or a prosecutor be so on top of this.",
