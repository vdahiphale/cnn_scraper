I'm Eleni Giokos. This is \"Connect the World\". Now, in the next hour, a key hearing in the election subversion case against Donald Trump, the first since the Supreme Court ruled on broad presidential immunity. Plus, Vladimir Putin raises eyebrows by saying he supports Kamala Harris in the U.S. Presidential Race. And did Pope Francis just have his own childless cat lady's moment the Pontiff weighing in on people who have pets instead of children? All right, let the stock markets in New York will open in about 30 minutes from now, checking in on how the futures are looking. As you can see, flat with a negative bias, and that's after two straight days down days for S&amp;P as well as nada NASDAQ. Not much clear direction, as you can see, we've seen another slide in tech stocks on Wednesday. And we've seen big falls in recent days for Chipmaker Nvidia, which, of course, is affecting market sentiment overall. We'll check in on those markets in about 30 minutes from now. Well, in the meantime, we begin in Georgia, where another U.S. community is in mourning from a deadly school shooting. Police say a 14-years-old suspect killed four people and injured nine others during Wednesday's tragedy at a high school near Atlanta. It is the deadliest of 45 school shootings in the U.S. this year. Now, the suspect, a student at the school, surrendered when confronted by police. His victims included two 14-years-old students and two math teachers. Officials say they are still investigating a motive for the killings. Now, several students spoke with CNN about the horror they witnessed. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And Francis made the remark in a slightly jokey way, but with a very serious undertone. Of course, this is an issue that Pope Francis has talked about a number of times in the past. He is concerned about low birth rates in Europe, particularly in his doorstep in Italy, he has lamented couples choosing not to have children, and when it comes to pets, preferring pets over children. Francis has often told the story that he once witnessed a woman in St Peter's Square pushing a pram, and in the pram there's not a baby, but a pet dog. So, this is something that Pope Francis has talked about a number of times before. He is concerned about low birth rates. He's also worked with the Italian government on this issue. And here in Indonesia, he raised this question, this topic, because he sees here families with a number of children, and that's clearly something that has struck him and impressed him, but I think the main focus of the trip here in Indonesia has been interfaith dialog. And Francis this morning at the Istiqlal Mosque, the largest in South East Asia, for a very moving and powerful encounter with other religions, including the grand imam of Indonesia, the two of them wearing white and embracing each other in a sign of that interfaith friendship and harmony that the pope wants to promote. This afternoon, Thursday, Francis was celebrating a mass packed stadium. There were people outside an enthusiastic welcome for the pontiff. Indonesian Catholics are a minority here in the world's most populous Muslim country. They make up about 8.6 million. Francis tomorrow, Friday is going to Papua New Guinea, the next stop in his marathon, 12 day South East Asian and Pacific tour. We'll see how it goes for the next few days, Eleni.",

The judge will hear arguments about the potential next steps in the case. Trump himself will not be present, but we'll be covering that as the hearing goes on. All right. Instead, the former president is gearing up to make his economic pitch to voters. He will speak at the Economic Club of New York in the next few hours. Among his proposals, if elected, trillions of dollars in tax cuts and big tariffs on imported goods. Some economists already sounding the alarm bell about what that would lead to.

      "sentences": "Well, Eleni, over the years, I've talked to a lot of economists about a lot of different policy ideas. And I'm not sure I'veever heard them as uniformly alarmed about an idea as they are about Trump's trade agenda. Remember, he waged a trade war during his first term in office, and he's basically calling for tripling down on that, right? He says he wants a 10 to 20 percent tariff on all $3 trillion of U.S. imports. Not only that, but he wants a 60 percent tariff on all U.S. imports from China. 60 percent that is massive. Now, in theory, those tariffs could be used to bring in trillions of dollars of revenue that would maybe help pay for his massive tax cuts. Maybe Trump will argue that this will also be a way to punish China and other countries for trade tactics that Republicans and Democrats agree, are unfairly hurting American workers. But in reality, mainstream economists that I talk to their word that all this is going to backfire, that the tariffs are going to make inflation worse, kill jobs and potentially set off a global trade war. JP Morgan's David Kelly, he told me this is a very bad idea. He described tariffs as, quote, magical economic proposals that can actually cause inflation and put you into a recession at the same time. Douglas Holtz- Eakin, a Former McCain and George H. W. Bush Advisor, he told me that this is, quote, terrible economic policy. The concern is that all of us are going to be paying the price. Recent research from the Peterson Institute found that the typical middle-class family would pay an extra $2,600 a year because of these Trump tariff proposals. That's a year. And importantly, that doesn't even account for the almost definite retaliation that we'd see from other countries that are obviously not going to take this lying down. Now the Trump campaign, of course, is pushing back here. They're arguing that Trump successfully was able to cut taxes and impose tariffs and create millions of jobs along the way. Trump campaign spokesperson told me that so called economists and experts doubted President Trump's economic plans in his first term, and they will be proven wrong then. They were proven wrong then, and they'll be proven wrong again, Eleni.",
