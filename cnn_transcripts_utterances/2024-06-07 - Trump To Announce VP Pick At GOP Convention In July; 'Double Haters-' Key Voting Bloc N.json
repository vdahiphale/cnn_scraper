But look, they all bent the knee, and there's nothing Donald Trump loves more than taking these people who once opposed him and making them bow down and beg for a job.I will say it's interesting. I really thought Trump was going to pick a woman ultimately, but we have seen multiple of the women who sort of would have been top contenders kind of self-Immolate on the tarmac, you know, like Kristie Noem had the unfortunate incident with the dog, and Katie Britt had her unfortunate, very strange response after the State of the Union. And so they're no longer on there at Elise Stefanik, the only woman sort of still in the mix. You know, Donald Trump does like the theatrics, though, of some of these things, I always kind of thought he would try to pick somebody who was newsy. But the more I watch this, the more I think Marco Rubio makes sense for him, in part because you get to humiliate him just a little bit by making him change move out of Florida so he could do it. But also it does bring Normie (ph) Republicans on side, in a way that Donald Trump has mostly done anyway.

I just -- it's also the interesting, like, arc of the never Trumpers, like most people, started like, okay, I'll vote for Trump, and then slowly progress to never Trumpers.

They couldn't stomach Hillary Clinton in 2016 they were lifelong Republicans who couldn't imagine voting for a Democrat. Some of them remember watching the apprentice and admiring Trump for his perceived business savvy. But the events of January 6 and general fatigue with Trump's antics have made these voters not very likely, or not at all likely, to vote for him again in 2024.\"Sarah, bring us inside the room.

This was an independent trial brought by the state of New York, and 12 independent jurors found the former president guilty on all counts. It was a unanimous decision, and it's a fact.

I was in Congress when he was in the White House. And we saw the attacks, not only against women, against families, but we also saw his attacks and demonizing immigrants.
