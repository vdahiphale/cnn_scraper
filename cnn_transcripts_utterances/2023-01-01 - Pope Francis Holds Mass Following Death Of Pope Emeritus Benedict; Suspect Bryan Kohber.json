There's other businesses who've been impacted where students have left because they just don't feel safe being in this city. And so they've been studying virtually.

The IRS is adjusting the tax code for next year so that more of your 2023 wages may be subject to lower tax rates than they were this year. And you may be able to deduct higher amounts of income.Here with me now to discuss this further is Mark Luscombe. He is a principal analyst at Walter's Clover Tax and Accounting. Mark, good morning to you. Thank you so much for joining us. So, as we know, this could really help Americans deal with rising prices, and I do want to show some numbers. So, standard deduction goes up by 7 percent. That's the biggest increase since at least 1985. And for individuals, it was almost 13,000 in 2022. That goes up to almost 14,000, an increase of $900,000 and $27,700 for married couples filing jointly, that's $1,800 of an increase from 2022. [06:15:09] So a lot of numbers here, Mark. Break it down for us and who benefits the most from these deductions? MARK LUSCOMBE, PRINCIPAL ANALYST, WOLTERS KLUWER TAX &amp; ACCOUNTING: Well, sure. Thank you. Glad to be here. The goal of the inflation adjustments is obviously to keep taxpayers in the same position they would have been, had there not been the inflationary period we've had over the last year. So the -- if you are a taxpayer whose income has not gone up that same 7 percent, then you would see a lower tax bill because more of your income would fall in that higher standard deduction, or more of your income would fall in a lower tax bracket. If, however, you've been lucky enough that your income has gone up that 7 percent along with inflation, then the goal is to keep you in the same place so that your taxes will be about the same as they were in the past.",

But sources tell me and my colleague Lauren Fox that there were no major break throughs. This despite the fact that Kevin McCarthy has offered a number of concessions to his criticsThat includes agreeing to an investigative panel to centralize all the probes into the Biden administration. That's something conservatives have really been clamoring for, and perhaps most notably here. McCarthy has agreed to a lower threshold for a vote on triggering -- a vote on deposing the sitting speaker. That is something known as the motion to vacate the Speaker's chair. It has been a chief demand of his conservative critics. Up until this point, McCarthy has been really reluctant to budge on the issue. That is because he's essentially giving power to his critics to fire him at any given notice. But as he has struggled to lock down the votes for speaker, he is now willing to come down to a threshold as low as five people, sources tell CNN. So that would be a major concession for Kevin McCarthy. However, moderates in the party said on the conference call on Friday that they are very uncomfortable with that idea. And meanwhile, the critics who are pushing for that threshold still wouldn't commit to voting for Kevin McCarthy. So they wrapped the call, agreeing to work through the weekend. They are hoping to resolve some of these outstanding issues and then finalize a rules package and then hope that everything else sort of just falls into place.

So, while it's clear COVID-19 is here to stay, other health issues began to take the spotlight once again. And some of it is very good news, starting with number 10 of our top health story. GUPTA (voiceover): More people are surviving cancer than ever before in the United States. In the past three years, the number of cancer survivors increased by more than one million. The big reasons why, a continued decline to smoking. And we are catching and treating cancer earlier as well. But there's still more to be done. DR.

GUPTA: While the data is encouraging there, there are also some serious safety concerns in the phase three trial, brain swelling and brain bleeding. Those are certainly things the FDA is going to evaluate if the drug comes up for approval. Number eight, mental health.
