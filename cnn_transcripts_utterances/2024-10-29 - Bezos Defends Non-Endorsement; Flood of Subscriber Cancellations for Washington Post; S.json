Tonight, Kamala Harris set to deliver the closingargument of that presidential campaign, and she'll do so at the same place where Donald Trump rallied his supporters on January the 6th, leading, of course, to the Capitol insurrection. For his part, Trump is heading to swing state, Pennsylvania, where he could face the fury of Puerto Rican voters following this racist remarks at a rally of his. And a closer look at the Arab-American vote. How disillusionment of America's role in the war in Gaza could shift traditional voting rights. That conversation coming up for you. But first tonight, it is full speed ahead for both candidates with one week left in a race to the White House that has been one of the most unpredictable, I think it's fair to say in U.S. history. Fresh CNN polling, we have this to show you released just a short time ago shows that Kamala Harris and Donald Trump remain pretty much in a virtual tie in the critical battlegrounds of Nevada as well as Arizona. Both states have a sizable number, important to say of Latino voters. Later today, the Vice President is scheduled to give her closing argument. That's where advisors say she'll try to strike a balance between the dangers of a second Trump term, and her vision for the country moving forward. Harris will speak at The Ellipse in Washington where Donald Trump rallied supporters just before the January 6th attack on the Capitol. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES &amp; DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  There is a huge contrast in this election, and I'd ask us to just imagine the Oval Office in three months, OK, so just picture it in your head.

Of course, security has been a major issue on the campaign trail this year with the two assassination attempts against Donald Trump. According to the National Park Service which grants permits for these kinds of events, they're expecting 40,000 people on The Ellipse. If that's true, that would be the biggest event at the space since the January 6th rally that Donald Trump headlined back in 2021. It remains to be seen whether or not that will actually be the crowd count, but that would be the biggest campaign rally that Kamala Harris has had this entire campaign season. Of course, the enclosed space is just part of where this is, outside of that is the National Mall writ large, and they have also permitted areas of that space as well for her -- for her crowds and for her supporters.

And the setting for today is serendipitous, and that he is going to the heart of the Puerto Rican community in the most critical battleground state, which is Pennsylvania. And he actually intended already to have a lineup that was going to attempt to speak to the Latino and Puerto Rican community there. The shadow senator for Puerto Rico, Zoraida Buxo; she is the elected representative, she doesn't get a vote in the Senate, but she does get to represent Puerto Rico's issues and lobby on behalf of Puerto Rico to the Senate. She was going to -- she was always intending to be at this rally to speak at this event, and now obviously, that comes much higher urgency, given what transpired on Sunday. And I think you're going to see more in his -- in his speech as well as in the pre-programming that is speaking directly to any sort  of undecided Latino and Puerto Rican voters. One thing to point out is that unlike other Hispanic Latino and Spanish-speaking voters, Puerto Ricans vote -- tend to vote at a much lower rate historically than Venezuelans or Mexican- Americans or other Latino groups. And so, one thing for both sides trying to go into this closing stretch is trying to inch up that number just a bit to help them win these very tight battlegrounds.",

We're hearing that law enforcement are ramping up their patrols around drop boxes. And to keep in mind why these drop boxes are such a vulnerable target here, especially in Oregon and Washington states, is because those two states, primarily are vote by mail. That means every voter receives a ballot in the mail at home, and the vast majority drop them off or mail them back in -- for example, in the Portland and Seattle areas, less than 1 percent of voters actually vote in-person. So, you can tell just how much these drop-boxes are used. This is definitely something federal officials are also keeping an eye on. CNN obtained a bulletin released by the Department of Homeland Security in September, talking about how they are concerned about domestic extremists who potentially would like to meddle with the elections process, and saying that ballot drop boxes can be a quote, \"attractive target\", Isa.",

They feel frustrated that the United States under the Biden administration, which has offered so much support to the Israeli government has failed to exercise due leverage over the Israeli government to push for an expedited end of the war. Hamas is in fact weakened, but they feel that this is going to be an ongoing conflict and the United States is doing nothing to stop it. On the other hand, we've seen this, what I would personally label as a nefarious exploitation of this frustration by former President Trump, who has been pushing for, on the one hand Israel to do what it needs to finish Hamas off, on the other hand, claiming that he would bring the war to a rapid end, playing both sides effectively.",

I think the jury is still out as to the tactical steps that she would take initially, but her framing, what she has been saying has been in fact, positive, has been in fact promising and optimistic for many in the Arab and Palestinian community. Myself included, some have pushed for a partial arms embargo on Israel, something that she has not supported and it seems highly unlikely she'll support. Others have called for U.S. support of international mandate if you will, as part of a transitional period to basically open Gaza up to allow a multilateral approach with U.S. support to go in there, administer humanitarian aid and reconstruct the Gaza Strip. It remains to be seen what the actual policy steps are.

But many more bodies are still believed to be under the rubble. And in addition to just the number of casualties, of which 25 were children, according to that Palestinian ministry of health, it's also about the process of trying to save those who survived and trying to recover the bodies who are beneath the rubble. And all of that is being affected by the dire humanitarian situation in Northern Gaza. The lack of heavy machinery of the Palestinian civil defense to be able to get to this area, because of the Israeli military blocking access, the lack of ambulances in the area, requiring donkey carts to be used instead to drag out the bodies from the rubble. And we are also seeing that those who were injured and arrived at Kamal Adwan hospital, one of the few remaining hospitals in Northern Gaza are also, of course, facing difficulties because of the lack of medical supplies, because of the fact that the majority of the health care workers at that hospital were detained in a recent Israeli military raid. Now, in terms of the why, why did the Israeli military strike this building where some 200 people were apparently living? And we just got a response from the IDF spokesman, David Avram (ph), speaking to our Matthew Chance, who said that this area in Beit Lahiya was meant to be evacuated, but that they did not intend to collapse this building in this strike. The spokesman said that the Israeli military was targeting a suspected terrorist that they saw in the area and that they are going to investigate what happened. Isa.",
