      "sentences": "Thank you for joining us here on CNN. We begin with new dramatic video released by the Ukrainian government, which they say is a drone attack on a Russian warship in the Black Sea.The video is recorded from the unmanned drone as it zeroes in on its target at high speed. The CNN analysis found the ship is likely the Ivan Khurs, one of the most modern in the Russian fleet in the Black Sea. The images, though, suddenly stop before the moment of impact, and Moscow says the Ukrainian attack was unsuccessful, and the ship sustained no damage. Meantime, Moscow-backed officials are blaming Ukraine for a missile strike in the Russian-occupied city of Berdyansk. They believe Ukraine may have used the long-range Storm Shadow cruise missiles recently supplied by Britain. Berdyansk is deep behind the front lines, which would make those missiles a likely choice. And just days after claiming victory in the battle for Bakhmut, Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the Wagner mercenary group, says his forces are beginning a week long withdrawal, replaced by Russian regular troops. Prigozhin's claim had not been independently verified, and there are questions over the Russians' military ability to hold and defend the city from Ukrainian fighters, who are believed to still have a foothold in Bakhmut's outer suburbs. For more, here's Fred Pleitgen, reporting in from Kyiv. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): Just as the Ukraine military say their forces are retaking ground on the outskirts of Bakhmut, Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin says his mercenaries are on the moving out. \"That's it, moving out in 10 to 15 minutes,\" he tells these tankers. \"Everyone leaves before June 1. We'll rest, prepare, and then get a new task.\" Wagner's exit could mark a turning point in one of the bloodiest battles in Europe since World War II. The mercenaries' assaulted Bakhmut for months, often using human waves to try and storm Ukrainian positions. Prigozhin trying to prove to Putin his hired guns can get the job done, where regular Russian units failed. Even during the withdrawal, a swipe at Russia's defense minister. Prigozhin joking, he'll leave two scrawny fighters behind to help the army when they take over Wagner's positions. \"That is Bieber (ph), and that's Douck (ph),\" he says. \"The moment the military are in a tough position, they'll stand up and block the Ukrainian army: 'Guys, don't bully the military.'\" While the Ukrainians tell CNN they cannot confirm Wagner is really pulling out of Bakhmut, they believe a withdrawal could give them a boost and Kyiv's quest to retake the city. SERHII CHEREVATYI, UKRAINIAN ARMED FORCES (through translator): Compared to other units of the Russian army, Wagner did fight better and conducted more offensive actions. But this was literally due to bloody discipline and threats of execution. PLEITGEN (voice-over): While Moscow's army struggles in Ukraine, Russians clearly feel threatened on the home front, as well. The intelligence service FSB releasing dramatic footage of arrest from earlier this month of what they claim were Ukrainian intelligence operatives plotting to attack two nuclear power plants in Northwestern Russia. While the Ukrainians haven't commented, Russia blames Kyiv. Moscow also lashing out after a U.S. intelligence assessment saying Ukraine may have been behind a drone attack on the Kremlin in early May. DMITRY PESKOV, KREMLIN SPOKESMAN (through translator): Behind this is the Kyiv regime. We know this, and we are carrying out our work based on this. PLEITGEN (voice-over): Russia using the incident to justify its war against Ukraine. Putin's top mercenary is recouping's forces and vowing to return. Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Kyiv. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Now, Rhodes spoke to the judge today and said that he had no remorse at all, that he still believed that the election of 2020 was illegal, that this was an illegitimate government governing the United States. And so the judge responded to that quite harshly, telling Rhodes that his crimes of seditious conspiracy and other crimes amounted to domestic terrorism in his sentencing and also that he believed Rhodes poses a continuing ongoing threat to the American republic, to American democracy. There was another person sentenced today, too, a deputy who was working with Rhodes on January 6, a man named Kelly Meggs from Florida. Meggs was a very different defendant, in that he did express remorse. He said he was sorry to be involved in an event that put such a black eye on the country. But the judge also gave him quite a significant sentence, believing it, too, amounted to a crime of domestic terrorism, seditious conspiracy, and the judge gave him 12 years. Kelly Meggs, whenever he was receiving his sentence, was crying, but the judge also took a step back and told him quite sternly that violence was not the answer and is not the answer for people who disagree with the political process in the United States. Judge Amit Mehta, he also said, \"We have a process. It is called an election. You don't take it to the streets with rifles. You don't hope that the president invokes the Insurrection Act so you can start a war in the streets. You don't rush into the U.S. Capitol with the hope to stop the electoral vote count.

But, that's actually whether you were actually vaccinated or from infection. So you're -- the vaccination protects you from dying, but in terms of long COVID, the actual -- according to the newest large study by NIH -- it's called a cover study -- it's actually similar.

And by that, models estimate well over one and a half million, 2 million or more people actually died in China. It's just under reported. But based on the models for many sources, that seems to be the number of how many people have suffered. But in this new wave, they're actually estimating 40 million new cases per week in May and 65 million more cases per week in June. Sixty-five million is like 5 percent of China's population.

Basically, two variants came together, did a little mixing, and now we have XBB strain. XBB in many ways, although it's a type of Omicron, it is a very different version. It's further from the original Omicron wave that we had, like, two years ago than -- than actually, then, the first, you know, Wuhan strain.
