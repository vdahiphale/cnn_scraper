      "sentences": "Straight from THE SOURCE tonight.Both Donald Trump and Joe Biden's campaigns are prepping for a verdict. The question that still remains, guilty or not guilty? We are potentially days away from knowing as the presumptive Republican nominee is lashing out on social media. He calls himself the law-and-order president. But of all the people to invite on stage, last night, Donald Trump picked two rappers, who are awaiting trial on murder conspiracy charges. We have the details. Also, three missionaries, who were gunned down in Haiti, including a married couple from the United States. We're learning new details of their tragic deaths. And we'll speak with one of the victim's fathers tonight. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. We're really finding ourselves on the cusp of history tonight, because by this time, next week, we may finally know whether or not Donald Trump will be a convicted felon, or whether a jury of his peers, here in Manhattan, will find him not guilty. It's hard to think of a more memorable, or really, a more stressful Memorial Day weekend. It's hard to even imagine what it's like, for this jury that is made up of seven men and five women, all 12 of whom are about to decide the former President's fate. Both the defense and the prosecution are now preparing for their closing arguments that they'll deliver this coming Tuesday. And we've just learned tonight that both parties now have in their hands, the jury instructions. It's a crucial document given -- it's what jurors will hear from the judge, before they begin to deliberate, and make their decision. It'll outline what they should consider, when they're determining if Trump is indeed guilty or not. And all of that is certainly on the former President's mind tonight. It's not hard to tell, because he is posting up a storm about the case. In one post, tonight, he's ranting that the judge blocked him from having an election expert testify. But that's not true. We were there. We witnessed this discussion that happened inside the courtroom. Trump's attorneys, in the end, chose not to call that election expert, because the judge refused to broaden the scope of what he could testify to. He was worried it would become, as the judge put it, a battle of the experts. As we know, Trump also could have testified in his own defense here. He said that he would, at the beginning. But in the end, he opted not to, as is his choice. So, what happens if Trump is convicted next week? The possibility of prison time, we know, does exist. But prosecutors aren't expected to ask that of the former President that he be taken into custody immediately if he is. And of course, that is a big if, tonight. I'm joined by a pair of legal sources. Retired New York City Criminal Court Judge, George Grasso, and who has been sitting in that New York court. I've seen him in there every single day that I've been in there. As well as jury consultant, Renato Stabile, who has been here many times as well. I mean, we are really in the final countdown of what we've been talking for six weeks about what these jurors have heard, what the two sides have argued. With these jury instructions that both side got, we confirmed last night, both the prosecution and the defense got, what the judge heard. And you were in the room as they were arguing about this.",

What they want is to limit his ability to comment about law enforcement that searched his Mar-a- Lago resort, two years ago.The request is a first, in this case. But here is the important context. It comes after the former President, and many of his Republican allies, have been repeatedly exaggerating, and falsely criticizing the FBI, for the use of deadly-force policy that was in place, during that search of his Mar-a-Lago resort, for the classified documents, after he did not turn them over, in response to a subpoena. Now, we saw Attorney General, Merrick Garland, pushing back on this, this week, and talking about how dangerous he believes it is, because of course, this is a standard operating procedure for the FBI, when this search happens. They actually went into Mar-a-Lago, with a much lighter presence than even authorized by a search warrant that was authorized by a magistrate judge in the State of Florida. They did not have their guns drawn. They were not wearing FBI shirts, and instead wore normal clothes. But that does not stop the former President from repeatedly going on social media, and targeting these law enforcement officers, who were there. Of course, they have their names, given they have the documents. They've been redacted in the filings that we have seen. But this is a notable first, in this case. We have our legal experts back here with us, as this news is just breaking. And Judge, I mean, this isn't Trump's first time with a gag order. We'll see if it actually gets authorized. But it is remarkable that Jack Smith feels the need to ask for this. Because it's not just Trump. We've also seen Senator Ted Cruz, Marjorie Taylor Greene, all of these Republicans, going after and saying -- it Trump's fundraising, saying that they had authorized for the FBI to assassinate him.",

So, reading this not only as a judge, but as a proud former member of law enforcement, this is outrageous. I mean, just reading from the document. The next day, Trump publicly claimed he was just shown reports that crooked Joe Biden's DOJ, in their illegal and unconstitutional raid Mar-a-Lago, then in all-caps, \"AUTHORIZED THE FBI TO USE DEADLY (LETHAL) FORCE.\" Trump also sent an email stated the government was authorized, in all- caps, \"To shoot me now.\" I'm thinking this through. And I'm obviously drawing the parallel to what Judge Merchan was just -- has been dealing with, in the New York trial, to protect witnesses, and the jury, and everybody else involved in this process. Now, sooner or later, I would imagine, in this case, FBI agents are going to be called to testify. People are going to know who they are. Now, this isn't just some crank (ph) Trump. This is somebody who just put something on Truth Social. He brags about it. Millions of people see it simultaneously. And there are a subset of people in that group, and potentially are dangerous that they're going to take this, and believe this.

On top of that, they say there is the possibility this could harm the jury.

This was nothing, out of the normal, for the search of Mar-a-Lago, in August of 2022.

This is an extraordinary step, by Special Counsel, Jack Smith, one that we have not seen him take yet. And for more on this, I want to bring in the former FBI Deputy Director, Andrew McCabe.

It tells them where to go, when to be there, who's going to be driving, which vehicles, all sorts of things like that. This particular section is required. It's not -- it is part of the form, like it's not even something that agents have to type in on every plan, because it's baked into the form. And that is a recitation of the DOJ's authorization to use legal force -- I'm sorry, lethal force. The reason it's there is to make sure that every agent, who goes out on this operation, understands the limits of using lethal force, that they're only authorized to use it, to protect their life or the life of someone else. It is not an authorization, or some sort of statement of intent or direction for the operation. It is the legal limit, on how agents can use lethal force, in the course of their duties.

And he was somebody who, we know, did vote to make the right decision and certify the vote. But he wouldn't say whether he would do it in 2024, if Joe Biden won. And so, I think that will be a deciding factor. And that's why you're seeing all of these VP candidates twist themselves into pretzels, if they're asked that question publicly. And they're not going to say whether they would certify the election, because that would essentially put a black mark, and kind of take them out of contention.
