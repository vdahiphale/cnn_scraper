I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.Today, Vice President Kamala Harris is preparing for the most significant moment of her political career. In less than 48 hours, she will face Donald Trump on the debate stage for the first and perhaps only time before Election Day. But now, after weeks, of Democratic momentum, a new poll is showing just how close this race is with no clear leader in the most recent matchup. CNN's Harry Enten is here to break down the numbers. Harry, it's just one poll, but, I mean, it hit people over the head here in Washington like a two by four. What is this telling you about the momentum behind Harris' candidacy? What's happening?",

And give you an idea that this is actually Donald Trump's best national poll that we've seen in a while, but we've seen a bunch of polls come out over the last few weeks. And remember, Jim, there are margins of error.So, you know, you mentioned that New York Times poll. When you look at the margin unrounded, what you see is Donald Trump up by two points, but, again, within the margin of error. But we had Quinnipiac just a little bit while ago, Harris was up one. The Wall Street Journal, Harris was up one. There was the ABC News poll among likely voters that had Harris up by six points. So, the bottom line is, yes, this is a good poll for Donald Trump, but we shouldn't lose sight of the fact that there have been a bunch of other polls that show something a little bit different. And when you put the average of it all together, what you essentially get is Harris up by, let's say, about two points. But, again, Jim, that is way, way too close to call. A lot on the line tomorrow night in Philadelphia. Yes, I mean, it feels like a jump all race right now, Harry. And what about the issues? How are voters comparing the candidates on the major issues?",

All right, who do you trust more on your most important issue? And I want you to look back at 2024, where we are now, and then look back at 2020. If you go back to 2020, when you matched up the Democratic Party versus the Republican Party, Democrats held an eight point edge on the issue that voters or adults said that was most important to them.Look at where we are today in that New York Times/Siena College poll. Look at this. When you match up Harrison Trump, who do voters trust more on the issue that's most important to them? They favor Trump by five points. So, the bottom line is, yes, this is a close margin. This is within the margin. But it's just vastly different from where we were four years ago, when Democrats are overwhelmingly trusted. Now, the issues are on Donald Trump's side, not, in fact, the Democrats or Kamala Harris' side.",

I'm not that surprised. And, yes, she can fill in some of the blanks in a positive way, despite, no doubt, Trump's attacks that are forthcoming, but let's also remember, this is not a usual regular election. You've got the other candidate, Donald Trump, who is disliked intensely by a very large portion of the American electorate. I don't think they need a whole lot more information about Kamala Harris in order to vote for her to stop Donald Trump.So, normally, it would be more important than I think it is right now. And just to add one thing, Jim, The New York Times polls, New York Times/Siena poll, as Harry Enten correctly said, and you said, is just one poll. Just because it's The New York Times, it has a great impact. This makes me deeply regret the loss of the Gallup poll, which was the gold standard.

That's because as this poll shows and frankly some of the internal data I'm looking at shows we do have a gap to make up, no question.The difference, I'd rather be in our position than Trump's position because there are still voters out there who are interested in potentially voting for her, former Nikki Haley voters.

Really solid Americans with integrity are running our elections at every level in every state. And the American public needs to know. Your vote is safe. Your vote is secure. It's going to get counted well. Because the same types of systems across the country have continued to be run. We know there's no widespread fraud. There's never been any evidence of any wrongdoing. And so to folks who are out there making these claims, they need to look at the facts and not the fictions, and particularly not the grievances of one single person.
