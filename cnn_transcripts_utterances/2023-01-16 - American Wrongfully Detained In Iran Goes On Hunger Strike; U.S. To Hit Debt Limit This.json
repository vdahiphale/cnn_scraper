      "sentences": "Yes, listen, he wrote a pretty moving letter to President Biden, Erica. In part of that letter, he describes just how challenging it has been for him to be in Iranian prison for more than seven years now.Saying one of the hardest questions for him to answer is, how is he doing. Because he says, how is he supposed to tell people how he's doing when he has been left behind, left in Iran when other Americans have been detained and then been released as part of prisoner swaps and other efforts by the U.S. government? And this week marks seven years since there were five Americans who were freed from Iranian detention. And he was in Iranian prison at the time, and he was left behind. So he is reminding President Biden of that awful anniversary for him. Biden was then-vice president during the Obama administration. What he's asking Biden to do is spend one moment every single day to remember him and the fact that he has been in Iranian prison. He has been interrogated in Iranian prison for the last seven years. Of course, we have seen other Americans who have been wrongfully detained abroad and their family members trying to attract the attention of the president because they believe that he is the person, the key person to be able to kind of secure their release. They think if he put some personal attention on it, then they have a higher likelihood of getting out. Now the National Security Council told us that they are intensely focused on trying to secure Siamak Namazi's release and the two other Americans who are still wrongfully detained in Iran. But we should note that U.S.-Iran relations are quite hostile right now. Of course, we haven't had diplomatic relations with Iran in decades now. But just the general tone of the relationship, given the fact that there are no current talks to revive the Iran nuclear deal -- those efforts are on the back burner. Given the fact that the U.S. has been very critical of the Iranian regime's crackdown on protesters in the country, things just aren't great right now -- Erica?",

As in this Thursday.If that happens, the Biden administration would have to take what are known as extraordinary measures, immediate action to avert a full- blown economic disaster. Let's bring in CNN's Richard Quest and Melanie Zanona. Melanie on Capitol Hill. Richard, first to you. First the word \"debt ceiling, I think for a lot of this makes eyes glaze over. This is a big deal. Remind us what the debt ceiling is and what could potentially happen if we hit that limit. What could happen on Thursday? RICHARD QUEST, CNN BUSINESS EDITOR-AT-LARGE &amp; CNN ANCHOR, \"QUEST MEANS BUSINESS\": Sure. Absolutely. The debt ceiling is nothing more than your overdraft. You can write it big and small. You can make it as complicated as you like. But the truth is the U.S. federal government has a debt ceiling, has an overdraft of $31.4 trillion. It's used to pay for debt interest, for the military, for -- there's all sorts of things that it's paying for. But it is nothing more exciting than the federal government's overdraft to pay for things that Congress has already approved. It's really important to remember that. This isn't new spending. This is spending that the government and Congress has already approved. So the debt ceiling has been -- the overdraft -- let's keep it in nice language. The overdraft has been raised by 78 times. Even stevens between Republicans and Democrats, 29 by the Democrats, set 49 by the Republicans. But as you get closer and once you hit your overdraft, then you have these extraordinary measures. Again, let me simplify. It's nothing more than robbing Peter to pay Paul. You are doing literally where's the money. The treasury, Janet Yellen, I won't pay that there, pay this here, and this pension fund won't get paid now and we'll pay more in a week or three's time. Everybody gets paid in the end. But you do have to move the money around because you can't borrow more. If there's no deal by June, god help us. Because if there's no deal by June, you are looking at Janet Yellen running out of robbing Peter to pay Paul. You're running out of the ability to move the money. And then you have just one simple option -- default. You don't pay a bill. That is so horrific to think about that the U.S. government would default that nobody wants to go there, not yet.",

In fact, Democratic leaders are calling for a clean debt ceiling hike, noting that Republicans raised the debt ceiling multiple times under former President Donald Trump and didn't put any conditions on it. So this is really shaping up to be a massive showdown on Capitol Hill. Now, McCarthy said he wants to sit down and meet with President Biden and to start those sorts of negotiations and figure out a path forward. That hasn't happened yet. But in the meantime, Republicans are preparing emergency contingency plans. Sources tell me that House Republicans are preparing to pass a proposal that would direct the Treasury Department over which payments to prioritize in case the nation does default on its debt. So it's really a sign of how serious and real this threat has become -- Erica?",

And the Hill, it's a collaborative place. It calls into question how effective he can be as a member of Congress. Here are what some other House Republicans are saying: (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. CHRIS STEWART (R-UT): It's pretty hard not to conclude he's a bit of a goofball. He clearly lied to his constituents. And to your point, as well, it's going to be very, very difficult for him to gain the trust of his colleagues. And I don't know what he's going to do.

New York Congressman Dan Goldman and Ritchie Torres, they sent a letter to Speaker Kevin McCarthy, the House GOP chair, the president of the Congressional Leadership Fund, the CLF. That's a super PAC affiliated with the House GOP. And in the letter, they cited new reporting indicating they had at least some knowledge of the lies Santos used to deceive his voters.
