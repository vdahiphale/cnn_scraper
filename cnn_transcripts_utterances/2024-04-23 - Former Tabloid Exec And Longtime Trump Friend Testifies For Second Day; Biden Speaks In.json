At this point, they are still scrambling to understand what the allegation is and whether she wants to go public with it or if she'd rather not.So I think what we will hear next from David Pecker is he will then explain how they agreed to make this $150,000 payment to her that AMI, his company did, and then that there was some cold feet about it after the fact. And this will then tee up the Stormy Daniels payment because there were three catch-and-kill deals as part of this alleged pattern that prosecutors have put out. And we've now heard testimony about the first two, Stormy Daniels will follow. And that will get to the center of this case, this main allegation here, the $130,000 payment, and then the eventual cover-up that prosecutors say took place through the falsification of business records. So we're getting now into kind of the meat of the case, getting into the core part of, what prosecutors say was this conspiracy to influence the 2016 presidential election.",

And the Biden campaign yesterday saying that it will affect women all across the Southeast who would be traveling to find care elsewhere.Now, this is the first official stop in the Tampa Bay area by President Biden in the 2024 election. And so it's certainly the campaign believes that this area, despite the fact that it's trending Republican, could potentially be winnable if this abortion issue is the one that galvanizes voters. Traditionally, we have seen Vice President Kamala Harris, the one that is fronting the message on abortion access and reproductive rights. And even just a few weeks ago, the White House declining to say whether President Biden, who as a lifelong Catholic has held evolving and complex views on the topic would be personally stumping on this issue. But clearly, the campaign not only sees this as one that will really light a fire under voters in certain swing states and potentially in Florida, but it's also an issue that allows them to draw a direct and substantive contrast with former President Donald Trump as he sits in a courtroom in New York City.

      "sentences": "Yes. So right now, what you're seeing behind me is the encampment that has been the center of protests, not just here at Columbia, but of course the types of protests that have emanated to campuses across the country. This encampment is now in its seventh day, and they say their core reason for being here is they want the university to divest in corporations they say are profiting from Israeli apartheid and genocide.Now, in the initial few days of this encampment existing, the New York Police Department, the NYPD, was called in to clear out this encampment, and it's part of why, one, they are still facing some criticism internally for that, but also it's part of why these students or at least these protesters here, say that that was what raised the temperature of a lot of these protests. And they point back to that moment when the university turned to an outside force to clear them out that they lost the trust essentially of these protesters. That said, we have recently in the last few minutes heard from leadership here at Columbia University. They say they have been in negotiations with students until 2 AM, but also that they believe, as of right now, that this protest goes against school policy. Now, the question is, they made that assessment in the last few minutes, at least publicly, but we don't know exactly what that next enforcement measure will be. Since the police came in a few days ago at this point, the school has added security in and around. They have gone to hybrid learning, just out of precautionary tale, just for safety. But, also, we spoke to one Jewish student a few minutes ago, too, who said that she didn't feel safe on this campus. Then we also spoke to some folks inside this encampment who told us that they are trying to make it as welcoming of an environment as possible. And I should also mention before I go is that there is a major contrast between what we have seen on campus versus some conversations that have happened off-campus by so-called instigators, as they have been described by many of the folks here on campus.",
