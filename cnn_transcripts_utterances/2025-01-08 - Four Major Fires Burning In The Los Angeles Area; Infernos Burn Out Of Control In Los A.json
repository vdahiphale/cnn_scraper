Daylight shows the blanket of smoke from four wildfires raging across the Los Angeles area right now. Look at these images. We just learned that two lives tragically have been lost in the fires. Some 1,400 firefighters are currently on duty. But officials say the fires are zero percent contained as of now. And they blame that on the warm, dry winds. We want to go live to our Julia Vargas Jones, who is in Altadena, California. And, Julia, press conference is ongoing right now, just talking about the severity of these now. Four fires and just tragic to hear that we already have fatalities, multiple injuries, thousands of buildings destroyed. And the fact that these fires now all are zero percent contained.

It's the wind. The wind is spreading these flames on both sides of the street. This is not a forest fire. This is not a wildfire. We are in a place where people live. You can smell the houses burning. You can smell the construction materials in the air. It's been -- you can't see the sky here. And this is where people's children grow up. On both sides of the streets, every street that we went by in Altadena here, we've seen fires on both sides. It's absolutely incredible. More than 30,000 people under evacuation orders. The residents that we've been speaking with here, they're saying, I'm coming back just to see the house is still standing. And a lot of them have just given up. They can't get to their homes. They can't even have a sense if it will make it. We saw volunteers as well here trying to douse these houses in water from their own hoses to see if they could contain some of it. But at this point, paramedics and firefighters, they're telling, Bianna, for people to just turn around. It's too dangerous. They won't want to see any more fatalities.

Captain, thank you so much for taking the time. I know this is a very busy and devastating time for Los Angeles County, for the state. We've been covering these horrific fires now, and our thoughts are with you and residents there. First and foremost, give us a sense of the situation, your message to residents for those who were not able to listen to the press conference about an hour ago. SHEILA KELLIHER, PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICER, LOS ANGELES COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT (through phone): Thank you for having me. I think the biggest message is this is massive, like nothing we've seen. Usually it's one of these fires that kind of puts us all back on our heels and puts everybody to work for quite a while. We have three moving on four major incidents in a very small -- you know, sorry I say small, but Southern California. It looks like Armageddon out here. I have been at the Palisades fire all night. I am floored by the extent of the wind and how fierce it is and how sustained it is. Usually come nightfall, the winds tend to die down a little bit and normal Santa Ana red flag conditions, that's not the case. They actually picked up and got even more severe and more erratic. So that just, in combination with the dry fuel beds, the low humidity. It's just a perfect storm for volatile fire conditions.",

But what we know right now is that this summation, the final report of the charging decisions, the investigation done by Special Counsel Jack Smith into Donald Trump related to the 2020 election and to his handling of classified documents after he left the presidency in 2001. That report, it's done, it's in the hands of the attorney general, and the Attorney General Merrick Garland wants to release it. He has a plan where he wants to release publicly and to Congress the part of the report about the 2020 election case. And then he doesn't want to release publicly the part of the report, the second volume of it related to the classified documents case. That's because Trump has two co-defendants who continue to face court proceedings there, even though the case is essentially dismissed. But this is the plan from the Justice Department. What they need now is a court to sign off on that plan. They articulated it for the very first time to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, but there is already a pause in place so that report can't be released publicly, summing up Jack Smith's investigation until the court does something, allows them to do it, or until the -- there are three days that pass where the trial-level judge says, OK, it's time to go. So what this is coming down to, Bianna, is a timing issue. We're in the last 12 days of the Biden administration with Merrick Garland as attorney general. Are the courts going to act quickly enough and definitively enough so that volume of this report about January 6, Donald Trump's actions after the 2020 election, will become public before he becomes president?

In fact, every now and then, like right now, I get a wave of heat that actually just comes up off the building and you can feel it here even across the highway. We watched as a part of that building burned down this morning. The top right-hand corner burned down of that building. And then we saw this flooding of the -- of the area by firefighters, first responders, who shut down Sunset Boulevard and are not letting anyone go up there right now. They actually just roped it off. See that wind? It's really strong. And then more back here in this canyon on this side, too. It's unbelievable how the lighting has changed. When the sun was coming up, we couldn't even really tell. And then there's waves of darkness here where we really can't see. And then it clears up again because the smoke is just so thick. And you're talking about a fire that just, I mean, exploded in size in a very densely populated area. As of now, officials do not think that anyone has lost their lives. They don't have any knowledge of that, but there have been a lot of injuries by people who stayed. And they have been injured. We know on the Eaton Fire, which is a fire on the other side of Los Angeles, up by the foothills that there have been two people that lost their lives. Ongoing evacuations there as well. Tens of thousands of people just in this area have been evacuated. Tens of thousands of people without power. Many school districts shutting down classes for today, just making it just obviously was too much to try to get teachers and support staff and students and parents all moving in that way. So you're seeing that. They're also seeing that they're having difficulty getting enough water. So they're also telling residents, water's just fighting fires right now. So the priority is lives and then its property. But when you look at this and see how massive this is, you can see why they have called in resources from other parts of the state to help fight this fire. They've asked firefighters in Los Angeles County if they are off to return to work all hands on deck because this fire is something that we have not seen. And you combine with that, Bianna, the fact that we are in a drought here in Los Angeles, County. We have not had any real measurable rain this wet season. In fact, this is the driest start to any wet season on record. That's 80 years of record. Records there that shows you that dryness, along with the densely compacted area, those tight streets, makes it very different -- difficult to fight fires, and was also very difficult for people to evacuate with this fire growing just as quickly as it did. And these winds, the winds, if you have just a little bit of fire, the wind can catch it, throw it to another place, and that place can explode in fire.

Patrick, where do we begin? You've already hear response from both the president of Mexico, the Panamanian foreign minister, and also an E.U. commission spokesperson, also all reiterating that these transactions will not happen. PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN HAVANA-BASED CORRESPONDENT: Yes. A lot to unpack there. And as you mentioned, these are all American allies, people -- countries that have enjoyed close relations with the U.S. for decades and now receiving, in some cases, threats. I was just in Panama over the holidays and people there were sobering the 25th anniversary of the return of the two -- of the canal to Panama something that is unites all Panamanians. And Panamanians feel that they have bandaged the canal much better than anyone expected. They've expanded trade so much of the goods that come to the United States from Asia or from the West Coast and East Coast and vice versa, come through the Panama Canal. It's absolutely important and it's just very confusing for them because, of course, if you disrupt that kind of trade, it's just going to make prices of all goods, many goods in the United States rise even further. And we are talking about a country that is a rare stable democracy in the region that has been supportive of the U.S. over the years, particularly in terms of migration in recent months. So Panamanians that I spoke with said, they didn't know whether laugh or cry because, of course, there is a history of U.S. involvement in the region, a history that they thought was really relegated to the history books. And you hear those kinds of threats now of using economic or even military measures to try to pry back at the Panama Canal, pry back to try to wrest control from Denmark of Greenland, to strike some as bizarre if they were not coming from the president-elect of the United States. So Panama's president said that, you know, he'll deal with Donald Trump when he is actually president. But there is a lot of concern over what the next four years could bring because you see how much concern and anxiety this does bring countries when they seem to realize both that Donald Trump is serious about this and that there are very few people around him in his potential cabinet, his advisors, that unlike in his previous administration seem to be willing to kind of speak out against ideas that for many people seem completely crazy.",

I'm so glad you brought it up, that John Bolton made on our air just yesterday, in not beating down what hedoes consider U.S. strategic interest in Greenland, but just the pursuit and how Donald Trump is approaching it, being so public and the bluster, as opposed to having these conversations privately behind closed doors. Susan Glasser, it is good to see you. To be continued. As we noted, Donald Trump has yet to be inaugurated and we're already having these conversations. A factoid that I found out, too, that Greenland was first owned by Denmark in 1380, declared a Danish county in 1953, with further self-governance established in 2009. So a bit of history there for those that didn't know the back story of Greenland. Susan Glasser, thank you.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Bianna. So we got an exclusive first look at excerpts of this book by Alex Isenstadt, he's a nationalpolitical reporter for \"POLITICO.\" And there is two really interesting nuggets in this book that we were -- that we were given. But the most -- the most stunning of them is what you mentioned is that this took place during the town hall in Iowa that Fox hosted last January with anchors Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum. And actually what this book says is that Trump's advisors initially didn't want him to do this because unlike some other Fox knows Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum are known to actually ask some tough questions and that they were expecting some tough questions about political retribution and political violence, especially after January 6th. But then, I want to read you part of this excerpt. About 30 minutes before the town hall was due to start, a senior aide started getting text messages from a person on the inside at Fox X the team thought. They were images of all the questions Trump would be asked and the planned follow-ups down to the exact wording. Jackpot. This was like a student getting a peek at the test before the exam started. So then what Alex Isenstadt writes is that the Trump team began to workshop for some of these answers so that Trump would be appear cool, wouldn't be caught off guard. And that is essentially what this book says happened. Now, that would obviously be a huge breach of journalistic ethics. Somebody on the inside at Fox that don't name who this person is, sending questions to the candidates' team before this town hall. I asked Fox News for a comment. And this is what they said. They say, while we do not have any evidence of this occurring, and Alex Isenstadt has conveniently refused to release the images for fact-checking, we take these matters very seriously and plan to investigate should there prove to be a breach within the network. I asked Alex, he says he stands by his reporting that he has multiple sources on the matter. And when I went to the Trump campaign to ask them about this, they didn't actually directly address my questions about the town hall. They're simply saying, President Trump was the most accessible and transparent candidate in American history. So, very interesting, scoopy nugget from this book that's set to be released in March by Alex Isenstadt. Bianna.",
