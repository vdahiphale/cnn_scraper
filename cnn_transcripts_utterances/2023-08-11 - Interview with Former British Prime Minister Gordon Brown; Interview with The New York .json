The scenes are impossible to forget. Chaos and desperation at the Kabul Airport as Americans hastily left Afghanistan and the Taliban took over. It was nearly two years ago now, and any hope that this Taliban 2.0 might be a more moderate version has all but vanished. The rights of women and girls are continuously under assault. Secondary schools are still closed for girls. And the latest edict, closed beauty salons. Not just a place of work, but one of the last all women spaces where they could socialize. Listen to one Kabul shop owner struggling to make sense of it all. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

In June, they say, women and girls in Afghanistan are experiencing severe discrimination that may amount to gender persecution, a crime against humanity, and be characterized as gender apartheid, as the de facto authorities appeared to be governing by systematic discrimination with the intention to subject women and girls to total domination. This is very strong language for the U.N., which is not often known for its very strong language. Now, obviously, the United Nations does not recognize the Taliban.

It's clear that this is being directed by the religiousauthorities in Kandahar, and it's clear that the minute that there is an attempt to bring education back to girls and women in Afghanistan, the religious clerics, the mullahs, has step up their campaign. So, increasingly, they have banned the entry of women and girls into public spaces, public parks, into any forms of entertainment, beauty parlors, everything that they can really target they are trying to ban. But there is a split in the regime. It's absolutely clear that within the ministry of education there are people who want to restore the rights to girls. It's also clear that in some provinces, the implementation of this is not happening in the way that the clerics have intended. We know, of course, that there are underground schools that many organizations, NGOs, are supporting. We know that the internet education is getting through into Afghanistan. We've got to step up all these things to make sure that the Afghans know that they can try and re-press for some time, but they will never be able to repress forever. That they can ban books and ban education, but the world will get through. And I think it's very important to recognize that there are very brave young Afghan girls and women who are fighting at the risk of torture and the risk of being imprisoned for the rights of girls to go to school. And of course, the most prominent leader of the NGO in Afghanistan that is pressing for women's education and girls' education is now in prison. We need to alert the world to what is happening.

Gender persecution, I think, is now recognized as a crime against humanity. And this is the classic case of where it's happening in a way we've got to act. And so, I would urge the International Criminal Court, the prosecutors of the court, to open an investigation specifically into genders discrimination. Either that or extend the existing review of they're doing into including, specifically, gender discrimination. And I would want to see a report done on this. Now, there's a precedent in the last few months, because the ICC has taken action against Russia, by opening the investigation and laying charges in relation to the transfer of children from Ukraine to Russia. And so, for the first time, in a way, the International Criminal Court is dealing with the needs of children in a way that we've been arguing for some years. But to extend the investigation in Afghanistan into specifically the crime of gender discrimination under the aegis, of course, a crime against humanity would be the right thing to do next. Now, of course, the International Criminal Court is independent, and it's right that it be so, but I think governments should say that they will support the prosecutor if he is in a position and decides to launch this investigation and to lay charges against the leaders. That would be the ministers for education, but it could also be the clerics, of course.

I'd like to see countries recognizing that there are common challenges. And that's what we've persuaded people to do in 2009. It wasn't just an American crisis of banking failures, it was a global crisis of financial instability and to persuade people, that because you have a global crisis and a global problem, you need to come together to agree to coordinated global solutions. And it's this desire to come together that's got to be fostered over the next few months instead of countries for treating into the silos, doing their own thing and then blaming other people for not doing enough. We need to have a common aspiration to get to some agreement on what needs to be done financially on climate change, but to deal with financial instability, to deal with the potential of another pandemic, to deal with all the problems that arise from the proliferation of nuclear weapons at the moment.

They have this clearly transgressive president who did something unprecedented in American history, and we have an opportunity to basically knock him out of politics for the duration if we vote to convict in this impeachment trial. But Republican officeholders could not figure out a way to come together and make that result happen. They essentially deferred it. Maybe Democrats will be able to figure it out. Maybe someone else will be able to figure out. The core issue for Republicans is that at no point have they ever really tried to jettison Trump from their orbit.

And the official with whom he is speaking, co-conspirator for, says, well, that's why we have the Insurrection Act. And a casual reader might not recognize what's happening here, but the previous year, the administration, or at least Trump, had wanted to use the Insurrection Act to basically use military force to put down protests related to the killing of George Floyd. And so, in that exchange, you get the sense that what was being seriously contemplated in the White House in the days before January 6th was both overturning the election, A, and then, once Americans understandably began protesting it, sending in the military to use force, potentially lethal force, to put down the protests.

And basically, the statute says, right, that it is a crime to interfere with the exercising of someone's constitutionally guaranteed rights. So, I think the echoes are kind of clear. Like the interfering with the exercising of someone's constitutional rights in the late 1860s and early 1870s was not just attacking voters and preventing them from voting, from casting a ballot, but really attacking elected governments. The reconstruction government throughout the south faced like violent attacks from former confederates, from, you know, members of these vigilante groups like the Ku Klux Klan or the Knights of the White Lotus, there were a bunch of them. And to me, this is like a clear lineage. Like the Ku Klux Klan Act was passed essentially to defend democracy in the south.

The former president of the United States, rather than accept the tradition of the United States, going back to the election of 1800, right, going back to our first real, highly contested and partisan election, which is for the loser to peacefully hand over power, the former president, Donald Trump, rejected that. Attempted to subvert it. And did so by inciting supporters to attack the capitol and by organizing with close aides and other supporters to try to subvert the process of counting votes and counting electors itself. That, to me, is more than worthy of prosecution, both for its own sake and it's wrong, and for its deterrent value, to tell future officeholders who may be in the position of losing a presidential election that you cannot do this, that this is actually completely inimical to what we think American democracy is. I think if many Republicans weren't so committed to defending Trump against all charges, they would recognize that this is simply not a precedent you want to establish.

We are the oldest democracy, if you want to use that term broadly. At least the oldest country where governments are determined by some degree of popular sovereignty. And so, I think we've just gotten used to this idea that this is where it's always going to be, but it's not. And I will say that I think there are some Americans, and not just, you know, immigrants, recent or otherwise, from countries that have been authoritarian states or have been autocracies, but we have -- they're putting Americans whose heritage are in this country that have a very real recognition of the fact that democracy is not guaranteed. You know, black Americans in this country, to go back to a reconstruction discussion, experienced democracy for a short period of time in the 19th century and then lost it for nearly a century, and are continuously working and fighting to ensure that their ability to participate in American democracy isn't restricted or revoked. We have this homegrown experience with autocratic government, with authoritarian government, with attacks on democracy that I think should inform our sense of actually how durable the American democratic experiment is. It's not as durable as we'd like to think and require real vigilance to protect it.",

My view of the current situation is that it's going to be a lotof just having to push through it as much as possible. We know, at the very least, that a majority of Americans reject the idea of the president can try to overturn the election, they rejected Trump twice, in fact, just one of times accounted (ph). And if next year -- if next year's presidential election it is Trump v. Biden again and Biden wins again with the majority of the vote, then the American public will have rejected him again. And I think that will likely lead to increased division. There will likely be plenty of people who feel that this was an unjust result, that it shouldn't have happened, that for whatever reason Trump is entitled to power. And I think the response to that is just going to have to be, again, to push through it. I'm not sure that there is something we could do at this moment to sort of bring in those Americans, groups of voters who have become completely devoted to Trump's political power and political authority. So, I feel this is a very unsatisfying answer, but it's the best one I have.
