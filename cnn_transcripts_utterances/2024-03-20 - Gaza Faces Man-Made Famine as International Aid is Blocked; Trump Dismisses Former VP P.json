For much of the last year they have slashed and burned their way through the country. This video shows them triumphant and entrenched in the very heart of Sudan, Al Jazeera State. And they are recruiting local men in the hundreds. UNKNOWN (through translator): I declare joining the RSF. UNKNOWN (through translator): I declare joining the RSF. ELBAGIR (voice-over): But it's impossible to tell who here is a willing soldier and who has been forcibly conscripted. Eyewitnesses have told CNN that RSF soldiers are giving civilians an ultimatum: enlist or starve. Our investigation shows how almost 700 men and 65 children have been forcibly recruited to swell RSF ranks, and that's just what we've been able to verify in Jazeera. Across Sudan, reports and images like this one are emerging: children in RSF uniform. As across Sudan, millions forced from their homes by violence now face famine. CNN spoke to three dozen eyewitnesses, survivors, and the families of victims. The RSF, they say, is weaponizing hunger, denying food to those who won't join. Aid groups say almost four million children in Sudan are already malnourished, as the country faces mass starvation. If aid agencies can't get food to those in need, almost a quarter of a million children could die. Jazeera is Sudan's breadbasket, its heartland. To control this part of Sudan is to exert control over who lives and who dies. The RSF denied they are responsible for the hunger gripping the country, yet they control every aspect of farming this land. They control the warehouses of food and aid meant to support the most vulnerable. They control the seed supplies, fertilizer, pesticides, agricultural machinery, and irrigation channels. And it's not just the infrastructure; farmers are being targeted, brutalized, degraded, and killed. Not just to control food, but to force allegiance. You hear shots off- camera as six of the men are executed, according to survivors who spoke to CNN. Those who were spared say the RSF threatened to starve their families if they didn't join. The RSF sit in the heart of Sudan, hoarding food meant for millions. From here they can wait out, starve out Sudan's people and its army.

So who is actually in the running? Well, here we go. British tabloid, \"The Sun,\" citing an unnamed source, says the role has been offered to Aaron Taylor-Johnson, the 33-year-old known for films like \"Savages\" and \"Nocturnal Animals.\" Other reports say there's no truth to the rumors. We've reached out to Eon Productions and Taylor-Johnson's team for comment. Other names on that list being floated are former Superman block of wood Henry Cavill and Oscar-winner Cillian Murphy. Another picture released by the royal family is under scrutiny for some Photoshopping, some alterations. It's caught the attention of the media experts, in particular, this one here. It was taken by the Princess of Wales, released by Kensington Palace last year. And the claims are it's been digitally altered. CNN's own analysis found as many as 19 alterations. No comment or declined comment from all accounts to Kensington rather. The scrutiny has compounded rumors about Catherine's health after her absence from public appearances since her abdominal surgery in January. This video from \"The Sun\" shows the Prince and Princess of Wales in a rare public outing over the weekend. But even that caused all the speculation. William is currently only one of two senior royals making public appearances after King Charles took on lighter duties after announcing his cancer diagnosis last month. Royal historian Kate Williams is joining us now from London for more on Kate-gate -- that's the other Kate. Kate, this is going to get complicated, but good to see you. Thank you for being with us.",

What seems odd, though, is that the royals have dealt with far worse before. This isn't their first rodeo. Did they create this mess simply by misjudging the amount of information that was released about Kate; it wasn't enough at the end of the day to keep all the conspiracy theories at bay? Or is it more to this than just that?",

This isn't like the breakdown of the Windsor marriages.This was a lady having abdominal surgery and wishing to recover. Perfectly straightforward. What's happened is a disaster of their own making. And that's really happened due to this lack of managing the P.R. Normally, the royals either give a few updates or they say nothing and just carry on smiling and waving. In this case, we didn't get any updates. William withdrew from engagements, and the Internet erupted into conspiracy. I've never seen such crazy conspiracy theories as there were in this case. I mean, I've never seen anything like it. And the Mother's Day photo didn't quell them. And now, this -- this latest photo, the Farmshop photo in what's been called Farmshop-gate, that set people off all over again. So really this is, I think, you know, a moment when the royals have to look back and say, we can never do this again. A simple operation has been turned into chaos.",

And everyone quickly said the king isn't dead. But what Charles has done is the odd little update. And he did a little video at the end of February, thanking people for all the lovely cards and -- and presents and get-well-soon messages. And that's quite often, we -- we see the royals do that.So I do think that we probably should see Kate doing some kind of little engagement, perhaps after Easter, or perhaps a photo or a thank-you letter. But certainly, this is also on William. William has to go out there and smile, and he has to talk about Kate. And we've seen him doing that in the last couple of engagements. Today, he was at a -- yesterday, I mean, he was at an engagement and he said, my wife needs to be here to hear this about homelessness. And he also said that, my wife is the arty one in an engagement last week. So although Kate does need to do something, I think the big responsibility here is on William to go out there, talk about Kate, do -- do some updates. He's the one who's not recuperating. This is his responsibility now.",
