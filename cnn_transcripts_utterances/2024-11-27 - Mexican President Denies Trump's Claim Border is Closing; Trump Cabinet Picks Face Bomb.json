I can remember being on the campaign trail. You meet families who have dealt -- they've lost children to this fentanyl.

This mandate from the voters was we've got to take the border serious, but I really look at this as a two-pronged issue. We can't just take the border seriously without talking about immigration, right? I just don't think we can have that honest conversation. And if Donald Trump just hones this moment and he focuses in on trying to figure out where those illegal folks that are here that are committing crimes, where they're at, then we can actually have a substantive conversation.

I also think that, you know, we live in integrated communities of politics and ideas. There's conservatives in my own family. And at the end of the day, like, we're not going to disavow you because you either voted differently or you chose in many cases not to vote in this election. That's another vote lost for Kamala. And that's not part of the conversation. So, I think that, you know, some people are taking this way too far because this isn't the first election cycle the Democrats have had where they lost. It is what it is, the pendulum swings in both directions. But it's also your family is your family.
