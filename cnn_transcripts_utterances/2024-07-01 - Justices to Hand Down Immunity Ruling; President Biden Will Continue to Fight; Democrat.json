Shortly, the court will rule on Donald Trump's immunity claim, we believe, in special counsel Jack Smith's federal election subversion case. How the court answers is highly critical to not only several legal matters in Trump's life, but also the future of immunity for all presidents.CNN's Joan Biskupic has more on today's ruling. You are watching for this to come down. Now, are we certain that this is going to come down today? We have been waiting for this throughout the course of this Supreme Court session.",

      "sentences": "It will, Sara. And I am about to leave my little post here in our D.C. bureau and run over there because at 10We don't know yet who will - who has written it. There's a strong chance that it's the chief justice of the United States, John Roberts, who would have kept this very important case for himself. And just to remind everyone what's at stake here, the question is going to be at bottom, will former President Donald Trump be subjected to any kind of criminal prosecution for election subversion for what he did back in 2020 after Joe Biden validly won the White House. Will he be subjected to any kind of trial before the 2024 election comes this fall. Lower courts had rejected Donald Trump's claim that he should be absolutely immune from any kind of prosecution because of the power of the presidency. They had rejected it with a lower appellate court saying, \"for the purpose of this criminal case, former President Trump has become citizen Trump with all the defenses of any other criminal defendant, but any executive immunity that may have protected him while he served as president no longer protects him against prosecution.\" Now, Sara, I should say that as much as lower court judges completely shut the door on Donald Trump, the U.S. Supreme Court, as it heard oral arguments back in April, suggested that they were going to go deeper and look at the specific activities at issue here that are part of the four charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith on behalf of the Justice Department and the united - all of the United States people here against the former president. And that will mean that when they rule, they could offer a new set of standards for the lower court judges to go deeper into the kind of activities there - that are alleged here. Are they activities that could be deemed a part of Donald Trump's official conduct and therefore shielded from any kind of prosecution, or would they have been private acts that he took as candidate Trump that would definitely not enjoy immunity. So, there will be a lot to look at and hopefully we will be able to tell how realistic it is that Donald Trump would be subjected to trial. But also, Sara, just stepping back a little bit further and thinking about the separation of powers, whatever the justices do today will apply to all presidents down the road. And I have to say, this is the, you know, first time since I'd say the 2000 case of Bush v. Gore, that these justices are in the position to really determine what could happen in a presidential election. A lot at stake, Sara.",

At the oral argument in April, Justice Neil Gorsuch talked about the importance of writing a rule for the ages.John, I think there's also the question of whether the justices then at least try to apply that test to the four charges against former President Trump, or whether they leave that for the lower courts, for Judge Chutkan, in the first instance. John, that's going to have a lot to say about how quickly things move after today's ruling. Are we going to get guidance from the Supreme Court about the specific application of whatever it says to the case of former President Trump, or are they just going to say, here is the test.

I do think the chief justice is looking at the overall landscape in some ways because just last week the court found in favor of a January 6th defendant. A few months ago the court found that the state of Colorado couldn't keep former President Trump off the ballot in enforcement section three of the 14th Amendment. So, it is entirely possible that the chief justice, or whoever's assigned the opinion, wants to write an opinion where the court is not as hands-on as one might think.And, of course, to Steve's point, this goes to, you know, how they apply whatever standard they come up with today and how that affects how things move in the lower courts.",

It's July 1st. didn't the special counsel asked the Supreme Court to first get involved with this and weigh in back in January. And if in the end what the court's going to do is kick it back to the lower courts here, do they really need to wait seven months to do that? VLADECKdoubt that the Supreme Court could have moved faster in this case. I mean Franita mention the Colorado ballot disqualification case. The court moved a lot faster to resolve that dispute. I think the key point though is, the court is still moving relatively quickly. I mean the court moved much faster, for example, then President Trump had asked the court to move when they agreed to take this case. Trump hadn't even formally appealed yet. So, you know, I think there's going to be a lot of dissatisfaction no matter what the Supreme Court says today with how slow the court moved, with what the court says, with how much it leaves for the lower court. I think that's understandable. Part of the problem is that I think, you know, to Joan's point from before, it really doesn't seem like the court is of one mind given how the oral arguments went in April, in contrast to Clinton versus Jones, in contrast to the Watergate tapes case, where what made the court's decision so resounding and so impactful was that justices from across the ideological spectrum, justices appointed by presidents of both parties, joined in one opinion.

So, it's not as if the president doesn't face some repercussions for his or her actions. It's just that now we may get a rule that imposes some constraints on the president or not, right?

Advisers also telling CNN that the conversations were really focused on how the family can continue to help him in the race, not whether he should reconsider his candidacy. Of course, his family is crucial. They have been really important and influential when it comes to the president's decision-making about running for office and re-election. Now, the president himself has also been collecting data and public polling and anecdotally, again, as they still grapple with that immediate fallout from the debate. There has been anxiety among donors. The president had fundraisers over the weekend where he tried to quell some concerns, again acknowledging that he had at a bad debate night, but also noting that he would continue to fight hard. And the allies - his allies have taken to the airwaves to continue to make this argument and especially keep the focus on the difference between the two records of the candidates. Take a listen to what Chris Coons, a longtime ally of the president, said this morning. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHRIS COONS (D-DE): We need to remind the American people of who Joe Biden is, a strong and capable president with an incredible record and a good heart who can tell the truth and get the job done in sharp contrast to who Donald Trump is, a man who on that stage just viewed chaos, anger, vengeance, and lies. REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ (D-FL): We don't have time for this - this hand-wringing. We have less than five months till an election. We have less than two months to the convention. We need to double down on organization right now, not on worrying about what happened during a 90-minute debate. (END VIDEO CLIP) ALVAREZ: So, you could see there how allies are trying to move on from this. Interestingly, Coons also said that the president should be out there more often in unscripted moments and sort of showing how he can be energized. And in the first post-debate ad that was released this morning, that's what the campaign also focused on, the North Carolina post-debate rally that the president did where he was more forceful and energized instead of showing any clips of him on the debate stage. So clearly the campaign continues to be under scrutiny. There are still calls that they are making privately. And notably, John, there was a fundraising email where they also put out polling of what other Democrats - or how other Democrats would fare against former President Donald Trump, making the point that President Biden is still best suited to be his contender.",

And what we can't do now is pretend that we can now undergo a whole new process with a whole new crew of people.Joe Biden is our nominee. He is the one who is best suited and best positioned right now to beat Donald Trump. Everyone else that you just showed on the screen, they are great for their states and for the positions that they are in right now, but they are not well-known nationally, Sara. It would be almost impossible to mount a campaign for any one of them between now and November where they could raise the money, put in the infrastructure, do everything that they would need in order to beat Donald Trump. That's just a reality. And so that's why you hear Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Senator Coons, and even Jamie Raskin at this point understands that what we need to do as a party if we want to beat Donald Trump is focus on the choice at hand. A good man, a decent man, an accomplished president, who had a bad night, versus a bad man with a putrid character who lied every single time he opened his mouth during that debate, wants to destroy our Constitution, get rid of our democracy, be a dictator on day one, is a convicted felon, wants to take away our rights and freedoms. That is still the contrast. And I believe, at the end of the day, that the American people will focus on and will choose a president that has given them the accomplishments he has for the past three and a half years and they're not going to let a 90-minute debate eclipse all of that.",

So, this just reinforced an existing narrative. But the underlying foundation of this campaign is not going to change. Joe Biden got record high inflation, gas prices we can't afford, 12 million illegal immigrants into our country. We've got women being raped and murdered by those illegals. All of that happened on Joe Biden's watch. That's why Donald Trump is actually performing 11 points better now than he was at this point in 2020.
