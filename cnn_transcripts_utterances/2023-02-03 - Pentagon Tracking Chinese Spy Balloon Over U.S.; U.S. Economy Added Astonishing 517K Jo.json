We're going to bring you reaction live.And a life threatening Deep Freeze heading to the northeast, millions are bracing for once in a generation sub-zero temperatures. We do begin though this morning. China now confirming the balloon is seen floating over the western U.S. is theirs. They are claiming however it's not a surveillance or spy balloon as the Pentagon believes but 'a civilian airship used for research.' Those are the words of the Chinese foreign ministry. It is said to be the size of three buses. China says it accidentally drifted off course, of course. Sources do say China cannot manually control it. But how did it get there in the first place? The continent of U.S. is a big target.",

While the Pentagon spokesperson says it is not a military or physical threat to the people on the ground, it still isn't clear why it has been there. CNN Pentagon Correspondent Oren Liebermann is here with more on what U.S. officials plan to do about the balloon.Oren, do we even know how long the balloon has been in the United States? OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: So the Pentagon has been tracking it for several days. How much of that was over the U.S., it's a little unclear because it came in over Canada and NORAD, which includes both the U.S. and Canada has been tracking it for several days. So it's unclear exactly where it crossed the international border there. But this is something the Pentagon and the U.S. and Canada, as we've learned have been watching very closely because the Pentagon has said it traveled over a number of sensitive sites. They wouldn't say what those sites were, were but we know what's in Montana, there's an Air Force base there. That's home to some of the U.S.'s ballistic missile fields. So that may be the reason the U.S. was concerned about this and has been tracking it very closely. So far, though the U.S. has made the decision not to shoot this down partially because of a risk to people and facilities on the ground. Here's what we know so far. Military options were on the table, President Joe Biden asked for those options. But in the end, the decision was made based on high level Pentagon recommendations, including from General Mark Milley, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs not to shoot this balloon down. Though the Pentagon and senior deficient defense officials have said they could take that option if they decide that the risk increases with his balloon. In a rare Friday night statement China took - took responsibility for this balloon, although they offered a very different explanation and then what the U.S. believes. Here's the statement from the Chinese foreign ministry. I'll read this to you. The statement says, \"It is a civilian airship used for research mainly meteorological purposes. Affected by the Westerlies and with limited self-steering capability. The airship deviated far from its plan course. The Chinese side regrets the unintended entry of the airship into U.S. airspace due to force majeure.\" Does the Pentagon accept that explanation? Does the White House accept that explanation that remains to be seen? Beijing says it will work through this through the diplomatic channels to handle this and maybe take a little bit of the edge off the tensions that are very high right now between Beijing and Washington, especially with Secretary of State Antony Blinken scheduled to travel to Beijing in what will be the first visit of the top U.S. diplomat to Beijing in some six years. How does this balloon affect that? We are eager to find out we will certainly keep you posted. Jim and Bianna.",

I'm guessing they were even ahead of your expectations. MARTY WALSH, LABOR SECRETARY: Yes, they certainly were ahead of our expectations. And seeing these numbers, just shows that when the President laid out a plan at the beginning of his term and continues through today, that plan is working. I mean, what we saw this month in this report, a couple of really strong areas. That was business development, business, hospitality, leisure was really strong month, certainly in medical as well. And in education, private education, government education a little bit there. So we've seen some good growth, we've seen some increase in labor participation rate. Certainly we want to continue because there's job openings in America so we want to see that number go up.

These Chinese balloons have flown over American territory in the past. How this is different? Well, it's coming right before this planned meeting with Secretary Blinken, that was due to take place next week. One day that they had been eyeing was February 6, so that - so that's on Monday, so they would have been leaving very soon. What's also different we're told by the Pentagon is that this this spy balloon was really loitering longer than balloons had in past instances. It was spending more time hovering, we understand that doesn't necessarily mean that it's able to gather more intelligence than say, a Chinese spy satellite.
