And finally, how panda sharing has now become a symbol of diplomatic decay between China and the United States. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in New York. Americas largest newspapers, \"The Wall Street Journal,\" \"The Washington Post\", and \"The New York Times,\" are dedicating their pages to the journalist, Evan Gershkovich, as he spends his fourth week behind bars in a Russian prison facing the trumped-up charge of espionage. The papers are running this four-page letter in their print editions where they write, as editors and publishers of some of America's largest news organizations, we are united in calling for his immediate release. Reporting is not a crime. His arrest is one of the latest flash points in a world where autocratic leaders increasingly feel free to lock up anybody who can be used as a political pawn and anyone they perceive as a threat to their rule. Well, this week, I sat down with \"The Wall Street Journal's\" editor-in-chief, Emma Tucker, to discuss all of this and what she and the paper are doing to help bring Evan home. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Then, there's the whole alerting the government, you know, making sure that we were talking openly to the U.S. government, and I have to say, they kicked into action pretty quickly. Then, of course, perhaps the most important element of all, was making contact with the family. So, we made contact with the family as soon as we knew that -- as soon as Evan didn't check in. We have the system, obviously, for foreign correspondents, where when they are covering dangerous -- operating in dangerous countries, we have a system of check- ins. Now, he missed his first check-in. And at that point, we informed his mother, but we weren't unduly worried. It's not completely uncommon for someone to miss an initial check-in. Then, when he missed the second one, that was the more painful phone call. And of course, then by 4:00 in the morning, New York time, we heard that he had been arrested.",

We have established the freedom of the press, a free and independent judiciary.

Children. Who can you pay less? Children. Who doesn't complain? Children. Who won't question authority if they have to do a dangerous job that maybe an adult would identify as dangerous? Children.
