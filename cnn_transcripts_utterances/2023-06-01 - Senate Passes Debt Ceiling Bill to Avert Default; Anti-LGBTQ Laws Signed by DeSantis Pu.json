The final vote tally was 63 to 36, and they needed 60 votes to be able to pass this in the Senate.But I want to give you the breakdown of who voted in support. It was 46 Democrats who voted in favor, along with 17 Republicans. That was the coalition that banded together to get this over the finish line, and that means that the opposition was mostly Republicans here with just five Democrats voting against this bill. But ultimately, they got it done. It now heads to President Biden's desk for signature. And it was no easy feat to get here because there was opposition on both sides of the aisle. Democrats did not like the stricter work requirements for food stamp recipients. They didn't like some of the energy permitting reform. And Republicans thought the bill didn't go far enough in order to limit spending. They also don't like that it's going to hike the debt ceiling until 2025. They wanted a shorter debt ceiling hike so they can get another bite of the apple. But this was a really big test for the leadership, both for President Biden, for Speaker Kevin McCarthy, really for all the party leadership here. And all the while, the economy was hanging in the balance. And at the end of the day, that is really what was driving a lot of members to support this deal, even those who did not like the deal. They felt like they had to swallow it and that they did not want an economic catastrophe. So, that is the bottom line here. They did avert a crisis but just barely, Alisyn.",

But it was never a sure thing because throughout this process, there were blowups, there were breakdowns. You really had these officials from the White House and speaker's office sitting down trying to hammer out a complicated fiscal agreement, something that usually would take months to figure out, and they had to do it in a matter of weeks. Not to mention Speaker McCarthy. He is new to the leadership position. He was really an untested leader. Him and Biden didn't have the same working relationship that him and Mitch McConnell had.

And you have to understand both Chuck Schumer and Speaker Kevin McCarthy were facing internal pressures from their respective flanks, the right flanks and the left flanks who are really unhappy with how this deal turned out.But something else that really stood out to me was the way Chuck Schumer was framing the messaging there. He was touting what wasn't in the bill and what they were able to protect. They talked about the fact that they were able to avert any cuts to Medicaid. That was something that Republicans wanted in their bill that they had passed on a party line vote in the House. Whereas Republican messaging is focused on all the things they did get in the bill, the impacts in spending, the permitting reform, the debt ceiling hike, a number of things (INAUDIBLE) IRS funding, unspent COVID money, a number of priorities. But at the end of the day, as Chuck Schumer alluded to, not everyone is going to love what is in the deal and that is usually the sign of a true compromise in Washington.",

I actually thought it was a very productive hearing.The challenge, Alayna, with a lot of these big tech laws coming through Congress is that Republicans and Democrats cannot get over the mutual understanding of censorship. In one sense, disclosure seems so nonchalant, right? What is the big deal? But on another, if you're forcing somebody to disclose an identity versus not, these are the types of things that become heavily politicized. What I'm hopeful for, though, is that the market will hopefully try to figure out a solution for itself because consumers want the real stuff. They want good answers. We're not going to settle for having search engines or chatbots give us false information if we know it's false. This case, clearly, this weight loss consultant tweeted about it because she knew that this was not good information.",

There were many businesses that were closing up shops to show solidarity. Now, I want to break out exactly what this will do in the coming month once this actually kicks in. We actually have a breakdown. Not only does it supplement the governor's migrant relocation program but it will also require some hospitals to collect patient's immigration status. It also invalidates the out-of-state ID cards, driver licenses that have been issued to undocumented people. But the top two are really the hot button issue which is requiring employers with 25 employees or more to check the immigration status of their new employees and those who did not comply this could face very hefty fines of about $1,000 a day per person. Supporters of all of this, including, of course, Governor DeSantis are saying that this is -- quote -- \"the strongest anti-illegal immigration law in the country.\" So, this is what we expect in the upcoming days and this is why we saw this massive show of support while, again, the governor standing by this as it kicks in about four weeks.",

Because it is Florida, I am so curious how this is going to play out.We saw Governor DeSantis sending migrants to Martha's Vineyard. I know other governors have done that as well. But because Florida has a lot of Cuban immigrants, a lot of people from Venezuela, I'm so fascinated to see how this could affect politics. I also think it is fascinating to see if what they are doing will have an impact and actually change some of these laws across the country and showing -- one of the biggest issues that I'm covering in Congress when it comes to the immigration debate is about visas and about -- it is not just migrants coming across the border, but how they are so necessary for a ton of jobs that people do not even realize that, you know, they are needed for.
