That's coming up live. But first, a wrong doorbell, a wrong driveway, a wrong car, three honest mistakes that any one of us could make, turned deadly, or near fatal, for several young Americans, all within the last week. In Texas, two cheerleaders shot, for opening the door of a car they thought was theirs. It happened in a supermarket parking lot. Heather Roth says she was trying to apologize, to the man, in the car, when he allegedly threw up his hands, and pulled out a gun. The 25- year-old man is behind bars, tonight. Roth was struck by a bullet, but is doing fine. A second cheerleader, 18-year-old Payton Washington was seriously injured, but is said to be doing well. And in New York, 20-year-old Kaylin Gillis, she did not survive, after she turned into the wrong driveway. The homeowner, who allegedly killed her, denied bail, charged with second degree murder. Kaylin's father, understandably emotional, while addressing reporters, after that hearing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Just looking at the footage, of the father, talking about what happened to his daughter, going into the wrong driveway, and his grief? That's something that shakes everybody.Two things. One, we do have a criminal justice system that is supposed to hold people accountable, when these tragedies occur. That's number one. So the process does have to work. But number two, this is the balance. This is where this comes into play. Americans do have constitutional rights, to hold firearms. That is in the Constitution. It is our governing document. And unless members of Congress go through the process, of amending our Constitution, that is the law of the land. So, I understand the grief that so many families deal with. But you have more than 100 million gun owners, in our country. They own guns, legally. They own them, lawfully. They respect everybody's humanity. And they use them, for sport, or whatever, and they don't harm other people. When these tragedies occur, it is horrific. But we also have to understand that in our country, we have a balance, to protect all rights, people's right to live, 100 percent, but people's right also to bear arms. They are equal rights that have to be protected. And Congress is mandated to do that. Last piece, I will say. Last Congress, I know there was a bill that came through the House. House Democrats, my colleague, Jamaal Bowman, voted for that legislation. I voted against it. It didn't go anywhere, in the Senate. In Barack Obama's first term, they had control of all three branches. If you remember, they had 60 votes, in the Senate. They could have did everything that Jamaal wanted to do. They didn't do that when Barack Obama was President. Why? Because the data does not support the arguments that we're seeing. The tragedy speaks to everybody. I'm not discounting the tragedy. But when you look at the data, long run, for some of the provisions that he's supporting, the assault weapons ban to be one? \"The New York Times\" came out and reported in 2014, it had no effect. The Department of Justice reported it had no effects. The RAND Corporation did a study. They said it had no effects, on decreasing the atrocities that we unfortunately do see in America.",

We have levels of economic inequality that are worse than the Gilded Age.To truly invest in poverty, you have to reverse the impact, of the disproportionate distribution of wealth that happened post-slavery. The Homestead Act, which gave the entire west to White Americans, both native and foreign-born that kept Black people from getting that land, those homes, and building wealth. Black banks have never been invested in, in the way that let's say the Bank of Italy was invested in that now has become Bank of America, one of our largest banks. You've had Jim Crow, Black laws, KKK, mass incarceration, you've had globalization, where we, with the race to the bottom, chasing low-cost labor, all over the world, taking industrial jobs, out of the Black communities. You know what they -- know what they brought back in? Cops, and drugs and the numbers game. You gave us an illegal economy, and cops, but never repaired the harm that you have caused, which is why Black -- mostly gun trafficking, is trafficked in the Black and Brown communities. And Black and Brown people are killing each other with it. So, we're not talking about dealing with the issue of poverty. I'm talking about reparations, repairing the historic harm, investing in schools. And equitably, right now, if you live in a wealthy community, you get more money for your school, than you live in a poor community.

The top 30 percent -- top 40 percent, excuse me, pays over 60 percent. The top 90 percent pay everything -- actually, the top 50 percent pay everything. The 10 percent. Got it wrong. The top 10 paid 90 percent of everything. OK? It is by far one of the most progressive in the world. I think what you're referring to is dealing with FICA and payroll taxes, which everybody pays, because everybody does pay, into Social Security and Medicare. We got to understand that. Number two, we raised more revenue, in the United States, under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, some people refer to it, at the Trump tax cuts. We raised more revenue than at any point, in American history, $4.5 trillion. We've never raised that kind of money, in the United States. So, we raise tax revenue, all over the place. Corporations are paying. Rich people are paying. Upper middle-class people are paying. Middle- class people are paying. And trust me they're paying, because if you ask them what's going on, on their tax bill, they'll tell you. So, they're paying the taxes. The problem is here, in Washington, D.C., we spend way more than we have. We just raised $4.5 trillion. We spent $6 trillion, last year, $6 trillion. The President wants to go spend $7 trillion. I mean, that just doesn't make any sense at all. That is not sustainable. We do have to get our house in order. If then you want to talk about all these things, Jamaal that you're talking about. Because the thing that's coming for every American, every American, under this economy, number one has been inflation. We all know it. It's been covered at nauseam. Number two is the fact that if we continue to borrow money, recklessly, interest on the debt, will become larger, than what we pay, on defense, larger than what we pay in discretionary programs. We got to take seriously, the spending, of the American people's money, and we got to do it, in a consistent and bipartisan way, I will add -- I will add, to make sure that we lower our debt that we get on a balanced budget track.

China is negotiating with Brazil, and other countries, around the United States dollar. They're becoming way more aggressive, with Taiwan. And in short, they're doing this because they see weakness, with the current Commander-in-Chief, one, Joe Biden. My view, on the presidential primaries, amongst Republicans, is that our nominee's got to hit the ground, running on day one, and be able to say to the world, \"Look, American leadership is back. We're not going to have countries and their sovereignties be taken advantage of. We want to actually have global security and global trade and, frankly, global harmony.\" I remember Hillary Clinton, once said, in a debate, in 2016, that if Donald Trump became President of the United States, we will be on the precipice of World War III. Well, that never happened. As a matter of fact, the world got a lot safer. If anybody's got us on the precipice, is Joe Biden. So, if you ask me a decision, between Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis, what I'm looking for, is somebody, who can come in day one, and get America back on track. Donald Trump has done it once. He can do it again. And I would ask all Americans, you have President Trump, you have President Biden. They've both done the job. The question is who did it better?",

At issue here is the FDA's approval, of the abortion drug, which for the past 23 years, has been deemed safe, and effective, by the medical community. Joining us now is CNN's Abby Phillip. So, let's talk about today. There's already so much uncertainty, and confusion. Today's administrative stay essentially just adds to that, right? So what can we expect from here? ABBY PHILLIP, CNN ANCHOR &amp; SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: I mean, I tend to kind of believe that if they had the votes, today, to either allow Mifepristone, to continue to be utilized, as it has been, for the last 20 years, or continue with Judge Kacsmaryk's ruling, as a -- on a permanent basis, they would have done it. But they're not doing it, because they need more time. They need more time either to take a look at the briefs. And there have been a lot of briefs that have been filed, especially over the last several days, to the court. Or, they need more time to sort out where the votes are, and to sort out where whether or not there are going to be written opinions. I think there have been a lot of legal experts, who have said, \"We're not just going to get a judgment here. We may get some actual rationale and some explanation.\" And that is probably all we know, at this moment, and we'll see what comes next. But this is a really uncertain time, for the abortion rights movement.

How much is the court weighing the preponderance of evidence, over 20-plus years of approval, versus weighing, what is a clear ideological effort, on the part of the people, bringing the case, to take this drug, off the market, so as to reduce the number of abortions that are happening in the United States? That is such a huge part of this picture here. And I also think that as it relates to just healthcare in general, we've seen, the stories are already happening. I think the chilling effect is already there, on the healthcare community.

They lose thousands to tens of thousands of servicemembers, many dozens of aircraft, as well, on both sides. So, two aircraft carriers, in the war games, they carried out, the U.S. losing two aircraft carriers, which as you know, each one carries 5,000 sailors. So, the scale of this conflict, if it were to break out, these war games show would be beyond anything we've seen, since the middle of the last century.",

That is an operation, to take over the island and with enormous Military casualties, but potentially civilian casualties as well. We don't know that China is going to do this. But we do know that the CIA Director said, in public testimony, that he believes Xi Jinping has told his Military to be ready, by 2027, to do just that.
