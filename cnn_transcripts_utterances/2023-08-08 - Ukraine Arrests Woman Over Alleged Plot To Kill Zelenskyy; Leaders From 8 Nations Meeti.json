One local official says the rubble has now been cleared. Well, Ukraine security services a woman is now in custody in connection to a plot to assassinate President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Ukrainian security officials published a blurred image that they say shows the informant for Russia. She has not been named but officials say she's from the southern Ukrainian region of Mykolaiv. CNN's Fred Pleitgen has more on that and the fighting that grinds on in Ukraine. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Nearly half a million munitions. That's how much the Ukrainian say the Russian army fired at them in only a week's time on the Eastern Front. Still, Moscow reporting only modest gains. Over the past three days the advance of Russian troops in this direction amounted to 11 kilometers along the front and more than three kilometers into the depth of the enemy's defense, the army spokesman says. But the Ukrainian say in most areas they are the ones advancing and Kyiv is hitting Putin's military behind the front lines as well. After Ukrainian see drones hit both the Russian tanker and a warship in the past days, now an air attack damaging a vital bridge connecting occupied Crimea to Ukraine's mainland. A local Moscow installed official trying to downplay the significance. These are sneaky punches he says, really sneaky. They can't be forgiven. They are just snarls from a wounded animal. Strikes like these often made possible by Western supplied air launched cruise missiles. Glory to Ukraine President Zelenskyy wrote on a French model during a visit to his air force this weekend. But now Ukraine's Intelligence Services it boiled a Russian plot to assassinate Zelenskyy using an informant trying to scout out his whereabouts. The Ukrainian say questioning revealed the person was involved in other attempted plots as well. The Ukrainian say their troops had been making some gains on the southern front, putting pressure on entrenched Russian forces there. Russian President Vladimir Putin meeting with the boss of one of Russia's top arms makers urging him to speed up manufacturing of modern weapons. Manufacturers promised me that they would increase the amount of production he says, they deliver on that promise, but it needs to be increased even more. This Russian drone footage shows the aftermath of some of the fighting in Ukraine South, very little territory won or lost, but nearly every building completely destroyed. Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Berlin.

What does her visit to Niger air signal to you the first trip by U.S. official to the country since the coup? J. PETER PHAM, DISTRINGUISHED FELLOW, THE ATLANTIC COUNCIL: Yes, I think it's a very important step by salute, Acting Deputy Secretary Nuland for making that journey at the end of a very long and tiresome journey that took her to not only the Middle East, but also Central Africa. And I think it's important that the channels of communication remain open. This is a country that the United States has invested in very heavily over the course of three administrations, both Democrat and Republican, and where the investment has been paying off, up until the coup. So, there's a lot there not just investment in terms of money, but also in terms of lives. Remember the service of the Special Operations Forces, personnel who were killed in Northern Niger, just a few years ago.

On the other hand, we also have to deal with some frank realities.This has been up to now, one of the success stories and I would argue it's still a success story, because the units have special operations forces that were trained by the United States and equipped and also trained by France and some of our other allies. Those units weren't involved in the coup. The coup was a minority group of elite presidential guards who felt marginalized. Their commander was facing possible dismissal. There were some investigations of corruption. So they moved to, if you will, protect their own selfish interests and put at risk not only the security gains which have occurred, but also the development gains over the course of the last few years in Niger.",

So it's been five years since the levels have been brought down to this law. And that's largely through the special operations forces trained by the U.S. and France and other allies that are operating at the periphery in small teams.

Well, in diplomacy, a cardinal rule is never make a threat unless you're prepared to carry it out. And quite frankly, they weren't prepared. In fact, there's even evidence that there's not even a political consensus within Nigeria, much less across the entire block, as the Nigerian Senate rather strongly objected to Nigeria taking this role. On the other hand, some of the coup states in the region, Burkina Faso, Mali, in particular have been very bellicose in supporting the coup in Niger, have enough province of their own.

No real organization with it yet some dry air still wrapping in but when I show you the visible, you may see some development, at least trying to get some of these areas wrapping in around to the north of Okinawa, so maybe some of that drier air is moving away and eventually 110 kilometers per hour as it approaches parts of South Korea. It has to run over parts of Kyushu. Again though we'll see the rainfall again with this storm before it finally works its way on up into the Korean peninsula. Some of the rain here across Seoul and Point South could be quite heavy. We don't need any more rainfall certainly don't need the wind. And then here you go. There's tropical depression that number seven, at this point in time on this computer model is no longer a tropical depression. Obviously, it will have grown into something significantly stronger at that point in time. We'll still see the rainfall here in Seoul parts, especially on the east coast here.

They are saying, look, we don't like commuting. 48 percent say it's one of the reasons they don't want to come into the office. It costs gas, it costs time, it costs money. They don't like paying extra childcare. When they are home, they can take care of that. 14 percent think that. 13 percent say they are better able to focus. What is the difference here and what they want? Generally, employers want 1.6 days at home per week. That's weird. We don't take 0.6 days. So basically, they are saying two days at home a week is enough. Workers want a little more than that, so basically three days at home per week.

They are happier, the firm doesn't lose. Letting them work-from-home full-time gets a lot harder. If you never physically see people, it's kind of harder to discuss things.
