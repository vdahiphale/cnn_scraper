So this new offensive is leaving people who originally fled to Rafah in dire circumstances with few options on where to go. Next, we head to Oklahoma, where giant hail, hurricane force winds, and devastating tornadoes tore through parts of the state Monday night, killing at least one person and injuring multiple others. Tornadoes and inclement weather also causing considerable damage in Missouri and Tennessee. The residents of Barnsdall, Oklahoma, are all too familiar with this kind of destruction. This tornado was the second in a little over a month to hit the small city with a population of about 1,000 people. CNN`s Lucy Kafanov is on the ground to show us the damage up close.

And that tornado, the direct hit here, flattening this structure. I don`t know if you could see it behind me, but over there is a pickup truck.

Millions in the Midwest are still at risk of strong tornadoes ripping through the area, and millionsmore are vulnerable to damaging storms. Boeing`s Starliner needs a do-over. We told you earlier this week that the new spacecraft was supposed to take off Monday night with astronauts on board for the first time. But shortly before launch, there was an issue with the rocket that propels the capsule into space. CNN`s Kristin Fisher explains what happened. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "About two hours before lifting off with two NASA astronauts, Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore ontop inside that Starliner spacecraft, the ground teams discovered an issue with an oxygen relief valve on the second stage of the Atlas V rocket. This is a valve that essentially releases some pressure from the oxygen, the liquid oxygen that`s building up in the tank. Liquid oxygen is one of the propellants that fuels the Atlas V into space. And so the United Launch Alliance says this is typically a pretty minor issue that they`ve experienced before. They know how to troubleshoot. If it had only been a payload on top, a non-human payload, like satellites or something like that, they would have gone ahead and launched. They say that those satellites would already be up in space now. But because this was the first time that they actually had people on top, the first crewed test flight of Boeing`s Starliner spacecraft, they decided, out of an abundance of caution, to hold off.

When it does take off, the spacecraft is headed to the International Space Station,where it will spend about a week before coming home. NASA is welcoming a second company with which it can partner on missions to the ISS. SpaceX has already been flying astronauts there since 2020. In South Africa, rescue operations are underway in the city of George after a multi-story building collapse left dozens of people trapped under debris. Rescue teams are working quickly to save as many people as possible. At least 26 people have been pulled from the rubble, but dozens more are missing and at least six people have been killed. South Africa`s president is offering his condolences to families who lost their loved ones. He`s also launching an investigation into the cause of the collapse in order to help prevent something like this from happening in the future. Ten second trivia. Which of these countries has the largest population in the world? The United States, India, China or Nigeria? If you said India, then Indi-yeah, with more than 1.4 billion people, the South Asian nation edged out China last year as the world`s most populous country, according to the U.N. India, the most populous country, has nearly a billion people who are eligible to vote. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is seeking a third term in office, but with a billion people, it`s not easy to keep track of who voted and who hasn`t. So India developed a special system. It involves purple ink. CNN`s Ivana Scatola has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) IVANA SCATOLA, CNN DIGITAL VIDEO PRODUCER (voice-over): This purple mark has become a symbol of Indian elections. It`s painted on with something called indelible ink, meaning it can`t be removed easily. The Indian Election Commission has used this practice for more than seven decades to prevent fraud and duplicate votes. When a voter arrives at the booth, the ink is painted onto the left index finger, leaving a stain.",
