And, you know, British taxpayers have a right to that as well. But she's also got this very private side to her. And she's been so concerned about the kids and making sure they get through this psychologically. So she's tried to have as normal a life as a mother as she can in recent months. And she actually pays credit to that for helping in this recovery. Also being out there in nature, which we saw from that video, that's really helped her. And she has finished this course of chemotherapy. We don't know what other treatments she might be on. They're not describing this cancer free because they say that's a phrase that has to be sort of signed off by experts. But they are saying that she's reached a major milestone here. And it allows her to go back to work on light duties, which may be canceled at the last moment because she wants to focus on making a full recovery. So she won't be going on foreign trips, but we will be seeing her at major family events and perhaps some of her key charity events as well. We'll wait to see. But it's really in that video, isn't it? How's she's trying to express herself. Thank other cancer sufferers for their support through this process.

It's not a written statement, you know, five sentences long from the palace. It's not her sitting on a park bench, for example, like we saw several months ago when she first announced that she'd been diagnosed with cancer. This is releasing information in a way that I've never really seen the royal family do before. This is obviously her in her element, out in nature. There's no pomp, there's no circumstance.

And they got privacy there, but they're allowed to walk amongst communities without getting too much fuzz as well. I think, you know -- that I think the priority here for the palace was not to control it. This was a private matter. And they wanted the Princess to decide how it was done. And that was really tough, particularly earlier this year after she announced she was -- she had been in the hospital. But before they announced that she had cancer and there was so much speculation and conspiracy theory which was, you know, really upsetting to them. And also a worry in the sense that they didn't want their subjects to worry unnecessarily and these conspiracy theories did create a lot of that. So when it came to messaging, sitting on the bench in this video as well, it had to be from the heart. It had to be open and honest to show that she's sharing as much as she possibly can. Whereas a statement might have felt as if they were holding information back and will encourage the conspiracy theorists. And what they really do is reaching out to rational thoughtful people to take what she said in that video and just leave it there not speculate about anything else is happening behind the scenes. And to just go with the Princess on this. And by having complete control over the message, not being affected by anyone else. I think you do feel that. It does feel authentic, it feels honest, and she's really explaining where she is right now.",

Because obviously the question that everyone's been asking is, how on earth do you prepare to debate someone like Donald Trump? I think that what's interesting going into this is that, obviously, Donald Trump has been part of the public eye for more than 40 years. And he's been part of presidential politics for at least eight years. So the opinions about him are really baked in. Kamala Harris, not so much. She has a real opportunity here.

From what we're hearing from his advisers though, they still believe that they need to go on the offensive in helping the country get to know Kamala Harris for the first time. Many people are still saying in these polls that they would like to hear more about her. Well, Donald Trump wants to try to define her during this debate. And there's two approaches they're going to take to do that. One is by tying her to the Joe Biden administration in these past four years, especially on economy, on crime, on immigration. Those are areas where they believe that they are on solid ground to go on the attack. They also intend to put her past record and stances in the spotlight and try to make sure that voters remember the types of issues that she stood out and campaigned for when she was a candidate for president in 2020. She was vocally in support of a ban on fracking. She had taken stances that aligned herself with the defend -- defund the police movement. Those are the areas where Donald Trump believes that if they can try to convince voters that she is more like that person and less like who she has put forward over the past three months, that they will be successful. Now, the concern is that Donald Trump is always liable to go on the attack in a very personal, mean-spirited, sexist, racist way. And that is -- they were trying to steer him away from going in that direction and more toward where they feel more comfortable being on the attack. But because it's Donald Trump, and who knows what he's going to say at any given moment, we'll have to wait till tomorrow night to find out whether or not he is able to do that.",

So that plus a little bit of better weather has really helped. And it's been the first day that we hear some optimism from these firefighters who now say we're at three percent containment. It's a small number, but it's an increase from that zero percent that we had since this fire started on Thursday. Now, there are still a lot of challenges and as you see where I am right now, the area is very mountainous and very steep. So firefighters have to either walk into these areas or they have to get flown into these areas. So that's one of the challenges. The other challenge is the weather. It is extremely hot here in Southern California. We're talking triple digit temperatures. And the lows just in the 80s, so it's draining for those firefighters who are here. This is above average for this time of year. And then also the weather that this fire has created also brings in some thunderstorms and that means there's lightning in this area. That could start new fires. And the wind that comes with that storm also means that the flames spread into areas where the firefighters do not know how to predict where it's going.

He's a Republican communications consultant, and the formerspokesperson for Doug Burgum's 2024 presidential campaign. Lance, thank you so much for being with us. Obviously, it is really difficult to prepare to debate someone like Donald Trump because, quite frankly, you have no idea what he's going to say. And so that is a challenge for Kamala Harris. My question is, how the -- how do the people who are preparing Donald Trump get him to stay on message? Because my guess is the idea of attacking her race or her gender is not going to win him over when it comes to independence in this race. LANCE TROVER, FORMER SPOKESPERSON, DOUG BURGUM'S 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN: Well, I think you made an understatement there in terms of what Donald Trump's going to say at the debate tomorrow night. No one really knows, but I will tell you this. Voters going into this know who Donald Trump is. So I'm less concerned about what he's going to say tomorrow night. I think that what voters are going into is particularly if you look at \"The New York Times\" poll that came out this weekend. Voters are really going in to check in on Kamala Harris and see what it is she stands for in this race. I think that she's got a heavy lift in terms of convincing folks that she's not the person that she's been in terms of her progressive past as a United States Senator, the campaign she ran for president, and what she's trying to now position herself as a moderate in this campaign for president. So I think more voters are likely focused on Donald -- or on Kamala Harris and what she's going to say tomorrow night and less on Donald Trump.",

And almost everybody has an opinion of Donald Trump. Like him, hate him, there's very little in between. And that's why I say I think the focus is on her tomorrow night. If you also dig deeper into that poll, many voters are saying they don't know a lot about her, so I think they are coming in to learn about her and her particular policies. If you look at the numbers in that poll, he's now viewed as the change agent. He is viewed as the center or the more moderate of the two candidates. Those are things that she's going to have to work on and change tomorrow night. So I think, in this instance, the debate tomorrow night will have a bigger emphasis on policy, mainly because granted she's only been in the race seven weeks, but mainly because she's not put out a ton of policy proposals out there. And I think voters are looking for that type of policy proposal from her.",

People are very unhappy with the direction of the country mainly because of the cost of living here in America. I think you will probably hear him again go back to talking about how we need to renew the Trump tax cuts. It's something a certain divide for he and Kamala Harris on this front.

So I think it's a fine line that she has to walk. But again, I think the bigger issue for her here is, she's got a past, a voting record in the Senate which was one of the most liberal ever. She ran a very progressive campaign for president of the United States. She's been Joe Biden's vice president. I think where she's the bigger issue for her is going to be, how does she separate herself from all of that? That's what she wants to do.
