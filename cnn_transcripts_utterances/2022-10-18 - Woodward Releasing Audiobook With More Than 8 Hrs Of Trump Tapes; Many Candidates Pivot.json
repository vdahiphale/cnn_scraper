The researchers said they found a twofold increased risk of uterinecancer among women reporting frequently using these hair straightening products compared with those who said they do not use these products. This was found among more than 30,000 women. And here are the numbers. The researchers estimate that the risk of uterine cancer among women who said they never have used the products is 1.6 percent. Among women who did report frequent use, that risk was 4.05 percent. Frequent use means they used the products more than four times in the previous year. The overall risk to uterine cancer appears to be low, because we're talking about 1 percent compared with 4 percent. But that difference, Victor and Erica, is what's really concerning and what's drawing attention. Now we also know that hair straightening chemical products have been associated with breast cancer and ovarian cancer. This study is now being added to that list. The reason why? Chemicals in these products have impacts on hormones. They're called hormone disrupters. And by doing so, they can increase the risk of hormone-sensitive cancers. That's why we've seen these associations. We've also seen an association with an increased risk of uterine fibroids. So this is an active area of research, Victor and Erica.
