The disgraced and disbarred South Carolina attorney is charged with two counts of murder and possession of a deadly weapon for the shooting death of his wife and son.Now, prosecutors say he killed Maggie and Paul Murdaugh at the family's hunting property in 2021. And in court documents they reveal what they say is a key piece of evidence, a Snapchat video which Paul, who you see in those pictures, sent to friends just about an hour before the window would open in which they -- the window of time in which it is believed that they were killed. Joining me now is Misty Marris. She's a defense and trial attorney. So, there is so much talk this morning about this Snapchat evidence and what it could ultimately reveal. There is also a chance that it is not admitted.",

First, showing that this evidence is relevant, the second part showing that it is authentic, and that is why we see this decision allowing a representative from Snapchat to come in. They're going to talk about has this been altered, where did it come from, when was it posted.And we still don't really know what the content of the Snapchat is. Is it something that Paul said? Is it something that could be seen in the background of the video? All of that is going to be relevant ultimately whether it gets admitted. But step one, authenticating that document with the representative from Snapchat.",

So, now the only evident they're going to be looking at, there is also financial evidence because this is part of the prosecution's whole case here as to why they say Alex Murdaugh murdered his wife and son. MARRISHowever, prosecutors can get it in for another purpose. And I think there will be -- there is definitely going to be a fiery courtroom argument between the defense and prosecution because this is the prosecutor's theory for motive, that Alex Murdaugh actually wanted to distract and preserve his reputation, and his way of doing that was to murder his wife and child. That is going to be the prosecution's theory. So, we're definitely going to see that play out in the courtroom. We may see a situation where some is admitted and some is not, but there is definitely an opening to get at least some of those financial crimes into the courtroom and before the jury.",

The judge in this case had one order. He ordered that a portrait of Murdaugh's grandfather be removed from the courtroom, which is fascinating, and also raises the question of, are they going to be able to find a jury in a place where everybody seems to know at least one of the Murdaughs?",

But so much of this has sort of wrangled up the entire community when it comes to what will happen in terms of how Cop City will move forward.The street behind me right here, that is Peachtree Street and that's where the cop car was actually set on fire. Then protesters started running down the street with heavy rocks and they started damaging things, like this Wells Fargo location. You could see the screens have been smashed out here and all of these boards have been set up because the windows have been busted out. Those people are protesting Cop City, which is a $90 million facility, to train police and fire. And there are some folks who don't believe that land should be touched. But right now, what the city has been focused on is the fact that the protests have turned violent. Listen to the mayor of the city talk about what happened Saturday night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR ANDRE DICKENS (D-ATLANTA, GA):  Make no mistake about it, these individuals meant harm to people and to property. And we continue to protect the right to peacefully protest, we will not tolerate violence or property destruction. My message is simple to those who seek to continue this type of criminal behavior. We will find you and we will arrest you and you will be held accountable. (END VIDEO CLIP) YOUNG:  Now, something that we want to show you, we'll show you the pictures of the people who were arrested. There six of them. Five of the six who were arrested are from out of town. That's something that's been stressed here. This Cop City has sort of been spreading, the protests has been spreading across the internet so they do believe that people have come from out of town to be a part of these protests. You see the pictures here, they have been each charged with four felony charges, domestic terrorism, arson in the first-degree and criminal damage. So, you can understand they do face a litany of charges but there is so much conversation in the city about how to move forward because the protests haven't stopped in terms of how they've organized and shown up at that site to a point where they're not even sure when they're going to be able to clear the area to even start construction on what is being called Cop City.

They want to move fast without a long and dynamic supply line. And they want to have a lot of tank-killing capability. Both of those vehicles, if you put ten soldiers in the back of a Stryker with each one with a javelin, you can really get behind enemy lines very quickly, get through the front. It is an infantry bus. It doesn't have a lot of weapon systems on the vehicle itself. But what is in the back of the vehicle is critically important. Same thing for the Bradley.

That is unfathomable and that is lower than what Ukraine is suggesting they have suffered. They're putting the numbers up to about 120,000 in 11 months of war. Of course, Ukraine, we don't know how many casualties they've suffered, but I would suggest it is an awful lot. This is a World War 2 battlefield and it is just unbelievably dramatic and challenging. And what we're seeing right now is not a stalemate, there are a lot of battles going on, as you've reported multiple times, both in the east and the southeast. Russia is trying to get more mobilized soldiers. Unfortunately, those soldiers are not trained. So, they're more cannon fodder or meat, as they say in Russia, to the frontline.

And rather than looking at just one single economic indicator, they've put together ten of them and they looked at what does it say about where the economy is going next. And this report shows that for ten months in a row, as Jim just mentioned, it is down. And the conference board, which puts out this report, they say that that is a signal that a recession is likely on the way.Let me read you a key quote from this report. They say, quote, there was widespread weakness among leading indicators in December indicating deteriorating conditions for labor markets, manufacturing, housing, construction and financial markets in the months ahead. And they warn that overall economic activity is likely to go negative in the coming month. I think the truth is, though, this is a mixed picture when you look at the economy, right? I mean, on the negative side, consumer spending, it has slowed. We learned just last week that consumer spending, retail sales actually dropped at the end of last year. Manufacturing service sectors, they're shrinking. Housing is getting crushed by the spike in mortgage rates. But there are some real bright spots that are leading some economists to say, listen, maybe there won't be a recession here, including the fact that inflation is come cooling off. I mean, wholesale prices dropped at the end of last year. The unemployment rate is historically low and the Fed is no longer slamming the brakes on this economy. I think if you put it all together, it is clear that a recession is a real risk here but it is not a foregone conclusion.",
