Two Latino political experts will join us.One who thinks the move to the center is the right way to go. Another who says neither party is getting it right when it comes to talking to Latino voters. Plus, I'll speak with a father in Texas whose daughter was killed in a car crash. A scholarship was created in her honor. But now, it's one of more than 130 scholarships that have been changed or on hold now because of a ban on diversity programs at public universities in Texas. And we've all heard about the 40 acres and a mule promise made after the Civil War. But did any freed slaves actually get any acres? I'll speak to an investigative journalist about what she found with her team. So that's coming up.",

Some of the biggest stars in our hemisphere are playing. And it all started Thursday in Atlanta. And the Biden campaign sees an opening here to reach Latino voters.

This week, he announced executive action to allow certain undocumented spouses and children of U.S. citizens to apply for lawful permanent residency without leaving the country. And earlier the President announced limits on protections for asylum seekers who crossed the border illegally.Now the White House and the Biden campaign have seen the recent polls that suggest Republicans, even third parties here are gaining ground with Latino voters. Is any of this likely to have an impact? Let's now talk about this with Mike Madrid. He's a veteran political strategist and author of the brand new book out this week, \"The Latino Century, How America's Largest Minority is Transforming Democracy.\" Also with us is Daniel Garza, president of the LIBRE Initiative, a conservative Hispanic group. Thank you, both of you. Mike, let me start with you. You warn Democrats that their continued loss of Latino voters specifically could be the key to a Trump reelection? Is it that Democrats are getting it wrong? Or is it that Republicans are getting it right primarily?",

It's actually a function of both, although most of the movement towards the Republican Party, which has been happening for about a decade now, since the height of 2012 in the Obama years. It's happening despite Republican efforts, not because of them. Most of the evidence suggests that there's a larger demographic shift that's happening with third and now even fourth generation of Latino voters. That's where most of the voter growth is. And there's clearly an economic populist strain that is driving most of the sentiment by, you know, voters. So the question is exactly the right one. The answer is it is probably a function of both. But the opportunity for both Democrats to bring a lot of those Latino voters back into a historical range is as great as it is for the Republicans to push for even higher historic levels.",

So when Donald Trump is making this, to literally add the name Americans, it's not a coincidence. It's research base, they know what they're doing. That's where the massive voter growth is happening.The Biden campaign has resorted to sort of an old 1970s 1980s model of this stereotypical caricature of, you know, a Spanish speaking more recently migrated Latino voter. There's nothing nefarious about it or bad about it, it's just probably not very effective anymore. It's kind of an old tactic. Again, it was used more last century than this century. So both campaigns are really speaking to two very different voter groups within the Latino community. And for right now the math is starting to benefit where the Trump campaign is heading.

A state law took effect this year that essentially bans DEI initiatives at public colleges and universities in Texas.Well now, according to the Dallas Morning News 131 college scholarships have been put on hold or modified in some way because of the ban. The paper says one of them is the Devin Oliver and Aubree Butts Memorial Scholarship. Well, Devin and Aubree were star players on the women's basketball team at Texas A&amp;M commerce. They were killed in a car crash in 2014. In a statement of the Dallas Morning News, the state senator who authored the bill banning DEI at state school said the law makes clear that taxpayer funds should not be spent conferring special benefits based on race, color or ethnicity. Joining us now is Devin Oliver's father Richard Oliver. Sir, thank you for being with me. And first, I just want to be clear here so people understand. This scholarship is not funded by taxpayers.

There are warning signs specifically for the Democratic Party from black women. One in six black women, they say that they may either stay home on Election Day or vote for a third party candidate. To be clear, President Biden is still doing really well among black women.But in the battleground state of Michigan support for Biden has dropped compared to 2020. One in five black women there according to the survey, 18 percent plan to vote for former President Trump. Andra Gillespie is with us. She is an expert on polling and associate professor at Emory University. Has now achieved friend of the show status, you've been on so many times. So I appreciate having you with us this morning. Let's start here with a disbelief because there are plenty of people who are watching, I'm sure you have heard it, you may also believe it. And when they see these numbers, you know, the high teens, low 20s of black voters who say they'll vote for Trump, there are people who say there's no way that's going to happen, it would be historic, and they discount the numbers.

So, for surveys from the Kaiser Family Foundation for instance that just came out, the sample sizes of black and brown women are between 140 and 195. So, there's still a lot of variability in these surveys. And so these numbers do suggest that the true number might actually be kind of on the low end of what the projected scale is. That being said, if you're the Biden campaign, and this is all the information you have, I think these numbers suggests that there's possible room for growth.And if you don't want to take anything for granted, then the message here is to make sure that you redouble your efforts to reach out to communities of color, particularly African American women. BLACKWELL: Even on the low end, though, considering how tight some of these states have been or were in 2020, Michigan, Georgia, Arizona, I mean, that could be enough to end the Biden administration.

And so this summer, they're going to have to make their peace with the fact that the nominees might not be the ones that they want but they've got to make a decision between the ones that they have. And so the probability of somebody's turning out to vote is a combination of how close the election is, how much you care about whether or not one candidate wins, the cost of voting, and then these unspecified factors that could include things like civic duty or whether or not you were mobilized.And so what I suspect the Biden campaign is going to do is they're going to try to draw a sharp contrast between Biden and Trump. You know, I expect that Donald Trump -- or that Biden is going to say a lot about Trump's felony conviction this Thursday in the election to try to convince the skeptical or tired voters that look seriously there are real differences. This is not Tweedledee or Tweedledum. And they're also going to sort of play into mobilization.

And then these were not focused specifically on African American women or Latinas. And so as a result, we're looking at small subsections. And when you only have 140 responses, or you only have 195 responses, you can't bifurcate that further with any type of statistical power to be able to say anything.So what's needed are more surveys that are done where the focus is exclusively on voters of color, so that we can get that type of granularity and get that type of subgroup variation. So, you know, one example of a survey that does have larger sample sizes that's been recently reported was a survey that Pew conducted in April where they had, where they focus exclusively on African American voters and where they had much larger sample sizes where we can kind of, you know, dissects the vote based on, you know, other types of group characteristics other than just race and gender.
