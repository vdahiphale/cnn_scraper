I'm Fredricka Whitfield.And more and are breaking news this hour, after devastating tornadoes rip through the central plains overnight causing widespread damage, now a stronger storm system is taking aim at the same region. Right now, a tornado watch has been issued for 1.5 million people across eastern Kansas and southeastern Nebraska where they are bracing for tornadoes, tennis ball sized hail, and damaging winds. There were reports, about 80 reports of tornadoes across five states on Friday, including this one in Lincoln, Nebraska. And despite the large scale of destruction near Omaha, there are no fatalities reported. And now, rescue crews are up against the clock searching flattened homes for anyone potentially trapped before more storms roll in. For the latest now I'm joined by CNN's Lucy Kavanaugh in hard-hit Elkhorn, Nebraska, and meteorologist Elisa Raffa, who is tracking all of this in the CNN Weather Center. Lucy, to you first. What are you hearing from residents?",

I want to show you that house right there where there are some families. We spoke to the owners of that home. There was a mother and her child. They were home. They heard the sirens. They ran into the basement, they sheltered in place. And when they emerged, you can see so much of that home destroyed, the vehicles unusable. Right now, the sister and the brother-in-law and some other friends and neighbors came by to help. What they are trying to do and what we've been observing them do is sort of pack up whatever belongings were salvageable, try to pack that in, take that to a safer place. Of course, a lot of these folks are going to have to figure out where to stay while the rebuilding process takes place. But it is too soon to get there. Some of the folks we've spoken to said we have no idea where we're going to go.This home, we were not able to speak to the owners, but you can see, again, the force of that twister that touched down yesterday at 4:30 p.m. local time. The house, some of it is still standing, but that car trapped inside there. A lot of these homes are newer construction, built around 2022. They didn't do so well in this particular area. I want to also show you down the street. There are a lot of volunteers. That's the homeowners, but also volunteers, neighbors from areas that weathered the twisters better, who are here to help. They are doing cleanup efforts right now. They are again trying to salvage whatever is usable for the families. We haven't seen cleanup crews, official cleanup crews on site, but we know that first responders were here checking for anyone that might have been trapped in the home, clearing the home. That's what some that graffiti is all about. And that home right there, we were able to speak to the homeowner. We talked about her a few hours ago. They've lived in this area for a while. They've never actually lived through a twister before. And so when that siren went off, one of the homeowners were saying a relative of her thought the siren meant to run outside for safety. They had to -- they had to pull the mother back in. But it was a terrifying experience trying to hide in the basement and weather the storm. Take a listen to some sound from another survivor who experienced it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

For right now, the tornado watches are south of there, over parts of Kansas and Oklahoma. That's where storms are blowing up right now.Now, I'm showing you this watch that was just issued for parts of Oklahoma just to the west there of Oklahoma City. This watch has a tag that we call particularly dangerous situation. So it's not just a tornado watch. This is a tornado watch for incredibly strong tornadoes. So it's got that extra layer of urgency that people need to really take these storms very seriously. Right now, no tornado warnings, but we do have a bunch of severe thunderstorm warnings as some of these storms do blow up with the damaging winds and the large hail. This is the risk for today. T level four out of five moderate risks there in the red, where we could find a strong tornadoes, tennis ball sized hail, damaging wind, the wording just incredibly strong. In this kind of hatched red area here from Tulsa to Oklahoma City to Wichita Falls, that's where we could find tornadoes in excess of EF-3 or greater. That is incredibly strong. That is severe. That's like some of the damage we saw yesterday with winds over 130 miles per hour. So again, these are very intense storms. Another new updates since we were with you last hour is we now have a high excessive rain risk also for parts of Oklahoma, just east there of Oklahoma City. This is another thing that is very rare. It's only issued four percent of the time, but it's responsible for 40 percent of our flood related deaths, 80 percent of our flood related damages. So a lot of hazards here.

And the university invited her to give a valedictory address. And then it rescinded that invitation. And it rescinded that invitation without clear communication. It made sort of vague claims about safety. It did not involve faculty or anybody else in short of taking measures to try to protect her speech.

We train them to do all of these things. We want them to be engaged and passionate citizens who are taking care of their world. And then the university invited the LAPD in to escalate the situation, to turn the campus into this, honestly, very militarized zone. And we saw the aftermath of that in terms of students being arrested, faculty being arrested, people being injured. There was a rubber bullet that was fired at students, students of mine, or even student journalists displaying press badges. We just saw an escalation by the university.
