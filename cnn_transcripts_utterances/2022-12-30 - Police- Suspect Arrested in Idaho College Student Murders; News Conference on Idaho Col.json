      "sentences": "Good afternoon, folks. My name is Bill Thompson, I'm the Latah County prosecutor.And it is sad to be here but happy to here at the same time. As the Chief Fry indicated, a criminal complaint was filed yesterday here in Latah County, charging Mr. Kohberger with four counts of first degree murder in addition to felony burglary, which involves entering the residence with the intent to commit the crime of murder. Mr. Kohberger, let me reface, there is a pending case now in court and I and any office and the investigators have to live with the restrictions that our Supreme Court places on pretrial publicity. That said, I promise you we will share with you through the court process or otherwise we are allowed to. I appreciate your patience on that. The factual basis for the charges are summarized in what is called a probable cause affidavit, that is on file with the court. According to the rules of the Idaho Supreme Court, that is sealed until Mr. Kohberger is physically back with Latah County and has been served with the Idaho arrest warrant. At that time, we expect that that affidavit will be available to you, so you could share the true facts with all of your readers and your watchers and your listeners and all of the people who are interested in really need to know what is going on. So have patience with us on that. We hope to get that to you as soon as we can. As far as Mr. Kohberger, I can share with you that he is a graduate student from Washington State University and has an if apartment over in Pullman. He has an initial appearance in front of a judge in Pennsylvania. He's been held without bond. And the warrant from our magistrate judge here also provided for no bond. We understand that he's scheduled to be back in court in Pennsylvania next Tuesday afternoon. And the public defender has been appointed for him there. The process at this point is since he was arrested in another state, he has the opportunity to either waive extradition and return voluntarily to the state of Idaho, or if he prefers not to waive extradition, we will initiate extradition proceedings through your governor's office. If we do that, it could take a while for him to get here. So again, I'm asking for your patience and understand that is just the way the system works. Once he gets here, he'll have an initial appearance with our magistrate, they'll deal with issues such as making sure counsel is -- competent counsel is scheduled. Your primary source of factual information is going to be the court record because that is what the Supreme Court says we need to refer you to. So, please, pay attention to what is going on in court and have people there to watch and hear what is being said. As an attorney, myself and my office, we are limited on what we are allowed by the courts to say outside of the courtroom. So please just work with us. Finally, as the chief indicated, this is not the end of this investigation. In fact, this is a new beginning. You all know the name of the person who has been charged with these offenses. Please get that information out there. Please ask the public, anyone who knows about this individual, to come forward, call the tip line, report anything you know about him to help the investigators and eventually our office and the court system understand fully there is to know about not only the individual, but what happened and why. Next I will introduce Colonel Ked Wills from the Idaho state police. Thank you. COL. KEDRICK WILLS, IDAHO STATE POLICE:  Well, good afternoon. My name is Kedric Wills. I serve as director of the Idaho state police and want to extend our appreciation for your presence here today. These tragic murders took four young vibrant lives to our community and the only thing that we could do in law enforcement to honor their memories is to bring this to a successful conclusion. This has been a very difficult time for the families, the university, the community and the state of Idaho. However, it is also proven that communities come together in tough times. Certainly appreciate the support of the local community and our national audience that has been following us as we work -- our investigators have worked through this case. I'm thankful also to you, the media partners, who have helped keep this case in the forefront that generates the tips and continues what we hope will continue to generate information that will help us to a conclusion of this proceeding. I'd like to express our appreciation on behalf of the Idaho state police to Chief Fry and his leadership an the entire Moscow Police Department for the way they handled this from the very beginning. He directed the right people, to the right positions that led us to this conclusion today. I've had the utmost confidence in this investigation and in Chief Fry as well as in Mr. Bill Thompson and the Latah County prosecutors' office who have been a great partner. Nothing has deterred the commitment of the investigators who worked on this case regardless of the organization they represent. It is very trying and difficult as you know that it has been on those investigators as they do the tedious work that they're so good at doing. The partnerships is what's led here as well. The partnerships between Moscow police department, I'd like to express our appreciation with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, specifically the special agent in charge out of the Salt Lake City division, Dennis Rice, and in the last 24 hours with the Pennsylvania state police and Colonel Evanchick, with the Pennsylvania State Police. We appreciate what they've done across the nation to help us as well. As Bill shared, this investigation is far from over. In fact, I appreciate what he shared that it is not an ending but rather a new beginning. The difference now is, as he shared, that we're dictated what information we could share by the court process and by laws in our state of Idaho. And so, we will share, as he shared, Mr. Thompson is absolutely committed to share everything he can share through the court process. We've got to make sure that we don't get in front of that process. And we really appreciate deeply, appreciate the relationships that were forged here that have led to this and based on that, it is why we're here today. And we continue to believe that the best way we could honor these four lives that have been taken is to make sure that we have a successful outcome here. One of the partnerships that has been forged is a partnership with the University of Idaho, and on that I would like to introduce the president of the University of Idaho, Mr. Scott green.",

It is a relief to our university, our community and our extended family. The outpouring of support over the past six weeks helped sustain us during the most trying time. They provided the strength that helped us navigate the international scrutiny, visited on our students and employees. We are truly thankful for the compassion and acts of kindness shown to our community. Kindness is contagious and it provided the light that reclaimed ground lost to evil and darkness. We first want to acknowledge and thank Governor Little for the early promise of financial support that enabled the university to secure our campus and focus on helping our students and our employees in the wake of the crimes. We also appreciate the Idaho state police and the highly visible security presence that brought comfort and calm to community shocked and confused by the senseless crimes. We never lost faith that this case could be solved and are grateful for the hard work of the Moscow police department and their law enforcement partners. The vast and committed FBI resorts brought important expertise to this complex case. Across the board, dedicated personnel worked this case to arrest. This crime has nevertheless left a mark on our university, our community, and our state. [16:15:02] While we cannot bring back Maddy, Kaylee and Xana and Ethan, we can thoughtfully and purposely carry their legacy forward in the work that we do. Our students come first and that was proven each and every day of this investigation. We're committed to safely delivering the colonel town atmosphere and high quality education for this the university of Idaho is known. With time we will heal, and we'll move forward together and remain Vandal Strong. And with that, I would like to turn it back over to Chief Fry.",

So it doesn't appear as though there was an invitation to come into the house.Also, I think it is extremely interesting that we learned that they have found the Elantra. They have not found the murder weapon at all. And as far as more information, it is sealed in the probable cause affidavit with the Idaho courts until the suspect goes from northeast Pennsylvania where we are now back to Idaho. And I want to tell you he was arrested at 1:30 in the morning. It is about eight miles from where I am. This is rural northeastern Pennsylvania. There is farm land here. It is just small town America. And what a source has been telling CNN, to go along with this, is that the FBI out of Philadelphia was surveilling him in Pennsylvania for the last four days and while that was happening, that authorities in Idaho were putting together an arrest warrant to be signed off by a judge, alleging the probable cause that they had to -- for him to be arrested. And the source tells CNN that that was DNA found at the scene. But also that that white car actually belonged to him. Now, once that probable cause and the arrest warrant was gotten, the complaint has been filed, they moved in at 1:30 this morning. It was the Pennsylvania state police that actually arrested him in Albrightsville, about 8 miles away from here. He had a court appearance early this morning and I saw on the docket, it said motion to set bail was denied. We heard he's here without bail and the next proceeding will be right here in northeastern Pennsylvania on Tuesday, which is the extradition process. Because he's got to be sent back to Idaho, but that has to be done legally. Either he agrees to do it or he doesn't and then as you heard the prosecutors said they would ask the governor to have him removed from the commonwealth here.",

But if he doesn't do that, it could be a long process. So if that happens, it could be a long time until we find out exactly why this happened. And I asked the police chief if there was any indication that the suspect knew the students. Was this random? How did this play out? He could not answer that. He said this is all part of the investigation. And the prosecutor and the police chief both emphasized that they are continuing to reach out to the community for tips.

We've been reporting based on our sources that much of the identification was due in part or due largely to that actual white Hyundai Elantra that authorities were able to track and as we've been reporting the suspect traveled some 2,500 miles from Idaho to Pennsylvania and it really shows you, as you mentioned, the sleepless nights for law enforcement, think about the number of moving parts that were involved in this investigation.You have authorities in one jurisdiction in the state of Idaho that learn with help from the FBI and the Pennsylvania state police that the suspect is in another location. And they quickly have to move to go to the courts to get the legal process in order to set up and arrest that person. Now we know that the suspect was under surveillance for several days based on our sources and then authorities ultimately decided this morning to actually move in. I'm told from law enforcement source that it was a Pennsylvania state police who physically put handcuffs on the suspect. That after they went to the court to get their own warrant, the suspect being held as he goes through the extradition process that jean was just mentioning, but a lot of moving parts here. One thing we still don't know is the motive. And, you know, authorities say as you just mentioned, they're trying to illicit tips from the public. And this is an occasion where authorities are asking us to do just that, to get this person's face out there, to get his name out there. They want as much information as they can.

I think that the public officials probably should have been more transparent in the early days when they knew that they had a mass murder and that is just an important lesson. We're not going to blame them. They've done a tremendous thing. But just that transparency to the community because we heard that people didn't even -- a lot of people didn't even know there had been a murder like this. You want to protect the community.But once they have an investigation, shutting down I'm always, this is maybe against interest because I'm an analyst for CNN, but I tend to forgive law enforcement for shutting down. This is a small community. They do not know if the murderer was or is a member of community. They don't know his status in the community. They don't know whether he had ties to law enforcement. They didn't know a lot of things. As the investigation then branches out to the FBI, state police, multiple states, all of the media that they thanked, then they begin to collect, as josh was saying, tips from the public and engaged the public in a way that clearly proves fruitful, and just finally ending on this point. We're all searching for a why because it's inexplicable that there won't be a why, right? I mean, as parents you said it is a good and a bad day in the sense that they have someone. And we don't know if there is a why. Was there a connection, an online connection or was this just a brutal murder done at random? And so they're continuing to try to figure this out.

And let's get to another point, every single thing they say will be picked apart by defense attorneys to determine whether there was prejudice in the case. The most famous case of my lifetime was OJ Simpson and it turns on the jury say that the police were prejudiced against the defendant. They don't want to say anything that gives an advantage to the defense attorneys. I understand the community is frustrated and the family.

And he got away in the middle of the night without that video camera footage from somebody's residence that picked up the white Elantra. I don't know that we would have this guy. We'll find out later about the DNA.But the key is he would be smart enough to get rid of the weapon for sure. Apparently he wasn't smart enough to get rid of the car, the fact that he fled back to his home town in Pennsylvania, not surprising. He thinks out of sight, out of mind. What interests me is the most is the question that came up in the presser based on someone in the room, they said during his booking and this -- the police would not confirm it, that he looked at them and said has anyone else been arrested in this case? Now that rang bells for me because this is a smart guy who is obsessed with crime. And to me that indicates a few things. It is a setup. He's trying to already and he's sophisticated he knows how the criminal justice system works because he studies it. He wants to set up the idea he didn't work alone or they've got the wrong guy. Or scariest of all, that perhaps he's suffering from a disassociate identity disorder and an alter committed these crimes.

I think based on the knowledge that the offender had inside of the house, the time of day, the way that the murders were carried out, the unprovoked murders were carried out, and if they were targeted, we still are reliant on early on information, this is someone that had some kind of knowledge about the victims and the inside of the house.
