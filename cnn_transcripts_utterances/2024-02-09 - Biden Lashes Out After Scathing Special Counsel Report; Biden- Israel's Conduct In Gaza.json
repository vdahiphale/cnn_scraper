A fiery President Biden went before cameras yesterday to disprove the point and ended up calling the president of Egypt, the president of Mexico. What is the plan to show that Biden is on the ball? Plus, paging Nikki Haley. It's not as if former President Trump, three years younger than Biden is himself avoiding criticism on this front, he called the president of Hungary, the president of Turkey. He confused Haley with Nancy Pelosi. Does Governor Haley have a point about the likely matchup she calls grumpy old man? And fears grip citizens in another city in Gaza as Israel signals that is preparing for a new ground incursion.

Ronald Reagan did not have any classified documents in the sense that Reagan had read something already marked are read by somebody else classified. It moved back to California with them.What Ronald Reagan did and what I edited was every night when he went to bed with his wife, Nancy, he'd write a couple of lines, not drawing on reports, on just what he saw or felt that day. And that became the -- you know, the Reagan diaries. Other presidents have different ways of doing these things. I mean, Bill Clinton had Taylor Branch come to the White House and -- a journalist, and they would tape -- make these tapes and Taylor would go off with them. It was all of these precedents after Watergate were trying to find a way to legacy spin, how do I keep some of my stuff? But I think in regards to both Donald Trump and Joe Biden, there should never be classified documents being taken out of the White House, whether it's stuffed in a notebook or stuffed in a briefcase. TAPPER:  You know, it's interesting. There's another section of the special counsel report that said that then Vice President Biden saw himself as a historical figure, and that's why he kept these documents. I suppose a lot of politicians view themselves in that way. But he also special counsel Hur, went out of his way to say that President Biden was more like previous presidents in how he handled or mishandled classified documents, then he was like Donald Trump, who Hur noted, refused to give the documents back, encouraged witnesses to lie about the documents and on and on.

We're going to come back to you.More than a million people have fled to Rafah in southern Gaza and now it is the target of Israel's next military assault as they pursue the terrorists of Hamas. Coming up next, the fears that Rafah will soon become a zone of bloodshed. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [16:30:56] TAPPER: In our world lead, the leaders of the United States and Israel once again showing that they are not on the same page. President Biden said just last night that Israel's conduct in Gaza is, quote, over the top, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is directing Israel's military to draw up evacuation plans before the Israeli military enters the last major population center in Gaza, the southern city of Rafah, where 1.3 million mostly displaced Palestinians are currently sheltering, according to the United Nations. CNN's Nada Bashir reports on the latest bloodshed in Gaza. And we must warn you, some of what you're about to see is difficult to watch. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER (voice-over):  There are simply no words. This grandfather cradling the body of his seven year-old granddaughter Hadat (ph), beside the shallow grave where she will soon be buried. I told her mother that Hadat is now aboard (ph) in heaven, Ahmed says, with her aunt, her cousin and her grandmother who were all waiting for her. You see, we have many martyrs in our family. Ahmed says his family had been taking shelter in a school in Khan Younis when an airstrike hit. It took hours, he says, to reach the nearest hospital, still able to treat little Hadat, but it was too late. Across Gaza, more than 10,000 children have been killed since the war began, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, many more left orphaned while facing life changing injuries. In the central city of Deir al Balah, the airstrikes are near daily. Those who survive left to dig through the rubble with their bare hands in search of their loved ones. Meanwhile, in the Rafah, once deemed a safe zone, UNICEF estimates that there are now more than 600,000 children among the over a million people in the area, many taking shelter in the sprawling tent cities. The southern city has, for weeks, come under relentless airstrikes by the Israeli military who say they are targeting Hamas. But now, a looming ground operation is stoking fears that could become as one aid group has described it, a zone of bloodshed. If by some misfortune as an invasion of Rafah, two-thirds of the population will die, Gabr says. We can't get out of Rafah. We have no other alternative. Israel says it is now calling for a mass evacuation of civilians in the southern city ahead of a planned ground offensive. But it is almost impossible to fathom where else the civilians can turn to. But Rafah has not only become a vital lifeline for the displaced, it is also a crucial gateway for humanitarian aid crossing over from Egypt. And many in the international community are now sounding alarm bells over Israel's warning. ANTONIO GUTERRES, U.N. SECRETARY-GENERAL:  And I'm especially alarmed by reports that Israeli military intends to focus next on Rafah, where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have been squeezed in a desperate search for safety.",

It's been nearly three years since Haiti's President Jovenel Moise was assassinated. In the power vacuum, warring gangs asserted their control of Port-a- Prince, disrupting the supply chain of basic necessities and displacing scores of civilians, kidnappings, and shootouts on the streets have become routine hazards of life.
