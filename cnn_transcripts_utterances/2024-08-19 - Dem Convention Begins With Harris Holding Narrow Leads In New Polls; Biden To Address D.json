Harris's advisers listened, they considered the arguments, they decided to stick with what the crowds were chanting in the arenas. That's really striking because there are a lot of advisers, as you know, you have been one of them. Now you're a principal, but you were an adviser, who say a lot of things based on a lot of data.

But to say that grocery owners, large grocery owners are not experiencing some of the highest profit margins that they have in the history of our country, I just think is not necessarily an appreciation of the whole story. And frankly, you know, let's figure out what are the actual policies that are being put forth by President Trump. He talks about inflation all the time. Has he actually put out a policy? Is the post-editorial page actually asked him what his economic proposals were? Look, the Vice President is putting out an ambitious policy proposal on a set of cost drivers in the lives of everyday people, the cost of food and housing, health care and prescription drugs. She actually wants to be a president and a leader who will bring Congress and the people of this country together with industry to do something about it. And that's the kind of leader that we need in this moment. BASH: Thank you so much. Sorry about the fake out. Hillary Clinton didn't come for her own prep, but maybe she'll come back later.
