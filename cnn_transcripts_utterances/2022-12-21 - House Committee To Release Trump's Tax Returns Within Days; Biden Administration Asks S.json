And that's what Democratic Chairman Richard Neal told reporters after the panel voted along party lines yesterday to release six years of the former president's tax information. But Republicans are warning this sets a dangerous political precedent. CNN's chief congressional correspondent Manu Raju joins us now from the Capitol. So what can we expect, Manu?",

      "sentences": "Yes, more information in a matter of days. Of course, this coming after years of court battles between Donald Trump and House Democrats. House Democrats ultimately won, got six years of Donald Trump's personal tax returns, as well as tax returns related to his businesses. Those came over just a few weeks ago and then yesterday along straight party lines, voting to release those returns.Now, we do expect that the returns, the full documents that they have obtained to be released within days. They said that they plan to redact key information, sensitive security information. Then they will be out in the public sphere. But we're also getting a taste of what the Committee has investigated so far. One report they issued looked into the IRS auditing, mandatory audits of sitting presidents. They say it was dormant during the time when Donald Trump was president, which raises concerns among Democrats. They said that it should have happened, given Trump's vast financial holdings and whether there were any conflicts of interest that Donald Trump had as he was signing bills into law and dealing with other policy issues. They said that audits actually occurred in April of 2019, when Richard Neal, the chairman of the Committee, the Democrat, sent a letter to the IRS asking about those presidential audits. That's when they took place. And we also have learned some information of Donald Trump's own personal wealth. He has incurred a number of losses over the years, shielded his tax liability, paid a lot of taxes, but also cut down those taxes and paid zero in federal taxes in 2020. Pamela?",

All right, so let's just jump right in, starting off with the significance of this. It's not every day that Congress releases the tax returns of a former president, but at the same time, most presidents disclose their tax returns when they're running for office. I think we just lost Mark right there. So, Elie, I'm going to go to you on that question. What is the significance of the Committee releasing the former president's tax returns?",

Was he profitable or not? The answer appears to be not. Most importantly, really, where were his debts? Where did he owe people? Could those people possibly have used those debts as leverage over him? This is something that even routine level executive department employees like I once was have to disclose. So we'll get a lot more transparency at the Donald Trump's true financial situation and what his motivations may have been.",

I want to note when Democrats were in the court battle that's lasted for years, they made the case that, look, this is not about releasing this to the public. This is because we want to look at legislation, but that is exactly what they're doing, and they found a legal loophole to do so by releasing it to, you know, to the Senate that essentially releases it to the public.

First of all, when they had a court battle, they are entitled to get those returns from IRS under the law. But during this court battle, the Ways and Means Committee repeatedly told our courts, up to and including the Supreme Court, no, no, no, we're not just looking for a way to make these returns public. Well, guess what they're doing just now. The other part of that is the very law that the Ways and Means Committee used to get these reports, which, again, they're entitled to do, says, you can only deal with these reports in closed session, and you have to maintain them confidentially unless the person consents.Of course, Donald Trump has not consented, and instead the Committee found this loophole that says, but what you can do is put them on the Congressional record, which we all know, as a practical matter, is as good as making it public. So they've been crafty here in the way they've used the law, and I think the precedent that they're setting here could ultimately be a longer term problem regardless of party affiliation.",

They could have put through a legislative proposal to say tax returns of candidates and presidents should be made public and leave Donald Trump out of it. That would have gone through. Instead, now we've had a further politicization, if you will, of tax administration at a time when the administration is very interested in spending the 80 billion, getting the IRS healthy.

This is what Democrats is using as justification for legislation. Here's what Democrat Dan Kildee of Michigan said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. DAN KILDEE (D-MI): She did this in 2019 with the intention of determining whether we needed to take up legislation to address what seemed to be a weakness in the audits of presidents. The reason it took so long was because of Donald Trump. Those returns raise all sorts of red flags, and we think in order for Congress to act in the American public to judge our actions, we have to be able to look at both of those facts.

I think they're caught in this very politically difficult position where this is a Trump era policy that's been very controversial, progressives, some Democrats have been putting pressure on them to lift it, but ultimately they're not prepared. And like Jeff said, there is no long term plan for how to deal with this. So, yes, you can say we need those workers, but we all know it's not that simple. And the administration is going to get blamed even if the responsibility is ultimately on Congress when they inevitably don't have enough beds and houses for migrants. And I think there is a lot of concern about unaccompanied minors and those images just flooding again. And even if there's limited things they can do with executive authority, this is still going to fall on them when this all kind of inevitably happens.",

And we know that some Senate Republicans want more amendment votes and that's the rub. They're trying to figure out exactly what the timing agreement is on that.We heard from Senate Minority Whip John Thune just ago. He said it's looking less optimistic. They can get this done today and get it done before President Zelenskyy addresses Congress later this evening at 7:30. So this is either looking to be a very long night into the early morning hours for the Senate, or this will play out tomorrow. Of course, we've got this winter storm that's also bearing down on the middle of the country. A lot of senators very anxious to get home, get out of here until they get trapped. Just a reminder, Pamela, as we have Zelenskyy coming here tonight, there is $45 billion worth of Ukraine aid in this funding, again, a $1.7 billion bill that will fund the government for the next year.",
