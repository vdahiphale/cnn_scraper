She is expected to seek an indictment of more than a dozen people as early as Tuesday. And that means this week a former U.S. president could be facing criminal charges in four different jurisdictions around the country. We've got you covered. We're going to begin with CNN's Zachary Cohen on this, who helped break this exclusive reporting. Zach, this seems quite significant, this evidence linking members of Trump's legal team, to the breach of a voting system there.",

And more specifically, it links them to this effort to secure a written invitation from a local election official there, essentially allowing them or, in their minds, to be held up as evidence allowing them to enter the election office and copy the voting system in Coffee County, which by all accounts is not legal and no election official is allowed to let outsiders have access to voting systems in counties across the country.But we know now that Trump's team and Trump's lawyers were trying to convince this local election official in Coffee County to provide a written letter of invitation. And these text messages really do show us how they were involved in the planning, and how -- you know, down from Rudy Giuliani all the way to Sidney Powell, how they were kept in the loop by operatives on the state level as they worked to secure this written letter of invitation, and then ultimately access to the voting system in Coffee County. Now Coffee County is about 200 miles south of Atlanta, downtown Atlanta, where we are right now. But the Coffee County breach has emerged as one of the focal points of Fani Willis' investigation over the last year and a half. And it's because the sensitive voting data was initially accessed by Trump's lawyers. This could play into charging decisions that are expected to come within possibly the next week.",

And then at the end when the evidence is fully presented, the prosecutors will say here are the charges that we think should be appropriate. Vote on them.

Monday, you'll probably get the greatest hits, the summary and all that stuff. Then on Tuesday, we have at least two live witnesses. And then if they go in the early morning, and that's the end of the evidentiary presentation, the prosecutors will probably have this indictment, if there's going to be one, already written. They present it to the grand jury and say, we're thinking about bringing this charge this time, what do you guys think? How do you guys want to vote? And then they vote.Remember also that there was this special grand jury that heard from 75 witnesses. They made a recommendation about criminal charges.

And then television makes a very big difference. We saw the failure of television in the O.J. Simpson case with Judge Ito controlling nothing in that courtroom.And that's going to make a big difference on how the lawyers behave and how perception of the audience is. Because you really want to convince not just the 12 jurors, yes, of course, you want a guilty verdict, but you want to talk to America, that this is a righteous prosecution, and so you want your evidence to be strong enough to convince people that this was appropriate, this was not a political witch hunt.",

And so now we look, what's the next precedent? Impeachment didn't really resolve this. Partisanship in some ways overwhelmed the ability to bring resolution.And so now we're looking to see, what does this nation say? First, it has to find out the facts and we have to reach a conclusion. But if the wrongdoing was done, what do we do about it? What does the government do about it? Do we allow this to be acceptable? And that is extraordinarily important for all of us. DEAN: And if you look back in history, if we go back when President Gerald Ford preemptively pardoned Nixon for any crimes he might have committed in the Watergate scandal, President Ford argued it was to avoid bringing any more trauma and let the nation heal.

There is no reason to think that we wouldn't experience a surge in all three respiratory illnesses this fall and winter. Just as we have in the past. What makes this different as you mentioned is that we now also have tools to prevent all three.We have the flu shot, which has been around for a while. We have the COVID vaccine, and are about to be getting a new booster which is great news for folks and most importantly for the first time ever we now have a tool to prevent RSV which you'll remember was filling our emergency departments and hospitals last fall. For little kids, we have a shot that gives them some antibodies to protect them from the disease, and for older folks, age 60 plus, we now have a first time ever vaccine. This is great news and if Americans avail themselves of these shots, we could potentially stave off an overflowing emergency department and an overflowing hospital. So I have a little bit of fingers crossed as we head into this fall.",

But now to have these vaccines seems very big. We know there is a new COVID strain that health officials are warning about. Why is it such a concern and do we know yet if the booster shot will be able to protect against it?",

But this is not the same as the summer surge that we saw last year or the year before or the year before that. This is a variant of interest, not a variant of concern. We are seeing a small increase in cases, hospitalizations and deaths but nothing like what we saw in prior years.To me this is really that signal that as we head into the fall, we could be heading for worse. So, the takeaways for my son as well as for folks watching is if you're in a crowded place right now and particularly if you're high risk, wear a mask. Because we are seeing increased spread of this new variant. If you have symptoms, if you feel like you've got the flu, stay home, please. Don't get other people sick and make sure you test, and particularly if you're in one of those higher risk groups and you test, know that you can ask for Paxlovid. It still works wonderfully for this new variant. Now you mentioned the booster, we are really excited about it. Everything suggests that it is going to work well against the variants that are floating out there right now. So when it becomes available, again, I urge folks to get it, particularly people who are age 60 plus, who are immunocompromised, pregnant or otherwise high risk for bad COVID outcomes.",

And we really saw this rise in suicides beginning in 2021 after two years of decline.I'm curious if you think this can be connected to COVID and the isolation that we saw during the pandemic, or do you think this is something independent?",

      "timeStamp": "18:50:05",

      "sentences": "No, Jessica, we've unfortunately been seeing increases in suicide deaths in the United States for about 15 years now. We have a slight decrease in 2019 and 2020 but it was only a very small decrease. So although this is likely connected to the mental health problem that all of us are experiencing in our families and our communities, it is actually a continuation of a trend that pre-dates COVID by over a decade.One of the saddest things about this increase in suicide deaths is actually the greatest increase in suicide deaths is firearm suicides or gun suicides. Those have made up more than half of suicide deaths for a very long time and we've seen that percentage increase in this latest year. And so for folks that are watching, I urge you that if you have a friend or a family member who is feeling depressed or going through a moment of stress, to make sure that they're connected to help, to know that you care about them. And if they own or have access to a firearm, make sure that they can't access it until they're feeling better. That can be the best thing that you can do to save someone's life.",
