There are now just over 100 days until voters head to the polls and pick the next president. Today, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are both out on the campaign trail. Harris soon heads to Massachusetts for a fundraiser as her campaign looks to add to an already impressive cash haul. The Harris campaign says it raised $126 million in just the first three days after President Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed her. The campaign also says it has seen an explosion in grassroots support with more than 100,000 people signing up to volunteer for her presidential bid and more than 2,000 applying for campaign jobs. According to a new Fox News poll, the presidential race is now a statistical dead heat in three swing states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. CNN's Eva McKend is joining us right now. Eva, set the stage for us on what this weekend is looking like for the Harris campaign.",

The question is, I mean, there's two problems. One is that even with Harris doing so much better in those demographics than Biden was doing, Democrats are still not even close to where they were with those constituencies in 2020. They've lost around 10 points with -- with those -- those groups since 2020. And so obviously, I think what these polls show is that Democrats absolutely made the right decision by pressuring Biden to step down.This -- this race now goes from basically a foregone conclusion in favor of Republicans, to now Democrats have a fighting chance, they're still the underdogs, but they absolutely have a chance to win this.
