Now, President Biden hosted governors here at the White House yesterday to try to hear some of their concerns around this debate. And so far, he's really insisted that he is remaining in this race, sending an e-mail to supporters and also telling his campaign staff that he will be in this race until the end. And, this morning, two interviews the president conducted yesterday with black radio show hosts aired, and he tried to explain a part of his performance on the debate, insisting that voters should judge him not on that debate, but on his time in office.

So, the president is here at the White House today. They will be hosting some Fourth of July festivities for military families on the South Lawn. He's spending the day in part with his family, who I'm told remains all in on him staying in this race. Of course, Vice President Kamala Harris is also set to join those Fourth of July celebrations on the South Lawn of the White House at a time when, of course, Biden has made protecting and preserving democracy a key feature of his campaign, perhaps even more important on this Fourth of July holiday.",

And I can tell you from my reporting that, even though you just heard him there saying that perhaps Kamala Harris would be a better opponent, that she'd be easier to beat because she's terrible, I know from my conversations with Trump's campaign, they're not exactly sure what this could mean for them if Joe Biden were to step aside. They're not sure if that would actually benefit them, particularly given they have spent so much time, including creating this massive data operation, the infrastructure around his general campaign, focused on Joe Biden.

You said soon after the debate that Democrats have to be laser-focused on winning and not hand-wringing or sentimentality. Do you believe that President Biden still gives your party the best shot to win in November? REP. JARED HUFFMAN (D-CA):  I don't know, Boris. But here's what I do know. The guy you showed a few minutes ago, Donald Trump, is a fundamental threat to democracy, to our fundamental rights and to the free world. Joe Biden is not. But I do know that we're also not on a winning trajectory. And I think we have got to be honest about that. So we need a reset. We need a course-correction. We have got to acknowledge that this was not just one bad night. This is a pretty pervasive and widespread perception that's been dragging President Biden down in the polls for many months. So we have got to figure this out. I think we have a couple of weeks to do it, but we have got to do it.",

Two weeks from today, the Republican Party is going to nominate a convicted felon, an adjudicated sex predator, a guy that wants to be a dictator, a guy who's deeply unpopular. I think, certainly, right after they finish that spectacle, we need to have our ticket finalized, so we can go out and win this election. SANCHEZ:  When it comes to your description -- quote -- \"many of us struggling,\" it seems like, behind closed doors, as we have heard in CNN's reporting, there is anxiety, and there is, as some have described it, panic. But, publicly, as we just heard in Sunlen's reporting, it seems that Democrats want to present the idea that this was just one bad incident.

And it wasn't just one bad night. It was a bad night that may have locked in a really unfortunate narrative about President Biden's age and fitness, and that narrative could be very hard to undo. So we have just got to be honest about that. We're four months before the election, and the guy who's threatening our democracy, our fundamental rights, and the free world right now is winning.

This should not be about sentimentality. It should not be about perceptions of loyalty or whatever to one person. It's so much bigger than that. The stakes of this are everything, when we think about our democracy, our fundamental rights and the free world.

You would think that's the softball of all softball questions, and the fact that he wasn't able to articulate why he wanted to be president really demonstrated that he only wanted to be president for the sake of being president. It hurt his campaign. Now, he did continue on, but, of course, he didn't win the nomination. The second is, back in 1960, it's actually an interview with President Dwight Eisenhower during one of his press conferences. He, of course, was one of the first -- actually, the first president to do televised press conferences. He was asked about the Republican nominee, his vice president, Richard Nixon, can you tell us a moment when Nixon really gave advice that changed your mind? I mean, Nixon's saying that he's a foreign policy expert. And Eisenhower, who, frankly, had no love for Nixon, said, well, if you give me a week, maybe I can get back to you on something, basically undermining the entire point of the Nixon campaign that Nixon was experienced.

Now he's starting to focus on, OK, I get it. I might have age on me, but I have wisdom and I have knowledge. He's starting to think a little bit more about addressing the age question specifically.
