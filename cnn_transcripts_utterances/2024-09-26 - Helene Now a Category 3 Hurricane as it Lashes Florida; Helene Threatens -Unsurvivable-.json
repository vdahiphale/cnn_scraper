And right now, Helene- sustained winds are clocking in at 120 miles per hour. The storm expected to intensify even more before it makes landfall later tonight along Florida's Big Bend region.Already, Helene is thrashing Florida's coast with heavy rain and strong winds. The National Weather Service warning of unsurvivable storm surge ahead, going all the way up to 20 feet, perhaps, in some places. But it's not just Florida that's going to get hit here. Here is what it looked like in North Carolina. Officials say significant impacts will also be felt throughout Georgia all the way up to Tennessee. And this here, this is just the prelude that you were watching. For more on this storm and its potential impacts, we're joined now by the director of the National Hurricane Center, Michael Brennan. Michael, what do people need to know about this storm as we're already seeing some pretty terrible pictures coming in before it ever makes landfall?",

So it's going to rapidly approach the coast of the Big Bend. We're seeing conditions deteriorating. We've seen sustained winds of about 50 miles per hour just in the last hour near the mouth of Tampa Bay. Gusts up to 60.But we're, you know, concerned about three major life-threatening hazards. The storm surge along the Big Bend coast, the devastating hurricane-force winds, and tropical storm-force winds that are going to not just affect Florida, but up into Georgia and the Carolinas. And then the potential for catastrophic flooding from rainfall all the way from Florida up into especially the southern portion of the Appalachian Mountains where we could see up to 20 inches of rain.",

Because on top of that storm surge, you're going to have destructive waves as the eyewall of the hurricane moves onshore. And that wave action can destroy a home, destroy other structures and that's what really creates that unsurvivable environment.You know, if you go back to Hurricane Michael in 2018 that hit Mexico Beach, people died in the storm surge trying to leave in their cars. And it's important to emphasize how rapidly the water is going to rise. And that's why people are asked to leave in advance. Because once you see the water rise, it's going to come up so fast you're not going to be able to get out. So you still might have a little bit of time to get out of these evacuation zones if you've been asked to leave and haven't done so yet. So please try to do so. You don't have to drive very far to get out of the storm surge evacuation zone, maybe just 10 or 20 miles to get to a shelter.",

The bands will keep coming through here, soaking Tallahassee, the capital city population about 200,000. And then the wind will come.For all the storms that have passed over this region in the last few years, none have actually gone past Tallahassee as a hurricane. That is forecast to happen this time. And that could create some real issues here. This is a beautiful cedar tree right behind me. But this town is famous for its live oak trees and the county commissioner told me they expect thousands of trees to come down, hundreds of roads to be closed. That's going to be an issue with power knocked out for days and that could be a good forecast. The local paper is reporting that Waffle House has already closed all over Tallahassee. And that's a sign to come because Waffle House stays open as long as they possibly can. They don't expect to be able to operate here overnight. Public transportation shut down in Tallahassee about an hour ago. And it's interesting because Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, he's coordinating Florida disaster response from here, from Tallahassee. But Tallahassee could be right in the middle of this disaster in a way it just hasn't been before. So the triple threat you've been hearing about, the storm surge, that's 20 miles south of here. But the minute that happens right here in Tallahassee, the wind an issue in that drenching, drenching rain, several inches already, as much as 10 inches by tomorrow, the soil will be so wet, which is why we could see so many of those trees come down, Danny.",

Now, as to the point that Trump's lawyers had been arguing about, some of this conduct being too old. This was something that the appeals court had reviewed before this case even went to trial.

It includes expanded air defense drones - air defenses, rather, drones, and training for Ukrainian F-16 pilots. President Biden also authorized $5.5 billion in presidential drawdown authority. So looking at all of that together, what impact will the surge of assistance have on Ukraine's ability in this war? LT. GEN. BEN HODGES (RET.), U.S. ARMY: Well, thank you. Obviously, this is all very good news and it will give Ukraine not only the physical capability to continue their fight to defend their country against Russian invaders, but it also sends a signal to Ukrainians and to Russia that the United States is, in fact, going to continue to support Ukraine.
