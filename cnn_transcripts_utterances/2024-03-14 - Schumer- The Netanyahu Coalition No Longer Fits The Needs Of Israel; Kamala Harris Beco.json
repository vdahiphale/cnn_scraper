He said it to our own Pamela Brown among others. How could he possibly defend such a thing? We'll tell you next.And leading this hour, the top Democrat in the U.S. Senate calls for Bibi to go bye-bye. Today, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, the highest ranking Jewish official in American history, we should note, said that the Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu and his far right government, have lost their way and it's time for them to be removed from office. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), MAJORITY LEADER: As a lifelong supporter of Israel, it has become clear to me that Netanyahu coalition no longer fits the needs of Israel after October 7. The world has changed radically since then. And the Israeli people are being stifled right now by a governing vision that is stuck in the past. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But there has been growing anger within the Democratic Party, within his caucus for the -- for Israel to do more to provide humanitarian relief along the Gaza Strip, to essentially pull back from some of the more aggressive efforts as part of this military campaign. And after Chuck Schumer called for Netanyahu to essentially step aside for new elections, calling him an obstacle to peace, Democrats who have aligned themselves with Schumer applauded what he said, while Republicans pushed back.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D-CT): I think the current prime minister has to perhaps rethink some of his approaches, especially on humanitarian aid, which I think has to be done more robustly than he has incurred so far. I think there are reasons that Israelis might want a different leader. And I think Senator Schumer has raised some of those reasons very powerfully and forcefully. SEN. RON JOHNSON (R-WI): What is Leader Schumer doing injecting himself Israel politics? Again, I think it's just beyond the pale. SEN. JONI ERNST (R-IA): I'm very upset. I don't think that Leader Schumer should be inserting his ideas and throwing them at Israel where they are in the middle of a war. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That language clearly just signals the fact that Democrats believe that this is a politically mobilizing and galvanizing issue for so many voters and one that they're going to continue hammering home on. Meanwhile, as you noted, President Biden was also in the Midwest. He went to Michigan for the first time since clinching the party's nomination. We saw him specifically visiting Saginaw County. And this is an interesting Bellwether area in the state, voted for Trump in 2016, voted for Joe Biden in 2020. There wasn't a big political rally that the President attended. Instead, he went to a supporters home, this was an organizing event. And really the campaign is at a moment where they are also trying to really draw attention to the beefing up of their campaign operations.

I happen to think Nikki Haley found the right way to talk about this not demonizing people on either side of this. But let's talk about where can we come to an agreement on a reasonable limit for abortions, whether it's 16 weeks, 15 weeks, whatever, and have an agreement and let's move forward on that.I think the reason the vice president's visit has been characterized as cringe worthy were just because of her tone and the way she talked about this. And look, she didn't do such a great job with the root causes of immigration, so I'm not sure why they think she's going to do such a great job with communicating on abortion.

She wrote that there is too much contested here that should be about what we tell the jury. That this isn't a legal question that she was going to be agreeing with Trump on at this time and she wasn't going to be giving him this ability to dismiss the case here, that this is something instead to talk about with the jury, how the law should be applied and interpreted here, what the jury should be told in this case.So, very quickly, resolving one of the, by my count nine, different ways Donald Trump is trying to get this case dismissed. We're still waiting to see what she does with the other piece that he argued today that these papers that were taken out of Mar-a-Lago or taken from the White House to Mar-a-Lago at the end of the presidency that they were his personal papers.

      "sentences": "Katelyn Polantz, thanks so much.In our politics lead, an update to the exclusive reporting we brought to you yesterday about one of RFK Jr.'s vice presidential prospects, Aaron Rodgers. You might remember we reported on the unhinged conspiracy theories that New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers has shared in private that the 2012, very real, Sandy Hook school shooting was not real, that it was a fake, despite the fact that 20 children and six adults were murdered that day. Now these comments of course, are troubling. But they're especially important because he's on Robert Kennedy Jr's shortlist for vice president. Normally, who cares what a quarterback says in private conversation. Yesterday on his ESPN show, Pat McAfee said that Rodgers was apparently at a retreat in Costa Rica taking the psychedelic drug ayahuasca when the news broke about the -- about that his being on the shortlist for vice president for RFK Jr. Yesterday here on The Lead, we reported that Aaron Rodgers had shared these frankly disturbing views about the Sandy Hook shooting not being real. He shared them 11 years ago with CNN's Pamela Brown, she was covering the Kentucky Derby for CNN in 2013 and met him there. CNN, I, have also spoken to another person, one who would like to remain anonymous in order to avoid harassment, who also had a similar encounter with Aaron Rodgers saying that Rodgers claimed the, quote, \"Sandy Hook never happened. All those children never existed. They're all actors,\" unquote. When asked about the grieving parents, whom I met and their grief is real, the source says that Rodgers said, quote, \"They're all making it up. They're all actors,\" unquote. Now, today, Aaron Rodgers is responding to our story, kind of, he does not deny saying what we reported he said, but he or a representative for him tweeted the following statement, quote, \"As I'm on the record saying in the past what happened in Sandy Hook was an absolute tragedy. I am not and have never been of the opinion that the events did not take place. Again, I hope that we learned from this and other tragedies to identify the signs that would allow us to prevent unnecessary loss of life. My thoughts and prayers continue to remain with the families affected, along with the entire Sandy Hook community,\" unquote. Again, you know, if you read that statement, Rodgers does not deny those comments that he made to Pamela Brown and to the other source. Last night on Fox, RFK, Jr. was asked about Aaron Rodgers. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR., (I) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I really like Aaron because, you know, our appeal is to young people. Aaron Rodgers is battle tested. He stood up. He's been hammered by the press. Stood up for things he believed. And I like that part of his character. He's a critical thinker. (END VIDEO CLIP) TAPPER: Critical thinker is now obviously what we're calling conspiracy theorists. Kennedy was not in that interview, perhaps not surprisingly, asked about the comments that we reported Aaron Rodgers made to Pamela Brown and someone else about Sandy Hook, not having actually happened. Today, a spokesperson for RFK Jr.'s campaign did address his comments responding to CNN in a statement saying, quote, Mr. Kennedy believes the Sandy Hook shooting was a horrific tragedy. The 20 children and six adults had died December 14th, 2012 brought the entire country together in grief. Let us honor their memory. This is where we are as a nation. We have actually as a subject for debate whether or not a vice presidential prospect thinks a massive shooting actually happened. Should RFK Jr. select Aaron Rodgers as his running mate again someone he describes as a battle tested critical thinker, it might cost him. Media, it is reporting the donors have voiced their discontent directly with the campaign, pledging to withdraw their support from Kennedy if he chooses Rodgers in particular. RFK Jr. is expected to announce his pick on March 26th. Also in our Politics Lead today, the North Carolina Republican nominee for governor, Mark Robinson, as we've reported, has a long history of anti-Semitic, anti-LGBTQ, sexist comments. Now just this past Saturday, Robinson told the crowd at a Republican fundraiser in Naples, Florida, that it's time to stand up and fight law enforcement. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. GOV. MARK ROBINSON (R), NORTH CAROLINA GOV. CANDIDATE: We once again to be the leaders of freedom in this nation. And it starts with us having a conversation in the mirror. Can I do it? Am I willing? When the chips are down, when the FBI is knocking on my door, will I count? Will I comply? Or will I stand up and fight? Folks, this time stand up and fight. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
