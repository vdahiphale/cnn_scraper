He is a political science professor at Elizabethtown College and he is the co-author of the book, \"Do Running Mates Matter? The Influence of Vice Presidential Candidates in Presidential Elections.\"Thanks so much for joining us here. So we've heard Donald Trump minimizing the importance of his own running mate with the comments that JD Vance will not have an impact on the 2024 White House race. And JD Vance said in response, he kind of downplayed his own relevance. Are they right in purely electoral terms? Do running mates matter? Literally, the title of your book. PROF. KYLE KOPKO, ELIZABETHTOWN COLLEGE:  Well, thanks so much for having me. In short, they do matter but it's often overstated. Trump isn't too far off the mark in his observations. So we do a deep dive into this. In our book, my co-author, Chris Devine at the University of Dayton, and I, we estimate hundreds of statistical models using a wide range of voter databases, dating back decades. And what we find is really three key things. First of all, a running mate is unlikely to deliver their home state. So a battleground state and I know there's a lot of speculation about that every presidential election. And we also find little evidence that running mates generally deliver a key voting bloc of voters. But where they can really make a difference is how they influence perceptions of the presidential candidate. That's the really key thing here. Selecting a running mate sends an important signal. It sends information to voters about what the presidential candidate's priorities and objectives are. So that, probably the most important way a running mate matters.",

But the point being is, in the forthcoming research that we used here for this particular analysis, we found that Democratic, particularly African American voters, women voters, African American women voters were statistically more likely to favor the Democratic ticket in 2020. So the marginal return for that bloc of voters was relatively small but it was there in the statistical analysis.",

What we find over time is that there really isn't a lot of evidence to suggest that home state candidates, at least vice presidential candidates, deliver an electoral advantage.The opposite is true for presidential candidates. There is evidence that presidential candidates performed better in their home states than other states. And I think you have to think about it this way. Whenever voters go to the polls, they're generally voting for the President of the United States. That is the candidate at the top of the ticket. That's the candidate that has the most power. While the vice president is part of the ticket, research shows that they are not nearly as influential. Evaluations of presidential candidates matter at least three times more than that of vice presidential candidates. So hypothetically, in order for a vice presidential candidate to really make a tremendous difference, they would have to be exceptionally popular, particularly in their home state. And we just don't see that happening very often. Now is it possible theoretically? Yes but we just haven't seen that in past elections very often.",

Domestically, there was huge demonstrations last week, demanding that he take a ceasefire deal, demanding he bring the hostages just home. Meanwhile, prime minister Netanyahu only seems to be aggravating tensions with this series of assassinations that have further pushed the proxies around the region have instigated Iran to vow this retaliation. But what will that retaliation look like? That's what you hear from our colleague, Ben, what U.S. officials are preparing for because it does not have to come. This response does not have to come directly from Tehran. Iran could easily activate its tentacles around the region and then you have that retaliation coming from Iraq or Syria or Yemen and that means U.S. assets on the ground, potentially threatened; U.S. troops, potentially threatened. You'll remember at the beginning of the year, there was three U.S. service members killed along the Jordan-Syria border. We had this huge barrage of missiles and rockets that were fired by Iran in April. That's the response that they may expect in this time but it could be wider, just as I mentioned. And all of that only escalates and grows the scope of this conflict. You might ask me, well, how do we calm it down? How does the temperature cool?

Take a look. You can see the entirety of it on your screen right now. In it, Austin wrote that it was his authority alone to enter into a plea agreement like this and that he had revoked the plea agreements announced only two days earlier as well as relieving of authority the person in charge of reaching those agreements. The agreements themselves had been in the works for at least 2.5 years. So it can't have been a surprise to the Pentagon and the White House that these discussions were ongoing. We reported on it as well as other media outlets that there was an effort to reach the plea deal. And the deal itself was viewed as a bit of a victory in the case of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed or more commonly known as KSM and two of his alleged coconspirators. And that's because the cases against them were so long and complex, delayed over more than a decade, and there were significant legal questions about whether evidence can be admitted that had been obtained from KSM under torture that made these incredibly difficult and complicated cases. In the plea deals KSM and his two alleged coconspirators agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy charges as well as all of the other charges they faced in exchange for a life sentence. The death penalty had been taken off the table. And that is why it received significant bipartisan backlash as well as ferocious backlash from the families of the victims here. Now the question is, where does this go from here? Austin wrote in that memo, the authority is his alone. So it's now up to the military prosecutors who had been looking at this case for so long, who had seen it delayed so long, where this goes from here in what promised to have been a very lengthy and complicated case -- Oren Liebermann, CNN, at the Pentagon.
