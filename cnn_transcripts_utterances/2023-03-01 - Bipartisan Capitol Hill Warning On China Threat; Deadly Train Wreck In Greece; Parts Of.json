The surprise snow storms are also bringing high winds streaming across the southwest and more snow tracking up across the Pacific Northwest. But the storm system is not spreading just snow, it's also spreading panic as resources grow scarce. Cities in the San Bernardino Mountains are facing food and fuel shortages because of dangerous conditions on the roads. Two more bouts of heavy snow are expected in the Sierra Nevada mountains and across northern California over the next few days. It'll take some time for snow to melt in the city of Truckee where snow banks seem to be taller than vehicles. California's Highway Patrol is warning residents to stay off roads if possible.

Just take this image for example. Look at the snowfall piling up. That is a sliding glass window that's coming out of the Lake Arrowhead California region. Get this. There has been so much snow in some of the ski resorts in California that they actually had to close the ski resorts. I mean, that's incredible, right? Isn't the purpose of a ski resort to have a lot of snow? Well, too much is perhaps too much of a good thing, right? 38 inches of snow in the past 24 hours at Palisades near Lake Tahoe and there is still more snow to come. You can see that digging in with another trough. Winter storm warnings, blizzard warnings, blanketing the state of California. Those alerts extend across a great basin over 10 million Americans feeling the impacts of this latest round of winter weather. And of course, as the system advances eastward, it'll pile up more snow, the potential for another two to three feet on top of what they've already experienced. But unfortunately, it's going to encounter some warm air upstream and cause the potential for severe weather. We actually have two different severe weather systems. Today we have severe weather across the deep south but on Thursday, that's the big show. We're going to watch out for the potential for tornadoes across East Texas into Arkansas, Louisiana as well as parts of Mississippi. The potential for flash flooding exists across the region as well.

A passenger train carrying more than 350 people collided with a freight train near the city of Larissa. Dozens of people are injured and more than 50 of them are hospitalized. Authorities say the number of victims is expected to rise. This collision happened shortly before midnight local time.

The train itself, the passenger train had 346 people on board.And this happened just outside of Larissa where a cargo train collided with a passenger train. The cargo train coming from Thessaloniki, passenger train coming through from Athens and it actually had picked up passengers in Larissa. State broadcaster also saying that for some reason the passenger train had been changed lines at that -- at which point then just outside of that city, the collision occurred. Of course, authorities are investigating whether this was a technical fault. Whether this was human error. But priority remains search and rescue right now. You can see cranes and of course, metal cutting machinery. We're also hearing that the first two carriages caught lights, took firefighters a long time to put that fire out. The fatalities occurred in the third carriage. The theory is that in the first few carriages there were still passengers. We can also see some rescue dogs as well people on the ground. The first few carriages were actually where the restaurant was. And this is the major concern that there are more people perhaps trapped under the rubble. This is nine hours into the operation and people talking about being a marathon rescue operation that is occurring right now.

One of the President's advisors tells CNN Ukraine's military will weigh all options, including strategically pulling back if needed. Ukraine says the city is not surrounded though one commander says Russia's constant shelling and bombardment are breaking the city into molecules. Several thousand civilians are still believed to be caught in the fighting and mostly cut off from humanitarian aid. Ukrainian soldiers say the situation in Bakhmut is hellish and much worse than officially reported but they're vowing to defend the city until the end no matter what. [02:15:11] And in a rare admission, Russian President Vladimir Putin has acknowledged losses among the ranks of Russian intelligence officers on the ground in Ukraine. In his speech to members of Russia's intelligence agency, the FSB on Tuesday, he called on the agency's leadership to support the families of fallen agents. He also signed a law suspending Moscow's participation in the new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with the United States. Though Russia's foreign ministry says the suspension could someday be reversed. More now on Russia's push toward back mode and Vladimir Putin's FSB speech from CNN's Fred Pleitgen. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Russian warplanes bombing Bakhmut. This video posted on state media trying to show the advances that Kremlin's forces are making. On the ground mercenaries of the Wagner private military company are leading the assault the Ukrainian say. These Wagner footsoldiers saying they're close to Bakhmut city limits. We're approaching Yahidne, he says. And Yahidne is the entrance into town. This district our platoon has taken without a single loss. Ukraine says the situation is tough for their troops in Bakhmut but that they are clinging on. While Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin is recruiting even more people in an ad with a top Russian propagandist. Sign up for PMC Wagner, he says. You'll learn a man's work and we'll be in good shape for the upcoming World War III. While Prigozhin claims he's gearing up for World War III, he's also involved in a social media standoff with the son-in-law of Russia's defense minister Sergei Shoigu. After the son-in-law Alexey Stolyarov allegedly liked an anti-war blogger's comment on social media which Stolyarov later denied doing, Prigozhin taking aim. We need to catch Stolyarov your roof and bring him to me, he says. I will train him for six weeks since I am a Z-redneck myself, I will help him improve by sending him to combat operations. As the fighting in Ukraine rages on, Russia's president now acknowledges that operatives for the intelligence service, the FSB are both on the front lines and allegedly behind Ukrainian lines. VLADIMIR PUTIN, PRESIDENT OF RUSSIA (through translator): Unfortunately, there are losses in our ranks, the leadership of the FSB must do everything to provide additional support to the families of our fallen comrades.",
