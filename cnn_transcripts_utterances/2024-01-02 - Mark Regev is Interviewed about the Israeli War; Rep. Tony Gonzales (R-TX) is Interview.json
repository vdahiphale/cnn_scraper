As you said, it was eight justices against seven. It was a narrow decision, and it reflects -- I think there is a serious debate in Israeli society about this issue.But I can tell you what there is no debate about, and that is that this issue needs to be put aside and we have to now focus on winning this war against Hamas because the debate about judicial reform is a divisive factor. And this is not a time for divisive political issues. This is a time to focus on what needs to be done, dealing with this existential threat to Israel, Hamas.

I created a split, I created a rift, and I created tension.

And I think the debate was at times overly passionate. And one of the things that I think we learned on October 7th is that when Hamas stormed the border and they started massacring our people, they didn't ask us what is our position on judicial reform, they didn't ask us if we like or don't like the prime minister, they didn't ask us if we were left of center or right of center, they killed everyone randomly. And today fighting in Gaza, in the same tank, you'll have people wholike the prime minister and who don't like the prime minister. You'll have people who support judicial reform and people who oppose judicial reform. But I think September 7th - sorry, October 7th showed us that we are facing external threats that really cast a shadow over any sort of internal debate over judicial reform. There will be a right time in the future, once this war is over, to go back and discuss the ins and outs of judicial reform.

Now, police in Riverdale City, Utah, they found Zhuang on Sunday. They say he was cold, he was scared but alive. With him, several cellphones. Now, that's how police say these virtual captors manipulate and controlled the teen, likely from thousands of miles away. They call this, as you noted, cyber-kidnapped. And they warn that these scammers are increasingly targeting foreign exchange students like Zhuang, threatening him and his loved ones back in China. Now, here's what Riverdale Police have to say. They say that these scammers \"tell the victims to isolate themselves and they monitor them through Facetime calls and/or Skype. The cyber kidnappers convince the victim under duress to take photos of themselves that make it appear they are being held captive and send the photos to their parents.\" Now, back in China, Zhuang's family equally terrified. Of course, they can't reach their son.

So that then scares them into wanting to comply.There have been similar cases, of course, targeting folks across the U.S. in recent years. We've reported on those. And the FBI is now warning that scammers are becoming more and more convincing. All of this, of course, thanks to technology. AI allowing some to more precisely impersonate the voices of loved ones. As for Zhuang, who you see there, when they found him on Sunday, guys, officers say he wanted two things. One is, he wanted to talk to his family, his mom and dad in China, make sure that they were OK, and he asked if he could have a warm cheeseburger. Of course, he got both of those.

I thought it was literally going to be Texas and Alabama. So, what that says is this. For Michigan, after all they have been through, I'll call that team in terms of story line the accused. Harbaugh served a three-game suspension for allegedly being involved in some sort of sign-stealing allegations, his entire team, and they still went undefeated. They came here. They were the underdogs. Everyone assumed Alabama and Saban, head coaches of all coaches, would win. And they showed up in such a big way. Their defense was other worldly. And then you have, on the other side, as we talked about, Washington and Texas. Everyone assumed Coach Sarkisian, who had another story, if you will, in terms of this fairy tale dream in coming back to win it all. Everyone thought that they would win in Texas because they had done so well and they beat Alabama. And here is Michael Penix Jr., here for Washington, arguably one of the biggest, brightest stars in college football, and they were so determined to win because they have been underrated, not talked about as much all season long. So, we have a national championship where we have the accused playing the underrated. And I think this is going to be great. I am so surprised, as I know you are, Phil. And I'm sorry.
