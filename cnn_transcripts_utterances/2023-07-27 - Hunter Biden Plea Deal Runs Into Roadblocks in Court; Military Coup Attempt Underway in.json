I'm Christine Romans.We begin with Hunter Biden's federal tax charges, still unresolved this morning, contrary to almost everyone's expectations. The president's son who planned to plead guilty to tax crimes and resolve a federal firearms charge as well, but the judge's questioning reveal the crucial disagreement between prosecutors and Hunter Biden's legal team. CNN's Sara Murray has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SARA MURRAY, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR (voice-over):  After a tumultuous day in federal court, Hunter Biden left with no plea deal after a federal judge said she was not ready to accept it. President Joe Biden's son arrived in federal court today prepared to plead guilty to two misdemeanor tax charges and to strike a deal to avoid a felony gun charge. After a five-year Justice Department probe that Hunter Biden once predicted he would emerge from unscathed. HUNTER BIDEN, PRESIDENT BIDEN'S SON:  I am absolutely certain, 100 percent certain that at the end of the investigation that I will be cleared of any wrongdoing.",

Then the two sides could not agree if Hunter Biden was at risk of additional charges if he took this deal. With that, the deal was derailed.Eventually, Hunter Biden's team agreed he was not shielded from further charges, and the deal seemed, for a moment, back on track. But then the judge raised questions about the gun deal. Is this even constitutional, she asked. And she said she was not ready to sign off on the deal. The hearing ended with Hunter Biden in a pro-forma move pleading not guilty. The courtroom drama providing another opening for Republican lawmakers who slammed the plea agreement. REP. CHIP ROY (R-TX):  At least there's some scrutiny going on. The plea deal we saw as it started was garbage. SEN. JOSH HAWLEY (R-MO):  Hunter Biden is getting a sweetheart deal that no other American who wasn't rich and had a father who's the president would ever get. Ever.",

Instead, prosecutors say he spent wildly on personal luxuries and expenses.(END VIDEOTAPE) MURRAY (on camera):  Now, our team that was in the courtroom for this wild hearing said as it was wrapping up, the judge did it was Hunter Biden, and said, I know you wanted to resolve this. I'm sorry. What she said she has to be careful in how she's handling it. It is clear, at least for now, Hunter Biden's legal woes are not over, neither of course are his political ones.

But which were out there and maybe still are out there in terms of the investigation.
