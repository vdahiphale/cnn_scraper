Vance, who will soon introduce himself to the American people.Excerpts from Senator Vance's speech were just released. Phil Mattingly has some of that. He joins us now. Phil, what should we expect?

And it is a speech that, as we've been reporting, is very heavy on a biography, a biography many of us know, but certainly will be introduced to the country tonight about his upbringing, about his time in the Marines, his law school degree from Yale, his relationship with his wife.But I think what's most interesting, at least in the excerpts I've seen so far, is how he threads together some of the connective cultural and historical moments of his life with where Joe Biden was, the president, during that time. He was in fourth grade when NAFTA was supported by President Biden, and he was in high school when PNTR, the China trade agreement was reached and Biden supported it. He was college when President Biden supported the invasion of Iraq, really threading together Biden's political career with his youth and what happened in those moments, making very clear that those moments, which have really been kind of the driving, accelerating force of what brought Donald Trump to the height of American politics are central to J.D. Vance's speech, also references, of course, the assassination attempt over the weekend, what he saw behind the scenes and what it meant to him as he accepted the selection to be vice president. It is a lengthy speech, very heavy on biography and very heavy on attacks on the current president.",

ABBY PHILLIP, CNN ANCHORThe other part about the excerpts that we've seen that I thought was really fascinating, J.D. Vance plans to use Joe Biden's 50 years in politics, 50 years in government against him, tying him at all these different junctures to what he says are policies that hurt, you know, the forgotten Americans, the people that he grew up around in rural Appalachia. So, it's not going to be just the kind of red meat that we're used to hearing about Joe Biden and his, quote/unquote, failed policies, but it's using the biography to make that connection between the policies, his own life experience. And this platform, he's giving us a view, I think, of why perhaps they view this as the MAGA future, because he's articulating MAGA policies but in a way that is more digestible to the average person, doesn't come with Donald Trump's baggage.",

He was one of the most vociferous voices, urging his dad to pick J.D. Vance as his running mate.He went to him late last night, last week, they were at a dinner, and I was told Donald Trump Jr. kind of stormed in and was like, you need to pick J.D. Vance, because He knows that his father is often influenced by the last person he speaks with, and he really made this case. Elon Musk and others were also making the case, that this wasn't just an effort by Donald Trump Jr. alone. But I do think you know, when people saw the schedule about a week ago that Donald Trump Jr. was introducing whoever the V.P. candidate was, people were thinking very strongly that it was going to be likely J.D. Vance, not someone that he thought his dad shouldn't pick. I will just say what J.D. Vance's speech to look for is there's a lot of Republican senators who don't like where he is on foreign policy. Senator Lindsey Graham has broken with him a lot. He urged former President Trump to pick either Marco Rubio or Doug Burgum. It'll be interesting to see what he says about foreign policy in this speech because it will give us a road map, potentially, of what that could look like if they are elected.",

But this new extreme Democrat Party, they want us to somehow believe that the only way forward is going backwards, where hiring decisions are based solely on race, where justice is only for those with the right opinions, where streets are a luxury only for the elite, where economic opportunity exists only when you know the right people.
