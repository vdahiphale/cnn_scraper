We are counting down to President Biden's Big Speech, about an hour from now and his entrance into the House chamber where Republicans are now in charge for the first time since Biden took office.New House Speaker Kevin McCarthy will be seated behind the President, a visible reminder of the political pressures on President Biden as the GOP-led House challenges his agenda and launches a slew of investigations. President Biden is expected to try to use his biggest national TV audience of the year to test the waters for his 2024 campaign message. New excerpts of the speech reveal that he will make a direct appeal to Americans on economic pain as he tries to make the case that the United States is better off under his watch. Among the most anticipated moments tonight, we're told that the President is planning to address his order to shoot down that Chinese spy balloon after it surveilled the US for days. We'll see how far he goes in discussing what actually happened as well as the increasingly tense US relationship with China. And emotions may run high when President Biden makes an urgent new push for policing reform. The parents of Tyre Nichols, the young man who was fatally beaten by officers in Memphis will be in the room as guests of the First Lady.    Our correspondents are standing by at the Capitol, at the White House, and in a key battleground state. Let's start with CNN's chief White House correspondent, Phil Mattingly at the White House. And Phil, what more are you learning about the big themes in the President's speech?",

Those three words \"finish the job.\"When White House officials look out into what the President will attempt to accomplish tonight, they made clear this is a literal primetime opportunity for him to run through a laundry list of accomplishments they believe had transformed the US economy. But they are also keenly aware that many of those accomplishments either haven't been felt by the American public or are still in the process of being implemented. That is where those three words will be critical. The President wanting to lay out why he believes the State of the Union in this moment is very strong, but the State of the Union in the years ahead will be even stronger based on what he has laid into place over the course of those first two years. When you talk to White House officials, they underscore the importance of this moment, both in telling the American public what the President has done, but also laying out that groundwork keenly aware that this isn't just about tonight or the year ahead, there is certainly a reelection campaign that seems to be looming in just a matter of a couple of weeks -- Jake.",

In fact, he has told Republican members that there will be millions of people watching and to not have any sort of distracting gaffe that could undermine their party's image at this critical moment.He recognizes full well, the last time so many Americans tuned into what was happening on the House floor. That was early on in January, when after 15 ballots he was elected Speaker, instead, he wants to project a middle of the road image for his party. In fact, McCarthy over the last several election cycles has tried to recruit candidates for moments like this, candidates who are more ethnically diverse, to try to show Republicans will reflect more of what the American public looks like as well.    Now, McCarthy too, has tried to convey to his members that he will act politely to the president. He won't do what Nancy Pelosi did back in in 2020, when she tore up President Trump's speech after the State of the Union address, says he will not do that here, but he does not want to see any of his members have any sort of outbursts like we saw in 2009 when Congressman Joe Wilson yelled out, \"you lie\" against Barack Obama, when Obama delivered -- addressed about healthcare to a joint session of Congress here, Jake. So McCarthy, too, recognizing there is a lot on the line with Republicans and that Americans are watching their actions closely as well.",

CHRIS WALLACE, CNN HOST, \"WHO'S TALKING TO CHRIS WALLACE\": They may not have read me, Jamie, but there is a lot of talk about contrast, which is a nice way of saying that they will point out that some Republicans want to cut Social Security, some Republicans want to cut Medicare, Republicans are talking about not raising the debt limit unless... Thirty-eight million people watched the President's speech last year. If they get anything close to that, it will be probably the biggest live audience, the President gets this whole year. So this is clearly, even though they say it isn't, a campaign speech. Two points they want to make. There was a poll that came out today in \"The Washington Post,\" fascinating. Sixty two percent of Americans don't think the President has accomplished very much or maybe nothing at all. They need to say these two years, he improved your life. The other poll, basically a third of Democrats and Democratic-leaning Independents talk about only they want the President to run for office more -- almost two-thirds don't want him to run for office. How he says what he says tonight is as important as what he says. He needs to come off as vigorous and ready for six more years in the job.",

That's the translation.And how does he address the doubts out in the country? That he is physically up to the job, I think that's a huge challenge. And when he says finish the job, the President wants to do things on the economy, like the Child Tax Credit, like raising taxes on the wealthy. He wants to do things on policing. He wants to do things -- more things on guns, he wants to do things on immigration, none of that is going to happen in the next two years with a Republican House, it's just not going to happen. So when he says finish the job, he means, let's get through the next election, reelect me, and flip the House back to the Democrats. That's the translation for what he is saying. There is not going to be a lot of bipartisanship, but I think one big question, how does the President talk about China? The American people are way ahead of this town. The American people for years have been aware of the China challenge. The balloon over the skies last week give the President an opportunity to talk about his leadership. He has to sell them on Russia and Ukraine, but now, he has to sell them on his policy toward China, and that is an area where many Republicans are ready to work with him, if he sounds tough, and if he brings them to the table.    PHILLIP: And what I've heard is that they're not -- they haven't revamped the speech around this balloon incident. I mean, there's a little exasperation in the White House about how this has all played out, but they think that this is proof of their sort of toughness on China in identifying the balloon when the previous administration didn't. So I think that this will -- look, to be fair, Biden has been talking about China. He has been from the very beginning talking about China as a competitor of the United States, and also talking about the need to strengthen the country domestically in order to compete with China. So I think that will be the theme. But, you know, I was told -- I was asking, you know, are you guys going to tout you shot down a balloon? I'm told, look, they didn't go back and say, oh, we've got to rethink this whole China section, because I think they believe that Biden has been consistent from the beginning.",

So, you know, I think it's going to depend.

You know, I think that he's also been struggling with this narrative around Republicans possibly attempting to cut Social Security and Medicare.

He has to keep the leftmost flank happy, but also appeal to Independents and moderate Republicans, which it looks like he's trying to do in some of these early excerpts.

Blue collar workers trying to engage with what used to be a core constituency of the Democratic Party that has largely moved away from the party in recent years. In fact, in the President's speech itself, he will address this directly, saying, quote, too many people have been left behind or treated like they're invisible. Maybe that's you watching at home. You remember the jobs that went away and you wonder where a path even exists anymore for you and your children to get ahead without moving away. I get it. And part of what the President will be doing in that section of the speech is trying to connect those legislative achievements, those new laws, and what they will do from an economic perspective to those individuals, those blue- collar workers, those union workers that the President believes are the people that he resonates with most, but perhaps have moved away from the party. You talk about the tens of millions of people that when the President reaches the Capitol, he's going to be directing this speech to. That's who it's to.

These legislative accomplishments are not one offs. They are not singular accomplishments in a vacuum.

For those unfamiliar with Kiefer Sutherland or the kind of tradition here, one Cabinet official will stay outside of the chamber. Given the President, the Vice president, the Speaker of the House, all of the senior leaders that are in the Capitol Building, just in case if something happens there, there is somebody outside that could have continuity of government. There's always a cabinet official, Gina Mormando, the Commerce Secretary, was the designated survivor last year. This year it is Marty Walsh. And, Jake, I would note, interestingly enough, the Labor Secretary is a very key member of President Biden's economic team, and several of the key items the President will be detailing tonight will have some ties to what the Labor Department does, but he will be the one outside of the chamber.

He was supposed to go to China and have a high- level meeting with Chinese leaders, and he canceled that trip.There is a Janet Yellen, the Treasury Secretary. Behind her, the Secretary of Defense, Retired General Lloyd Austin. And there is, of course, Attorney General Merrick Garland, whom many Democrats have criticized for not acting strongly or more forcefully enough when it comes to prosecution of President Trump. He recently appointed special counsels to take over the investigation into both Biden and a separate one for Trump. There is Deborah Haaland the Secretary of the Interior. And of course, there is -- I was going to say Xavier Becerra coming up in the back there with the Department of Health and Human Services. You know, what's interesting, Jamie, is Marty Walsh is leaving the administration for a pretty cushy job. He's going to be head of the National Hockey League's Players Association.
