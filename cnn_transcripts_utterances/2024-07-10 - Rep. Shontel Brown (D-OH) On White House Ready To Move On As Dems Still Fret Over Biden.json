And right now, we are in a very scary situation. But what is more frightening to me is what is happening on the other side of the aisle as it relates to Project 2025. When I think about the election that we had in Ohio last year, which I would describe as a test case for Project 2025, when the Republicans in the Statehouse attempted to suppress and silence the voice of the voters by eliminating a simple majority in our constitution, the voters showed up. So I am encouraged by that. They also test-drove their effort to put forth a national abortion ban when they proposed that we would not have the right to make our own health care decisions in Ohio. So this is very fresh for me. The fear around Project 2025 is very concerning. But what I am pleased and encouraged by is the fact that voters, when they are given the information, despite the odds, despite the polling, despite the dulls and the doldrums and the gloom and doom that has been predicted even in a state that is considered ruby red, like Ohio, Democrats, Republicans, Independents, Blacks, whites -- they showed up in record number to vote in election years that were not considered presidential years. And so, that is what I am encouraged by despite all the gloom and doom that has been reported on the news around President Biden's potential issues or health. My focus is winning in 2024 --",

She's been elected twice statewide -- a history-maker in her own right. And to me, it demonstrates that Mr. Trump is probably scared of Vice President Harris. So that is what I take away from that. The enemy does not attack those that they are not threatened by. And so, that is what I take away from Mr. Trump trying to discount, dismiss, and really disrespect the vice president who has done a yeoman's job when it comes to being a vice president. She has had probably one of the most difficult positions as it relates to trying to solidify what it is to be a vice president. No one has had to live up to the standards that she has since being elected vice president. And what I can also say is she is endorsing her president, her ticket. And I can't -- I don't think we can say the same about Mr. Trump's former vice president. And to add to that, we don't even know who his vice-presidential pick will be. When we think about the fact that it could potentially be J.D. Vance, the senator from Ohio, that is frightening to me because we know that the MAGA extremists are all about trying to strip away women's rights.

Look, this was really an extraordinary warning -- real time warning of a foreign influence campaign by the nation's top intelligence official as it's happening.Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines warning that Iran, just in recent weeks, has moved to really ramp up its efforts to try to stoke these protests that we have seen at college campuses and elsewhere related to the conflict in Gaza. Iran, according to Haines, has been not only posing as protesters online, it has also, in some cases, been providing funding to protesters. Now look, for analysts who track this kind of foreign influence campaign this isn't necessarily surprising that Iran would try to do this. Haines and others have warned that in recent years Iran has really ramped up its efforts to try to meddle in foreign governments and try to -- try to sort of meddle in foreign politics, including the United States. They tried to interfere in the 2022 U.S. midterm elections as well as the 2020 presidential election. And, of course, we know that Iran broadly opposes Israel's military actions inside of Gaza and supports Hamas. Also important I think here is that Iran is going to be looking for any opportunity that they have to try to exploit existing divisions within the body politic inside the United States. And, of course, we know, Sara, that these protests have been hugely divisive domestically, making them a really ripe target not only for Iran but other foreign adversaries who are more -- who are interested in seeing Americans kind of fight with each other rather than stand unified. Now, really important to note here that Haines also says that Americans who may have been interacting with this campaign likely did so unknowingly. And she really emphasized the importance of the kind of foundational nature of peaceful protests to American democracy. As you see here, saying that, \"I want to be clear that I know Americans who participate in protests are, in good faith, expressing their views on the conflict in Gaza. This intelligence does not indicate otherwise.\" But, Sara, that's where the warning comes in here. Haines really saying to Americans look, be careful who you are interacting with online.

And all of the allies were there. All the leaders of the 32 NATO countries and some other invited leaders, and President Zelenskyy.So they were looking at the president for basically three things. First, what kind of shape was he in. And he gave a pretty rousing speech in a strong voice. He was, of course, on a teleprompter so there was no chance he was going to go wander off as we saw during the debate. But he gave one of his stronger speeches for whatever that reassurance gave them. The second thing they were looking for was what kind of commitment was he making to NATO. And there we heard sort of the greatest hits from his speeches in Poland and elsewhere in Europe right after the war broke out and a year later. He has obviously been one of the biggest champions of NATO. The third concern you're hearing now is, of course, about the possible return of Donald Trump. But also a growing recognition that the two percent, which 23 of the 32 nations have already met, is going to be nowhere near enough Kate for the kind of challenge that is clearly going to face them for the next 10, 20, 30 years. This is a generational problem. And the United States is not going to be able to spend enough, arm enough to bring Europe up to that level, and that's what I think they have not yet sort of absorbed politically.",

I had John Kirby on, and I asked him about the possibility of the U.S. lifting the current restrictions on how -- that they're putting on Ukraine in terms of using U.S. weapons. And John Kirby basically said the policy that they have in place and kind of using it just over the border -- the policy is not changing right now. But do you think it's likely to change? Do you think Ukraine needs it to change? DOZIER:  Ukraine does have the permission from countries like Britain to fire their munitions anywhere the threat is. France has put certain limitations that Ukraine can fire where Russians have fired at them. That's essentially what we've got from Biden, but just in a certain location. So perhaps that will ramp up to the next geographic area. The major problem that the Biden administration sees, and NATO allies see happening is the air defense isn't good enough to stop not just the attacks on civilian targets but especially on infrastructure. And Ukraine's energy network is Soviet era. So NATO allies can't rush in the technology they need to fix it. And already this summer you've Kyiv, the capital, with 12 hours and less electricity per day. That's going to be worse in the winter. So the NATO allies are looking at how do we get enough air defense in fast enough to save enough of this infrastructure.",
