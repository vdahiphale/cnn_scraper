So, what we'rewatching for acutely is to see whether the strategic partnership is going to be small ball, like economic measures, trading in rubles instead of dollars right now between North Korea and Russia, tourism measures. Or are they going to play fastball and hardball with new military cooperation, perhaps military drills in some of these disputed islands close to the border of North and South Korea, or perhaps a mutual defense agreement that seems to be a little less likely for reasons that we're going to explain in a few seconds from now. But in terms of what each country wants, why they're growing closer to each other, it's because they need things from each other acutely, Bianna and Zain. So, what North Korea wants from Russia, whole laundry list we're talking about, help with their satellite program, with their ballistic missile program, help with food security, energy, of course. And, of course, Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea, wants the, quote, unquote, prestige of standing with a, from their point of view, strong leader like Vladimir Putin. Again, I stress from their point of view. What Russia wants, they need more ammo constantly to help prosecute their war with Ukraine against Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. And, you know, interestingly enough, Bianna and Zain, we heard very public comments from Vladimir Putin last week when he said that he was thanking South Korea for not, I repeat, not sending lethal weapons to Ukraine to help President Zelenskyy. And for that reason alone, there are so many experts we've talked to who have said because President Putin is grateful to South Korea not sending these lethal weapons to Ukraine, perhaps he may not rock the boat here on the peninsula too, too much. Listen to a few words on that point. Let's listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Just talk us through what is going on here in terms of the winds, the lowhumidity, the high temperatures, this perfect storm, essentially, that is fueling the blazes. NATASHA CHEN, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Zain and Bianna, this situation is getting worse and worse by the year. It seems we're seeing more and more wildfires grow larger and larger. Some in recent years, we've seen some that were supposed to be once in a century events becoming a couple of times a season. And we talked to the public information officer here at the command center for the post fire here in Los Angeles County about this. He says the strategy now is to just send way more crews to attack the fire more quickly. As in this case, 15,000 acres burned, more than a thousand people evacuated over the weekend with this post fire. And he says if they just quickly wrap this fire, they can prepare potentially for the next big one. Right now, they've got the northern perimeter of this fire contained well, but the southern perimeter is a bit difficult because of the rugged terrain. They are still expecting high winds with a red flag warning through about midday today. Just about now is when they're hoping to see things taper off a little bit. But they have to actually send in crews, shuttle them by boat on a lake to get to the southern perimeter in certain parts. And that, he says, they've never seen in this county. So, they're using all sorts of tactics, really, to get at this fire. Now, while the conditions may improve here in California, the situation in New Mexico is very dire. We are talking about the southeastern portion of the state that has the highest level of drought designation in the U.S. right now, labeled exceptional drought. So, you can imagine the fire dangers there. Here is a resident who had to deal with two fires converging on the village. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Along Israel's northern border, once thriving villages have become ghost towns. In Shlomi, the spirit of the country may be strong, but its people have left. Approximately 60,000 people have been evacuated from the north to hotels across the country. According to Israel, Hezbollah has fired more than 5000 rockets and drones since the start of the war. Israel has carried out strikes against Hezbollah targets and commanders amid fear of a simmering conflict boiling over into a war. \"We are approaching the point where a decision will have to be made\", says Chief of Staff Herziya Levy, and the IDF is prepared and very ready for this decision. In recent weeks, the north isn't just under fire, but on fire, sparked by Hezbollah attacks and missile intercepts.

If you are already undocumented in this country, if youcame in without papers, then -- and if you happen to marry a U.S. citizen, you don't just automatically get a Green Card. In order to legally come in without papers, and if you happen to marry a U.S. citizen, you actually have to leave and go back to your own home country, and you can be barred from coming back to the United States for 10 years. And so, this is what the President's announcement today fixes. In addition to, as you know, there are up to 11 million undocumented immigrants in this country who are long-settled undocumented immigrants. We're talking mothers, fathers, aunts, uncles, grandmothers, grandfathers, business owners, veterans, health care workers, first responders. And so, President Biden, in the face of an intransigent Republican Congress who refuses to do anything to fix our immigration system because they are listening to Donald Trump, who only wants to weaponize the issue, two weeks ago, and I'm sure you all reported on this, he signed an executive action to increase border security and make it stricter to apply for asylum in between ports of entry. And so now, two weeks later, he is doing the balance, what we call the balanced approach, stronger border security in addition to expanded legal pathways for those long-settled undocumented immigrants who, by the way, according to economists, have injected more than $7 trillion into the United States economy. And so, I think it's very smart policy. It's incredibly smart politics. You have Latino voters supporting this. You have swing voters supporting this. But importantly, the vast majority of Americans support this. Upwards of three-fourths of Americans support the balanced approach because they know, they probably know some of these undocumented immigrants. They are in all of our communities. They are American citizens in every sense of the word except for that piece of paper.",

It was collegial, but it got quite heated. And we should note that this is a very important issue, a top priority for many voters, not just Republicans but Democrats, as well. And under this new legislation from the President, it would also apply to the children of undocumented people here in the country who are married to U.S. citizens with their step-parents essentially are U.S. citizens. I'm just curious politically, Marie, why wasn't this done simultaneously with the executive order? Because there are some who say this is just a political stunt that it's done to quell some of the outrage given that executive order among the progressives. It seems rather disjointed, some would say. Why not do this at the same time and say I am unrolling today, maybe two weeks ago or today?",
