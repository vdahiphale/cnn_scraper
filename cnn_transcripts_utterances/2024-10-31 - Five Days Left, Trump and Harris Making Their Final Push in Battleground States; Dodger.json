Accordingly, today's show is brought to you by the number five, five games for the Dodgers to win the World Series with a fifth inning rally with five days left in the election.Today, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump both head to events in Arizona and Nevada, with Harris focused on reminding voters what a Trump supporter said about Puerto Rico, with Trump reminding voters what a Harris supporter said about garbage, Trump also raising eyebrows saying what he would do for women, whether they like it or not. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: About four weeks ago, I was saying, no, I want to protect the people, I want to protect the women of our country. I want to protect the women. Sir, please don't say that. Why? They said, we think it's -- we think it's very inappropriate for you to say. I said, why? I'm president. I want to protect the women of our country. Well, I'm going to do it whether the women like it or not. I'm going to protect them. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And they overwhelmingly -- the women in that crowd said yes. But the problem for Donald Trump is his rally audience is not necessarily reflective at all of the overall voting population. In fact, take a look at this latest ABC poll of likely women voters. Vice President Harris comes in at 56 percent to Donald Trump's 42. That's a 14-point gap there.And that is something that Republicans have been concerned about for months leading up to this race and are increasingly raising the alarm of over. You saw Nikki Haley's remarks about Donald Trump's, quote, overly masculine MSG rally, not doing enough to add votes. Yesterday as well, Charlie Kirk, who is a very important ally for Donald Trump because his organization, Turning Point, is in charge of Trump's ground game in several states, he issued this warning on social media, writing, quote, early vote has been disproportionately female. If men stay at home, Kamala is president. It's that simple. So, those are the stakes. Donald Trump, though, continues to push toward, pulling out his base, especially by seizing on President Biden's remarks about supporters being garbage. Take a look at what he said yesterday, continuing to get mileage out of those remarks. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It was those comments from former President Donald Trump in Green Bay, Wisconsin, that certainly caught the fresh attention of the Harris campaign and the vice president. And I would not be at all surprised if she references those again. As she leaves Wisconsin, she'll be waking up here and traveling out west to those western battleground states.The gender gap in this campaign in the closing days is one of the most important things we are watching in terms of an outcome next week. Harris has a strong lead among women. Donald Trump, of course, is doing much better among men. But the Harris campaign was seizing on those comments the former president made about protecting women. Now, at her rally last night here, she's also trying to draw a contrast, of course, with the former president, but at the same time trying to reach across the aisle and saying she would be a president for all Americans. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: As your president, I pledge to seek common ground and common sense solutions to the challenges you face. And I pledge to listen to experts to those who will be impacted by the decisions I make and to the people who disagree with me. Unlike Donald Trump, I don't believe people who disagree with me are the enemy from within. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But the vice president was here because early voting is so key in this race, of course, and the deadline in some counties is Friday, others is Sunday, here in Wisconsin. That is why both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are coming back to Wisconsin on Friday. Of course, the blue wall is so important in both of their strategies. It's her strongest path to the White House. It was the narrowest margin of the three states four years ago. That's why all of their focus, at least a lot of it, is on Wisconsin, even as they travel out west today. Essentially, these candidates are chasing one another, Kate.",

We know that Vice President Harris will end her campaign with a big rally in Philadelphia after barnstorming Pennsylvania on Monday.But Michigan also so key there, Vice President Harris has a narrow edge, but just within the margin. And in Wisconsin, of course, she has a slight edge in the polls. But I am told that both sides are confident here in Wisconsin.
