And of course, what President Zelenskyy wants is a date and a time. Give us a target. Tell us what we need to do to get there.And we'll get there. And the reason that no one wants to do that or particularly President Biden and Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany don't want to do it, is they don't want to commit to getting the Ukrainians into the alliances and a moment that they are still at war with Russia, because that could commit the rest of the alliance and American and German troops to go into the actual conflict. And you can see the escalation issues there wouldn't necessarily require that but it might. And so that's their hesitant.
