It was revving up his re-election campaign as well as sort of threading the needle between his political ambitions and -- or I should say political identity and his personal identity. This is a region that he knows very well. It is one that he comes from, and it is also a place where he has sought support and crucial support going into these elections. So, unions were a big part of today. Obviously, this was a union rally. And we heard from union members earlier, right before his remarks, all of whom were ticking through the issues where they have seen President Biden sort of succeed, including where the unemployment rate is today, inflation, manufacturing, clean energy, and President Biden ticked through those issues himself. But what it always came down to during his remarks was just how important these unions were going to be moving forward. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I'm scared to death, she cried out, before she was shot and killed while hiding in a pew.
