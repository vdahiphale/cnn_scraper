      "sentences": "-- hard way there's a huge price to pay, for pushing Trump's election lies. And the ex-President, who demands loyalty, doesn't often reciprocate. What my sources are saying about a Mar-a-Lago meeting and Giuliani's big ask?Plus, the prosecutor in Georgia, with an ambitious trial timeline, she wants Trump in court the day before Super Tuesday. Could the 2024 front-runner be in front of a judge, for most of that election year? And Hawaii's governor says that more than 1,000 people tonight are still potentially missing. As FEMA is acknowledging challenges with the relief efforts there, we'll get an update, from a top official, and a new look at some of the harrowing scenes, on the ground. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. We begin, tonight, though, with some exclusive new reporting, on the hundreds of thousands of dollars, in legal fees that Rudy Giuliani is now staring down, and the desperate attempts that he has made, to get former President Donald Trump, to cover them. With his attorney in tow, I am told that Rudy Giuliani traveled to Mar-a-Lago, in late April, on a mission, to make a personal appeal, to Trump, to pay his legal bills. By going in-person, Giuliani, and that lawyer, Robert Costello, believed that they could help explain face-to-face why Trump needed to assist his attorney with those ballooning legal bills. They argued that really it was in Trump's best interest to do so. But apparently, it fell on deaf ears. Trump is notoriously strict, about digging into his own coffers. He did not seem very interested, I'm told, in covering everything that Giuliani and Costello wanted. One source says that he verbally agreed to help, but he didn't commit to any specific amount or timeline. Another source tells me that Trump really only agreed, to pay a small fee, from a data vendor that was hosting Giuliani's records. I'm told that was about $340,000. All in total, Giuliani's legal fees are in the seven-figure range. Giuliani's trip to Mar-a-Lago has not been previously reported. We're telling you about it first, here, on THE SOURCE, tonight. But it does indicate the level of financial stress that he has been facing, for months now. Some people in Trump's inner circle were actually surprised by Trump's unwillingness, to pay for Giuliani's bills, given he could find himself, under intense pressure, to cooperate, with federal and, now, state prosecutors, who have charged Trump. Giuliani already sat down voluntarily, with Jack Smith's team, this summer, two back-to-back sessions. He's now a co-defendant, in the election interference case, in Georgia. He is facing 13 criminal charges, like Trump, and potentially serious prison time. It's not out of character, for Trump, to not want to pay legal fees. This is something we have heard from many of his attorneys, in the past, including his former attorney, Michael Cohen, when I sat down with him, last month. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And Michael had to go to court, to get his fees paid. So, Kaitlan, there's no surprise here. And Trump, I think, is willing to tough it out. He doesn't think Rudy will flip.

Giuliani also already owes $90,000 as punishment for not complying with an order to turn over records, in a separate defamation suit, in which he's already acknowledged making false statements about election workers. That's before you get to the $10 million sexual assault and harassment case, in which his former assistant has tapes and text. And now, the 13 criminal charges that the Fulton County District Attorney brought, this week, against Giuliani, Trump and 17 others. It doesn't stop there. All of this is coming as Giuliani is also facing disbarment proceedings, both here in New York and in Washington. That means that right now he cannot make money, from practicing law. Giuliani has firmly embraced his role, as the face of Trump's election lies, something that Trump himself personally ordered. He spent months, speaking at increasingly bizarre press conferences.
