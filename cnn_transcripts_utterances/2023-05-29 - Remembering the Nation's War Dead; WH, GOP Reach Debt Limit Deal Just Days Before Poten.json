President Biden, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, they reached the agreement over the weekend.The plan would suspend the debt limit for about a year and a half through January 1, 2025. Important with that date, it pushes -- pushes off this debate until after the election. But the road ahead is still quite unclear and could be quite bumpy. Party leaders are now waging full-on campaigns to convince their members to back the legislation. If they cannot, the United States could default on its debt on June 5th. That is one week from today. CNN's Manu Raju is on Capitol Hill. Arlette Saenz is at the White House for us. Manu, first to you. Even before they would get to a full House vote, they've got to get through the Rules Committee and that is not even a sure thing right now. What is happening?",

That is the committee that essentially allows legislation to come to the floor.It can stop legislation dead in its tracks if they don't have the votes to get it out of the committee. But there are outspoken critics of this Republican and -- bipartisan bill on this committee, two GOP members. Chip Roy, Ralph Norman, is seat on this committee are vowing to try to do whatever they can to stop this bill. If another Republican joins with them and all Democrats oppose rules that they typically do, and the Rules Committee, that could be enough to stop it. Now the expectation is that they will still get the votes to overcome any efforts to try to derail this in committee. And then the challenge will be in the broader House because at the moment, we are seeing opposition build on the far right of the Republican Conference including some members of the House Freedom Caucus. People who believe that this deal represents a retreat of the Republican position as -- who are demanding far steeper spending cuts and conservative priorities to try to go after the Biden administration. We have seen the outrage build on the right including from Congressman Bob Good, who is a Virginia Republican, who tweeted no one -- \"No one claiming to be a conservative could justify a yes vote.\" Congressman Clyde also saying, \"Hard pass. Hold the line.\" Now the question would be how many of these Republicans will be -- will vote no and the hope among the leadership is that there will be enough Democratic votes to offset the Republican losses. And yesterday in speaking to the -- on a separate network, Congressman Jeffries, the -- a House Democratic leader, indicated that there would be Democratic votes but said there is still information that his members want to hear from the White House. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY): Well, I do expect that there will be Democratic support once we have the ability to actually be fully briefed by the White House. We have to go through a process consistent with respecting every single member of the House of Representatives and their ability to fully understand the resolution that has been reached.

The president says in his belief that he thinks Democrats will realize that he didn't give away too much. And that in the end, this was a deal that needed to be struck in a bipartisan way in order to reach a compromise. The White House this morning isn't saying if they do in fact have the votes to get this passed. But they are optimistic about it.

It would raise the debt limit through 2025 which means this fight would not have to happen again before or during the 2024 election. It caps nondefense spending in the physical year 2024 but allows a 1 percent increase in 2025. And allocates $637 billion for nondefense programs in 2024. Wasn't part of negotiations but in case you're wondering, neither Social Security nor Medicare will be affected by this.The deal tightens work requirements for both the SNAP food assistance program and the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. Under the law right now, childless able-bodied adults ages 18 to 49, they need to work at least 20 hours a week to receive food stamps regularly. The proposed change would increase the age range to 55. In other words, if you're like 52 or 53, you don't have to work now, but you will if this bill passes. At the same time though, it expands exemptions for veterans and homeless people. In other words, more will be able to receive food stamps. The deal finds money in a few places. $30 billion in unused COVID funds clawed back. It pairs back new spending on the IRS. Congress approved about $80 billion in new funding for the IRS last year. The new deal reduces that amount by about $20 billion over 10 years. The agreement does not touch the climate or clean energy measures passed under the Inflation Reduction Act. Some Republicans have wanted to appeal a few of those. Kate.",

But it is a matter of time before you'll begin to see some of those families arriving. So the big recommendation right now is for folks to certainly keep track of their loved ones if they are in the water because New York City certainly faces one of those shortages in terms of trying to get ahead of it or at least up those numbers. The city is boosting, they're upping their recruitment efforts including bonuses, also upping the salary for lifeguards in New York from about $16 to now $21 an hour. But the -- the concern though is that they cannot keep up with the demand to fill some of those positions. And not just here, but again, throughout the country. So the big recommendation that we heard from the American Lifeguard Association is for folks to really watch out for one another as -- at this certain point, there doesn't seem to be any -- any relief in sight in terms of that lifeguard shortages.
