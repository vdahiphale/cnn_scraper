Coming up,we're going to get you an update in the aftermath of Russia's attack on the Dnipro, where 90 percent of the apartment wreckage there has now been dismantled but 25 residents remain missing. Plus, we'll take a look at where the war in Ukraine is headed with this strategic and crucial battle for Bakhmut? And finally we'll discuss China's sharp slowing economy recording one of its worst GDP figures in nearly half a century, and the ripple effects for the rest of the world. We begin though today with a conversation about where the global energy market is at the beginning of 2023. And China plays a part in this. This is how oil prices have started the year dipping before rising a bit in the last few days. Well, natural gas prices have actually decreased a bit from those incredible highs. We saw at the start of the war in Ukraine. There are a couple of key factors on the mind of big oil producers. China, as we've been reporting is reopening after ditching its harsh zero COVID policy. Then you got Russia now it's still might respond to the West's price cap on its oil products and what that might do to the global energy markets. And most importantly of oil - of all what is the future of the fossil fuel industry's global efforts to tackle the climate crisis ramp up in a year where a major oil producer this country the UAE gets ready to host COP28. So an awful lot to unpack. And earlier today at Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week, I've got a chance to do just that with one man who has an insider's view of all of this the UAE's Energy Minister Suhail Al Mazrouei. My main question to him was how an oil and gas producing nation like his defends itself while hosting the next big climate conference COP28? But first, I asked him, how he expects China's reopening will impact the oil market short term, have a listen.",

But you're absolutely right, Becky to point out that tanks right now are something that the Ukrainians are very much calling for. I think there are several reasons for that. The Ukrainians, I think, realize that the battles here are shifting to ones where they're going to need more tanks. They also understand that the Russians right now are pulling together or gargantuan force on the other side of the front line. We had that gigantic mobilization that took place in Russia at the end of this year. And those forces are being pulled together. The Ukrainians know they need more tanks. And they certainly also know that the Western tanks are far superior to the ones that came from the Soviet Union's the ones that the Ukrainians have, and the ones that the Russians have as well. So it's a big deal for the Ukrainians. And of course, right now, we mentioned this before; the Germans are really the ones that the Europeans are putting pressure on.

But the fear is that the Russians could very well in the coming days or weeks surround Bakhmut completely or at least make the roads in and out of it impassable one.

Thosereassuring words coming after China's growth slowed in 2022. In fact, the world's second biggest economy is posting one of its worst performances in decades. Now, look, this is largely because of COVID. Beijing says the country's economy expanded by just 3 percent in 2022 and although that may sound quite high that is far below the government's target. And Beijing's got another problem on its hands at present. China saw its first drop in population in six decades last year. CNN's Marc Stewart looks at the implications for the global economy. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MARC STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): The headline is significant. China's population shrank last year, the first time this has happened in more than 60 years, a decline of about 850,000 people. Let's break this down and look at some of the reasons why? First, priorities are changing. We're getting married later, and some young people are not having children at all. In addition, Beijing held a controversial one child policy until 2015. But it was relaxed because of concerns about the population. In 2021 three children were then allowed and a plan was released to strengthen maternity leave and to offer tax deductions. In addition to all of this, the cost of living in China is high, so is education. And then there's just general economic uncertainty that can all impact decision making. So what are the takeaways from this? The United Nations is predicting India will surpass China to become the most populated country this year. And then there are the economic implications. This means an ageing workforce without a pipeline into the future that could impact productivity and in turn economic success. Chinese Leader Xi Jinping has raised these demographic challenges saying boosting birth rates and addressing the cost of raising a child will be part of future policy. Marc Stewart, CNN, Hong Kong.

You had that memorandum that was signed between the three countries where they agreed to address some of the issues that Turkey had raised. That it wanted, that it wanted these two countries to address what it says are national security issues when it comes to the accusations that Finland and Sweden they say are harboring members of Kurdish separatist groups and others groups that they wanted them to deal with this. And it did seem like they were on track after signing that agreement. But Turkish officials are saying, look, they have taken some steps. But so far, it's not enough. They want to see they say more concrete steps and addressing what they say are their legitimate national security concerns. And some Turkish officials are saying now they're in no rush to approve this possibly not even taking it to parliament before elections here that are expected in May or June. We've also heard from the Turkish President, over the past few days also saying that they still want Finland and Sweden to hand over more than 100 individuals who are wanted by Turkey, otherwise, they are not going to approve their membership. But it's also very important to look at this, Becky, in the context of what is going on here. It is the lead up to a critical election in the next few months. It's very much campaign season here. So sometimes what Turkish officials say publicly doesn't necessarily reflect what may be going on behind closed doors? These ongoing negotiations between these countries and other NATO members and also, you know we've heard from U.S. officials, the NATO Secretary General and others in recent months saying that they believe that eventually Turkey will come around that it will approve their membership. But you know a lot of people are seeing this as a moment that Turkey had been waiting for where you've got this situation where it has this leverage it didn't have before.

And that Democratic Senator Bob Menendez has said that until Turkey shows that it has changed its behavior that Erdogan stops his authoritarian tendencies opens up the media and his country stops the threats against the Kurds. And of course, signals a willingness to allow Finland and Sweden to join NATO, and he is not willing to vote at for this arms deal to go through. Now, of course, his voice is not the only one that matters, he has a very important voice. But ultimately, a lot of Democratic senators and members of Congress that we have been speaking to say that they will likely put a provision into any agreement that requires Turkey to show that they will ratify this NATO session for Finland and Sweden before they receive these F-16 fighter jets. Now, it is really unclear at this point how this is all going to play out because of course, the Biden Administration really wants to sell this equipment to Turkey and President Biden did express his willingness to do so just last year saying that he believes it's a good idea, as well as the Pentagon, they also support this. But ultimately, it is required to get congressional approval before a massive foreign military sale like this is actually approved. And so while the Biden Administration is trying to work with Congress at this point to see whether this could actually move forward. It is far from clear that Congress at this point is willing to do that, especially given the staunch opposition that we have seen from certain senior members. Of course, Turkey has been asking for this F-16 fighter jets since 2021.
