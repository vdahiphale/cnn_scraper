We have heard, though, from a U.S. State Department spokesperson saying that there is no reason to believe that Israel would have been involved in this. And another U.S. official telling CNN that this really has the hallmarks of a terrorist attack, something like a group of the likes of ISIS may have carried this out. And this is something that's really being borne out by analysts as well, that this kind of attack is not generally that of a state player. It is generally a militia, a separate terror group that could have carried this out. But, there was a heavy death toll for these twin blasts which happened.What we know from state media, from officials as well, is that one happened at three o'clock in the afternoon, and that one is believed to have been a bomb in a suitcase that was planted in a car and appear to be detonated remotely. And then, just 20 minutes later, once the emergency services would have got to that area, once others would have approached the area to help the initial casualties, a second explosion happened, and we understand from the Interior Minister telling state media that that was actually the more deadly blast, that second last. But, there has been no claim of responsibility at this point. But, it does come, as you say, at a tense time for the entire region. It comes just one day after a top Hamas leader was killed in a Beirut suburb. That's attributed to Israel or Israel itself, not commenting. And of course, there have also been other leaders, Iran-backed leaders that have been killed in recent weeks as well. So, this all just builds up since the October 7 attacks by Hamas in Israel to increase tensions in the area. The U.S. and other countries have been at pains to try and make sure that what happened on October 7 does not expand. But, of course, every day, with these increasing attacks, there is a concern that it could spill over. Max.",

He and at least three others were killed on Tuesday in an attack in southern Beirut. Lebanon's Foreign Minister tells CNN, the government is working to keep his death from sparking a wider war between Israel and Hezbollah. Arouri has been taking part in Qatar-mediated talks with Israel over a possible ceasefire and hostage release. It's not clear how his death might impact those talks. Nada Bashir joins us from Beirut with the details. And we are waiting to see the response, aren't we, the amount of sympathy there is and the response there to the funeral, but also the response in Qatar.",

The Hamas-controlled Health Ministry says Israel was targeting the home of a specific family. Meanwhile, Israeli Military is warning people moving from the north to southern Gaza to keep to the coast road to avoid all the fighting there. Israel has just released video recorded in November that it says shows its soldiers destroying a Hamas tunnel underneath the Al Shifa Hospital. That's prompted the U.S. to double down on its assessment that Hamas was using Gaza's largest hospital as a command hub. Russia and Ukraine have carried out what Kyiv is calling the largest prisoner exchange since the war began nearly two years ago. Ukraine says more than 200 of its soldiers and civilians were released. In return, Russia says 248 of its servicemen were handed over. You can see the released Ukrainian POWs here, draped in their country's blue and yellow flag, singing the country's national anthem and shouting \"Glory to Ukraine\". The UAE helped mediate negotiations over the prisoner exchange. Fred Pleitgen is standing by for us in Kyiv. What does this mean, Fred?",

Epstein was the multimillionaire indicted on sex trafficking charges before his suicide in jail in 2019. It's important to know the persons is named in the documents doesn't necessarily indicate that they had any role to play in wrongdoing. But, we've got more now from CNN's Shimon Prokupecz. (BEGIN VIDOTAPE) SHIMON PROKUPECZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME AND JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): Long-awaited documents finally released. The first batch of sealed court filings pertaining to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein were made public Wednesday. The document stemmed from a civil defamation lawsuit brought in 2015 against Epstein's former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell, prominent figures including Prince Andrew and former presidents Bill Clinton and Donald Trump included in a 2016 deposition of Johanna Sjoberg, a former employee of Epstein. She says in the document that she and Epstein had a conversation and \"He said one time that Clinton likes them young\", referring to girls. When asked if Clinton was a friend of Epstein, she said she understood Epstein had \"dealings with Clinton\". Clinton has not been accused of any crimes or wrongdoing related to Epstein, and has denied any kind of criminal activity. But, in 2019, he admits to having flown on Epstein's private plane, but knew nothing of the financier's \"terrible crimes\". Sjoberg also recalled a time she was with Epstein on one of his planes, and pilot said he needed to land in Atlantic City. Jeffery said, great. We'll call up Trump and we'll go to, I don't recall the name of the casino, but we'll go to the casino. She says in the deposition she never gave a massage to Trump. This is the first reference to Donald Trump, but he is not accused of any wrongdoing. LISA BRYANT, DIRECTOR, \"JEFFREY EPSTEIN: FILTHY RICH\": Right now, the only person who has been prosecuted is a woman, Ghislaine Maxwell, who certainly should be behind bars. But, it's interesting in this network of all these men who've been trafficking young women and underage women for decades, and yet the only person that's been prosecuted is a woman. There are many, many other people that should be held accountable as well. PROKUPECZ (voice-over): The documents also contain excerpts of depositions taking a Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who previously reached an out-of-court settlement in her sexual abuse lawsuit against Prince Andrew. Giuffre alleged in her deposition that Maxwell directed her to have sexual contact with people, including former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson, Prince Andrew, and tech guru Marvin Minsky. Attorneys for Ghislaine Maxwell said in a statement on Wednesday, she has consistently and vehemently maintained her innocence. This is the first set of documents to be unsealed under a December 18 court order with more expected in the coming weeks. The documents are expected to include nearly 200 names, including some of Epstein's accusers, prominent business people, and politicians. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
