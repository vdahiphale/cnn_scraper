The Eiffel Tower, standing iconic, getting set to shine bright across the city of light as we get set for the world's best to light up the pool, the track and the field here in Paris over the next two weeks. The final countdown to the official start of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games is upon us.Hello. Welcome along to this special edition of \"Aiming for Gold.\" Live from Paris with me, Amanda Davis, as myself and the team bring you all the buildup to what is billed as the greatest show on earth with a very different Olympic Opening Ceremony set to get underway within the next 30 minutes or so. Instead of the usual focus on the Olympic stadium, this is the evening where Paris gets the chance to set the tone for the next couple of weeks. The long-awaited parade of 100 boats along a six-kilometer stretch of the River Seine with the teams and the athletes making the journey past some of the city's most iconic landmarks, Notre Dame, the Louvre right to the Trocadero, where the Olympic Cauldron will be lit. And I am delighted to say joining me this evening, we have CNN's Coy Wire just down there, behind us in the shadows of the incredible Arc de Triomphe and senior international correspondent based here in Paris, Melissa Bell. It is an Olympic Opening Ceremony that Paris 2024 organizers have said is going ahead as planned, absolutely unchanged despite what was described as an attack on France overnight, a coordinated sabotage of a number of train lines across the country with fires and stolen cables set to impact an estimated 800,000 people over the course of the weekend. So, instead of the fan zone where Melissa was meant to be this evening, she has spent the day the Paris Montparnasse station. Melissa, I mean, there'd been a lot of talk, hadn't there, about safety and security concerns here in Paris, particularly ahead of this opening ceremony with a difference, but this is certainly not what had been expected. MELISSA BELL, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  No, you know that they had planned for almost every eventuality. We spoke to the Paris mayor yesterday who told us just how well they were prepared, the 45,000 policemen, the 18,000 soldiers. Security was at the forefront of their minds throughout the organization of these games these last few weeks. And yet, it was in the early hours of this morning that disaster struck in a way that no one could possibly have imagined. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BELL (voice-over):  The organizers of Paris 2024 believed they were ready for anything. But it was at 4:00 a.m., hours from the opening ceremony, that coordinated sabotage and arson caused chaos. PATRICE VERGRIETE, MINISTER DELEGATE FOR TRANSPORT OF FRANCE (through translator):  Today, all the information we have clearly shows that it was deliberate, the simultaneous nature, everything happened at the same time. Everything now points to the fact that these were arson attacks, particularly the timing, which is more than suspicious. BELL (voice-over):  Security in Paris is tight, with authorities keen to make sure that things go smoothly. But this was one attack carried out simultaneously across the country that was impossible to imagine. No particular group has yet claimed responsibility.",

Katie then won the silver three years ago in Tokyo. I think a bronze would be great for her here.Not because she is getting worse, but because all of the wonderful young athletes, the swimmers, the girls who grew up idolizing her are now, of course, racing against her, and they're incredibly competitive. So, I think a bronze tomorrow. But then the 800, the 1,500. Basically, with Katie Ledecky, the longer she swims, the better she does. I expect two golds for her there.",

NOE SOBESKY, BBOY NEOSAN\", FRENCH BREAKDANCER:  You just have to be the most connected to the moment possible.
