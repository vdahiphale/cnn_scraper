Go, get out of here and I also threatened him that I would shoot and I had many thoughts. I thought I would actually have to kill him, I would actually shoot a person. He was trying to contemplate whether to attack. Like there was a brief standoff where he was just thinking about coming after me with his body. And I was thinking, oh, I would have to shoot him. But he actually came to the conclusion to turn around and leave and that's when he exited the door and jogged back to his van. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And that is where they say he violated those sanctions. Because if you do any business with some of these sanctions, you're subject to those same prohibitions in the U.S. Now, that was the first load of charges that we saw. Then there was a second indictment that was announced by the U.S. attorney's office in Washington, D.C. They alleged that while Charles McGonigal -- the former chief of intel in New York -- while he held that position, he received $225,000 in payment from a former employee of an Albanian intelligence agency. Now, they say that he was working with that Albanian, receiving those payments. They say that he also didn't disclose any travel that he took overseas, and he took multiple trips with him. And that he did not disclose on government forms as required, the meetings that he was over there with any foreign nationals. And according to prosecutors, he met multiple times with the prime minister of Albanian. And he pleaded not guilty and was released on a $500,000 bond. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
