Stand by to hear what he's saying about his efforts to tamp down the post Biden campaign. debate crisis within his party.Also breaking tonight, an influential Democratic senator reportedly is trying to form a group aimed at asking President Biden to bail out of the 2024 race. I'll get reaction from a key House Democrat, Debbie Dingell of Michigan. And as many Americans want answers about the president's poor debate performance, CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta says it's time for him to take detailed cognitive and neurological tests and then reveal the results. Dr. Gupta joins us live this hour. Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world. Wolf Blitzer is off today, I'm Pamela Brown and you're in The Situation Room.

Let's bring in CNN's Arlette Saenz in Madison, Wisconsin, where the president had an event a short while ago and sat down for a T.V. interview.

It will be one that's unscripted, one that is without teleprompters at a time when there are many facing -- presenting questions for the president about whether he has the stamina to run for a second term in office.Now, President Biden, as he was departing Madison, Wisconsin, a short while ago, took several questions from reporters, where he once again insisted that he is not leaving this 2024 race.

That is something that many allies have encouraged Biden to do in the wake of that debate.Now, the Biden campaign has also laid out some aggressive plans for the month of July. They plan to have President Biden, the vice president, first lady and second gentleman travel to all the battleground states by the end of the month. They are also launching a $50 million media campaign on television and digital to try to get their message out to voters to try and to show that this campaign remains on track at this time, even as there are serious doubts from within the president's own party about whether he should remain at the top of the ticket.",

I want to get your reaction to what we just heard from President Biden. DAVID CHALIAN, CNN POLITICAL DIRECTOR: President Biden is trying his darndest today to shut this down, this talk of him leaving the race. Obviously, that is a decision for Joe Biden to make and Joe Biden alone. There's no doubt about that. The issue is if he is determined to stay in this race and withstand the pressure, which, by the way, I think we've only seen the very beginnings of what that pressure is going to be, I think this is going to intensify for him and his team going forward, he's going to deal with the reality of what may be a lonely campaign. Because if the Democratic Party deems he's staying in the race but it's not a winnable campaign, House and Senate Democrats are going to try to distance themselves from him, they're going to run their own races, try to separate from the ticket. This will be a different kind of campaign for him if the party he is supposed to lead comes to a conclusion that it's not a winnable race that he is in. And so we've got a -- we're going to see in the next little bit, Pam, how the battleground maps have changed and if indeed some states that the Biden team was sort of counting as already in their blue bank of electoral votes actually are coming back online as real toss-up battleground states. This is going to get a lot more complicated for Joe Biden. I'm not suggesting a replacement candidate will have it any necessarily easier than Joe Biden, but I'm saying if the party comes to the determination overall, this guy can't win and he stays there, it's going to be a different kind of campaign.",

This guy wants to be a dictator on day one. He wants to terminate the Constitution. He puts retribution ahead of the interest of the American people.And that message is actually having resonance with that 1 and 2 percent, those Nikki Haley voters, those independent voters, according to the Biden campaign internal polls, it's actually penetrating and having some resonance with them.

CNN's own polling had Donald Trump ahead by six points before the debate, and it had him ahead by six points after the debate. There were other polls that showed a little bit more slippage for the president, but nevertheless, this is a race that is very locked in.And what is helping Joe Biden the most is the fact that he's not Donald Trump, and that right now, Democratic voters do not want Donald Trump to win. I did a focus group for The New York Times back last year, where I talked to some disappointed Biden voters who said, look, I don't love him. I have worries about his age. Everyone in the focus group thought that Joe Biden would not be able to serve another four years as president. And yet at the end of that focus group, they all said that they would vote for Biden anyways, because they just could not stomach the idea of flipping to the other side. So, Joe Biden right now is a really risky bet for the Democratic Party. If he struggles further on the way to November, they could be in big trouble.

So, Sanjay, we saw the president today give those energetic remarks. They were off the teleprompter, but he did speak to reporters as well after that. What stood out to you when, you know, you look at his debate performance and then you see him today? DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. I mean, you know, there could be significant fluctuations day-to-day and even within the day. Sometimes people are much better as sort of earlier in the day and sort of develop more problems later on in the day. So, it's a little bit hard to read into that. And I think that that sort of gets at the heart of why testing can be so helpful. Are we looking at something that is episodic or something that is sort of reflective of a deeper underlying condition? I don't know. I mean, look, people can have episodic changes because of all sorts of different things. How did you sleep the night before? Is your blood sugar low? Do you have a viral illness of some sort? All those things can affect how you're sort of performing minute-to-minute, hour-to- hour. But is there something deeper going on here? That's what the testing can sort of really reveal. The things during the debate, Pamela, that I think sort of stood out to me and I think lots of other brain docs who've reached out to me were sort of the halting speech, the confusion that sort of led to sort of rambling sort of speech at different times. And also, we don't see it today, but sort of the loss of facial animation, what they call sort of a masked face. These are things that I think for a lot of brain docs would sort of say, look, it's not diagnostic of anything, but it probably warrants further testing in terms of cognition, but also in terms of movement disorders.

There could be sort of basic cognitive testing, which is more like screening tests, something that we heard about with President Trump, the MOCA exam, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. That's sort of a screening test. And I think we have an image of it, but it's all sorts of different things. Can you draw a three dimensional cube? Can you connect a series of dots? Can you draw a clock hand to a certain time, identifying animals remembering certain words, things like that. It's a screening test. It's not diagnostic, by any means, and it sort of gives people an indication if there's more to sort of probe.But the deeper cognitive exams, they are really -- there's a lot more cognitive sort of questions, but there's also physical exam, there's history, there's talking to the patient's family, to really get a complete picture of how the person is behaving over time.

You know, as a communicator, that's the one thing I'm listening for. Are you pivoting back to your message? Are you using each one of these opportunities to get yourself out of a bind and put the attention back on your opponent?
