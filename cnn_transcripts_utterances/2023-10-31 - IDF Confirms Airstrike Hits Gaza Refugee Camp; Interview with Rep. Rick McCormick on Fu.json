Photos of the site showed multiple large craters and extensive damage to nearby buildings. Israel confirmed it was behind the strike. It said its target, a senior Hamas commander was killed. The director of a nearby hospital told CNN hundreds of dead and injured people have been brought in. He said many people are still under the rubble. The IDF's international spokesperson spoke to our Wolf Blitzer just over an hour ago. Here is some of that conversation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WOLF BLITZER, CNN HOST, \"THE SITUATION ROOM\":  I want to ask you first about this massive blast that we all just saw. We saw the video at the Jabalya refugee camp in Gaza. Is there anything more you can first of all tell us about how this explosion happened? LT. COL. RICHARD HECHT, INTERNATIONAL IDF SPOKESPERSON:  Hi, Wolf. Thanks for having me. So we'll be coming out in the next hopefully hour with more data, but I can update you now that there was a very senior Hamas commander in that area. Sadly, he was hiding again, as they do behind -- within civilians, and that's all I can see at this point.

MARWAN JILANI, DIRECTOR-GENERAL, PALESTINIAN RED CRESCENT:  Yes, as you know, our ambulance service has been stationed next to the UNRWA Clinic in Jabalya refugee camp after our center -- health center was destroyed few days ago. So our colleagues have been to the area where the bombardment has taken place. This is the biggest refugee camp in northern Gaza, a huge destruction, many injuries. Our colleagues have dealt with tens of injuries and they've transported alone 30 people who have been killed. This is only our ambulances. Our people who have counted, who have transported those to the hospitals, to Yemen Hospital and to the Indonesian hospitals. We are only one service in addition to the Civil Defense and to the Ministry of Health ambulance service. So we expected the toll to increase. There are so many people under the rubble, we cannot reach -- people are using their hands in order to reach to those who are until now buried under the rubble and we cannot reach them.

We have now few -- we have a very huge shortage in medicine and medical supplies, and even water and food. The aid that is coming, the trickling of aid that's coming through Rafah is not reaching anyway to the north because the Israeli instruction is no aid should go across to the north, so none of the aid agencies is able to send the aid to the north, not to the biggest hospital in Gaza City, Al-Shifa Hospital, not to our hospital, Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City.

According to the IDF, this airstrike on the Jabalya refugee camp killed Ibrahim Biari, the commander of Hamas' Central Jabalya Battalion. And as I said, they say that he was in part responsible for that October 7th attack. They say that this strike was carried out as part of a wide-scale strike on terrorists and terror infrastructure belonging to that same battalion, which they say had taken over control of civilian buildings in Gaza City. They also say that a large number of terrorists, one estimate from the IDF is 50 terrorists were killed, they say in this strike, but that, of course does not explain the dozens of others who appear to have been killed in this strike as we have been watching the images pour in from hospitals in the area. You see women and children among the injured and the dead as well. And so this will be a matter for the Israelis to answer more questions about. We will continue, of course, to press them on this and what they -- how they feel that they try to limit civilian casualties in this instance, when you look at the scale of the strike.",

I assume we're going to hear more about what was achieved beyond the fact that they took out a significant Hamas commander and others as a result of that.

I think that thegovernment here defines progress in the number of Hamas commanders and fighters that they take out. There is an estimated 50,000 fighters. The government set itself a target of completely destroying the whole of Hamas from top to bottom, which many analysts say is something that is impossible to do because there are, A, so many of them and, B, it is an ideology. And you can kill the people who are the front of that ideology. But you don't kill the ideology and you don't kill the anger. And so what is a measure of success here is a measure of how well they are doing on the ground. The number of terrorists, the IDF claims to have killed, is it how far the tanks have advanced? Is it how secure the IDF feel that the streets that they are on are secure? And also the IDF continues to talk about hospitals in particular as locations where Hamas is hiding out. We're not aware so far that the IDF has taken control of any of those hospitals. And so if hospitals are a point that, the IDF says, Hamas hides, at and obviously hospitals are not the sort of place that the IDF can target, they will have to go gain control of those hospitals if they're going to eradicate them of Hamas or deny them to Hamas. And so I think that we are at the very early stages of a ground incursion that Israel has warned will be long and will be different to anything that we have seen in the past.

You understand operating in a war environment I think better that the most of us at this moment and the consequences, the human and life civilian consequences of military objectives.

Does it make the conversation about more money to Israel, the difficult conversation about supporting Israel and their objectives, that much harder in light of what we are seeing? REP. RICH MCCORMICK (R-GA):  Before any of this really went down, as soon as we knew the Gaza Strip had become erupted into Israel and I knew tat Israel was going to retaliate, I said right off the bat, there's going to be horrible ramifications from a ground war in Gaza. We knew this was going to happen. This is part of war. If you don't think that even the greatest successes that we've had in war historically at any point in World War II which we glorify all the time, there was a human tragedy of unparalleled proportions during that war, where millions and millions, tens of millions of innocent people were killed. We had over 200 people executed by the United States who were United States soldiers who did war crimes. War is a horrible thing or else we would become too fond of it. That's not my original saying but it's true. Horrible things happen during the war and the reason that war happens is because one people attack another people. Sometimes it's by some (INAUDIBLE) not. In this case I don't know why Hamas decided to go into Israel. They certainly weren't occupied by Israel at the time. They came in and they beheaded babies, they raped women, they kidnapped people. That is what started this. And everyone in the Gaza Strip laid down their arms right now, we would have peace. If everybody in Israel laid down their arms, we'd have no more Israel. And people would be annihilated. That's the fact of the matter. War is a horrible thing and there's going to be continued innocents that are going to die on both sides.

They have a two front war whether they wanted it or not. They're going being attacked from Lebanon, from Yemen, from the West Bank, from Gaza, all simultaneously. Missiles are coming from everywhere.

They've been used and abused by the Hamasregime, which only a small percentage of the population, whether it be in Afghanistan or Gaza, is really responsible for that violence and for all the death that happens down range. I agree with 100 percent on that point. But when it comes to the aid package, I don't think that the Speaker is only going to do the Ukraine package. He wants to do it  individually and separately because otherwise it gets confounded and it gets more difficult to deal with different factions. I think that we have near universal support for Israel. We want to have good accountability for where that money goes to be consistent with our philosophical boundaries of where we spend our money and how it helps. I think that is why the way that we are paying for this is kind of unprecedented. I want to talk about an emergency funding item and then to look for PayGo. I do not think that is consistent with historical emergency fundings. And I think it is something to be careful of. And it's also something, this IRS money has been cut into several different bills. And so it is consistent with the fact that you either cut it one place or another but you cannot cut it in three different places and call it the same savings. So I want to have an honest, transparent conversation about this. I do not think that Ukraine is going to be ignored. I do not think that the southern border is going to be ignored.

The news came as Australia withdrew their interests, leaving the Saudis as the only country to have submitted a proposal by FIFA's bid deadline on Tuesday.

In recent years, Saudi Arabia has been pouring money into sports, hosting Formula 1 races, heavyweight title fights and the and event on BP World tour before launching the controversial LIV Golf series as well. But it is in football that they have made by far the biggest splash, spending a fortune to lure the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo to play in their Saudi pro league and buying the Premier League football team Newcastle United. Now, of course, they have the biggest prize. The tournament in 2030 is set to be a joint venture between six countries on three continents -- Spain, Portugal, Morocco, Uruguay, Paraguay and Argentina. FIFA says that they will confirm the locations for both 2030 and 2034 at the end of next year. But with the involvement of Saudi Arabia now virtually guaranteed, human rights advocates are concerned. Saudi Arabia is routinely criticized for its human rights abuses. On Tuesday, the Sports and Rights Alliance, which is a global coalition of human rights and anti-corruption advocates in sports, they urge FIFA to secure human rights protections for both the tournaments in 2030 and 2034.
