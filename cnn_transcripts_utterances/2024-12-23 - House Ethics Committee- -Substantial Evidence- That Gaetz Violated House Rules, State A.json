The House Ethics Committee laying out what it calls substantial evidence that the former Congressman paid tens of thousands of dollars for sex with multiple women, including a minor, and took drugs while in office. Gaetz has denied the accusations, repeatedly, and he's pushing back, again tonight. And the alleged CEO killer back in court today. Luigi Mangione's lawyer, tearing into authorities for treating her client like, quote, a \"Spectacle,\" and staging that extraordinary perp walk. Also, is all the talk of President Musk getting under the President- elect's skin? You'll hear what Donald Trump has to say about that. I'm Sara Sidner, in for Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. For the first time, we are seeing the evidence collected by the House Ethics Committee investigation, into former GOP Congressman, Matt Gaetz. The once-secret 42-page report states that there is, quote, \"Substantial evidence that Representative Gaetz violated House Rules, state and federal laws, and other standards of conduct prohibiting prostitution, statutory rape, illicit drug use, acceptance of impermissible gifts, the provision of special favors and privileges, and obstruction of Congress.\" That he \"Regularly paid women for engaging in sexual activity with him.\" \"In 2017... engaged in sexual activity with a 17-year-old girl.\" And \"Used or possessed illegal drugs, including cocaine and ecstasy, on multiple occasions.\" The report referred to the 17-year-old as Victim A. And it said, quote, \"She did not inform Representative Gaetz that she was under 18 at the time, nor did he ask her,\" her \"age.\" Gaetz strongly denying accusations in the report. And in a post on X said, \"They did this to me in a Christmas Eve-Eve report and not in a courtroom of any kind where I could present evidence and challenge witnesses.\" Gaetz also argues, giving funds to someone you are dating, as he put it, is not prostitution. Yesterday, President-elect Trump gave a shout out to Gaetz. Remember, Trump had picked him to be attorney general. But that idea went down in flames.

And in the report today, they too, did not find evidence to conclude he may have violated federal sex trafficking laws. But on the State question, what the House found is that they believe that he may have committed statutory rape, when he had sex with this girl in 2017, and that that could be in violation of Florida's law.

Senior adviser to Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, Karen Finney. And former senior adviser to Senator Mitch McConnell, Scott Jennings. Thank you both for being here. Scott, let's start with you. Gaetz slamming the report, defending himself in online post. And here's one where he claims, quote, \"Giving funds to someone you are dating - that they didn't ask for - and that isn't \"charged\" for sex is now prostitution?\" And that he \"Was never charged with a crime.\" Gaetz has repeatedly framed the Justice Department's decision, not to charge him, as an exoneration. We know that that isn't how this works. No prosecutor has actually come out to clear Gaetz. But he was never charged. What do you make of all of this, and the fact that the ethics report is out, and it has got some really damning information in it? SCOTT JENNINGS, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, FORMER SENIOR ADVISER TO SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL: Yes, I mean, I'll be candid with you. I don't make much of it, because most of the details, or most of the stories that we heard, we already knew. I mean, a lot of this stuff was already swirling in the public domain, anyway. Number two, Matt Gaetz is no longer in Congress. Number three, Matt Gaetz is no longer under consideration to be in Donald Trump's Cabinet. As far as I'm concerned, he's a private citizen in Florida. And I'm sure he has a story to tell about this. And if he runs for office again, he'll have to explain what's in this report, and we'll see what the voters say about this. But honestly, of all the things that happened in Washington, D.C. today, to me, this is a low priority when you consider what Joe Biden did over at the White House, commuting all the sentences of these terrible people, using the power of the presidency. He's still in office. Gaetz is gone. And yet, there seems to be more outrage about Gaetz over stuff that, frankly, is old news.",

He did a really lovely job there, trying to diminish the importance of this. But there's a couple things that do matter. Number one, remember that when Donald Trump initially nominated Gaetz, he was talking about recess appointments, which would have meant that Gaetz would not have had to go through any kind of formal hearing. And there was this, the -- he was pressing that the report not be released. I say that because it is a reminder, this is why the hearings for each of these Cabinet nominees matters. It's important that every single one of those individuals go through the process. I think Trump has finally come around to realizing, they're not going to get him -- let him get away with just trying to shove some of the stuff under the rug, and get -- and pass these people through. I mean, imagine someone like Matt Gaetz as the Attorney General of the United States of America. I mean, he is a disgusting sleazeball. And secondly, I think it's important, I heard some of the members, I was reading with some of their comments, I think they felt that this was damaging enough, that it was important that younger members, newer members, understand that there is accountability, and that this kind of behavior is inappropriate. One of the things I didn't know, that I read in the report, he actually created a fake email account from his office in the Capitol, which he was using to buy drugs. I mean, not only is that stupid. It's incredibly inappropriate, and not someone who should be serving, certainly not in Congress. And I think it's important that we hold leaders accountable. Unfortunately, you have a convicted felon as president, so we missed that vote. But again, I think there's some very important facts that came out today that are very relevant.",

Matt Gaetz is no longer under consideration for being in a Cabinet. Matt Gaetz is not going to be recess-appointed to anything. I feel like there's an effort today to make it feel like, we're six weeks ago. We're living in the now. The now is after he thought about it, Donald Trump dumped Matt Gaetz and got Pam Bondi. And she's going to be an amazing Attorney General. And Matt Gaetz thought better of it, and he resigned from Congress, and we'll see what he does. Regarding his political future. I mean, anybody can run. The voters have to look at your whole record and decide what to do. I would assume, like, I'm no super-genius, but I would assume having a report like this hanging out there over your head, you'd have to explain it, when you ran for Congress. And it would probably be problematic if some of the other people involved in the report came forward. But that's for him to decide. And yes, I really -- really have no idea what he's going to do.",

And as they took this very large, this omnibus bill, as you know, 1,300 pages. People didn't have a chance to read it. Again, we've seen that before. They trimmed it down to 100-and-something pages, something they could digest. And I think the President appreciates the Speaker's leadership on that. So, I think he turned what could have been a potential weakness into actually a strength by being able to pass something, with bipartisan support, by the way, that was a simpler bill and more aligned with what the President, I think, expected, and what a lot of the American people were hoping for as well.",

But him mentioning all this, do you think it's getting under his skin, judging from what you heard there, and that he brought it up? S.E. CUPP, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Yes, knowing Trump, the way we all know Trump, I do. One thing he does not like to cede are headlines. And there are a lot of headlines, not just jokes, but headlines about Elon Musk's power and influence. And it's not just rhetorical influence. The ascendancy of Elon Musk has all the markings of a plutocracy. This is a person, who used his money, and his position, to essentially help buy a president. And he's going to use that President to help push policies that benefit him, personally, professionally, financially, politically. So this is -- you know, I think people are more fearful of Elon Musk's actual influence over policy, than they are just how close Donald Trump and Elon Musk are. He's allowed to have friends. But I think what's worrisome is that Elon Musk is not just seemingly influencing the Executive, but he apparently had some influence over the Legislative as well. Let's not get him close to the courts, or he'll have an impact over them as well.",

And you, Sara. But the problem is not chaos. It's what S.E. said. It's plutocracy. This is government of the billionaires, by the billionaires, and for the billionaires. Axios has counted 11 billionaires that Trump has named to top position, a 11, for goodness sakes. And what do they want to do? Well, they want to cut taxes for their fellow billionaires. They don't want to raise the minimum wage for working people. That's the way to go at this. Trump won voters who make less than 50 grand a year. He, I'm sure, is very proud of that. He should be. I admire that. But if the Democrats want to win those folks back, they've got to make the case that they're better for the working-class. This goes all the way back. The richest guy in the world in 1921 was Andrew Mellon. Warren Harding makes him Treasury secretary. What does Mellon do? He raises tariffs, which hits working people. He cuts taxes for the rich. He cuts taxes for corporations. We wind up in a Great Depression. And for the next 95 years, the Democrats win working-class voters, until a few weeks ago. Democrats ought to be able to focus on the plutocracy. And that's exactly the problem here, is this is billionaires running our country for their interests.",

He has commuted the sentences of 37 of the 40 total federal death row inmates, who will now serve out life in prison.This is a part of a move to blunt, frankly, Trump's plan to restart federal executions. In Trump's first term, there were, I think, 13 executions, more than any other president in modern history. S.E., what do you make of this, the move from President Biden, and the fact that you're looking at a president to -- who let more people than any other president be killed under the federal guidelines?",
