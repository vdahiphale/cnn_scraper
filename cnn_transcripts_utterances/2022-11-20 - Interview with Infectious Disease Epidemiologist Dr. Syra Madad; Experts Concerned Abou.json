So excuse me in some way. Their activity is a way to protect themselves.Colorado is an interesting place. It is both very liberal with liberal islands within a state that's pretty permissive on guns. We certainly know that the beginning of our conversations and mass shooter, you know, were essentially Columbine, but we have a war and a long list. So people in Colorado are so very well aware of the possibility of this. So while we can talk about outside support police, surveillance cameras, body checks before you go into bars. It is also clearly a community and essentially the gay patrons at this club, who minimize the threat for themselves. And unfortunately, a lot of times that ends up being your sort of measure of success, because time is so limited to respond.

It feels like just 3 degrees in Buffalo, 2 degrees in Chicago. Feels like minus 2 degree in Duluth. So it's that factor of both. But here's the thing, there's still more snow that's coming down. For a city like Buffalo, Cleveland, Erie, likely an additional 1 to 2 inches, which is plenty they've had enough. But the highest area we're expecting to see snow today is that space between Syracuse and Watertown where is as much as 1 foot of additional snow could still come down. And here's the thing, temperatures still cold today. They're still going to be below normal tomorrow. But we will start to see at least a trend in the right direction going warmer.

My next guest is acutely aware of the problem. Her two-year-old daughter spent five days in and out of hospitals and doctors' offices after suffering a severe case of RSV.Dr. Syra Madad is an Infectious Disease Epidemiologist at Boston University and Senior Director at the Special Pathogens Program at NYC Health and Hospitals. Dr. Madad, I appreciate you joining us this morning. I'm sorry for what you've been through. I mean that's -- I'm sure it was alarming as a mom. Can you just talk us through what happened to your daughter, Lila, and when you felt something was seriously wrong? DR. SYRA MADAD, INFECTIOUS DISEASE EPIDEMIOLOGIST: Yes, so she was unfortunately infected with RSV just a few weeks ago and it came down with her just initially feeling irritable, and then she progressed to nasal congestion and coughing. And then shortly after that, she started to feel pretty bad in terms of spiking high fevers not eating much, you know, just generally being very weak and decreased activity. [07:30:00] And for me as parent, and as a parent of three, this isn't my, you know, third time experiencing, you know, my child unfortunately going through RSV. I knew that this was a telltale sign, you know, when you started seeing high fever, decreased appetite. You want to make sure you give you pediatrician a call. But for me, I went to the urgent care because it's after hours followed up by a pediatrician's visit. And then, luckily, she was on the mend after a few days, like, majority of children, you know, they usually have typically a mild case, they recover on their own without requiring emergency department support services. But for her, she also experiences post -- you know, a viral rash that spread all throughout her body. And to me, that also pondered (ph) a visit to the emergency department. And for viral rash, this is something, unfortunately, is common. Not everybody experiences it, but she, unfortunately, did where it's just her body reacting to the virus. So, luckily, she's on the mend. She's feeling better. But I certainly sympathize for all the parents and caregivers out there that are in the very similar experience, you know, with me that are experiencing the child suffering right now. WALKER:  Yes. Oh, gosh. I'm sorry. I mean -- and I'm glad she's doing better and she's on the mend. I thought that RSV was a serious threat if it became serious for infants or children under one. But -- I mean, toddlers can be impacted as well that way. DR. MADAD:  That right. Really anybody can get RSV. Anybody can get impacted. But those that are most at risk are children under the age of five, typically under the age of six months because they have these tiny airways. And then the elderly. And we're actually seeing based on data that, you know, children under the age of six months are at highest risk and being impacted the most right now. They're being hospitalized at records numbers. So, it's very, very unfortunate. And in addition to that, you're seeing that the American Academy Pediatrics is calling the Biden administration to declare RSV a public health emergency. Looking at the date, over 70 percent of pediatric beds across the national are full, and that's alarming rate, especially as we're heading into, obviously, colder months. We're seeing, you know, flu actively rise across the nation. COVID is holding steady but that can certainly surge as well. So, really important that we're trying to prevent all these respiratory viruses from circulating in our communities.",

So, the virus itself hasn't necessarily changed in a more pathogenic, in that sense. It's the fact that there's more susceptible individuals in the population. So, there's a couple of different factors here at play. First, obviously, we don't have a lot of mitigation measures like masking and social distancing now. So, we're seeing of the -- more individuals getting exposed to this virus. In addition to that, because we've had a relatively low, you know, season of RSV and flu the last few years because COVID-19 dominated the playing field, if you will. We're seeing more individuals getting sick for the first time with RSV. So, the first, you know, infection could be severe. And in addition to that, because we have lower immunity from these viruses, it's just coming back and, you know, impacting people in a much more severe way. So, a lot more individuals are getting infected. Hospitals certainly are getting overwhelmed in the pediatric EDs. And was -- the silver lining is because this is a respiratory virus, all three, you know, we have two -- we have a vaccine against two so we have a vaccine for COVID-19 and for flu, which for flu, I'll mention actually is a good match this year, which certainly is good news. And on top of that, the mitigation measures are all very similar. Wearing a mark, you know, staying home if you're sick. Getting tested for COVID if you think you have COVID and not -- sick individuals.
