I'm Lynda Kinkade.We're following breaking news out of the state of Kentucky where a manhunt is underway after five people were shot and wounded near a busy interstate highway. It happened Saturday afternoon near Interstate 75 in Laurel County just north of London, Kentucky. That's about 80 miles south of Lexington. The London Police Department released a photo of who they call a person of interest in that shooting, a 32-year-old white male named Joseph A. Couch. Couch is about five foot ten and weighs approximately 154 pounds. Police say he is considered armed and dangerous. The agency is urging people to contact their 911 call center with any information regarding the whereabouts or location of this individual where police closed a section of the interstate due to the active shooter situation, urging residents in the area to stay inside with their doors locked. And the state has now reopened in both directions. Laurel County sheriffs department said all five victims are now in a stable condition. Well, several travelers told scene and that they were stuck on a highway for more than an hour after police brought traffic there to a standstill. Matt Downing said a police car begins swerving all lanes to stop traffic. A video he shared with CNN shows a police car speeding past a line of stopped cars. Another woman said she and her friend had allowed noise sounded like a gunshot while driving on the highway, and later saw several police cars ill speed by. When they made it to their destination, Christina DiNoto noticed damage to her car and said her hands still shaking. Well, Ed Davis joins me now. He is the former Boston police commissioner. Good to have you with us. Thanks for joining us. So, we saw from the local beliefs to consider this suspect armed and dangerous, that warning from the London Police, Kentucky, where the picture of the suspect. What should we make of the fact that police have already named a suspect, and how will that help in this manhunt?",

One is that the police so quickly put this picture out, but it's very unusual it would indicate to me that this probably then some past history with this guy and they sort of had a leg up on this investigation when it started. It's great the information is out there. People can keep an eye out for him and help the police, so with clues as to where he might surface.The other complicating factor is the fact that this is a heavily wooded area that this occurred in. It's right off a major interstate highway in a rest area and that hole location is hilly and wooded. And it makes a very difficult search when you've got something someone with a weapon that can see you coming, the police have to use extreme caution in working in that environment. They'll bring dogs out. They may bring horses out and start going through the woods, but it's a very dangerous situation, especially at night.",

I appreciate it.Well, now I want to go to the latest on the school shooting here in Georgia where two students and two teachers were shot to death. The mother of the accused gunman at Apalachee High School called a school counselor with a warning before the shooting. That's according to the woman's sister. The call is reportedly prompted by an alarming text message from her son in which he said, I'm sorry mom. Marcee Gray then spoke to the school about what she described as an extreme emergency involving her 14-year-old son, Colt. She has now apologized for the, quote, absolutely horrific shooting. His son has been charged with four counts of felony murder. \"The Washington Post\" reports that it has seen a phone logs showing a call made at 9:50 a.m., half an hour before police when notified of the shooting. The small community of Winder, Georgia, is still trying to process this tragedy. There's been a huge outpouring of sympathy and support from the community after this mass shooting. As people, they continue to try and come to terms with Wednesday's mass shooting in Georgia. CNN's Rafael Romo filed this report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

There's a reason that Donald Trump has been coming to Wisconsin so often, and that's because Donald Trump's campaign use it as being a key part of their pathway to achieving 270 electoral votes come November.Now, look, they actually recognize its perhaps even more important now that Kamala Harris is at the top of the Democratic ticket prior to Joe Biden ending his campaign, Trump's senior advisers have told me they were very confident about their chances here. But now recent polling, including CNN's own polling, released last week, shows that Harris has actually made up a lot of ground in this state. She is currently polling a little bit better than Donald Trump, although, it is incredibly close. You're going to be seeing a lot more of him in Wisconsin in the next two months, but a big focus of Donald Trump's speech on Saturday was about the economy. Now we know that this is the most important issue for most voters across the country, but it's also an issue where Donald Trump is polling better than the vice president. And so you're going to hear a lot more about that as well on Tuesday when he faces off with Harris on the debate stage and one other thing I think is very notable to point out is that he made some news on Saturday. He said for the first time that he would look into modifying the 25th Amendment if elected. Take a listen to what he said. DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT &amp; 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: And finally, I will support modifying the 25th Amendment to make clear that if a vice president lies or engages in a conspiracy to cover up the incapacity of the president of the United States, if you do that with a cover up of the president of the United States, its grounds for impeachment immediately and removal from office.",

Most of the time when we see mass shootings or active shooters, there's either a theater or there's a large accessible crowd as school of theater a bar, because the person presumably wants to have a mass casualty event. This kind of behavior essentially going after cars is intended for two things.One is, of course, to go after a particular -- target individuals drivers, or passengers. But also too, in some ways witness the response which is cars out of control, crop cars trying to the noise. We have testimonials about people hearing noises and wanting to get out of the way and so there's a certain I would say performative aspect to it. Because it happened in the daytime I think that explains how they know who it is or clearly enough eyewitnesses to at least narrow down on the search.

They can narrow down the car.There's even in these interstates in more rural states, there's all sorts of radar, all sorts of visuals. So that once they put the pieces together, there's highway cameras, there's individual cameras, then they can figure out who were in fact were the shots coming from? They can tell that by the noise and then figure out who owns the car. The car identification likely lead to the perpetrators identification and he's likely on the run and knowing that he's now been caught. His motive may be exceptionally perverse he just wanted to have an event that that would not only harm people, but would harm others who were not shot at because of the nature of what a car accident or a car swerving would entail.",

So that was what had happened and then a few minutes later, we just saw dozens the police vehicles going in that direction I believe it's northbound on I-75, and we were like what is going on here and we saw tons of tire shreds on the side of the highway and it's all these things were happening that didn't really add up and about an hour later, we got a call from Jeremy's dad, and he said he was watching CNN and what there was an active shooter on I-75.
