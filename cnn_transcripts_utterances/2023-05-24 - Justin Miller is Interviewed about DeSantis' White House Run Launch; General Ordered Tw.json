He ordered his command to tweet that a senior al Qaeda leader had been killed in -- after he was targeted in the drone strike, despite not yet having confirmation though of who was killed. That's according to multiple defense officials telling that to CNN. A Pentagon spokesperson answered questions about the strike on Tuesday.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRIG. GEN. PATRICK RYDER, PENTAGON PRESS SECRETARY: They are investigating the allegation of civilian casualties. So, you know, I think our record speaks for itself in terms of how seriously we take these.

And a couple hours after that, CENTCOM tweeted from its official account that the U.S. had targeted a senior al Qaeda leader in that strike and that more information would then become available. Well, we never really got more information on that and there was no clarity about who that senior al Qaeda leader actually was. Well, now we're learning that that tweet was actually put out by the commander -- or ordered to be put out by the commander of Central Command himself, General Erik Kurilla, before the U.S. really had any kind of real confirmation about who was actually targeted in that air strike. So, fast forward a couple days and \"The Washington Post\" starts asking questions and presenting the Pentagon with some information that called into question the CENTCOM statement that they had actually targeted a senior al Qaeda leader rather than a civilian. After that, Central Command began looking into this information that was presented to them by \"The Washington Post\" and decided that because of the evidence that \"The Post\" was presenting, things like photos, witness testimony from the man's family, it warranted opening a civilian casualty assessment, which is kind of one review kind of short of a formal investigation, to see whether actually a civilian had been killed in this strike, as his family has alleged. So, the review is ongoing into whether this civilian was killed. But obviously it raises a lot of questions about why this tweet was put out in the public sphere before Central Command actually had real confirmation of who they had actually targeted in this air strike, Kaitlan.",

There is no U.S. military footprint in that area of Syria.So, they did urge him. However, two defense officials pushed back on that saying that they did not actually hear any consternation or voiced opposition to that.

In response to this, a committee made up of educators agreed to move that book at the K-8 school. They moved it from the elementary portion of the school to the middle school portion of it.
