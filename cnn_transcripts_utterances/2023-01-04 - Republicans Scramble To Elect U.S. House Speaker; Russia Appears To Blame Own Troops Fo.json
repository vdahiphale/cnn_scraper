Then, a shocking turn as Moscow appears to blame its own troops for a deadly attack that killed dozens of Russian servicemen. And there is reason for optimism. We are live in Buffalo with an update on football star Damar Hamlin's condition. But first tonight, political paralysis in the U.S. house as congressional Republicans struggle yet again to elect a speaker. For the fourth time in two days, Republican leader Kevin McCarthy has suffered defeat, and now a fifth vote you're looking at there is underway. But hard-line conservative Republicans don't appear to be budging in the opposition to him despite of course, intense efforts and horse trading et cetera, to try to persuade them. The Republican who nominated McCarthy earlier tried to tamp down perceptions that his party is out of control. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MICHAEL GALLAGHER (R-WI):  I think my friends on the Democratic side misunderstand what's happening here. Sure, it looks messy. But democracy is messy. Democracy is messy. By design. By design. And that's a feature -- that's a feature, not a bug of our system. We air it all out in the open for the American people to see. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And what a lot of his allies have been saying is they have patience for him for it to go through all of this. But it's not limitless. They want to see some progress today. And so far, we have not seen progress. He hasn't brought anyone over to his side. In fact, his opposition has become even more entrenched and really determined to not back down. So really, this is a staring contest at this point and each side is willing the other to blink. And it's just simply not happening. And so what that means is we're just at a stalemate, and no members have been sworn in. They cannot begin their committee work. This is really putting everything in a holding pattern. And certainly, it is showing the house GOP, the message that it's sending to the American people is you've given them power and this is what they've done with it. They cannot elect a speaker. And at this point, there is no end in sight, eventually, this will get solved. But it's just a question of how long will this go on?

And it is all down to a small minority of fringe Republicans. Look, Republicans worked extremely hard to win back control of the house and gain a majority in the house. But the problem is, a majority that is not united is not a majority. We have a small number of Republicans who clearly have a problem with Kevin McCarthy and will not support him. And it is extremely frustrating for those who fought so hard on the issues and they are making this a personal problem for them in terms of rallying together. And here's the key issue. Ronald Reagan said that in terms of being a Republican, someone can be an 80 percent -- agree with you on 80 percent of the issues, and that makes him a friend and an ally, not a 20 percent trader. And unfortunately, these people have got in their heads that Kevin McCarthy is someone that cannot be trusted and should not have their support in order to move forward. And with this, if we can't get a speaker, we cannot make committee assignments. We cannot legislate and we can't put forward the policies that people elected Republicans to do. Look, some of these holdouts, Chip Roy in particular, a congressman from Texas has valid issues. He has valid concerns about outrageous spending, about the Omnibus Bill, about securing the border and about freedoms. Unfortunately, their valid concerns are being watered down with this public spat with Kevin McCarthy. And at some point, someone's going to have to realize either they need to blink and give in on Kevin McCarthy or Kevin McCarthy needs to recognize we may need a consensus candidate that all Republicans can get behind and also work across the aisle to actually get things done.",

Sometimes those numbers are remarkably high. And typically, they are also remarkably difficult to verify. What makes the situation unique is that the Russians have acknowledged that this attack not only happened, but was extremely deadly as well. As you mentioned, saying that the death toll is 89 right now, and that number may well rise as they continue to pick through the rubble and very likely will find and identify more bodies. What also makes this quite remarkable -- what also makes this quite remarkable is the fact that the Russians are in essence blaming their own soldiers for their own deaths by saying that they were en masse using cell phones despite a ban on using them that close to the front lines. Which essentially allowed the Ukrainians to very quickly triangulate and figure out where their precise location actually was. The bottom line is that no one in Russia is describing this as anything but a failure. The Ministry of Defense says that those officers who allowed this to happen will be held accountable. That is, if they survived that attack. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MCLEAN (voice-over):  Digging through the debris of one of the deadliest strikes so far. Dozens of Russian conscripts were stationed in the school that once stood here. They were killed just moments into the new year in an apparent Ukrainian attack, using U.S.-made HIMARS rocket launchers. Now, diggers sift through what little remains of their barracks, while anger in some quarters of Russia grows. One lawmaker claimed the military hadn't given the soldiers quote, \"the proper level of security. Individuals should be held criminally liable\", Sergei Meiranov(ph) said. On Wednesday, Russian officials said bodies of 89 soldiers were found in Makiivka, an occupied city in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region. This would represent one of the worst Russian losses in a single episode of war. But the Ukrainians, and now, one top Russian military blogger, suggests the figure could be higher. Earlier on Tuesday, Semyon Pegov or WarGonzo cast doubt on the official death toll, which then stood at 63. \"Despite the official statement of the Ministry of Defense\", he said, \"the exact number of casualties is still unknown.\" Some of the dead came from Russia's southwest Samara region, state media reported. It showed mourners laying flowers for the victims. Meanwhile, Russia continues its air assault on Ukraine. This strike, Monday night, while a French reporter was on air, was part of a barrage of strikes in Druzhkivka near Kramatorsk. One of the strikes hit a hockey rink, causing extensive damage inside. Russia may be down, but they're not out. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

One other thing to mention, and that is that we also heard from the leader of Donetsk People's Republic who says that when that vocational school was hit, after the initial blast, some of those soldiers actually managed to get out.

Those lower-level military leaders on the ground in Russia who either did not confiscate these phones or did not impress upon these young conscripts how serious it could be. I also have to sort of do a shout-out to the Ukrainians on this. This is a classic example of good battlefield tactical intelligence. You've got signals intelligence on the Ukrainian side, picking up cellphone activity and using it very successfully and in a very lethal fashion against the Russians. So, it's not the conscripts fault. It's the Russian leaders on the ground. The military leaders on the ground who did not do what they needed to do to protect their soldiers.

And they brought him back to life.\" Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DORRIAN GLENN, DAMAR HAMLIN'S UNCLE:  We were in Pittsburgh watching it on TV and his little brother was there with us. And when he seeing his brother drop like that, and I want to tell you, I've never seen him cry, scream like that. Like we were trying to calm him down like it's OK, you know, he's going to get back up, he'll be back in the game, you know, he'll do -- next thing you know, 10 minutes later, they're doing chest compressions. It's a half-hour later, they still are not playing it. I'm like, what's going on? What's wrong with my nephew? And in like -- when I say it like now, we were all in the room crying, man, we were all in tears, man. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They are still just processing everything that's going on with their teammate who fights for his life in the hospital. But they are getting some encouraging news, Damar Hamlin has shown signs of improvement. The Bills said in a statement released just moments ago, \"Damar remains in the ICU in critical condition with signs of improvement noted yesterday and overnight.\" The Bills say he is expected to remain under intensive care as his healthcare team continues to monitor and treat him. This is news for which the team and so many others are grateful. Something else for which the team is grateful, was how the game was stopped in unprecedented fashion. Is something that wouldn't -- has never been done before. Halting a game in the middle of it when there is a severe injury, putting player's safety first. Ten years ago, five years ago, that game would have gone on. Coaches would have said buckle up, get back on that field, it's time to play. So we can't overshadow and overstate how impactful it was for the head coach, Sean McDermott of the Buffalo Bills, Zac Taylor of the Cincinnati Bengals and others to call that game off. Here is Bills lineman Dion Dawkins talking about what that moment meant to him. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It is so much safer now than it was with the rule changes, with the awareness, the cognizance of how brutal this sport can be and how important it is to take care of one's body, of one's mind.

Here the short answer is it comes from these distributors and thethird-party sellers that are essentially taking the parts that these Americans and Western manufacturers produce and diverting them for illicit purposes. Basically, what we found from this Ukrainian intelligence assessment was that they examined 52 components of a downed Iranian Shahed drone and found that, of those 52 components or parts, about 40 of them actually came from about a dozen different American companies. It's a lot of numbers. But essentially the majority of the parts in that drone came from American manufacturers. It's a very concerning statistic to the Biden administration, which, as we reported last month, has actually set up a task force to figure out how and why this is continuing to happen. The reality is that, in this global market, where a lot of these products are just so ubiquitous and so easily available online in other parts of the world, it's very difficult for these companies, these manufacturers to get a complete hold over their supply chains and monitor every distributor and reseller who might be diverting those for illegal reasons. What we were told by the White House is that they have been talking directly to these companies to try to get them to better monitor where their parts and components are going. A lot of these things like semiconductors, very small parts; it is just very difficult to figure out where they're going. The U.S. does not always have perfect visibility either. Sometimes it's actually a lot easier for Iranian and Russian and whatever other bad actor to create shell companies to buy and sell these kinds of products than it is for the U.S. to actually uncover those shell companies and sanction them. So it is kind of a game of Whac-A-Mole at this point. But experts we spoke to said that it is a game of Whac-A-Mole worth playing. If you can make it harder by even a little bit for these bad actors to be able to purchase the equipment from these American companies and then sell them to Iran to make drones to then use in Ukraine, then that is kind of a version of success. But they all agree that this is never really going to be 100 percent stoppable (ph).",
