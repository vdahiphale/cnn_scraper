      "sentences": "Hello. I'm Jake Tapper live at the site of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where the state of our union is deeply shaken.We begin this morning with our breaking news. Former President Donald Trump is safe and a 20-year-old shooter is dead after a shocking assassination attempt on the former president in Pennsylvania yesterday afternoon. Former President Trump described the attack in his own words, revealing that a bullet had ripped through the upper right part of his ear, saying -- quote -- \"I knew immediately that something was wrong, in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin. Much bleeding took place\" -- unquote. This morning, former President Trump added -- quote -- \"It was God alone who prevented the unthinkable from happening.\" He added: \"It is more important than ever that we stand united.\" This was the closest call on a president or former president's safety since President Ronald Reagan was shot in 1981. Authorities say they have identified the gunman as Thomas Matthew Crooks, a 20-year-old man who lived in nearby Bethel Park, north of Pittsburgh in Western Pennsylvania. Crooks was killed by U.S. Secret Service agents, and the FBI says they are working to learn his motive. Public records suggest Crooks was a registered Republican. He made a small donation to a Democratic- aligned group in 2021. One person attending the Butler, Pennsylvania, rally was killed in the attack, and two others are in critical condition. President Biden is set to be briefed again this morning at the White House. He spoke with President Trump last night and joined the condemnation of political violence, as law enforcement confronts a deeply unsettling security failure.

      "sentences": "Right.Well, I'm just going to walk you through some of those details again, Jake. Now, we have learned that authorities have identified 20-year- old Thomas Matthew Crooks as the attempted assassin of the former president. As you noted, U.S. Secret Service had shot and killed him shortly after he had fired a series of bullets into the venue. Now, he lived, we're told, in the suburb of Pittsburgh, Bethel Park. That's about 35 miles south of where we are here in Butler, Pennsylvania, just where the rally was. And it was interesting. We actually were able to connect with his father last night. I'm going to read you a quote of what he told us. His father told us -- quote -- \"What the hell is going on?\" He was trying to figure out -- quote -- \"what the hell was going on,\" but said that he wanted to speak with law enforcement first before sharing more. Now, Jake, I can tell you, actually, if you look behind my right shoulder there, that's actually the AGR building. That's not the exact building where the shooter was on top of the roof, but that is the complex. So we went to the site last night directly in front of the scene where the shooter was heavily armed, heavily guarded. And it was remarkable to me to see how close the shooter was to the stage where Donald Trump was speaking. I was in the venue itself, but if you look at where the shooter was on that roof, it was about 500 yards or so. It was outside of the fenced- in perimeter of where the stage was, but, again, an incredibly close location to the former president. Continues to raise questions about what exactly happened and why that area itself was not secure -- Jake.",

And joining us now to talk more about everything is the former chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin. And let's just start with the horrible news. Your reaction to what happened yesterday. SEN. RON JOHNSON (R-WI):  Well, here's a little bipartisanship. I think what Senator Fetterman said, he said well. It was shocking. It's sad. You know, my tweet was, pray for President Trump. Pray for America. Pray for the family of the deceased, the rallygoer, and the two individuals that were grievously injured. We -- if this moment can turn into a moment of healing and unity, if people can understand what's at stake and the road we're going down -- as President Lincoln said, a house divide against itself cannot stand. I have been saying for quite some time, as much as we're not addressing our debt and deficit issue, I think the greatest threat to America right now is the fact that we're horribly divided. But the good news, Jake, is, there's no reason for us to be divided, honestly. If you consider the main goals in life, most Americans, most people globally are in agreement. We want safety. We want security. We want enough opportunity so we can provide for ourselves and our family. Let's focus on those areas of agreement. Let's turn this moment into a moment that helps us down that path of healing and unity. That's certainly what President Trump tweeted today on TRUTH Social.",

We didn't know about the deceased person at the time. But my first thought was, President Trump knew exactly the risks he was taking, running for reelection. He knew he'd be vilified. He probably didn't understand the full extent of lawfare. He realized his life would be at risk. But he did it anyway. And you know why, Jake? Because President Trump loves this country. And that's the other thing I would say about his supporters, those rallygoers. That's -- if there's one attribute that Trump's supporters have in common, they fervently love this country. And so if the rest of America can understand that about Donald Trump, about the people who support Donald Trump, I think they love this country as well. There's a good place to start the healing and unification of this country. We need to understand that about each other.

So there are people who are purposely trying to divide us for political advantage. Resist it. Don't let them get away with it. And again, start talking to each other. That's part of the problem with social media today is, we have lost that sense of community. These civic organizations, they're not as robust as they used to be. And everybody -- it's awful easy to get pretty nasty on social media. And that ends up being kind of how we socialize.

You can see where the shooter was in relation to Donald Trump. It's estimated to be about 500 yards. We have seen and heard accounts and videos of bystanders who said they were trying to alert authorities to the fact that they saw somebody with a rifle on the roof before the shots rang out.

      "sentences": "Yes, Jake, there's a lot of questions that come up from those facts that you just referenced.I guess, foundationally, it's one of the most basic elements of site security, especially a site that's outside and largely uncontrolled, is that you eliminate sight lines to the space where the protectee will be either speaking or just occupying. And so, when you look at that map, it's so clearly points to those buildings that are within -- clearly within shooting range, although outside the traditional designated perimeter of the event. Nevertheless, there's all kinds of things that law enforcement does in this situation. They either put people on the roof to take up that space and ensure nobody can get up there. They put people around the building to make sure nobody gets access to it, or you can simply move obstacles in between that position and the space where your protectee is going to be just to block the line of sight. Simply by doing that, you eliminate that position of advantage. So I think, preliminarily, there are going to be a lot of questions about why those steps weren't taken here. And there's potentially a lot of answers to that, right? It could be a resource issue that maybe they didn't have the folks to be able to do it. It could just be a mistake, that there was coverage -- a piece of the coverage was not completed according to the plan. Or it could be an issue with the folks who were in that area, likely not Secret Service law -- representatives, but representatives of local law enforcement. Maybe they weren't properly prepared. Maybe they couldn't communicate back to the command post or to the Secret Service folks who were on the countersniper team. So there's a lot of different ways it can play out. I think it's important that we don't jump to conclusions at this point. But, yes, there's many questions to be answered in light of what we now know how this attack played out.",

I was glad President Biden called President Trump and that they had a conversation, short and respectful, but we have to find a way forward, because we're in a pressure cooker. And we're lucky that we didn't have more people lose their lives. So I'm glad President Trump is OK. I send my condolences to the family. But there's a better version of this for us.

That's what our country is supposed to be about. It's not supposed to be about rhetoric, mean- spirited rhetoric on your social media that's easy to hide behind, right? So I think let's try to use this as a turning point, as a moment to sit and reflect about our better angels and how we can become better Americans and put down the rhetoric, put down the vitriol for a little bit.
