      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to all of our viewers joining us from the United States and around the world. I'm Laila Harrak.Ahead on CNN Newsroom, teetering on the brink. With just a week to go, U.S. lawmakers have yet to reach a deal to avoid a government shutdown. Moscow ramps up its rhetoric, Russia's foreign minister calling the West an empire of lies, as he unleashed a barrage of attacks on the U.S. and its allies. A Texas border city hits a breaking point with more than 2,000 people a day seeking asylum amid a surge in migrants at the southern U.S. border. We begin this hour focused on the looming deadline to fund the U.S. government and House Republicans floundering efforts to work out a deal. On Saturday, GOP leaders tried to find agreement among their fractuous caucus in a conference call. But House Speaker Kevin McCarthy admitted later that a number of hardliners were unmoved. With the September 30th deadline less than a week away, President Joe Biden expressed his frustration Saturday evening. At a Congressional Black Caucus awards dinner, he slammed House Republicans for hurting Americans and failing to handle what he called one of lawmakers' most basic obligations. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  Let's be clear, if the government shuts down, that means members of Congress, members of the U.S. military are going to have to continue to work and not get paid. The government shutdown could impact everything, from food safety to cancer research, to head start programs for children. Funding the government is one of those basic responsibilities of Congress. And it's time for the Republicans to start doing the job America elected them to do. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That includes, for example, how many employees would be furloughed, how many would be considered essential and would have to work without pay, as well as what activities and services may be disrupted. Now, there are some services that will continue to, be it federal law enforcement activities, border protection or air traffic control, but the White House making clear over the course of the last week that it is incumbent on Republicans to get these bills passed. Now, we heard from Republicans on Saturday who tried to lay out a path forward and also project some confidence, saying that the majority of their conference does not want to see a government shutdown happen. But the reality is that they just don't have enough votes. And for those bills that they do have enough votes, those are dead on arrival in the Senate.

And in this case, as in past cases, the House speaker here, Kevin McCarthy, really has nowhere to turn because he's being dragged across the political embers by a small number of hard-line fiscal hawks in the Freedom Caucus.And what we're seeing from them, I think, is largely performative politics. And it's underpinned by this feeling that we're very accustomed to, that politics as normal isn't working for us. So, let's blow up the system. Let's light it on fire. It's a style of politics that I think is more concerned with maintaining ideological purity and ensuring that the other side loses than it is concerned with what's doing right for the American people, unfortunately. And it's really hard to negotiate with the cadre of politicians like that because they're essentially willing to take the country to the brink. I mean, there's no doubt that America has a spending problem, its deficits are enormous and they're growing and there's a real cost to that in terms of servicing the debt over the long-term, kicking financial obligations to the next generation, et cetera. But like we saw with the debt ceiling debate earlier, there's a right way to address the problem, I think, and there's a wrong way to address the problem. And just holding the federal government hostage by threatening a shutdown really isn't the solution, but it's the dysfunction that we've become so used to.",

There's also a possibility that Kevin McCarthy may have to go across the partisan divide and work with some Democrats and try to get a majority there.But it does look like a lose-lose situation, certainly for the American people and, of course, federal workers who have the real potential to be furloughed.

      "sentences": "Well, certainly, strong words from the Russian foreign minister directed towards Ukraine and, of course, Ukraine's Western allies, namely the United States and Britain, as you heard there saying that the U.S. is already directly at war with Russia, but also accusing the United States and Britain of not wanting the war in Ukraine to end, dissuading others in the international community from coming to the negotiating table with Russia.And he was pressed by journalists around the possibility of negotiations of a peace plan. He actually poured water, of course, on President Zelenskyy's own ten-point proposal for peace, which has, of course, been out in public eye for some time now. We've heard repeatedly from the Kremlin its views on this peace plan, and that was reiterated by Sergey Lavrov speaking yesterday in New York. He said that this plan simply isn't feasible in Russia's eyes, that it is unrealistic. And, of course, as you would expect, that peace plan put forward by President Zelenskyy makes no mention of ceding Ukrainian territory to Russia, nor does it shut down Ukraine's hopes of one day joining the NATO alliance, two key sticking points in the eyes of the Kremlin. When it comes to negotiations and to the potential for peace, there were also, of course, as expected, questions around the grain deal and in particular the U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres's proposals put forward earlier this month in the hope of bringing Russia back to that grain deal. And we heard from Lavrov yesterday expressing Russia's respect, in his words, for the attempts of Antonio Guterres to revive this deal. But, once again, he said that in the Kremlin's eyes, this simply is not feasible, that these plans won't work in action. He accused the United Nations and Ukraine of essentially failing to uphold their end of the bargain when it comes to the grain deal, of failing to protect Russia's interests when it comes to the export of Russian agricultural goods and fertilizer through this safe Black Sea corridor. He also accused Ukraine of exploiting this safe corridor of using the Black Sea to launch surface drones against Russian vessels. And, of course, it is important to note that Russia has, over recent weeks and months, repeatedly targeted Ukrainian port and grain infrastructure along the Black Sea, while we have seen Ukraine in recent days using this backup corridor unilaterally established through the Black Sea. There are now concerns, particularly after Lavrov's remarks, of the long-term viability and security of this corridor. Laila?",

They are trying to sell again to the rest of the world to oppose Russia as the leader of the non-western world and to sell its role to the non-western world, which is not very logical because Russia is an old colonial empire trying to imitate in its discourse, in the speeches of its diplomats, the grievances of their, let's say, old colonial and now developing countries.",

But they are rejoicing the simple fact of Russia's opposing in the west, even if this opposing takes shape of a brutal war of aggression. These sympathizers, however, are not keen, very keen to become allies. So, Russia is fighting without allies.

The purpose is transporting immigrants to what Abbott calls a self-declared sanctuary city, which are municipalities mostly run by Democrats. In a statement, Abbott said Texas has bussed nearly 12,000 migrants to our nation's capital, nearly 15,000 to New York, and an additional 8,700 to Chicago. In a statement, Abbott said that until President Biden upholds his constitutional duty to secure America's southern border, Texas will continue to deploy as many buses as needed to relieve the strain caused by the surge of illegal crossings. Meanwhile, the Biden administration has announced several steps being taken to address the situation, including the deployment of 800 active duty military personnel, adding capacity to border facilities, and continuing to conduct deportation flights. The problem goes beyond the migrants who have already made it to the U.S. southern border. Take a look at how these migrants are traveling through Mexico on cargo trains using bed sheets as tents to protect themselves from the sun during the long trip north. There may also be tens of thousands of others on their way north. On Tuesday, Ferromex, Mexico's largest railroad operator, suspended service of several northbound train lines after reporting half a dozen injuries and deaths of migrants. We reached out to the government of Panama, a Central American country that serves as transit point for many immigrants coming from South America and other parts of the world. They told us that during the month of August, nearly 82,000 migrants crossed through their territory. And so far this month, more than 55,000 have done the same.

The U.S. ambassador in Kyiv says three more cargo ships have passed this week through a Black Sea corridor set up by Ukraine. They are set to load grain in Ukrainian ports. Two other vessels already are heading out taking grain to Asia, Africa and the Middle East.The temporary routes was announced last month after Russia pulled out of a grain deal brokered by the U.N. while Moscow is not guaranteeing the safety of ships. using the new route. But grain exports are putting Ukraine at loggerheads with one of its closest European allies, Poland. This week, the Polish prime minister threatened to pull the plug on all weapons deliveries to Ukraine. That's after Poland extended its ban on importing Ukrainian grain to protect its farmers. The move prompted Ukraine to sue Poland and two other E.U. countries that have similar policies. And President Zelenskyy later slammed those bans as political theater in his speech at the U.N.

Instead, two-thirds of the grain that Ukraine moved into the European Union actually stayed in Poland and Polish farmers are understandably angry about that.

The police actually have carried out protests against their own government over the past several months on occasion because they say that when they are sent out to the street to fight these gangs that have taken over large areas of the country and the capital of Port-au- Prince, that they are simply unable to do so because they do not have the manpower and they do not have the resources they need to fight against the gangs. Of course, billions of dollars have flowed to Haiti over the years to help Haiti following natural disasters. But so much of that money, investigations have uncovered, is either stolen or misspent. Over the years, it has been proven already that Haiti's problems, many deep systematic problems, are simply ones that money alone cannot solve. Patrick Oppmann, CNN, Havana, Cuba.",

And that comes after the sudden disappearance of two senior Chinese cabinet members in recent months. CNN's Will Ripley reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Away from the great hall's glaring lights in the shadows of Xi Jinping's China, a silent storm is brewing, trouble at the top of the Communist Party. Two high-profile senior officials, once trusted members of Xi's inner circle, abruptly vanished from public view with little explanation. First, it was Foreign Minister Qin Gang, China's second most powerful diplomat on CNN last year.",

They were handpicked by the president himself. And their removal from such visible positions so abruptly, it raises questions in the international community about the stability of the Chinese system. And, you know, Chinese leaders have long said that their stability makes their system superior to democracies. President Xi, however, might be sending a message to the world that no matter who he has put by his side, if they fall out of favor, no one is indispensable. No one is irreplaceable under his one-man rule. Will Ripley, CNN, Taipei.",
