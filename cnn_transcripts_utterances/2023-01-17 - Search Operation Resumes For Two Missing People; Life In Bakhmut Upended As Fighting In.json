CHURCH (voice over): Authorities say 70 bodies have been recovered so far, and at least 41 of them have been identified. Many of them will be handed over to their families in Pokhara, while others including those of foreign nationals will be airlifted to the capital Kathmandu. There were 72 people on board, including four crew members when the plane crashed into a gorge on Sunday. CHURCH (on camera): And CNN's Paula Hancocks has been following the latest developments. She joins us now live from Seoul. So, Paula, what more are you learning about the investigation into the cause of this deadly and tragic plane crash, and of course, this search for two missing people? PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Well, Rosemary, starting off with the search, we know that they are using drones in this particular area, as the plane did crash in a gorge to try and locate those two final victims. They have been having to use a crane to lift the bodies from the gorge itself and there are many taken to the hospital. And as you say, then, many will then be airlifted to Kathmandu, to the capital, as well as the 15 foreign nationals who are on board to be handed back to loved ones. So, at this point, the search is ongoing. And of course, the questions are beginning to be asked, what exactly happened? There is a five person investing investigative committee that has been created in Nepal. We know that there are also four investigators arriving there today, this Tuesday from France from the aviation safety agency there to help with the investigation. Now, they have a number of things to look at. They do have the black boxes. We know that the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder have been retrieved from the site and they will be looked at very closely. We also have seen social media video of the plane as it was coming close to a populated area, and then, banked very substantially to one side. That will be something they'll look at as well. And we heard today from the Civil Aviation Authority and also the spokesperson for the airport saying that the pilot when coming close to landing actually requested to change the runway just minutes before. And one key quote here, saying, \"No distress calls were reported from the pilot to the Pokhara Airport tower controllers.\" So, even at the very last minute, there was no distress call. So, this will all be looked at very closely by investigators. It is a challenging region to be flying. And we have seen a number of accidents over the years due to inclement weather, also due to the fact that they have eight of the 14 highest mountains in the world, including Everest, and it is challenging to fly in this -- in this area. We also heard from some on the ground nearby where the plane actually crashed. And they describe what they saw. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

How critical is this type of support for Ukraine at this particular time?MICHLIN-SHAPIR: So, these are conversations that, obviously, the Ukrainian government is having with government that's governments that are allied to Ukraine. And then, the U.K. is obviously one of them -- one of them, and one of the most steadfast allies that Ukraine can rely on. And Ukraine wants to keep this -- its momentum, the momentum that was created during the counter attack that we saw in -- that we saw before kind of the winter and the conditions for offensive became more difficult. Obviously, Ukraine wants to continue to push the Russian -- the Russians -- the Russian forces out of its territory, out of the entirety of its territory, and it needs these heavier weapons, it needs these heavier systems to continue this momentum. And this is what the U.K. is trying to create. U.K. is also trying to create a momentum on the international arena. So, sort of the U.K. -- the U.K. will be first to send this type of tank and heavier tanks into Ukraine. CHURCH: And as we just reported, Poland's prime minister is calling on Germany to supply all sorts of weapons, his words to Ukraine, adding that the defeat of Ukraine may become a prelude to World War III. Do you agree with that assessment? And why do you think Germany has delayed supporting Kyiv at this point? MICHLIN-SHAPIR: Yes. So, one of the things that the U.K. is doing for sending these tanks is, is mounting pressure on Germany. Germany has been hesitant to allow to re-export its Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine. And so, what the U.K. is doing is basically what Secretary Wallace did was saying, I will go first. I will go first. So, you Germany don't have to do it first. So, you don't have to feel like you're crossing some kind of red line, vis-a-vis Russia. And so, this opens the door for re exporting the German Leopards, which are out there in other allied countries of Ukraine, other countries that are willing to export it, but they can't do so before Germany allows them. And that would give Ukraine much more support, much needed support that currently the U.K. basically just cannot provide because the numbers are not there. So, obviously, East European countries, such as Poland are looking at the situation in Ukraine, are looking at this precarious state where the Russians are mounting this war of attrition against Ukraine. And they're saying, well, if Ukraine -- if Ukraine cannot achieve its goals, then, what happens next, right? Putin is digging in. Russia -- the Russians are digging into this conflict with Ukraine, and which for them is also a conflict with the West. So, this is extremely concerning for them, should be concerning for all of us.",

      "sentences": "But do you think that Ukraine can win this war with Russia if it's able to build up its military capabilities with critical help from these various Western nations?MICHLIN-SHAPIR: So, what happens is that the Ukrainians -- and this is very important also with this various weapons that specifically we're speaking about tanks right now. Is that Ukraine, is -- throughout this war, as the war goes along, its build a western-style military. A NATO style military. And the Russians, even with their numbers would find it very hard to find this western-style military the Ukrainians are building. The problem right now to the Ukrainians are facing is the sheer numbers. The Russians are winning by numbers. They're winning by numbers of the force that they can mobilize, and also by numbers of the equipment that they can bring into the battlefield. So, what do Ukrainians are trying to do, and if they're able to do so, they pour is to -- as the war goes along, to rebuild to modernize their military. So, they will be fighting the Russians, which is relies on Soviet-era technology and weapons, will be fighting a Western native-style military. And then, it will be incredibly difficult for them, and that gives Ukraine a chance of winning this war. Vera Michlin-Shapir, thank you so much for joining us. Appreciate it.

Anti-government protesters from across Peru have been converging on the capital Lima and calling for the resignation of the country's current president.Protests began last month when the former president was removed from office and then detained after illegally trying to dissolve Congress. Over the weekend, the government extended its state of emergency in some regions and suspended certain constitutional rights such as freedom of movement and assembly. Well, now protesters are demanding new elections and a change to the Constitution among other things. And for more on this story, we want to bring in Christopher Sabatini.

Some of them are historical, basically proves always been divided between the capital Lima, and the vast interior of the country in the jungles of the North, and the mountains to the East and the South. And those are largely indigenous populations, rural populations, where a lot of the mining and real basic economic activity of Peru takes place. But those populations haven't benefited from a real mining boom in the country. And so, more and more of the political class had become discredited, the political system had become very fractured, political parties that basically ceased to exist.And what happened was, basically is this population in the rural areas just felt sort of disenfranchised, left out of the national politics. So, when they elected Castillo, who is a completely -- complete unknown, he had never held elected office before. He was from the rural area, he's indigenous. He had been a teacher who headed the teacher's union locally. It was sort of seen as giving them a representative voice for the first time in the country. Now, of course, what happened was it has been sort of a standoff between the Congress, and the -- and the -- and the executive. The country's had six presidents in five years because of impeachment processes and resignations. They attempted for the third time to impeach him. He basically tried, as you said, to illegally dissolve the Congress, was removed, and now those populations that back him, those indigenous populations, the rural populations are rising up and demanding he be returned to office.",

But what they're demanding really is impossible in the short term, they want to have new elections, they want the president to be returned.Well, first of all, he had attempted a coup d'etat, so he's in prison right now. Second, to amend the constitution, to bring up new elections is going to require the Congress voting that to happen, and the Congress is really dead set against Castillo, and that will -- can't even happen for about another year or so according to election authorities in Peru, they can't prepare for the election. So, their demands are not actually feasible. But by the same token, they're sort of activity, their protests are ramping up. And it's come at a really high cost. The crackdown and the state of emergency that's now been extended, as you said, Rosemary, has come at the cost of more than 50 lives. 50 people have been killed largely by security forces.
