THE AMANPOUR HOUR begins in just a moment.But first these top stories we're staying on top of, several breaking stories at this hour in fact. Starting in Russia, where a short time ago, President Vladimir Putin released a statement on the deadly attack on a concert venue near Moscow, calling it a barbaric terrorist act. ISIS is claiming responsibility for the rampage, which killed at least 133 people and injured more than 100. The world is also reacting to the stunning announcement from the Princess of Wales revealing her cancer diagnosis. Princess Catherine says, she is now in the early stages of treatment. All right. Let's get started in Russia. CNN senior international correspondent Fred Pleitgen is monitoring developments from Berlin. So Fred, what more is the Kremlin saying at this point?",

He called the attack on the Crocus Center a barbaric attack as he put it.And he also then tried to create a link Fredricka to the attackers and to Ukraine. It was quite interesting to listen to Vladimir Putin because this is also a narrative that we are now hearing more generally from Russian state-controlled, Kremlin-controlled media as well, where they are saying that right now -- that they're not exactly sure where these attackers came from, what organization they're from, but they are trying to create some sort of link to Ukraine claiming that the attackers were trying to get back to Ukraine after perpetrating the attack last night. I want to listen in to some of what Vladimir Putin had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): All those direct perpetrators of the terrorist attacks, or those who shot and killed were found and detained. They tried to hide and moved towards Ukraine, where according to preliminary data, a window was prepared for them on the Ukrainian side to cross the state border. A total of 11 people were detained.

      "sentences": "There's two things I think are really interesting about that, Fredricka. On the one hand, he said that the perpetrators, as he called them, were trying to get to Ukraine. Of course, that in itself is a pretty difficult thing to do because, of course, that is exactly where the frontline of the war in Ukraine currently is. And there really is no open border to get through there.He then claimed as he put it, that a window appeared to have been opened for them seemingly meaning some sort of way to get across the border which would strongly indicate that Vladimir Putin, like some others in Russian state media are accusing Ukrainian and the Ukrainian state or any state organizations of having been at the very least a part of this operation. Ukrainian military intelligence has already come out and said that Ukraine had absolutely nothing to do with this. In fact, the military intelligence service is accusing Russia of doing this in a false flag operations. So you can see these things going back and forth there between the Russians and the Ukrainians that narrative sort of starting to take hold there in Russia now. The latest that I have for you and this actually came just a couple of minutes before we went on air, Fredricka as the Russians are now saying, that of the 11 people who have been detained so far, none of them are Russian citizens, Fredricka.",

There has obviously been so much worry over the last few weeks and months. Also, a lot of trolling. And I think now that everyone's got their answer, they can sort of make sense of why we hadn't seen the princess for all this time. She had to decompress. She had to recover from surgery. She had to start her new set of treatment. And she's made it very clear that after all of that, the priority was the kids and making sure that they are in as safe an environment as possible, which is why they waited until they broke up from school and went into the school holidays to announce this news to the world. So I think now it's the case of, you know, what level of privacy should the family be afforded.

So we're not being told where they are even at the moment, for example, although lots of flowers, I have to say being laid out in Windsor they for the princess, but we don't even know that she's there right now.She may appear at some point if she feels ready to, but she's not going to be returning back to work until the doctors have given her that approval. I suspect that will be after she's successfully completed this period of chemotherapy and she's ready to go back to work. So we're not going to see much of her. We are going to see William. He says he is going to carry on with his public engagements, but he's got to balance that against looking after his wife and now his children who are at home as well. A lot of pressure on him when you consider his father and his wife have both got cancer now, but he also has to be the front facing of the monarchy alongside the queen.

Let's take a look at what's in this bill, including funding for the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security. You can see the breakdown on your screens there. And now that the government is officially funded for the rest of this fiscal year, we can take a step back and just realize and acknowledge how chaotic and tumultuous this was. We always knew it was going to be challenging for Congress to fund the government when its divided. But this was really next level. Republicans have such a small majority in the House. Democrats control the Senate, and there was a lot of stalemates between the two. Part of the issue was Republicans tried to include a lot of partisan measures in these government funding bills. That was a nonstarter in the Senate. So that set off a stalemate between the two sides. And we saw lawmakers again and again passing these short-term extensions us to get to this point and usually up until the 11th hour. and beyond that, I mean, Kevin McCarthy lost his job over this Republicans ousted him back in October for his handling of government funding. Speaker Mike Johnson now faces a threat from Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene over his handling of appropriations. We'll see what happens there, but I think right now there's just a sigh of relief on Capitol Hill that they have finally funded the government for this fiscal year.",

When we are not feeling happy, when we're not feeling fulfilled in our lives that affects how we show up at work, at school and our communities. But it also ultimately has an impact on our physical health. We've now learned over the years that there's a strong connection between our mind and our body, how we feel, and how we are.

And in fact, what we are seeing is that in many, many countries, which are increasingly modernizing in terms of their economy, their culture, et cetera were actually seeing that unhappiness is growing. And I think that's coming for a few different reasons. One of them is because we're actually pulling further and further apart from one another with the benefits and efficiencies of modern technology and ways of life. We actually have fewer friends that we trust. We have fewer relationships we can rely on and that is a direct impact on our happiness and well-being. The other challenge though is I think technology has been a mixed blessing for us. And I think particularly when it comes to young people, the impact of social media on their mental health has often been quite negative, which is why last year, I issued a surgeon- general's advisory on social media and youth mental health to point out the fact that when young people are using social media as they often are for more than three hours a day, they double their risk of anxiety and depression symptoms.",

And were telling them, you know what do your best to figure it out. It's insane. DR. MURTHY: Yes. That is what we've done to our children is we've put them in unsafe, untenable environments and we're hoping for the best. And you know, who else we've placed the burden on, are parents. Parents all across the world are trying to figure out how to manage social media for their kids. These platforms are rapidly evolving. Many parents never grew up with them. And what they're finding is that their kids are often exposed to extraordinary harms whether that's violence and sexual content, whether its content generated by the algorithm that in some cases tells them to harm themselves. And the experience itself, many young people tell me, has led them to often feel worse about themselves and about their friendships. Yet, they feel they can't get off of it because the features that are built in are meant to maximize how much time we all spend on them.
