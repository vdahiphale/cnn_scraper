So, it's not like there's -- you know, it's not a total freeze. But it's a very complicated equation. We just need to focus on Evan and we're just asking the U.S. government just to focus on Evan and get Evan. And as you say, Paul Whelan has been there for so long.

So, we're very hopeful.But you have -- Paul Whelan is there obviously. Evan is there. And the Kremlin keeps doing it. They have you know Alsu Kurmasheva who is a reporter for Radio Free Europe Radio Liberty. She has been there. Seized for no purpose. For being a journalist. And she's been there for over a year.

The Vatican Pontifical Academy for life has this document called Rome Call for AI Ethics. And that is kind of setting the gold standard for AI. And the pope's concern is that AI be humanly based and take into account the poor and not leave people out or not be used as a method of destruction. And so, I think that it's historic because the pope wants to be where he has an influence. And so, he's invited. He goes. And I think he hopes to make a difference.

And he thinks that they have the power to make sure that legislation is in place where AI does not get abused. And so, I think the fact that you know, he's as engaged as he is, may surprise them.

Because those who are not going to play with Trump, I think, have -- either have to make a decision whether they're going to go with their values, with their beliefs, or they're going to kowtow to Donald Trump and genuflect at his altar.

SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, host of CNN's \"CHASING LIFE\" podcast. What do athletes, office workers, and seniors all have in common? A need to stretch. GUPTA (voiceover): Look, many people ignore this, but stretching is beneficial for all ages, all lifestyles, it enables us to move at our best. Think of it like this. Without stretching, your muscles will actually start to shorten. They'll get tight. And that puts you at risk for muscle and joint injury. It doesn't take a lot. Research in the International Journal of Exercise Science shows that stretching just 10 minutes a day can improve flexibility and range of motion.",
