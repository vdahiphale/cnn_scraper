At about 250,000 square miles, the Empty Quarter desert covers parts of Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Oman and the United Arab Emirates. Up next, we`re headed to that desert in the Middle East to talk about dust storms. Our journey begins all the way in the United Arab Emirates. We`ll meet Diana Francis, an atmospheric scientist in Abu Dhabi and an expert on dust storms. Now, when dust storms hit, they can be dangerous, driving thousands of people to hospitals shutting down businesses and schools these storms know no borders and wreak havoc across the Middle East, and the phenomenon cost the region`s economies an estimated $13 billion a year.
