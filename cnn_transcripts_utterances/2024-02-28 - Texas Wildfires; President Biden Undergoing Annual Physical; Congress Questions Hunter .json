Very dangerous wildfires have now exploded, one of them burning three acres every second. Hello. I'm Wolf Blitzer in Washington, and you're in the CNN NEWSROOM. We begin this hour with President Biden over at the Walter Reed Medical Center outside Washington, D.C., in Bethesda, Maryland. That's where he's currently getting his annual physical exam. This likely will be the last public update on his health before the November presidential election. President Biden is 81 years old, the oldest sitting president in U.S. history. His age and the age of his likely opponent, Donald Trump, who is 77, are becoming campaign issues. CNN White House correspondent Arlette Saenz and Dr. Jonathan Reiner are standing by to join me. Dr. Reiner is a CNN medical analyst and a professor of medicine and surgery at the George Washington University here in Washington. Arlette, let me start with you. What do we know specifically about today's visit? '",

      "sentences": "Well, Wolf, President Biden has been at Walter Reed Medical Center for about an hour-and-a- half this morning, as he is undergoing his routine annual physical.It's expected it's being conducted by his physician here at the White House, Dr. Kevin O'Connor. And the White House has said that they will release a summary of the physical results a little bit later in the day. Now, this is the third time President Biden has undergone a physical since being in the White House as president. He did one back in 2021 and again around this time last year in 2023. Following that physical, Dr. Kevin O'Connor wrote in a summary that the president was healthy, vigorous and fit to successfully execute the duties of the presidency. But this physical is being conducted at a time when the president's age, his physical fitness and his mental fitness have been in the spotlight in the 2024 campaign. His Republican opponents have tried to argue that the president's age should be something voters should consider heading into the 2024 election. And polling has shown that there is some concern about the president's ability to serve a second term. A recent Quinnipiac poll found that only a third of registered voters believe that President Biden had the physical and the mental stamina to endure a second term. So, many will be watching this physical quite closely. Of course, we all often hear from the president pushback on these concerns about his age, saying that with age comes experience. Sometimes, he tries to make light of the fact that he is 81 years old, the oldest president to serve. He would be 86 at the end of a second term. But there will be many people watching this physical, the results of it very closely to see what else they can glean about the president's physical health at this time.",

The medical reason to do it would be if Dr. O'Connor thought that there had been a substantive change in the president's either memory or his cognitive capacity. And that's really the standard reason to do a test. And that's why we would do this during an office visit, if there was either a concern from the patient or a concern from the physician. The other reason to do a test like the MoCA, or Montreal Cognitive Assessment, test that President Trump apparently has had twice, would be a political reason. And whereas there may not be a truly medically based reason to test the president, in this environment, there could conceivably be a political reason. I'm not sure, by itself, that's a reason to actually do the exam, but that question remains out there in the public's mind.",

Other news that's happening right now, a pivotal moment up on Capitol Hill, as Hunter Biden faces off with Republicans behind closed doors. They're questioning the president's son as part of their impeachment inquiry into his father after months and months of tense negotiations and some key concessions. Let's go to CNN's chief legal affairs correspondent, Paula Reid. She's up on Capitol Hill for us. Paula, so what's the latest? What are you hearing?",

      "sentences": "Well, Wolf, Hunter has been in the room for a little over an hour now.And he did not answer questions as he headed into this closed-door deposition. But we do have a copy of the opening statement that he was going to give to lawmakers to lay out what he hopes to achieve today. He said in part: \"I am here today to provide the committees with the one uncontestable fact that should end the false premise of this inquiry. I did not involve my father in my business, not while I was a practicing lawyer, not in my investments or transactions, domestic or international, not even as a board member and not as an artist. Never.\" He goes on to say: \"For more than a year, your committees have hunted me in your partisan political pursuit of my dad. You have trafficked in innuendo, distortion and sensationalism, all the while ignoring the clear and convincing evidence staring you in the face. You do not have evidence to support the baseless and MAGA-motivated conspiracies about my father, because there isn't any.\" Now, we know that Hunter, along with his lawyers, Abbe Lowell and Kevin Morris, they have taken a much more aggressive approach to Republicans, to his detractors. So I think some of that is going to come through today. But this is make-or-break for GOP lawmakers, who so far have not provided clear evidence to support the allegation that President Biden benefited from his son's foreign business dealings. And, of course, he's only appearing for this closed-door deposition after a few concessions from Republicans, including that this will not be videotaped, and the transcript will be released promptly. Those are things we haven't necessarily seen for other witnesses in this investigation. But, Wolf, let's just -- let's just give you a sense of just how much interest there is in today's deposition. They had to move to a larger room. And we expect a record number of members to participate. But more members means more questions, which means it could be a pretty late night up here on Capitol Hill.",

But, beyond that, there's not much that they can -- Congress can really do with this testimony. Clearly, as we have been talking about, they're intending to use this for an impeachment push of his father, President Biden. That doesn't look like it's going anywhere either. And so, at the end of the day, there isn't a lot of sort of legal use of the testimony. Now, Congress, despite being a legal body, it's also a political one. And, certainly, when they release this transcript, no video, they can use that to make political hay out of it. But no one's going to jail.

We're going to continue moving forward with our impeachment inquiry to see if we can still find some sort of evidence. They haven't. But, Wolf, I know you know one of the most riveting things about Washington is that nothing happens in a vacuum. So Congress may be continuing to search for evidence, but there is evidence, and the Justice Department has it, and they are going to be putting it before the court, turning it over to the defense of Alexander Smirnov, this FBI informant who's now charged with lying. Hunter Biden's team, they want access to that evidence as well. We will see if that happens. Smirnov, I should note, is going to trial in April. That's before Hunter Biden is set to go to trial on tax charges in the very same court in federal court out of California. So we're going to watch that court very closely to see what happens in all of that and how it plays into the Republicans' impeachment proceedings.",

And it is based on nothing. And we will see the evidence. But, up until now, Hunter Biden's deposition and everything based on Hunter Biden and the people that they have had up there in all of these hearings were supposed to be the pinnacle of Comer's focus on why they're impeaching President Biden. And, instead, it's become a whimper. It's been embarrassing for this Congress.

We, our team and I, actually managed to make our way to Fritch, Texas.We left Amarillo. We are here. This is as far as we could get. Now, this is an area population roughly 2,000 people. It is in Hutchinson County, which has been very devastated by that large Smokehouse Creek wildfire. This entire area has been evacuated, and there are still homes on fire as we speak, Wolf. We are not actually able to access that area. You can see the roadblock behind me. Police have been turning cars around. To my right is a church that was used as a shelter for most of yesterday for families to have to flee the flames to seek refuge, to find safety. They have been evacuated from here to a different area where it is a bit safer, where there are more services available to them. And I have to say, on our way here, driving from Amarillo, we saw miles and miles of scorched earth. There were still little fires along the sides of the road, a lot of smoke. The visibility was incredibly low. We also encountered crews dropping power lines to try to keep things safer, to try to stop more fires from being sparked by falling power lines, nearby areas also devastated. The town of Canadian had been evacuated. CNN spoke to a local motel owner there who described the scene as Armageddon. There was white ash everywhere, flames everywhere. The nursing homes there, the hospital there had to get evacuated as well. You mentioned that this is now the second largest wildfire in Texas history, and crews are really battling the elements here. This isn't California. They don't have a lot of those planes that could drop fire retardant and water. And so a lot of the firefighting here has to happen on the ground. And this is a time of drought. There's not a lot of water access. And so it's a really, really challenging condition for fire services.",

So it came out of the north, and so it had a 45-plus-or-minus-mile-long fire head that shifted and began burning south. For the past two days, the winds have just not stopped. So there hasn't been a place for firefighters to really effectively get in and begin suppression. Today, we have lower wind conditions.

Appreciate it very, very much.We will stay on top of this story. Meanwhile, there's more breaking news we're following. The Hunter Biden deposition, which we have reported on extensively, it's now on a break, and lawmakers are beginning to speak out. Let's listen to Jamie Raskin, the Democratic congressman from Maryland. Listen to this. REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD):  All right, good morning, everyone. When we went into today's transcribed interview with Hunter Biden, we have had a dozen witnesses who had told us that Joe Biden was not involved in any way in Hunter's business, that he did not profit from Hunter's business, and that he rendered no official favors or benefits to Hunter's business. And nothing that we have heard from Hunter Biden has changed that in any way. In fact, he has emphatically and repeatedly underscored to the Republicans that his father was not involved in any way in his businesses, did not profit from his businesses, and Hunter neither asked him for any official favors, nor received any official favors from Joe Biden. So what we saw, I think, was a rather embarrassing spectacle, where the Republicans continued to belabor completely trivial points. They seemed to be obsessively focused on speakerphones and use of speakerphone. I did not know that was the devil's technology, but, apparently, it is. And I believe, based on this first hour, that this whole thing really has been a tremendous waste of our legislative time and the people's resources. But I would love to have each of my colleagues come up and share their sense of what we just witnessed. And we will start with the vice ranking member of the Oversight Committee. Then we will go to... (CROSSTALK) REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY):  Sure. Thank you. Thank you so much, Ranking Member Raskin. I think the ranking member stated it completely. What we just witnessed over the last hour was, I think, a deep sea fishing expedition, because the Republican case has completely fallen apart over the last several weeks, after it's been exposed that the critical -- one of the -- their most key pieces of information was based on a source that was in communication with Russian intelligence. They are now trying to scramble to find anything to substantiate their fairy tale, is what we should call this. But I think, more disturbingly, what we are seeing is just a complete and inappropriate expedition into the president's son, and for matters and subjects that are completely unrelated to an impeachment investigation. And I think it is extremely disturbing to see the lack of professionalism, the lack of grounding and the abuse of public resources and abuse of public power in order to pursue something that truly whose point at this juncture is very unclear. And with that, I hand it back.",
