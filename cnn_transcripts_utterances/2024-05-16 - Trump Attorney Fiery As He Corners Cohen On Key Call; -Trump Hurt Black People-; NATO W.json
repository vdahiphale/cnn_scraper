      "sentences": "OUTFRONT nextFireworks. The Trump legal team tries to tear Michael Cohen story apart, casting serious out on several fronts. Did it move the jury? Plus, Trump hurt Black people. That is the message Biden is putting out there tonight. Is it resonating? Two radio hosts who spoke to the president about this subject are OUTFRONT. Plus, breaking news this hour, NATO now closer to sending troops to train in Ukraine, as Putin makes gains towards one of the biggest cities in Ukraine. CNN is on the ground, on the front lines. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight: Trump taking aim at Cohen. It was an explosive day in court and Trump was all in. He knew today could decide the case, as Trump's team turned up the heat on Michael Cohen. Trump was present like he hasn't been yet for this trial the whole day, staring down the man who once said he'd take a bullet for Trump. Trump's eyes were opened. He was leaning in, he was fully engaged. Trump insiders are telling me earlier today that Trump most likely knew what attacks were coming from his lawyer and was eagerly awaiting Cohen's reaction, and there was one big moment today. Trump's lawyers bringing up a crucial call that Cohen made just weeks before the election, a crucial one minute 36-second call that Cohen says, was when Trump had personally okayed the hush money payment to Stormy Daniels. Now, Cohen has acknowledged that this call was actually made to Keith Schiller's phone, who was, of course, Trump's bodyguard. Cohen says, well, Schiller is always with Trump and I called him and he handed the phone to Trump. But Trump's lawyer, Todd Blanche, brought this call up with a surprising twist, casting doubt on whether Cohen actually did speak to Trump and casting doubt on the entire content of the phone conversation itself. Blanche producing texts that showed Cohen was texting Schiller about an unrelated matter, a 14 year-old who Cohen had been harassing him just before the phone call, no texts about Stormy Daniels. So, the timeline Blanche laid out, show the text was sent, the call was happened after Cohen even followed up about that 14-year-old, Blanche was trying to show that the call was actually about the kid. And Cohen has said under oath, under direct examination that the purpose of the call was, quote, to discuss the Stormy Daniels matter and the resolution of it. He mentioned nothing about any other topic but after Blanche laid out the text messages about this 14 year-old, Cohen today acknowledged for the first time that the call wasn't only about Stormy Daniels, and that he did speak to Keith Schiller in addition to Donald Trump in a phone conversation. He acknowledged that to Todd Blanche today, saying part of it was the 14 year-old, but I know Keith was with Mr. Trump at the time. And there was more potentially than this. Blanche responded that was a lie. You did not talk to President Trump. You talked to Keith Schiller. You can admit it. Cohen responded, no, sir. I don't know that it's accurate. Blanche was pacing back and forth. His arms were flailing, saying a one-minute and 36 second phone call and you had enough time to update Schiller about all the problems you were having and also update President Trump about the status of the Stormy Daniels situation? Well, this is, a crucial day and back to the timing of a minute and 36 seconds. It really does depend how the jury sees it. It's either not enough time to talk about two topics, any way, shape, or form, or it is. I mean, in television, a minute, 36 seconds is a hell of a lot of time. It's an entire reporter story. If a topic has already had a lot of back-and-forth, a minute, 36 seconds is a lot of time to resolve a payment and talk about an unrelated issue. It depends how the jury sees it. And Blanche today told the jury that the only way to see it is that Cohen is a liar and his version of the call was a lie. In fact, Blanche repeatedly called Cohen a liar to his face, just as Trump publicly did when the trial began in violation of his gag order. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT &amp; 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Whether they're going to look at all the lies that Cohen did in the last trial. He got caught lying in the last trial. So, he got caught lying, pure lying. Michael Cohen is a convicted liar and he's got no credibility whatsoever. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But he didn't say that. He hesitated. The other issue is it made it seem like the prosecution set this up. So the only reason that Cohen knew about this was because the prosecution told you the date, what Cohen should have done is said, well, yes, when they prepped me, they told me the dates.

He knew what he was doing. You know, what did you make of his performance today? ARLO DEVLIN-BROWN, WORKED WITH TRUMP ATTY. BLANCHE: Well, I think what he did today was very significant because earlier today and Tuesday, a lot of what he did was show that Cohen had lied in the past and jurors don't really care about that. I know that seems startling, right? Because it does go to whether you should believe the person. But jurors, just like regular people, like the idea that they can size up, if someone's looking at them in the eye, like Michael Cohen was, they can size them up.

That -- that's not good. But this weekend, in three days, and Blanche is going to come back and continue. Who does that benefit? Who does all this, these breaks benefit the most? DEVLIN-BROWN: I think this one benefits Blanche because this is what the jury ends with and the prosecution does have redirect, but they've got a couple of problems. One is they can't talk Michael Cohen while he's on cross. So they can't sit there and try to figure out. Oh, could it have been this call? Did we get this wrong? So they're going to go in there blind when they do redirect on this question on next week. And I think that's going to be very hard, more time I think it might be good to keep it short because sometimes the more time you take, the more you maybe telegraphing to the jury that you were really hurt.

Why do you think Trump is resonating more with younger Black voters as we see those polls? DARIAN \"BIG TIGGER\" MORGAN, RADIO HOST: When you look no further than social media for the misinformation and disinformation as being put out there, lots of people in our community have this illusion that Trump gave the hood money, they believe that Trump, because he put his name when he six was the reason that money came to them and that while we were up, so to speak during that time period and, you know, like the older demographic, they don't have any problem fact checking, and they'll hear something, they'll go back though research to see if its true. Do a little research behind it. Younger people, if it's on a gram, its probably true. It's kind of the thought process and it's rather unfortunate. You couple that with the apathy about voting in general and in our community and it could be problematic.",
