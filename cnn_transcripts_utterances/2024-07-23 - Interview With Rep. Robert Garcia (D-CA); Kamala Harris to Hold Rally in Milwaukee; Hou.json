And, this hour, President Biden is on his way back from isolating with COVID and Delaware to the White House, where, tomorrow, he will deliver a speech to the nation about his decision to end his reelection bid. Any moment now, we expect to see the president for the first time since he announced that he was dropping out of the race and endorsing Vice President Harris as the nominee. We do begin our coverage with Manu Raju, who is at this press conference by top Democratic leaders. A big announcement coming, Manu.",

      "sentences": "Yes, we do expect that to both Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic leaders, to announce their endorsement of Kamala Harris here in a matter of moments.They have not done so yet. Initially, they decided not to do that because they didn't want to look like they were trying to essentially anoint the next Democratic nominee, allow the process to play out. But now with Harris having secured enough delegates to essentially be the presumptive nominee, essentially, they're going to make it clear where they stand, which is to support Kamala Harris. Now, of course, Schumer and Jeffries have been part of this effort, raising concerns if Joe Biden were to stay in a race behind the scenes. They met privately with President Biden over the last couple of weeks, Schumer making a trek up to Delaware to talk to him, relay the concerns he was hearing from Democratic senators, Jeffries also separately heading a meeting with the president at the White House, conveying concerns he was hearing from the Democratic Caucus. There were real fears if Jeffries -- if Biden were to stay at the top of the ticket, the impact that would have downticket. That was one of the concerns they were laying to the president. Now that Biden has stepped aside and Harris is on the top of the ticket, a much different view among Democrats, who believe their chances at potentially taking back the House, maybe keeping the Senate, although the Senate is much more difficult, perhaps those chances improve. And, right here, we're at Democratic Senate Campaign Committee headquarters, where they plan to announce their endorsement, hoping that perhaps that Harris could change the dynamics of a race that had been going up until this point Donald Trump's way. So we will expect that endorsement here in a matter of moments here, Brianna.",

In the meantime, joining us right now, Democratic Congressman Robert Garcia of California. He's a member of the Harris Campaign National Advisory Board. Congressman, thanks so much for being here with us this afternoon. I know that the vice president and you have been close for a long time. Hold on. We're going to go in and listen to Schumer. We will get back to you in a moment. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY):  Great, great day for the Democratic Party and the country. Vice President Harris will soon be our nominee and will be elected president in November. We are brimming with excitement, enthusiasm, unity. On Sunday, President Biden showed the world what a great man he is. His true patriotism, his profound sense of decency came shining through. We all know it was not an easy decision for him. But just as he has done his entire life, President Biden's selfless decision not to seek the nomination put our country, our party and our future first. At his core, he's just an honorable man, a family man, a man of deep faith. We love him. We truly do. I will have more to say on President Biden later this afternoon in my floor speech. But President Biden's selfless decision has given the Democratic Party the opportunity to unite behind a new nominee. And, boy, oh, boy, are we enthusiastic. Since President Biden's announcement, we have seen the Democratic Party swiftly coalesce behind Vice President Kamala Harris. When I spoke with her Sunday, she said she wanted the opportunity to win the nomination her own and to do so from the grassroots up, not top down. We deeply respected that, Hakeem and I did. She said she would work to earn the support of our party. And, boy, has she done so in quick order. [13:10:06] Vice President Harris has done a truly impressive job securing the majority of delegates needed to win the Democratic Party's nomination to be our next president to the United States. The vast majority of my senators quickly and enthusiastically endorsed her. So, now that the process has played out, from the grassroots, bottom up, we are here today to throw our support behind Vice President Kamala Harris. (APPLAUSE)",

In just the last 36 hours, I have seen a surge of enthusiasm from every corner of our party uniting behind Vice President Harris, an enthusiasm felt in every corner of the country, and it's contagious among Democrats. The volunteers, the small contributions, they're just pouring in, in ways even beyond our expectations. Now, we all know that Vice President Harris has a tremendous record to run on, and now begins the next chapter in our quest to make sure Donald Trump does not become president. Today, with one voice, we speak about the dangers he presents to working families, to our country, and to our democracy. We will -- we see very clearly how nervous the Republicans are about our new nominee. Well, they ain't seen nothing yet. Last night, Vice President Harris secured a majority of delegates. Today, in Wisconsin and across America, we begin our next chapter, and it will be our best yet. Vice President Harris will beat Donald Trump and become the next president of the United States of America. Applause? (LAUGHTER)",

We really do appreciate you sticking with us. Congressman Garcia, we hear those endorsements now. It seems like the circle has been complete. We're going to see Vice President Harris become the nominee. I know you all have a long relationship. Have you spoken with her in the last 48 hours, since all of this has happened? And what can you tell us, if you have? REP. ROBERT GARCIA (D-CA):  I have. And, of course, it's great to see, of course, both our leaders in our party make the official endorsement. We knew it was on its way. But, yes, I spoke to the vice president actually on Sunday, so the day that actually the announcement happened. And what she said is that she, of course, is excited. She's all about unifying the party. And exactly what the leader said is correct. It was really important for her for this to be a grassroots effort, for our process, which is delegate-driven, to unify and rally around the vice president. But, wow, we had no idea that it would happen so swiftly and so fast. And what you're seeing right now is a party that's being energized by the grassroots around Kamala Harris, the fund-raising, which has broken records, the tens of thousands of volunteers that are signing up at offices across the country, and the entire party rallying around our vice president. So, as someone that's known her for a long time as both a friend and a political ally and supporter, it's a proud moment for this Californian, for our state. We are going to do everything we can to work every day, and we're going to defeat Donald Trump in November.",

She's served as vice president. She has been the governing partner to Joe Biden, probably the most consequential president of the modern era. And so she is a person that has so much more experience today than she did when she first ran. But I think that same person is still there. And one of the things that I have been telling folks is, I cannot wait for the country to get to know that Kamala Harris that we have known for such a long time, that prosecutor, the person that took on all the bad guys, that took on the sexual predators, that took on the huge, large corporate banks that were foreclosing and taking homes away from so many working-class families. She took on the private colleges and universities that were scamming students. That's who Kamala Harris is. And so this contrast between her and Donald Trump, who is literally a criminal and a felon and a con man, she knows folks like Donald Trump. She's prosecuted them her whole life.

But we know that the Secret Service director yesterday just performed terribly, I mean, no doubt it, because you have bipartisan calls for her to leave. And very few things unify these two parties right now in Washington, but it was clear both sides viewed what she did yesterday. And so, as a result, she said in her letter to the staff today, to the men and women of the Secret Service, she said: \"The Secret Service will move forward with our investigatory and protective mission in a steadfast manner. We do not retreat from challenge. However, I do not want my calls for resignation to be a distraction from the great work each and every one of you does towards this mission.\" She also said: \"It's with a heavy heart I have made the difficult decision to step down as your director.\" It was obvious, obviously, after yesterday, where she declined to answer so many questions.

And we have seen that video. We have seen where people are trying to get the attention of police that he is on this roof. What the -- this official now from the Pennsylvania State Police is saying is that they had a couple of minutes, perhaps as many as three minutes, where they knew he was on the roof, they saw he had a gun, and the time that the fire -- the first shots ring out. So it does raise the question, again, of why the former president was on stage at a time when they were looking for someone. Yesterday, we heard from the director that she believed it was only seconds before they realized he was not just suspicious, but actually a threat. It appears, from the local police, the State Police there, that that is not true, that it is much longer. And it does raise additional new questions, including the fact that a couple of local official -- police who were supposed to be watching that roof and that -- in a position to take shots at that roof, they left that post to go look for him.
