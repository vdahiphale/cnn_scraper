It's more coordinated, it's more planned out, it's much more well-funded and sophisticated than it was in 2020. So essentially, they've had four years to look at what worked and didn't work last time around. And a lot of the things that are happening now are things that we saw happen around 2020. We saw these false claims that there are non-citizens voting en masse that is happening again from Republicans. We are now seeing just an avalanche of legal challenges ahead of the election. We saw a lot of this afterwards, but the challenges really take aim at voter rolls, the notion that states aren't cleaning their voter rolls, that there are dead people, that there are people who have moved. We saw this a lot in post-election challenges in 2020. Election boards that are delaying or disrupting certification, that is the kind of thing that happened in one place around 2020 and drew a ton of headlines. And since 2020, it's happening in counties and battleground states all over the country.",

They also, to a far greater extent than Republicans in the Senate or in governorship, mimicked, amplified, and tried to validate his paranoid claims about a deep state conspiracy within the federal government, his ludicrous claims that the election had been stolen, his rewriting of January 6th, and his claim that the government had been weaponized against him and his supporters by Democrats.\"",

And you look at Mike Johnson, the Speaker of the House, he is out there saying, will you accept the election results? You know, correct answer? Yes, I'll accept the election results. He's saying, if they're fair, which presumably means if Trump wins. Now, he owes his job to Donald Trump. He's out one mean tweet. He's out of a job. If they win the House, he'll be up -- they'll have to decide on January 3rd. So what does he do when Trump says, you know, I need you to overthrow the election, I need you to use the 12th Amendment, bring it into the House. Well, it probably won't work, but he certainly built the predicate for that to happen. So that's the -- I think that's the major change, the infrastructure that's there now.",

And so it's not just the infrastructure of election deniers that has grown and popped up, but it's also the infrastructure of these folks who are seeking to counter these efforts to counter these narratives.
