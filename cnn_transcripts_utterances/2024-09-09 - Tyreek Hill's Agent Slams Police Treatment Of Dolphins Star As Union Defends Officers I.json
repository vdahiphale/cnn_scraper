If Tyreek wasn't a world class athlete in an incredible shape, who knows how this could have impacted him. He was sore, he was hurting, he was physically and mentally distraught. This is something where we're seeking answers and we will pursue this to the fullest extent of the law. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The latest information we have is a statement from the local police union, which has come out within the last hour or so.They are saying that at no time was Tyreek Hill ever placed under arrest. They said that he was not immediately cooperative. He was put into handcuffs according to policy and for the safety of the officers present. They then said that he remained uncooperative, at which point he was, quote, \"redirected to the ground.\" The local police union say they are standing by their officers based on the information they have about the way this all played out. As I mentioned, Tyreek Hill did speak with the media afterwards. He was very measured in his comments and this is what he had to say. He said he's still not quite sure why it played out the way it did. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Bomani, thanks so much for sharing part of your afternoon with us. I want to get your reaction to the statement from the South Florida police union saying that Hill was uncooperative and that he was never arrested. They claimed that he was driving in a manner in which he was putting himself and others in great risk of danger. Despite the statement, Miami-Dade police not yet putting out the body camera footage.

I wouldn't be surprised if they already had that thing on the hard drive and just like, give me the number five, right?Like, no matter what happens in a circumstance like this, the police union is not going to give an inch. The question that I would ask when they say that Tyreek Hill wasn't cooperative, but it's entirely possible. The question is, what were you asking him to cooperate with? Like that's a broad term. Just the idea that you're going along with whatever it was asking, hey, what's going on here? I could make an argument that's uncooperative if I wanted to. That doesn't necessarily mean it's supposed to leave. You put me down face first on the concrete with my hands behind my back. SANCHEZ: And what did you think of Tyreek's reaction to all of this and also the leagues, because as you all know, Bomani, historically, they've lagged or been silent on issues of police brutality.",

Like one big difference that happened here was that Tyreek Hill actually got up and got to go to work where Scheffler had to actually go in and they put them through the whole process and everything else.I don't know which is better or worse. I don't really, like, my head doesn't go there where my head goes to on this one is 10 years ago. We'd have been ready to burn something down metaphorically speaking, of course, about something like this. Our ability to sustain outrage at these sort of things is kind of God. I think there's a lot of reasons that that may be the case, but we are 10 years and one month removed from Mike Brown being killed in Ferguson. We are four years of change removed from what happened with George Floyd. The police still engage with people generally and black people specifically in the same ways that they have throughout this course of time. Nobody can get in front of you and put some numbers that show some great improvement in terms of their ability to treat people with a measure of dignity under these circumstances. The problem that was there before is still the problem now. I think there's a question that we got to ask ourselves, which is, why we don't seem to care so much about the fact that nothing happened with the problem, right? Like, there's a level of exhaustion, I suppose, that gets there. But I think the lesson that we need to learn about this is that if you ever needed to be diligent about an issue, chances are you always need to be diligent about an issue. And this issue that was an issue with Trayvon Martin, although that wasn't the police, but all the way down in the ways that those movements went, that issue still remains. And this is just another example of that issue. We just don't have the capacity to dial it up for those sorts of things like we used to.",

That to me is ideally what you would want to have in that circumstance.Of course, a lot of the people at high levels of the league ownership in particular are a bit politically compromised. Great example, Stephen Ross, the owner of the Miami Dolphins, who is a big Trump supporter. Also, the man behind rise, an organization that works toward the eradication of racism in sports. If I'm not mistaken, Trump has said in the course of this election cycle, he wants police to get immunity for just about everything that they could possibly do. So who's side is Stephen Ross going to stand on under these circumstances? The guy that's on his team or the guy whose team he's on? Chances are he's going to go with the guy whose team he's on. So, yes, ideally, the league will stand up and say, Tyreek is our guy and we stand behind him and we believe that he has been treated unfairly. But I don't think there'll ever be a circumstance where those people at those levels of power will ever stand on the side of their players opposite the police.",

He gets the electoral authority, which he controls, to declare him the winner. But nobody believes him because the vote was 2 to 1. So he goes to the Supreme Court, which he controls, and the Supreme Court says that he won. But nobody believes the Supreme Court. So what do they do? They tell Gonzalez that he has to show up. He doesn't go because he doesn't trust the system. They get the Attorney General, who is also controlled by Maduro, to indict him for publishing the list, about 80 percent of those votes. They had the paper trail, publishing it and showing that Maduro lost 2 to 1. So, it was a matter of time. He was in hiding. He expected to be arrested.
