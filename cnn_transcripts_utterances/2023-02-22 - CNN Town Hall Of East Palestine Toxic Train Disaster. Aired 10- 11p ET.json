In just minutes right here on CNN the CEO of Norfolk Southern will face questions live from East Palestine residence. The people in the Ohio town were one of his trains skidded off the tracks to disastrous results.Nearly three weeks after this train derailed. Anger is running high. So is fear. Many of the 4700 people who live in this town worried that they're sick because of the crash. And they're worried about the company's failure to contain its toxic fallout. But before we go to the CEO of Norfolk Southern, let's bring in the Mayor of East Palestine, Trent Conaway, who joins me now. Mr. Mayor, thank you so much for joining me, really appreciate it. We've heard from the state government, we've heard from the federal government, we're going to hear from Norfolk Southern this evening. What more do you need from all three of them that you're not currently getting?",

We've told our air is safe. You know, I think it's safe. My family's here, they've been here the whole time. But there's definitely concern for residents.

And maybe I think we need to look at some safety regulations. And, you know, see if there's anything that we can change, maybe slowed down a little bit. We did get some good word that there are going to dig up all the dirt under the tracks. That was a big concern. We heard today that, you know, they are going to start that process very soon.

And then we were evacuated. And before we were told we could come back to our house trains were running again. And at least the perception is that we were told come back because they wander on the trains not because we were safe, it's amazing that the trains could start up within minutes after the evacuation was lifted.

And I hear a lot about money coming in money coming in and what we can do financially, but there's a perception that we've got to change. We've got customers might come into our places. Now we've got school teams not coming into our school. And I don't know how we address that long-term to change the perception of what's going on here. The stigma of what is now in East Palestine.

But as I talk to the community here, and individual meetings, you guys made it really clear that you didn't feel comfortable with that plan. And I listened. And I'm hearing your concerns.

At the same time, we should note, Norfolk Southern plans to spend $7.5 billion in stock buybacks to benefit your shareholders.

I'm Alisyn Camerota and this is \"CNN Tonight.\"We're going to continue the conversation from CNN's Town Hall on the toxic train disaster in East Palestine, Ohio.  We just heard from key players trying to deal with the aftermath of this dangerous spill, including Ohio Governor Mike DeWine, and Michael Regan, the head of the federal EPA. We also heard from residents of East Palestine who are still experiencing vomiting, bloody noses and other health issues. Many are still afraid to go back to their homes. The NTSB will release its preliminary report on the derailment tomorrow. And the EPA chief is turning up the pressure on Norfolk Southern, telling the railroad, that it will be fully responsible for cleaning up the toxic mess and footing the bill for the disaster. Norfolk Southern's chief executive was confronted by an angry resident. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) J. STEWART:  I'm angry. I'm angry about this. I lived in East Palestine for 65 years now. That's my home. My grandmother came from Germany. She lived in Palestine. My dad grew up there. My family has grown up there now. And it is disgusting that were just lost it. I live in a house, it's probably closest of any of these, and it's a shame. This is probably the next closest one. And our houses, you know, it's been inspected, it's been this, it's been that. I'm afraid to put my dog out just to pee. I mean, he's only this tall. So, you know, I don't feel safe in this town no. You took it away for me. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
