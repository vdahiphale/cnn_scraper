Rick Scott of Florida, who has been a member of the Republican Senate leadership introduced a former plan for \"all federal laws, no exemptions, to be sunset every five years and if Congress wants, reapproved every five years.\"I took this quote straight from the plans official website today. He says all federal legislation sunsets in five years, if a law is worth keeping Congress can pass it again. Now, the Scott plan was swiftly rejected by Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell dooming it for now. But in rejecting it, McConnell use basically the same language as Biden did last night. McConnell said, we will not have, as part of our agenda, a bill that sunsets Social Security and Medicare within five years. In addition, guys, Scott is not alone. Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin has suggested that entitlement programs, Social Security, Medicare included should be made discretionary spending that Congress has to approve annually, so that's an even faster sunset. Now, in fairness, Scott and Johnson have repeatedly said they do not want to cut Social Security and Medicare benefits and other Republicans again quickly distanced themselves from all this sunset stuff. It's not a majority position of the party right now, but the idea that Biden is just making it up as Congresswoman Greene and others claimed, he's absolutely not.",

But experts have consistently told CNN, me and others that Biden is taking way too much credit for this decline. It was not because of his administration, in large part. In reality, that decline overwhelmingly occurred simply because temporary pandemic spending from 2020 expired as scheduled not because of Biden's own actions.In addition, experts say that Biden's laws and executive orders have on the whole significantly increased deficits. Dan White, a Senior Director of Economic Research at Moody's Analytics, one of Biden's favorite Wall Street firms says this, he says, \"On net, the policies of the administration have increased the deficit, not reduced it.\" And increase it by a lot. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget advocacy group estimates that Biden's actions will add more than $4.8 trillion to deficits over a decade. The group's president, Maya MacGuineas, told me on Tuesday before the speech, \"The White House deserves credit for the $250 billion of deficit reduction they enacted through the Inflation Reduction Act, but should also take responsibility for the '$5 trillion' of deficit-increasing policies they signed into law or executive order.\" Now, Biden can take some credit for the economic recovery that has boosted tax revenues, that has helped keep the deficit down.

And his book is Joe BidenEvan, let me begin with you. The President walked into the speech last night with at least one poll suggesting that over 60 percent of Americans didn't think he accomplished much of anything in the past two years.

Long before that poll came out, I was talking to senior White House officials over the days before the speech and one of the things that they were making clear was, as they put it, it's time to go from getting things done legislatively to, as they put it, making it real. Meaning, making it tangible.I mean, getting out there on the road and putting shovels in the ground, getting a sense for Americans that all of this drama they've seen in Washington, all of this horse trading and backroom dealing ultimately has led to meaningful changes in their lives when it comes to creating jobs or creating opportunity where it doesn't exist. One of the things you heard last night was this emphasis over and over again on workers, on job creation. And as he put it at one point, people who feel invisible, people who feel left behind. here he is today, he's going out and talking to people about union jobs, as he says, people who don't need a four-year college degree to make a meaningful career.

But as they think about a speech like this, White House is thinking, what is the impacts going to be, how do you break through all of the noise that people have in their lives and make them pay attention.So instead, you hear them talking about these almost kind of kitchen table issues, things like the resort fees on your hotel bill or how much you're getting charged by the airline, couldn't be farther from these kinds of geopolitical issues. I think that surprised some China analysts that the idea that there wouldn't be more mention of it. But I think part of that is because that issue, the issue of the United States and its relationship with China, is right now at a very fragile moment and it's one that is being kind of labored behind the scenes quite delicately. Obviously, Tony Blinken was supposed to go last weekend. That idea was scratched because of the balloon over the United States and the decision to shoot it down.

If last night had not gone well and we've been talking about that all day today, if the President had not looked like he was tuned up and ready to do it, if he had botched those moments of getting pushed back from his Republicans, that would have had a significant cloud over what may in fact be his announcement for reelection pretty soon.Instead, he came out of there doing no harm to himself. And arguably, I think as Bakari said, kind of fortified the case among Democrats that he's the person who is in the prime position right now.
