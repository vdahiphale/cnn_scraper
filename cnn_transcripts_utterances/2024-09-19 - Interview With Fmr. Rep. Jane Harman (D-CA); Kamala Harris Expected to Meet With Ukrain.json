Oprah Winfrey will share the stage with Harris tonight for a virtual reality -- rally, I should say, in the critical battleground state, the event co- hosted by an organization called Win With Black Women.Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump will give a speech this evening here in Washington on fighting antisemitism in the United States. Both candidates are on the campaign trail as a new poll out just this morning shows they are locked in a dead heat nationally with 47 percent each. Let's bring in our panel, CNN senior political commentator Ana Navarro, CNN political commentator and former nations director of Vice President Kamala Harris Jamal Simmons, and CNN political commentator and Republican strategist Shermichael Singleton. I run out of breath just going through all those amazing titles. So thanks to all of you for being here. But Ana wins because she's here in the studio with me, so I will start with you first. How big is this Oprah event for Kamala Harris tonight?",

All data suggests that he still has a slight lead on it, although Vice President Harris is performing a whole lot better than President Biden. Voters appear to be giving her a bit of a pass on the issue, for whatever that reason may be. And so, in knowing that and looking at the data that this is such a very tight and close race, the former president is going to need to win over some of those persuadable voters, a very small percent of them that remain in this contest. And I'm not necessarily convinced that the rhetoric or the language or the critique overall is enough to move them. The critique, I get, because voters are saying that they're concerned. But then I think the next question to the critique or the follow-up to the critique should be, what are the possible solutions? And I think that's what some of the voters are looking for.",

And I have got to think that it's going to backfire on them, because, look, so far, there's been something -- upwards of 30 bomb threats. And, yes, people say, oh, but they're all hoaxes and they're coming from -- no matter, regardless of whether they're hoaxes, regardless of whether they're coming from, they were not happening before Donald Trump and J.D.
