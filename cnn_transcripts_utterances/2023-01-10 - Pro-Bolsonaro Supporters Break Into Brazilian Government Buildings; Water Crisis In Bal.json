Supporters of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro stormed keybuildings in the country`s capital Sunday breaching security barriers and temporarily occupying the country`s Congress, presidential palace and Supreme Court. Masses of protesters flooded the country`s seat of power, many dressed in the colors of Brazil`s flag yellow and green, fueled by anger and distrust over Bolsonaro`s defeat in a runoff election last October where he lost by less than two percentage points to current President Luiz Inacio Lula Da Silva. Protesters threw objects and scaled the roofs of buildings, while clashing with police who responded with tear gas. At least one protester was seen sitting at the desk of Brazil`s congress president. CNN Brazil reports the floor of the Congress building was flooded after the sprinkler system activated when protesters attempted to set fire to the carpet. By evening, police began dispersing the rioters from buildings and arrested hundreds of people who were detained in buses before being taken to the police station. President Lula Da Silva who was inaugurated just a week ago described the events as barbaric and vowed to punish the people responsible. LUIZ INACIO LULA DA SILVA, BRAZILIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  Those people that we call fascists. We call them everything that`s abominable in politics. They invaded the government headquarters,. and they invaded the Congress like vandals, destroying everything in their path.",

Bolsonaro who is currently in Florida denounced what he called the depredations and invasions of public buildings in a tweet, adding that peaceful and lawful demonstrations are part of democracy. But critics say Bolsonaro may have stirred up the crowds by repeatedly saying without evidence that he questioned the integrity of the country`s electronic voting system.
