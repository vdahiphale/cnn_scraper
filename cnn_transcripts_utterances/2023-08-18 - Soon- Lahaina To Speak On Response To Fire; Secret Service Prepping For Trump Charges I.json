So, we're kind of watching these arms, these outer bands try to feed up past Cabo. And eventually by tomorrow afternoon, likely even into Southern California. And there it is. A tropical storm watch, the first ever for California period. There are hurricane warnings to the South because there will be hurricane conditions there. But here's the deal with this storm. It is going to die rather quickly because it's going to go from 88 Degree water to 68 Degree water. And hurricanes don't like anything really below about 82. So when we get into this colder water, we know the storm is going to die off. It isn't going to be a hurricane. There could be some gusts but it isn't going to be a true hurricane when it gets up toward California. It is going to rapidly de-intensify because there's your water, and there's your water. That -- try to swim in the Pacific Ocean off California without a wetsuit or go surfing, it's not very fun. It's very, very cold. But we do have the real threat of how much rainfall could come down.

And this is as jail officials, the Secret Service, the city of Atlanta try to get on the same page essentially about how a Trump surrender is going to look at this Fulton County Jail. Obviously, if you're the Secret Service, you don't want to be ushering the former president in there for the first time without having gotten the lay of the land, understanding where he's going to be going through as far as the different rooms of the jail where, you know, he may be interacting with other people. And also how to keep him separate from the general jail population, which of course we expect to happen. So, this is the guide that we would expect. We would expect the Secret Service is not going to want to show up there blind with the former president of the United States. [14:10:03] SANCHEZ: Yes, absolutely. Jennifer, to you.

But a couple of these trials are likely to happen after the election next year and into 2025 because there's just too much to do. It's not as bad as they're making it out to be with the discovery. But for trials, is a lot to prepare for, especially for someone as busy as with a campaign schedule. So, they just need to get it going.

To get to your direct question.

And so, I left thinking we needed to pay more attention to the blockade scenario, the economic coercion scenario.In fact, you can make a case that that sort of economic and cyber invasion of Taiwan has already begun. When the select committee on China that I chaired did a war game, in fact, one of the key findings we came away with was that while we have sort of the theory of the case when it comes to conventional and strategic deterrence i.e. military deterrence, we don't incorporate the economic and financial analysis. We don't incorporate what are the economic and financial weapons we are willing to use in order to prevent the invasion.

I think that could actually make him more aggressive in the near term.He himself is 69 or 70 years old. So, if you believe as I do, that he's serious about achieving that lifelong ambition of taking Taiwan, I think the next five years are the most dangerous. It's what I've called the window of maximum danger. It's also when we have some major defense issues that we're dealing with, some big bills that are coming due, and our Navy continues to get smaller and smaller, it could potentially bottom out at 279 ships in 2027.

So, I guess all I'm asking for when the debate comes to Wisconsin next week, is that we just see where the candidates stand.
