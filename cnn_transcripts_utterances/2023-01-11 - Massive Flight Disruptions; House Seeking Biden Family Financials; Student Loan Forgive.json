But just a sign of things beginning to get back to normal. We've also heard from United Airlines. This is a hub for United, saying that their customers may continue to see delays because of this ripple effect. You can't have problems with planes taking off for the first few hours of the day and not have a ripple effect. So, some delays and cancellations United is warning its passengers they'll see as they work to restore their schedule. And they said United has also activated a travel waiver for any customers who need to change their plans, including offering refunds. So, they're doing the best they can to try to make sure that this is as painless as possible for the travelers affected. But, bottom line, here at Newark Airport, and nationally, no more ground stop.

It caps payments at 5 percent of the borrower's discretionary income. Right now that's at 10 percent. So that means you've have to pay less every month. And for singer borrowers making less than $30,600 a year, you don't need to make any payments under the proposal. Right now that threshold is at $24,000. And it forgives the remaining balances after ten years of repayment instead of 20 or 25 years. So, essentially, these are ways to tweak the income-based repayment system to get borrowers out from under these big, heavy debt burdens so they can live their life, right?

So, I wonder, where does that go, and does it - I mean all of this is about, what, I suppose, what you can do now, right, versus what you might be able to do in the future. But is this going to affect that, you know, states trying to transition away from gas heating as well?",

You don't really end them.But it's the kind of thing -- I did this story at a place right outside of Denver. They tried to create a net-zero community, no gas. But half of the development got sold to a new developer who insisted on putting it in. So, all zoning really is kind of local. And you've got to think about this. Is the decision you're making on that is a 20 or 30-year decision. A lot of times on a new construction, you put the oven in there, you hope it lasts a generation or so.",
