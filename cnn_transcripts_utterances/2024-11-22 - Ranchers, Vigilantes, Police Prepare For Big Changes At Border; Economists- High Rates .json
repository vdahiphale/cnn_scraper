The big question right now is that a market where housing for so many million prospective buyers, does the Fed need to stimulate into that? I mean, who exactly benefits? If you're a young family that's waiting for cheaper interest rates, is that going to bring home prices down or are home prices going to go up if the Fed brings interest rates and then mortgage rates down?
