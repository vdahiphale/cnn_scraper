You know, there are people who are dealing with their economic -- with their -- with economic conditions, sort of wiped out as a result of the inflation, wiped out by the Biden economy.

But they're very grateful for the outpouring of support that began when our documentary came out and keeps coming in waves as other reports are coming out about them telling more of what they feel is the truth and highlighting the work that they have done at the prison and all of these years. Their life didn't end 35 years ago on that horrible tragic day for their family. They went on to try to get educations in their prisons, start programs, hospice programs, counseling programs for other prisoners, meditation programs, art programs, green space programs. In fact, for the last 20 years, whatever prison Lyle has been in, the other inmates have elected him to be their representative to the administration. And I want to say one last thing that a lot of people are not aware of, that in that filing, there are letters from prison administrators saying who the brothers are now, these are the people who know them the best, and saying that they should be released, that they have been rehabilitated.",
