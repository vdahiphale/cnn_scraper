In line with that President Biden has now elevated these negotiations to three senior staff members, the president's counselor Steve Ricchetti, his director of the Office of Management and Budget Shalanda Young, as well as the Director of Legislative Affairs Louisa Terrell. On the other side for Speaker McCarthy, you have Congressman Garret Graves as well as the speaker's senior staff. But the president nonetheless in an acknowledgement that this deal is going to come down to him and Kevin McCarthy cutting that trip short, going only to Japan, not going forward with those stops to Papua New Guinea and Australia. And that's because he wants to be back for the final negotiations, which are expected to happen next week, if indeed a deal is to be had. At the same time, John, as you just heard from the speaker of the House, he is saying, look, the White House is finally willing to negotiate. They've dropped this pretense that they are not negotiating over the debt, not quite. Here if you talk to folks here at the White House, they still insist they are not negotiating over default. Nonetheless, what's clear is that they are negotiating over the spending agreement with that ticking time bomb of the potential for the fault hanging over them. John?",

He wanted it to just be him and President Biden negotiating because he sees Biden as more flexible than some of these other Democratic leaders.

So, this never has to happen again, until after the next presidential election. Those two things are a win for Joe Biden. Why does he keep opening the door? Is it just because he's gaffe prone and he can't help himself? I don't think so. It's because we have now 30 some years of polling, but at least five or six consistent years of immediate polling that showed that actually Americans don't think that people should have a free ride. But the way you package this and talk about this matters, and that if for better or for worse, it's usually for worse, there are two Americas. McCarthy is messaging to different voters than Joe Biden is. And what President Biden, I think he's trying to make clear is, he is willing to talk about language that suggests that everybody tried to work if they can, but he does not going to leave anyone destitute or uncovered for health care. There is a lot of wordsmithing and rhetoric attached to all of this. But when I heard McConnell and McCarthy say yesterday, nobody wants to default. To me that says, this thing is done. And it's just a matter of every -- I think you'll have a back here in a week, it will be wrong, and it'll be an attack.

One is that this is actually as you noted, sort of relatively modest compared to some of the other measures that are going on in the American South and Midwest. North Carolina has been increasingly looked at as kind of a safe haven for women in the south who need to get to a place where they have abortion access. This really diminishes that at the same time, and you have a situation where now this could fuel democratic enthusiasm or centrist sort of nonpartisan enthusiasm and turnout for lawmakers who are going to vote this way.
