So I was like, \"If I do all this, I'm going to have to cancel everything again, and just be in this cycle of canceling stuff, and no one will hire me again and I am never going to survive.\" And I started my first panic attack at four in the morning that day in New York, and I didn't know what was happening to me. I just knew I was sobbing, crying, and I couldn't breathe and I had to lay down and I was sweating really fast and I thought I was dying. I was like, \"This is it. My body is just giving up.\" And I was like, if I freak out like that again, I'm going to be live on TV freaking out. And I kept my cool, but reading the list, you can -- I can hear I start, I remember losing vision, like I was like, trying not to faint. That's what I remember, I was like \"Just don't pass out on TV right now. Just get through this.\" And I was supposed to jump into an interview right after, but as soon as they said like, \"Okay, we're off the air.\" I sat down and I started crying in front of all of those people, Gayle King, every camera guy, everyone and I lost it. And my team circled around me and looked at me and we're like, \"Okay, we're done.\" And I found out months later that this was anxiety and my chemicals are all messed up. And I was like, \"No, I must have an illness.\" Like I have a fever clearly and I'm sweating. And I would go to the emergency room and be like, \"I must have ate something that's closing my throat, can you just check,\" you know? And the doctor looks so sad coming in trying to explain what a panic attack is to me and I was like, \"That's not it.\" You know, like \"I'm very happy.
