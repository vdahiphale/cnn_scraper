So whether tariffs promising to go after prices at the supermarket or now, President-elect Trump who has promised tariffs and the implications of the tariffs could be exactly what he -- what he went in on the coattails of now. Like, if tariffs became inflationary, if tariffs cost U.S. jobs. If tariffs made goods very expensive for Americans. How would he thread that needle?

Mr. Trump views those alliances as a burden, often declaring he doesn't understand why the United States would defend nations with whom Washington has a trade deficit. He professed  in his first term to reject the concept that Europe was a bulwark against the Soviet Union and, later, Russia, or that Japan was America's aircraft carrier in the Pacific, or that South Korea is key to containing North Korea.\" So what does that mean for the world?",

But even if they did not, having those troops placed around the world is sort of the forward edge of American defense and pretty critical to the way the Pentagon operates around the world. You can't just base everybody in the United States. And he still, after four years as president, views this, as I wrote, as a burden -- something that we're doing as a favor for everyone else. And that's a fundamental difference of view. Now, he was right, as President Obama was right before him, that the allies had to step up and spend more. And, in fact, in Europe now, I would say roughly 20 of the 31 other allies in NATO are now spending somewhere around two percent of their GDP on defense. In my view, that's probably going to have to go to four percent or so if you are going to mount effective defenses against a Russia that is clearly going to be an issue for a long time. I also mention in the piece though that that fundamental change since he left office four years ago is that Russia and China have now come together in this uneasy but worrisome partnership.",

Kamala Harris' senior adviser David Plouffe -- he raised some eyebrows with this post on X praising his campaign staff while writing, \"We dug out of a deep hole but not enough.\" Several Democrats viewing that as an unmistakable swipe at President Biden and launching the blame game into full swing. Some Biden allies are privately upset with Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi for squeezing the president out of the race in both 2016 and then here in 2024, respectively. Many Harris insiders believing that Biden's deep unpopularity and his use of the word \"garbage\" to describe Trump supporters in the runup to the election presented a hill too steep for her to climb. Our next guest recently reporting about Biden's \"garbage\" gaffe that, \"Some of Harris' top aides were blissfully unaware of the mushrooming crisis inside the White House, standing outside the building with limited phone service and no Wi-Fi. When they learned, they were exasperated. Biden wanted to clean it up, and the White House proposed to the campaign a post from Biden on X.

Joe Biden is not going to be able to play that same role. So I think there's a lot of questions of who is going to lead the Democratic Party. But to your point, there is also a lot of blame to go around. A lot of it is focused on Joe Biden and not just his decision not to run or step aside, but his initial decision after the midterms of 2022 to run in the first place. And a lot of the conversation that was around the 2020 election when Biden sort of hinted and suggested he would be a transitional president -- some people even assuming that meant he would only run for one term. He never said that publicly. But I think that decision before the 2022 midterms and after Democratic success, he's under a lot of scrutiny right now.",

Already, Democrats are starting to jockey for that role.I think one of the things that we'll start to see is Democratic governors step up to try to fill that void and that leadership. Democratics -- Democrats have had a lot of success in state capitals around the country and I think they will try to step up to the mantle and say voices outside of Washington need to lead. And I think you can see some of those blue wall governors -- Josh Shapiro, Gretchen Whitmer, Wes Moore in Maryland, Gavin Newsom in California. And obviously, there are senators that ran for president in 2020 we could see try to take up that mantle of leadership. But it's a really open question and we're already seeing those divides play out in the Democratic Party, whether it is some of the liberal -- more liberal lawmakers, Bernie Sanders, with a scathing statement about the party's campaign apparatus and focus on the working class, or is it some of the more moderate members of the Democratic Party that try to usher in the -- usher the party more towards the center. Someone was -- I was talking to someone yesterday and they said one of the things we need to figure out is are we the party of AOC? Are we the party of Joe Manchin? Are we the party of Josh Shapiro, Gavin Newsom? Very different views on the future of the party and I think we're going to see a lot of internal family debate about what that looks like and ultimately, what the voters want to -- want to decide about how who is the right person to lead this party forward.",
