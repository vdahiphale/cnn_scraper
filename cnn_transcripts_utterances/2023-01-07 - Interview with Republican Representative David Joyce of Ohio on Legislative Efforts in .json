But it has to be part of a process with other members.They're working with my group, Republican governors' group, and explaining along the way what was taking taken place. There's nothing in this package that really hurts us because, unfortunately -- and I've seen it since my time here -- too much power has been put in leadership, put in the speaker's job and taken away from the floor, taken away from the committees. And that is what they wanted. And that is what we are getting, it's back to the idea that, if we are going to do things, we are going to have committee chairs and committee people working on these hearings, putting together bills, passing their bills in committee, moving them through the amendment process, the old regular order. As you can appreciate, Dana, and then actually getting the floor, a secondary amendment process, for those not on the committee -- and then vote them up or down. Let all 435 of us vote on whether we think it's a good amendment or a bad amendment. And then we'll have buy-in from both sides. I think that's part of the process. At least, it's necessary to heal the House because (INAUDIBLE) Democrats and Republicans is that (INAUDIBLE) speaker's office and (INAUDIBLE) at the last minute with no ability to look into them or to oversee what has taken place. And so, that has been a problem. And hopefully, this will be part of the cure in our rules package, to fix those problems.",

What I heard the congress man talked about was team, together. He was laughing through it because he knows team and together was not on full display here. But did you happen to hear the narrative coming out of it? It's not a weekend speaker. It is more of decentralized power. That is a different way than thinking about it now. It's not a weekend speaker. It's more about having everyone have agency, the rank and file members, and going back to how it is supposed to function in the right way. What do you make of that argument or that narrative? I don't mean to get pejorative on it. But it is a shift away from the weaker speaker comments we have seen the last four days. Is it about just decentralizing it for the benefit of Congress? TIA MITCHELL, \"THE ATLANTA JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION\":  I think he put a great spin on it. And I think, to Liam's, point, it's a different way of doing things. It's going to be a big experiment. And if you put it in the context of everyone working in good faith, then it sounds right.

We don't govern in an ideal way. And we have not in decades, whether it is on appropriations bills, whether it's just the basic functioning of government. And because of that and because a significant chunk of their conference is not willing to reach out, opposed to reaching outcomes on the very things that keep government open, that raise the debt ceiling, the crisis moments we always find ourselves in, that is why power has just shifted steadily away from members, away from committees, into leadership. Every single time we reach a deadline, you are huddled around the speaker's office, waiting for them to come out and announce the deal. Not the kettle balls (ph) or kind of the old guard. And unless you have members that are able to deliver in a decentralized manner, then it will start to flow back the other way. And I think that is the biggest problem.

But as somebody who was in the Capitol through the 7th to the 10th and on, there was probably a three-day period -- maybe a 2.5 day period -- where every member you spoke to on the Republican side, including those who were pretty dedicated to the former president, were right on the edge. Because they were all there. And they knew it. And now speaker Kevin McCarthy went down to Mar-a-Lago, they took the picture together. And things started to turn around. If Speaker McCarthy's goal is to be speaker and he knew he needed the former president at his side, well, he is speaker and the former president was at his side. The one thing I think that I was struck by is -- Liam and I were looking at each other at the same time, I'm going to steal the smart thing that he was going to say, probably in a less smart manner -- he's got the job now.

They all want to vote present, which I found surprising, given that Gaetz had tried to scuttle McCarthy's ascension to the speaker for the past several months. And even said he would never become speaker just a couple of days ago. But nevertheless, at the end of the day, Gaetz was working, in some ways, to help McCarthy by voting present. And that helped him at the end of the day. So that was an interesting development which we learned here. But also Gaetz denied getting any sort of offer from -- for voting present, for helping McCarthy, at the end of the day. He said he was not offered a subcommittee chairmanship. McCarthy denied that as well. That has been a rumor that had been going around the Capitol. But he said he really did not get anything for. That and as far as that confrontation is concerned, he declined to comment, telling Pat Barrett, roll tide. That's all he would say. Rogers, of course, is from Alabama.",

That's his argument going forward, saying, let's forget about this, let's move, look ahead. And a lot of them are saying more positive things because they just know they have a huge task ahead of them governing in this narrowly divided Republican House with this -- two wings, that are completely at odds with each other, on so many key issues, representing so many districts, Biden districts that Biden picked up. And reconciling their views with the hard right which, at the end of the day, was what McCarthy had to cater to, to get the speakership.

Is that a message for Hakeem Jeffries? Is it a message for that block of five or six that went right up until the end? He kept talking about his father, his late father, talking about how he was the son of a firefighter. And I just could not put away from my head the imagery of Kevin McCarthy fighting about 1 million firefighters over the next weeks and months. But we have spent a lot of time over the past week talking about how a very small minority could basically hijack the majority. If I was going to try to interpret this a different way at this hour, after this very long week, it is that, actually, they were working with within the system. It shows you the problems with this system, but it was nonviolent, with the exception of the near punch that almost got thrown. It was nonviolent. It was a peaceful political protest. And they are operating within the rules that they're allowed to operate under, because they come from districts, these five or six lawmakers in particular, they come from districts that voted for Trump over Biden 2:1. Not Lauren Boebert but everyone else. And that's where those base voters are saying, this is what we want you to do. And Kevin McCarthy is experiencing some of that in his own district. So I think this does portend a very difficult year for Speaker McCarthy. The debt ceiling thing could be really bad for the country. But the reality is that, until either gerrymandering changes or people in these hard red districts change their minds about what they want, this is all functioning within the spectrum of how democracy is currently working in this country.",

And we don't know what the concessions are and the scope of, them, Tia, and what was the price to get the vote to go from a Never Kevin to, here, present. When it comes to things like that, which is a very nuanced aspect that most of the electorate might not be aware of, let alone understand, the idea that there can be this check and balance on what he says is wanting to have the government help, you not go after you, it was not a very subtle reference point. It was very blatant what he was trying to say. How do you think that translates? TIA MITCHELL, \"THE ATLANTA JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION\":  So I think it's two things. Number one, I think the Republican majority does have a consensus. They want these investigations. They want to address wokeism. And they want to repeal some of the things that were in some of these big spending packages that they did not agree, with such as the money for the IRS agents. But the rules package, the framework of how they can do that work, that could be another contentious vote on Monday, again. We already have one lawmaker saying he is a no.
