As we heard there in that tribute package to him, he was in EGOT, which means he was in that rare club of having an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar, and a Tony. So, this is really a presence in Hollywood that we truly, I don't think we'll ever see someone like James Earl Jones again.Now I want to read something to you, Jake. Back in 2014, so just a decade ago, he was asked about his long career and what was the secret to it. And he was so humble. This is what he said, Jake, quote, \"The secret is never forgetting that you're a journeyman actor and that nothing is your final thing.\" Nothing is your greatest thing. Nothing is your worst thing. I still consider myself a novice.\" So you see there at the age of around 83 already with so many awards, so decorated, so many roles.

That will live as one of his most famous roles, but Jake, he also revisited some of his other famous roles in very recent years.Just back in 2021, he was in a sequel to \"Coming to America 2.\" Of course, he continued to voice Darth Vader over the years in various \"Star Wars\" films. And a fun fact, in 1977, Jake, when he first voiced Darth Vader, he was paid just $7,000 for that role when he began, which is really incredible when you think of it, because without that voice, I don't know if Darth Vader would be the Darth Vader.

They said it about Barack Obama. They said it about Joe Biden when he ran. There are very few people who they don't see as far left.I would argue that for Kamala Harris, what she has to do is rise above the fray when it comes to pointing her as a West Coast liberal. We know that she is someone who was a progressive prosecutor before progressive prosecution was even a term that was used broadly. We also know that she's someone who stood for civil rights and equity. I don't consider that extremely far left. I consider that right in the same way that it was right when people like MLK stood for civil rights and justice. With that being said, I think that for Kamala Harris, it is also showcasing how she's expanded the tent. There are people on the right who have stood by in support of Kamala Harris, not because they're all of a sudden becoming Democrats, but because they understand what's at stake with our democracy should Donald Trump get elected again.",
