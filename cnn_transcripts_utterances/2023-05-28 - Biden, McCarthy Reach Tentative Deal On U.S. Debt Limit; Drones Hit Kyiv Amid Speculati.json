The deal meant to avert the first U.S. defaulting history, which of course would have had disastrous consequences worldwide. Here's how the U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy characterize the breakthrough.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): After weeks of negotiations, we have come to an agreement in principle. We still have a lot of work to do. But I believe this is an agreement in principle that's worthy of the American people. It has historic reductions in spending, consequential reforms that will lift people out of poverty into the workforce, rein in government overreach. There are no new taxes, no new government programs. There's a lot more within the bill. We still have more work to do tonight to finish all the writing of it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We went back to pre-ending, we would have a surplus right now if we -- if we -- if we were at that level of spending. REP. MAXWELL FROST (D-FL): These are really difficult times right now, especially when people are using a default to push a political agenda forward. And so, people at home know the budget process is separate from this. They're combining it because they understand that they can't get through these type of cuts through the actual normal process that Congress usually takes. And so they've combined these two things.

It seems to show Ukrainian soldiers getting ready for battle and saying it's time to take back what is ours. Now, in the video, you also see is them showing a lot of Western supplied military equipment. It ranges from U.S.-supplied Howitzers to HIMARS multiple rocket launching system, but also German-supplied Leopard 2 main battle tanks which many believe are going to be a key element once the Ukrainians start a counteroffensive that has been looming for a while.Now it's unclear whether or not this could be an indication that that counteroffensive could be on the rise and could be inching closer. But one of the things that we are seeing that there do seem to be an increased number of long-distance strikes, possibly by the Ukrainians on the rear echelon of the Russians. Now, those are focusing essentially on two places. One of them is Berdiansk on the Azov Sea and the other is Mariupol which of course is also a major port town on the Azov Sea as well. In fact, there are reports of three explosions at least in Mariupol on Saturday. Mariupol is one of the main staging grounds for the Russian military for their operations in Ukraine. So that certainly could be a big blow to the Russians if the Ukrainians are indeed hitting that area. The Russians, for their part are saying that they have intercepted some Ukrainian drones and some Ukrainian missiles as well. They were also talking about intercepting to Storm Shadow missiles, which of course were supplied by the United Kingdom. It's unclear whether or not that is true, but it certainly does seem as though right now, the Russians in that part of Ukraine seem to be under a considerable amount of pressure.

Now, of course, over the next several hours, both sides will be working on the text of this agreement and the devil will be in the details. That is where Republicans as well as Democrats will learn more about what exactly this agreement looks like. And they're up against a very tight deadline.

There was concern about their so much so that one of the House members took to Twitter saying in part, \"I will be submitting a journal statement to amend charge documents to include abuse of power, intimidation of House members and Senate jury tampering in light of Charlie Geren statements that A.G. Paxton called and threatened House and Senate members.\" Now I asked Paxton's office about this and I did not hear back. But Ken Paxton did take to Twitter in response to his impeachment, saying in part, \"I am beyond grateful to have the support of millions of Texans who recognize that what we just witnessed is an -- is illegal, unethical and profoundly unjust. I look forward to a quick resolution in the Texas Senate where I have full confidence the process will be fair and just.\" So what happens in the Texas House, what we know is that the Lieutenant Governor serves as judge, the 31 senators serve as jurors and that a two-third's vote of those senators who are present is required to convict.

But they're also taking an unprecedented legal step asking for court to grant them some relief. Suspending a portion of its long- standing Right to Shelter law. It's been in place for decades.And at its core, it basically requires New York City to offer homeless individuals shelter space. So, what we recently saw here is New York City petitioning for relief of some of those provisions citing an unprecedented demand for housing. City officials arguing that when this law came to be, that it did not contemplate a scenario that it's currently happening in which hundreds of asylum seekers without a home are arriving in New York City. So, as you're about to hear from the chief counsel to the mayor's office, this move is not according to them. Not to shut the door in the face of migrants and other homeless individuals, but instead to provide some flexibility long term. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
