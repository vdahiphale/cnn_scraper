Disturbing claims emerging of what's happened inside Putin's army tonight as Putin's reputed girlfriend breaks her silence. You'll hear what she's comparing to Kalashnikov assault rifles.Plus, a right to retaliate. China vows to fight back the U.S. shut down its spy balloon with a heat seeking missile. What will China do? We're live with a report from the ground in Beijing. And Congressman George Santos addressing today the long list of campaign expenses that don't add up, like spending $22,000 in an Italian restaurant. That's almost 1,000 orders of the rigatoni bolognaise there. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, Russians shooting Russians with machine guns. Allegations surfacing in this new video tonight, these are Russian soldiers detailing the threats and torture they suffered at the hands of other Russian soldiers. You see them there. According to the regional government of Tuva, which is where they are, it's part of Russia bordering Mongolia, one of these soldiers says on February 4, 2023, the Russian military in Donetsk came to us. They shot at us with machine guns, forced us to do pushups, told us that we will not leave here alive. They're saying this happened only two days ago. Those Russians attacking Russians. It is shocking, even in this war, happening on the front lines. All the more so, because any Russian who would survive such, you know, intra-Russian conflict and actually is there on the front line could suffer the same horrific plight as this Russian soldier. This is more new video to want. I do want to warn you this is very disturbing, but this is the horror of this war. This is a Russian soldier running. He's on fire. His body is on fire is. He's running to escape after his tank came under attack. Seconds later, one of the tanks hit, explodes. Now, of course, in this war, we don't know if the soldier engulfed in flames survives, and it's horrific to see, no matter who he is, but his fate, alive or dead, is terrible. And he is not alone. The rugged terrain in Eastern Ukraine is now littered with tank debris and Russian bodies. And now, in a bizarre move of bravado, Yevgeny Prigozhin, the founder of the brutal Wagner Group, whose forces are dominating much of the region for Putin, is putting out a new propaganda video that appears in the video in which he claims to be in a fighter jet that just bombed the village of Bakhmut, whether there's anything left to bomb. He claims that's where he is, he's in a fighter jet and he's doing that. And this comes as we're hearing from someone close to Putin that we don't often hear from, his girlfriend and the mother of multiple children of Putin, Alina Kabaeva. The former Olympic gymnast's title is chairwoman of the National Russian Media Group, which is one of the largest media corporations in Russia, and she is now speaking out publicly, saying that propaganda is as important a weapon right now as those machine guns. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ALINA KABAEVA, PUTIN'S REPUTED GIRLFRIEND:  Our people need our success, because information works under the conditions that we are currently living and as we fight for our country, is like a weapon of war and in terms of significance, it holds no less value than a Kalashnikov.

It's expert after expert on state television saying that Putin should use nuclear weapons, saying that this war is a war of Russia against Nazis.That propaganda is powerful. It's been used to justify Putin's entire invasion of Ukraine and justify his attacks and imprisonment of political enemies, like Putin opposition leader Alexei Navalny, now in solitary confinement in a penal colony, and former critic Mikhail Saakashvili, the former president of Georgia, who's dying in prison right now. The court today rejecting an appeal to release the former president of Georgia because of his declining health. Look at the ghastly images he showed. Those are his ribs. And just to remind you, here's what Saakashvili looked like when he was OUTFRONT in February of 2015. He's now emaciated and incredibly unwell. It's hard for him to even write. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy put up pictures in a press conference for the world to see over the weekend, saying Saakashvili is being killed, quote, little by little -- as Putin's purge of his enemies continues.

Now, General, you know, let's start here with what we heard about this, Russians fighting Russians inside the army, right? This group from Tuva, a region near Mongolia, saying other Russian soldiers are machine gunning them and telling them they won't leave there align. Those are Russians on Russians. What do you take away from seeing this? LT. GEN. BEN HODGES (RET0, U.S. ARMY:  Three things, Erin. First of all, there is a long tradition of violence, abuse inside the Russian military, hazing. I mean, very physical hazing, brutality, using weapons to keep people from retreating. So this does not surprise me. The second take away is that the Russian Federation is made up of almost 100 different ethnic groups. You've got soldiers that come from different parts of the Federation, different ethnicities, different religions. Historical grudges. So again, that doesn't surprise me that there would be some friction. And then third, this is a manifestation, I think, of enormous pressure on the military. None of them wants to be there.",

She's really reconfirming what has been official Kremlin policy. I think the second takeaway here is something that she alludes to, which is, of course, that we are looking at almost a year since Russia's full scale invasion of Ukraine. And I think she says at the beginning that we need this win, something along those lines. And what she's really saying there is this war for Russia, the war that Russia that Putin has launched against Ukraine is really an existential war for Putin and for Russia itself, and many Russians today inside of Russia do believe that this is a war that they have to win. It's a nationalist war. They believe, wrongly, of course, that Mr. Putin is protecting them.",

MIKE TURNER (R-OH):  Well, their balloon was an escalation, Erin. And the fact they say this was a lost weather balloon, then they shouldn't have any concerns about us taking it down. They're certainly not going to get it back, if it's a lost weather balloon. It certainly wouldn't be at a great cost. But it was at great cost. China calculated that they could pull this off and they could garner whatever information they were attempting to get as they crossed our most sensitive missile defense sites and nuclear weapons sites and infrastructure. And this is of grave concern. This is a national security risk. China should not be permitted to do this.

Now at least three rescue groups are coming forward, telling Gold that money that Santos raised on their behalf never made it to them.Several other people, including Navy veteran Rich Osthoff, who's appeared on the so show, says he scammed them out of money meant to help their sick pets. OUTFRONT, Judi Eskenazi, who helped run one New Jersey rescue group that worked with Santos. And, Judi, thanks so much for your time. So, you know, when you meet Santos or he first contacts you, this is back in 2017 and it's for help placing some dogs that he apparently had in his care.

OK, unclear as to why stripping a liquor license. I presume the minors weren't allowed to partake of that, but I get the punishment. All jokes aside, Jonah and Karen are with me.

I think if you actually read what these kids were exposed to with this thing, the average, nonpolitical parent is going to hear it and say, I think it's inappropriate for six year olds to see all of that stuff and to hear all of that stuff.And if Democrats want to fight 'em on it, then they have to defend what was going on there, which is not good politics. So I think it's a smart move for him. He's very good at picking these kinds of fights.
