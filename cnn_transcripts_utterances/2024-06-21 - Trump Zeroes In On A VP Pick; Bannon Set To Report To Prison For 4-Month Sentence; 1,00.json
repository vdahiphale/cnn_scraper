CNN with new reporting tonight because we are learning, it may come down to three men here wearing identical ties. They are Ohio Senator J.D. Vance, North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, and Florida Senator Marco Rubio. All three are currently being vetted and all three have high profile backers who are pleading their case directly to the former president. So let's start with Trump's oldest son, Don Jr. He, we understand, currently going to bat with his doppelganger, Senator J.D. Vance. Rupert Murdoch is pressing Trump to consider Governor Burgum. While one of Trump's most trusted television advisers, Sean Hannity, is making it known he'd like to see Senator Rubio on the ticket. For months, these three men have been campaigning for the job, positioning themselves to become Trump's pick, frequently appearing on shows they know Trump watches, showing up at fundraisers, rallies courthouse, of course, tripping over themselves to seeing Trump's praises. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. J.D. VANCE (R-OH): The world is on fire and I sort of see Donald Trump as a bit of a fireman. GOV. DOUG BURGUM (R-ND): I wish every American could see President Trump the way we've seen in the last six months. He's genuinely exceedingly funny, but as you know, Jesse, the best comics are really smart people, highly intelligent and highly perceptive and they know their audiences. And I think President Trump's been amazing. SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL): When Donald Trump was president of the United States, this country was safer, it was more prosperous. The country and the world is a better place when he was president. And I would love to see him return to the White House. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Vance is a fighter and he needs strong debater. But I actually think he is somebody who really underscores some of the most unpopular elements of Donald Trump. But I also think the important thing to remember here is the reality of the dynamic in this race is that Donald Trump is the supernova and the VP is a flashlight, right? I mean, Donald Trump is the one who's going to drive -- who drives the message, who is going to be be the person that the Biden campaigns running against.

People were not in a shade box with louvers. They were on a road with the sun beating on them. So the temperature where they were experience dancing could certainly have been more than 125 without a doubt. And it's still hot.
