That nightmare scenario could happen in just 10 days. Treasury's funds are already dwindling, and, without a deal, Uncle Sam won't be able to pay out Social Security, Medicare, and military salaries. This weekend, urgent negotiations resulted in the same old standoff. McCarthy wants major spending cuts. Biden says Republicans are holding the economy and his presidency hostage.

So, today, the White House negotiators and Speaker McCarthy's deputies met for another three hours today, Congressman Patrick McHenry, one of those negotiators, coming out there saying that we are at a very sensitive point, but saying that there is goodwill, at least, on both sides to try and reach an agreement. But what's really notable here is how far these sides remain just 10 days away from a potential default, not only over the specifics of a potential deal, some of those sticking points, like work requirements, for example, but just on the basics of what that top-line spending number will actually look like, where federal spending will be capped, and for how long. We know that the White House has proposed capping spending for next year at this current year's levels. House Republicans say that spending needs to go backwards to at least fiscal year 2022. And that, it appears, remains one of the major roadblocks here, something that has yet to actually be resolved. All of this, of course, ahead of this crucial meeting between President Biden and Speaker McCarthy later today. We know that the president yesterday, when he was in Japan, he was asked whether or not he could guarantee that a default would not happen, a question that he was posed by so many world leaders at that G7 summit. And the president said that he simply cannot guarantee that, putting the onus on Republicans, saying that he doesn't know that Republicans won't do something that would lead the country to default.",

The other thing to keep in mind is just how long it's going to take on the floor of both the House of Representatives and then in the U.S. Senate to get any deal passed. It does take some time to get lawmakers all on the same page. In the House, it takes 72 hours for lawmakers to have an opportunity to read legislation before they vote. That timeline could always be moved up in the U.S. Senate, but any one senator could really stall this progress.

The second part of this speech really was an indictment on President Biden, arguing that he is too weak and that this country needs new leadership. So, this will be a difficult road ahead for Senator Scott. He will spend the next several months introducing himself to voters. Many folks here in South Carolina know him and know him well, have known him for a long time, from when he held local office here.

That endorsement obviously resonates here in Washington and perhaps in South Dakota as well, but does it hit the base? Does the base look to these endorsements as a sign of where they should lend their vote? BARRON-LOPEZ:  I don't think they do, because anything -- what I have seen when I go to these rallies, whether it's Trump rallies or rallies for other Republicans that have run down-ballot, you don't hear them talk very much about establishment Republicans, other than to say that they don't agree with them, that they don't -- that they aren't aligned with him anymore.

Of course, there were fits and starts over the weekend, but the White House -- a White House official was telling me today, as they head into this meeting, there's frustrations over two big things, which is that they feel as though McCarthy and his team in recent days tried to propose more extensive cuts on SNAP -- that's food assistance programs, which the president has a red line on that on. He does not want to pursue more cuts on that at all beyond what was potentially in the Republican bill that they passed, and then also on the sheer number of spending caps. So I'm told by the White House official that Republicans are proposing six years' worth of spending caps. That's not something that the White House wants at all. They're looking more at the two-year range. So they're heading into this meeting right now trying to find common ground on those areas.

We reported on them back in December. That self-same group has now confirmed that it has crossed the border from Ukraine into Russian territory and attacked three border villages, one, Grayvoron, about eight kilometers, five miles into Russian territory. Now, in exclusive video that they -- this legion supplied to CNN, when you zoom in, you can see some support for their claim, which we can't independently verify, that they attacked the local headquarters of the FSB -- that's the secret police in Russia -- and also claim to have knocked out a Russian tank in this engagement. As of midafternoon, when we were in touch with them, they said they were ongoing. The local authorities in Russia have confirmed that they have been invaded, albeit on a limited basis. The regional governor of Belgorod has been to Grayvoron, says the situation there continues to be extremely tense, that almost all civilians have been evacuated or have fled from that village and that there is artillery in use. Now, the Russian Legion is described for this operation by the Ukrainian armed forces as being an independent group of Russian citizens. And that is true, in that they are Russian citizens, but they are kind of trying to keep them at -- keep them at arm's length when it comes to this cross-border incursion. But, frankly, it couldn't have been done or would not have been done without the full support of the Ukrainian armed forces and these are people in Ukrainian uniforms who've been fighting already very heavily south of Bakhmut for Ukraine. But, yes, they are Russian dissidents, all dedicated to trying to end the Putin regime. Very dramatic moment here, because they have in the past, the Ukrainians, conducted covert operations inside Russia, but never admitted responsibility.

Military significant -- militarily significant for Ukraine to be able to strike there? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Absolutely, Jim. And the reason is, Belgorod is actually the site of a major air base for the Russians. And that air base just happens to have nuclear storage facilities at it. So, that would be one reason to actually go there. And you also pointed out something very important here. This is a staging area. Every single thing that the Russians have been doing vis-a-vis Ukraine in this part of the country has actually come from Belgorod.
