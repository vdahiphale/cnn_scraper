Good evening.A dramatic and perplexing chain of events unfolding in Russia today with much of the world on edge ahead of the Wagner mercenary group have roughly called off in advance in Moscow. The apparent insurrection was reportedly aimed at Russia's military leadership over its handling of the war in Ukraine. Wagner forces were almost unchallenged as their columns marched toward Moscow. Here, locals are heard cheering for the mercenaries. They said they had captured key military facilities in two Russian cities. They made it about halfway to Moscow before suddenly turning back. Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin says he wanted to avoid bloodshed. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YEVGENY PRIGOZHIN, HEAD OF WAGNER GROUP (through translator): Therefore, realizing all the responsibilities for the fact that Russian blood will be shed from one of the sides we turn our columns around and leave in the opposite direction to the field camps, according to the plan.

This was Prigozhin's claim that Valery Gerasimov, the Russian military chief of staff, his boss, the Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, falsely went into this war. He blamed them for the war. The way that they fought it, the loss of life, the lack of training, the lack of ammunition. What's happened to them? We haven't heard a whisper from them either. Are they now off the scene?

ROBERTSONcould put a match to any part of this at the moment, and it could just rip up into flames again. Yes, Lukashenko, just a couple of years ago and a fraudulent was barely clinging to power. Massive street protests. It took support from Russia, has been increasingly propped up and even lent on by Putin, and was host to Russian forces and Russian aircraft involved in the invasion of Ukraine. And indeed, Russia has made a big point of moving, it says, tactical nuclear warheads into Belorussia. This is all on Lukashenko's watch. Lukashenko who's looked like a far weaker figure than Putin and a far weaker figure than he used to be a few years ago. How is it that he now has the power and the influence to negotiate this deal where the Kremlin points out that Lukashenko and Prigozhin have a 20-year history. Lukashenko was able to sort of play on some of that, to have influence over Prigozhin. Did Prigozhin realize that he'd miscalculated? That he didn't get the support that he wanted? Was this always his plan and this was his best option, his get out of jail free card, apparently, because otherwise he would have been put up against a wall or similar and shot? Were those the options presented to him? It's so hard to tell. But Lukashenko's role in this, does this upend, understanding of the power balance between Putin and Lukashenko? I don't think so.

All right, Nic Robertson, thank you very much for that analysis.And joining me now, CNN military analyst and former commanding general of U.S. Army Europe, retired Lieutenant General Mark Hertling, Kimberly Dozier, our CNN global affairs analyst and senior managing editor of \"Military Times,\" and David Sanger, CNN national security analyst and national security correspondent for the \"New York Times.\" General Hertling, let me get back to you. We were speaking in the previous hour. What do you think Prigozhin's intentions were? Was this all some big stunt that succeeded a lot more wildly than he could have possibly imagined? Is that potentially what happened here? Why did he stop so abruptly? LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes, Jim, I'd suggest it was a stunt that got a little bit out of control. I mean, all indicators, the government assessment was that Prigozhin was attempting to counter the new law within Russia to make all the mercenaries that are part of this DMC's sign contracts with the government, in effect, putting Prigozhin underneath the control and command of the minister of Defense Shoigu. Shoigu and Prigozhin absolutely cannot stand each other. Neither one of them have military backgrounds. Neither one of them are soldiers. But they just see things from a very different perspective. Prigozhin is out after power. And as we talked the last hour, he's looking to be his own personal warlord with no ideology, whereas Shoigu is attempting to just make as much money and grift as much as he can, and he's been doing that for 10 years. They hate each other. So this was an attempt by Prigozhin to make Putin have a decision. Who is the top dog? And listening to what you said to Nic a minute ago, I'd suggest to you the top dog of Putin took his chihuahua Prigozhin and sent him off to deal with his poodle, Lukashenko, to carry through with the dog analogy. So what we're talking about is getting this free-floating electron under control.",

Reacting in the folk hero style that has been lionized across Russia and by Vladimir Putin. So his reaction to march on Moscow after being betrayed fits into a Russian narrative that makes sense even to Putin.And I think what Vladimir Putin understood was that, if he took Prigozhin out, he could stir the hatred of his own people. You don't make a hero and then destroy a hero. It just doesn't -- that doesn't play well long term if you want to stay in power. On Prigozhin's side of things, look, he's lived to fight another day. From his perspective, he doesn't have air power. There were some reports that some of his forces were getting hit by air power. He knew that it's open territory between where he was and Moscow, and that Putin couldn't risk that fighting reaching the edge of the capital. So at this point, he goes on to live another day in Belarus and to possibly form a political counterweight.

I think they've got some severe losses ahead. And that's what might lead Putin to do, as Mark suggested, to pull back and consolidate.But for now, I think the Russian commanders have been challenged.

It was about 15 hours ago that Putin called him a traitor, and it was about three or four hours ago that they announced that there wouldn't be any charges after all. So if we were wondering just how political the prosecution process is in Russia, I think we've just had a really fabulous miniature case study.But I think, to your question about whether this is Putinesque, that sort of depends on what he thinks the end point is. We've seen people get exiled before and, you know, get poisoned as you pointed out, get killed in other ways. It's possible that Putin doesn't know how he would replace the kind of services that the Wagner Group has provided him in Syria, in Africa, and then in Ukraine. They've obviously been among the more effective forces. So that leaves Putin with a bit of a problem. And there is a third shoe that we've got to -- we've not yet heard drop. There are many American officials who think that at some point Putin is going to turn around and say this entire thing was a plot by the United States. I don't think it had anything to do with the United States. I think it was purely internal. Prigozhin has been sort of signaling this dispute for many months. But you can imagine the utility to Putin of saying this was a U.S. or a NATO or whatever at the moment that he's getting ready to install nuclear weapons in Belarus along with Mr. Prigozhin.",

As early as January, the national security spokesman, John Kirby referred to the Wagner Group as a rival power center to the Russian Ministry of Defense and we are told that US intelligence officials had begun to believe that Prigozhin was preparing something. But nonetheless, Jim, the speed at which all of this evolved over the last 24 hours really caught US officials, and clearly Vladimir Putin as well by surprise. And so over the last 24 hours, US officials have been actively monitoring the situation, but they have been very careful in terms of their public statements not to go very far. We've heard very little, in fact, on the record from US officials other than to say that they are monitoring the situation and reading out some of those calls that we know that President Biden and top US officials have been having with their allied counterparts. President Biden this morning spoke with top NATO allies, his counterparts, the president of France, for example, the prime minister of the United Kingdom, and leader of Germany. And we also know that Secretary of Defense Austin, Secretary of State Blinken, and the national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, they have also been in touch with their counterparts as well. Now, as I've said, US officials have been cautious about what they're saying in public, in part because of the fast speed of these developments, and also to avoid any association with this armed insurrection and any kind of Western support. Now, there's a number of questions that remain to be solved here and I can tell you in speaking with officials that it is clear that the White House doesn't have all of the answers yet to the questions that remain. In particular, what is the future for Vladimir Putin? And how will this affect Russia's war in Ukraine? We know that Ukraine has now advanced in new offensive ways.

And then you had Vladimir Putin himself coming out and calling this an armed insurrection a stab in the back of Russia, and comparing this to the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, which if you use that historical analogy would make Putin Tsar Nicholas II who ended up being killed in a firing squad by Bolshevik some years later.

It was posing an existential threat to the country. There are still Russian politicians on Russian air saying that these Wagner mercenaries are traitors. They need to be dealt with, they need to be punished.

He has been very, very critical of them as mishandling the war, and even misleading Putin. So I do think Putin has to look strong, but it's really a balancing act. The military has to look strong and then he has to figure out what happens to Prigozhin. Prigozhin goes to Belarus, a very friendly place. Maybe he's murdered at that point, we don't know.
