All that means is that every registered voter, all 1.8 million of them, received a ballot in the mail unless they opted out. And so long as they placed that ballot inside a mailbox and it got postmarked on Election Day, it could be counted until Saturday. And so that's there's why there's this uncertainty and the races here right now are razor thin.Let me go through those really quickly with you because in the U.S. Senate, Republican Adam Laxalt, has a less than 3 percent margin ahead of Democratic Incumbent Catherine Cortez Masto. That's razor thin. The governor's race, Joe Lombardo, the Republican has a less than 5 percent gain over the incumbent governor, Democrat Steve Sisolak. The secretary of state race, Jim Marchant, the Republican, has a less than 1 percent lead over Cisco Aguilar, the Democrat. Now, this is what we've been hearing from officials here in Nevada. It is just unclear exactly how many ballots are out there. They are, of course, waiting to count all of them and there are tens of thousands, Jim and Erica, that we know for sure. There's about 80,000 of those that we heard from the Clark County registrar yesterday. These were either in the hundreds of drop boxes that had not been counted on Election Day or they were mail ballots that were received and are yet to be processed completely. And so those tens of thousands are still not reflected in the results that we just talked about. So, clear as mud at this point.",

You saw him sounding victorious and defiant, unlike a number of his predecessors who, after their first midterm elections, had to really promise a major course direction change for the country, the president saying that, regardless of who ends up controlling Congress, he is going to largely stay the course. He said he's willing to continue working with members across the aisle on important issues, like bringing down inflation, national security issues. He also said that he is very much prepared to exercise his veto power if he sees Republican efforts to undo some of his major accomplishments.

Donald Trump as Trumpty Dumpty, that he had a big fall. This is the New York Post being the New York Post. I mean, let's not say this is the entire conservative movement. But it is worth noting that on the day after the election, they had a headline about Ron DeSantis and how strong he was. On the second day after the election, they have a headline about Donald Trump and maybe him losing his grip on the Republican Party.On a more serious note, The Wall Street Journal Editorial Board has an editorial that makes the point that I've tried to make to people over and over again, just in pointing out Donald Trump's record. He's won one race, 2016. He lost the House and the Senate during his time in office for Republicans and he lost the 2020 presidential race. Then you go to 2022, there have been losses there too. So, I think you're seeing, Erica, some, some elements of discontent within the Republican Party about Donald Trump. I hesitate to say that's the entire party. I think we have to be careful in making generalizations like that, but there's at least some.",

In the exit polling, 73 percent of Republican had a favorable opinion of him. 23 percent had an unfavorable opinion. So, he's a still popular within the party. Let's not say it's all over for Donald Trump.But I want to go to the DeSantis number, if we can pop up that up. In Florida, he was asked, would you want Ron DeSantis to run for president. These are people who know him. 72 percent said yes. So, I think there is some momentum for DeSantis. He raised a ton of money, $200 million for his campaign. He has a lot of that money still left on hand. He had a huge night compared to the Republicans more generally and compared to Trump more generally. So, I actually think we may see this fight and I think Donald Trump is a little worried about this fight with Ron DeSantis, which is not a trait that we usually associate with him.",

It reads, we're quoting here, since his unlikely victory in 2016 against the widely disliked Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump has a perfect record of electoral defeat. The GOP was pounded in the 2018 midterms owing to his low approval rating, Mr. Trump himself lost in 2020, then he sabotaged Georgia's 2021 runoffs by blaming party leaders for not somehow overturning his defeat.

Because even when you're looking at the DeSantis thing, he had a very strong night, the question is, does he now turn around and take on Donald Trump?

So, I think that's the real question, is who's got the courage to do it and who's going to go out there with a strong message.And to win in a primary, the message can't be that necessarily Trump is awful, even though many of us believe that, it's got to be, hey, it's time to move on.
