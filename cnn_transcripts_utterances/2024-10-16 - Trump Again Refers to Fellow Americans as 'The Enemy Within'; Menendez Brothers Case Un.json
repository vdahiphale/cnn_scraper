      "sentences": "Later today, the family of Erik and Lyle Menendez is holding a news conference calling for the brothers' release from prison.Nearly 35 years after the pair admitted to fatally shooting their parents, prosecutors are reviewing new evidence in the case. It's a letter Erik allegedly wrote to his cousin eight months before the 1989 murders. Erik claimed at the time that his father was raping him. That abuse was central to the brothers' claims of self-defense. Quote -- and this is from the letter -- \"I have been trying to avoid dad. It's still happening. But it's now worse for me.\" And the case, of course, fascinated America three decades ago. It has returned to pop culture thanks to a documentary on Netflix. The long- imprisoned brothers describe an abusive relationship with their father that drove them to kill. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

What's your reaction to the impact this documentary has had on this case and the fact that it's being reviewed right now? It sounds as though there's a possibility the brothers could be released. LONI COOMBS, FORMER LOS ANGELES COUNTY CRIMINAL PROSECUTOR:  Yes, it does sound like that. And, Jim, it's so interesting to see the impact of this documentary. I call this a modern phenomenon going on in the criminal justice system. It's very new. And case in point, look at the R. Kelly investigation and the prosecution and conviction there.

Half of the victims alleged there are men as well. So we understand it better. We understand the dynamics of it, that sometimes it takes years for the victims to be able to talk about the trauma, which might explain why the boys in this case, when we were looking at this back in the -- at the time when this was actually going on, they confessed to their therapist, but they never said that there was sexual abuse. They said, we killed them. We thought about it. We planned it. We tried to cover up. But they never talked about the sexual abuse until the trial came. So it was like, why did it take so long? Now we understand that better. Now people on TikTok are talking about this. Everyone, it seems like, either knows someone or understands sexual abuse so much better. And it's something that I think will resonate when you're talking about resentencing. Resentencing, you're looking at mitigation.
