A source familiar with law enforcement plans has told CNN police have declared the protest encampment an unlawful assembly. The first step before police move in asking individuals to disperse or face arrest.The Los Angeles Police Department has issued a citywide tactical alert placing all personnel on notice. They may be called to UCLA if needed. Just 24 hours ago, the university was the scene of violent clashes between pro-Palestinian protesters and a counter group which left at least 15 people injured. CNN's Nick Watt live at the scene at UCLA for us this hour. So, Nick, where you stand right now, how is this set to play out?",

      "sentences": "Well, I've heard from a source, John, that the basic clan is this. The Los Angeles Police Department will provide basically crowd control. As the rumors have spread over the past few hours that an incursion into the encampment was coming crowds have gathered of pro-Palestinian protesters at the east side and the west side. Hundreds of people.So the LAPD in riot gear is facing outwards towards those crowds. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department is also going to be involved, I'm told, because these crowds are perhaps bigger than were anticipated. Now the people who are actually going to go into that encampment are the California Highway Patrol. They are a state agency. This is state land. Now their concerns are human waste in there. That camp has been there for about a week. They're also concerned that some of the protesters in that encampment might have bear spray. So I'm told that that is going to be a very slow and a very methodical process. We have also heard reports from my colleague Josh Campbell that buses are being staged about an hour -- a mile away, I'm sorry. They would be to take away the arrested people. As you say, an unlawful assembly, that is what these people could be charged with. As I mentioned, this encampment, you can almost see through the darkness, has been there for about a week, John. Ong only a few hours ago did they declare it an unlawful encampment. That was really a clue that something was going to happen. Now, over much of this week, the law enforcement present here on UCLA campus has been very minimal. The college officials did not want to antagonize. They did not want to provoke. They did not want to see those clashes that we've seen on other campuses. However, last night, as you mentioned, a group of pro-Israel counter protesters sort of attacked that encampment. A firework, there were some chemicals sprayed, there were physical altercations. After that, the governor of California made it very clear that he wanted a far greater, a far more robust law enforcement presence on this campus. That has been growing all day today. Just a few hours ago, just before night started falling, we heard the rumors of this impending incursion. That's when the crowd gathered. That's when these LAPD officers gathered facing outwards towards that crowd, and as I say, sources telling me it's California Highway Patrol that will actually be going in at a time we do not yet know -- John.",

Sheriff's Department and the California Highway Patrol versus the number of protesters who are there.[00:05:04] And also, there's also been this allegation throughout these protests that maybe they're not all students.

A lot of these people gathered around me now, who say that they will stay here as long as it takes. They do appear to be students. In terms of numbers of people inside that encampment, we frankly don't know because they've barricaded the encampment and they won't really let media in.So we don't really know. The last estimate I had which was yesterday was about 100 people. So I don't know how many people are inside, but I can tell you there are now hundreds outside and this was perhaps not anticipated. This is why the sheriff's department will be coming in to try to deal with this crowd. Obviously, it makes it much harder to go into an encampment, clear out an encampment, if you have to deal with hundreds of other people on the outside. Now one headache they don't appear to have to deal with tonight is counter protesters, pro-Israel protesters. We did see a small cluster of them here earlier. They have gone. It is now pro-Palestinian protesters on both ends of the encampment. And as I say, an unknown number of people still inside. Now, what we do see in these cases, John, is the law enforcement will give the people in that encampment a chance to leave. They will give them a warning. They will give him a way out. And those who choose to stay, they were the ones -- they will be the ones who will face this incursion of the California Highway Patrol -- John.",

We appreciate the update but for now thank you.These campus protests are now a political fodder for many U.S. lawmakers. The Republican-led House approved a bill Wednesday, which would broaden the definition of antisemitism. It passed by a large margin. Supporters saying the bill will help combat antisemitism on campus but opponents say it overreaches and threatens to limit free speech. House Speaker Republican Mike Johnson has called pro-Palestinian protesters common criminals, accuses the U.S. president of being afraid to speak to the issue. But the college protests have put Joe Biden in a difficult position as he seeks reelection with the war in Gaza dividing many Democrats. His administration has condemned the forceful takeover of campus buildings and instances of antisemitism, while remaining mindful of students' right to protest. That's according to White House press secretary. President Biden will drive home -- drive home the need rather to fight antisemitism when he delivers a keynote address next week at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum's Annual Remembrance Ceremony. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The president is being kept regularly updated on what's happening. As you just stated across the country, he is monitoring the situation closely, so is his team. And I would just add that no president, no president has spoken more forcefully about combatting antisemitism than this president. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Some of the similarities include that it's a protest over a war, protest centered in campuses, a lot of student activism. Also, there's a parallel between 1968 and the Democratic convention in Chicago. The Democrats are in Chicago again this time around.But I think the differences are really striking because in the early '60s, the early '70s, the war was in America's homes, by a television, and it was being fought by Americans, young American boys, and some women. My friends, my classmates went to Vietnam, and there was the draft. And so there was an incredible involvement very directly by students in America in the '60s. And there was the hippie movement and the Civil Rights Movement. There was the women's movement, the -- it's an age of revolution. And so you had incredible activism on campuses. The campus I was on, St. Mary's College, we shut down after the Cambodian invasion in 1970. But it's very different because it was much more direct, much closer, and much more personalized in that era.",

It still is arbitrarily denying entry of essential humanitarian assistance.
