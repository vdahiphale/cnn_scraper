New explosions over Gaza and this video of an intense firefight. Flares lighting up the sky, our Nic Robertson on the border, with Gaza, telling us this usually means ground troops are on the move. This assault comes as northern Gaza's overcrowded hospitals are now bearing the brunt of Israel's intense strikes. The head of a pediatric hospital telling CNN, they were completely surrounded. He says there are tanks outside the hospital, and they, inside, cannot leave. That is raising new fears that the lives of vulnerable patients are at risk. According to the Palestinian ministry of health which relies on numbers from the Hamas-controlled ministry of health in Gaza, more than 11,000 people have been killed from strikes like this one at a school. Now, CNN cannot independently verify those numbers. Today, America's top diplomat, Secretary of State Tony Blinken, warned that far too many Palestinians are being killed. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The Israeli military now surrounded the Al Nasr Hospital in northern Gaza, according to the hospital director, with tanks, visible on the streets outside.The staunch U.S. support for Israel has come with a cost. A State Department cable obtained by CNN warns that U.S. support for Israel is being seen in Arab countries as material and moral culpability, what they consider to be possible war crimes. Despite growing international calls for a cease-fire, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel will continue until Hamas is defeated and cannot return. The fight, not only on one front. Tel Aviv under a barrage from rocket fire triggered red alerts and interceptions. On Israel's northern border, the IDF says it struck Hezbollah targets after an anti-tank missiles injured three Israeli soldiers at a military post.

And OUTFRONT now, retired Army Major General James \"Spider\" Marks, and Seth Jones, whose analysis of this conflict is been extensively utilized by the U.S. government. He's the senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. General, you just heard the IDF saying it is now near the heart of Gaza City. What does that fight look like tonight? MAJ. GEN. JAMES \"SPIDER\" MARKS (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, what it really looks like is the extremely difficult fight. Let me show you how this will unfold. When we go back to when the IDF entered into Gaza, they essentially came along three axes and by doing that, you isolated where the primary fight is taking place right now. Going to the next map, what you really see with Gaza City is, if you could fly a drone over Gaza City right now, what you would see is the IDF has created an outer ring, essentially, we're a strong points in different locations that are interconnected visually, through communications, through supporting fire. And the intent of that is to keep Hamas fighters, or reinforcing kinds of capabilities out. What you would also see then is kind of an inner ring where most of the fighting is going to take place. Most of the clearance of the tunnels, and those individual locations where inventory of weapons systems, were the latest locations of where the Hamas leadership might be located, and what that is intended to do, is to keep Hamas inside, so that Israelis can do some very precise and some very hard fighting. But this is described, doctrinally, as a three block war. We are on one block or doing some very high intensity conventional fighting. On the second block, you may be doing some very precise targeting, go after individuals. It may be trying to separate combatants. And on the third block, which is important to understand, the third block, you're probably condemning humanitarian efforts. So, the issue all along is, can you conduct operations and conduct humanitarian operations? Yes. There's doctrine that supports that. So the international claim that you need to take a technical pause, which is not a military term, there is no term for a pause. You're either attacking or defending. You can simultaneously conduct humanitarian efforts which should take place, which could take place here along the sea, you could bring in some mercy ships to handle a lot of that medical requirements, as well as humanitarian -- you can create humanitarian corridors, and you can bring in resupplies.",

They are facing a range of improvised explosive devices in and around those areas of Gaza City. They've got rocket propelled grenades that Hamas has a shot, and other groups, frankly, in the area. We have got other types of snipers that have shot at IDF forces. And we certainly see a range of Hamas operatives coming in and out of the tunnels with additional weapons. So this is a very difficult environment for the IDF. They know it well and this is really where intelligence is so important to identify where those Hamas Islamic jihad and other fighters are, what they have, and where they're going.",

Hamas conducted their attack on the 7th of October, under direction of Iran. And what Hezbollah does is at the direction of Iran as well.And so, clearly the intent, I must say, the strategic objective of the attack on the 7th was hopefully to draw the rest of the Arab world into this. So that Israel would collapse. I mean, that's their charter. That's why Hamas and Hezbollah exist. And that's what Iran is trying to achieve. So what's happening is, clearly, you think that Tehran hopes the Israelis are focused, laser focused, in on Gaza, and might not be completely engaged, as they should, be on the northern border up here. Well, clearly, what the Israelis have been there before is that type of requirement, to fight a multi-front war. What may happen, if Hezbollah begins to create a number of missiles that would overwhelm the Iron Dome system that Israel has, and if they were to use the tunnel system, which exists, in northern Israel and southern Lebanon as well, so that there could be Hezbollah fighters infiltrating in, we now look at possibility, not the probability, this belongs to our Defense Department and State Department to engage in. So, we got the Eisenhower carrier strike group, do they then go after targets in southern Lebanon that are conducting these missile strikes into Israel? That is the key question.

It does impact civilians. That State Department cable is certainly true, that U.S. diplomats have been under pressure. But I would just remind everyone that as we look across the Middle East, the last several years, the Saudis pounded targets in Yemen, over 15,000 civilians were killed. Syrians killed well over 200,000, with the Russians targeting hospitals and humanitarian aid convoys. 10,000 in Mosul itself, that were killed by Iraqi and other forces as the Iraqis and the U.S. moved into Mosul. So I will just remind everyone, to, this kind of war is violent, including for other Arab regimes that have been involved in it.
