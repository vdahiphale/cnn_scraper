My son, he was -- he had Crohn's disease. He had surgery in 2013. My son weighed a buck 50. He was 6'3\" and he weighed a buck 50. And those men, if you combine their weights, they all -- it was over 1,000 pounds beating and beating 150-pound person to death. Because that's what they did, they beat my son to death.",

Bakari, I always think of my mom in situations like that, imagine her reaction, or any mother's reaction. This is a mother in mourning and in shock. As you heard those words, and what she's learned so far from police about this, what was your reaction?",

We've been on -- I've been on with CNN since 2015 and this has to be the 10th, 15th time we've spoken about this. We've seen the pain of black families having to live through this. And I want people to truly understand the systemic nature of the injustice that we're seeing perpetrated against black bodies.I am trying to be as diligent as possible when talking about the race of the officers because, Jim, practically speaking, that doesn't matter. This is a system whereby black folk are not valued. And we heard from his father, we heard from his mother about the images you'll see on that video. And I think that those images will show you the basic tenet that we've been talking about since we've been blue in the face from Emmett Till to now Mr. Nichols, that black folk don't get the benefit of their humanity.",

It's about the conduct of the officers.And the police chief said as much to Don this morning, that you can take that out of it. This is about the way they acted. Something else that stands out, Bakari, is, with hearing from the police chief that in her view this is as bad as, if not worse than, that video of Rodney King from 1992. You know, our colleague Josh Campbell pointing out what's interesting is in 1992 those officers didn't know that they were being filmed.",

      "sentences": "That's a good question. That's actually a really good question, Erica.I think that it goes to the gratuitous nature whereby individuals who look like me are treated by law enforcement, right? And so if you beat somebody behind closed doors, that just means you have a really fundamentally flawed character because character is who you are when no one's looking. If you beat somebody out in the -- under just, you know, light with cameras and video around other people, that shows that you didn't believe that person to be human. You figured no one would care because that person was less than human. And so that -- under that analysis it shows that this is actually worse than Rodney King because in Rodney King they thought they were doing something under the cover of darkness, which they had done many times before. In this case they wanted to beat him and beat him and pummel him because they figured no one would care. And that's my fundamental problem with this entire system. You can talk about the Jump Out Boys, you can talk about the Red Dogs, you can talk about the Scorpion Unit, that that is what they're called in different municipalities, which usually lead to bad policing. But, fundamentally, you've got to give black folk the benefit of their humanity, and we just don't see that often enough.",

She said you're going to see, she said to Don, a disregard for life.What preparations must law enforcement be making now for reaction to this? And is there -- is there some benefit in that reaction in terms of teeing this up a bit, right, preparing people for exactly what they're going to see later today?",

Seasoned law enforcement officers, prosecutors, are describing this asjust such a horrific act. And, you know, when - when this video does get released, it is going to send a shock wave across the United States, not just Memphis. It undermines the credibility of law enforcement, their legitimacy, their ability to operate in the communities that they serve. It's going to raise a whole bunch of new issues. But to Bakari's point, we have to solve the issues from the past, right? We have to get greater accountability. And what we heard this morning from the interview with Chief Davis by Don Lemon is that she's saying that accountability runs throughout the department. The Memphis Police Department has actually put in to practice a whole bunch of policies to try to avoid this in terms of de-escalation training and other measures. Why wasn't that applied in this case, right? Why did these five individuals feel like they could act with - you know, we're talking about body-worn cameras, all of this surveillance, with impunity. That's the question why. Why did this happen?",
