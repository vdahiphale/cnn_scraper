I'm Jake Tapper.We're going to start with our world lead as Israel continues its siege of Gaza's largest hospitals, its forces have found the body they report of a second Israeli hostage near the Al-Shifa medical complex. This is 19-year-old Noa Marciano. She was a corporal in the Israel Defense Forces. She was kidnapped by Hamas during the terrorist attacks on October 7. Hamas confirmed her death earlier this week. They claim she was killed in an Israeli airstrike. Israel denies it. We have no way of knowing the truth. The body of a 65-year-old Yehudit Waiss was found yesterday around the same area. It's not clear if the two women were found together. With those two and the discovery of part of the skull of Shani Louk who was kidnapped from the Nova music festival on October 3rd, that's at the least the third victim of kidnapping whose remains have been found since October 7. Today, we're also getting new insight into the negotiations to free at least some of the hostages believed to be currently held by Hamas which we believe is more than 230 innocent civilians in total. Sources say Hamas has demanded had Israel stop flying drones over Gaza as part of a larger military pause. Sources caution that Israel is not likely to accept the request since Israel uses the drones to track the movement of Hamas operatives. Today, it is one of the birthdays of one of the hostages. It's her ninth birthday, Emily Hand. She's one of the faces featured on this new billboard in Times Square. Her dad Thomas was in New York City to watch the reveal of the billboard this morning. He told CNN that he is praying she will be home by the end of the year. I want to bring in CNN's Nic Robertson. He's live in Sderot, Israel, just east of the Gaza border. And, Nic, let's start with the latest on the ground. While Israeli forces are raiding the Al-Shifa hospital for a third day in a row, we are hearing some really dire conditions for patients in the hospital.",

It feels as if this area of Gaza is getting some intense military activity tonight. That's some more of the detonations. We think that's outgoing tank fire. Looking over my soldier there, we can't see very much, but we have been picking up the occasional flash on the horizon there.This is some of the intense fire that we've been seeing just -- yeah, this is some of the intense fire we've heard in the past few days from here. I think those big booms you're hearing, that's outgoing tank fire from not far away. But it's accompanied by -- you're going to see there, some very, very big explosions illuminating, looking at the geography of where we're at right now, that is over towards the Mediterranean coast, right at the northern and western tip of Gaza. That would be sort of the area perhaps working down towards the Al- Shati refugee camp. [16:05:02] These detonations, by the way, are shaking the floor I'm standing on about five miles away. We're talking there as well -- I'll talk about the hospital. The Al-Shifa hospital, Shifa Hospital there, doctors there have been speaking with the Qatar-based al Jazeera network. We have not been able to reach them because phone lines are so badly disrupted in Gaza right now, because of a lack of fuel. But the doctor was telling the al Jazeera network that patients have been dying in the ICU there because they've been running out of oxygen, running out of fuel. He said that promise deliveries, the IDF delivering some food for the people. He said about 7,000, including patients still in the hospital, displaced people there as well, 650 children. I think they said many, many children still in the hospital. The amount of food he said that's arriving is insufficient for them. He described the situation where there is no water, and no electricity, and some main buildings inside the hospital there, Jake. But I think as you can hear, the fighting is not just around the Al- Shifa hospital, which is probably about six miles in this direction. It's way up in the north end of Gaza as well tonight.",

This is what he told me.

And yesterday, we were told that we would not see your mother and grandmother again. What keeps us going is our family, a big, close knit family.

So that must be just a little inland of western, northwestern part of Gaza.So, our estimation, this balcony I'm standing, shaking  right now, our estimation, is these towns and villages in the northern area of Gaza, sort of down to the al-Shati refugee camp, which is a few miles north of Gaza City, where we know the truths are in, we know there and Gaza City. We know they have controlled deep -- five miles into Gaza, way south, way to the left, as you look at these pictures, way south of where you're seeing these explosions now, just a couple of days ago.

In addition to fuel trucks, there is also another statement about allowing, at a lower level officials saying allowing unlimited numbers of humanitarian trucks to come in, as long as the U.N. provided those lists.So maybe, you know, as they continue this ground offensive, and it stepped up, they will have to let the pressure also, the pressure valve off a little bit more, in terms of allowing humanitarian aid, in terms of creating this balance, in these negotiations for the hostage releases.",

A source confirms to CNN that another one of Adams aides had her home raided by the FBI as well. This is \"The New York Times\" is identifying a former Turkish airlines official, whose home was also searched.CNN's Brynn Gingras is here. And, Brynn, this makes three people with ties to Mayor Adams, whose homes have been raided. First we know of is Adams' chief fundraiser, Brianna Suggs, who are the other two?",

      "sentences": "Yeah. Well, if you remember, our teams reported that on that day, November 2nd, a dozen people's homes were searched. Adams was asked about this earlier this week when he held a news conference, and it wouldn't give any details. So, it's no surprise some of these names are starting to trickle out.But the answer to your question, one of those names is Rana Abbasova. Now, she works in the administration's international affairs office as a director. And she also has been without him since he was mayor, when he was Brooklyn borough president. In this role, she sort of acts as a liaison between foreign dignitaries, does the vetting process and so, she -- you know, there's questions at sort of what sort of relationships she has made while in his administration. Now, Jake, if you're one of those people who are following this story closely, you may remember, when this investigation came to light not too long ago, there was, you know, a statement that was put out by the mayor's office saying someone had acted inappropriately in their office. That is her. She apparently got wind about this happening to her. She was nervous she was going to be part of this investigation. She was put only from this office. So, that is higher. The second person is Cenk Ocal. Now, he worked as you mentioned, for Turkish Airlines. He was also part of the mayor's transition team when he came into being mayor of New York City. Now, all of this circles, all the leaves to Turkey, that is what we know from sources, federal investigators are looking into the mayor, and his campaign's relationships with Turkey officials in Turkey, and also Turkish American officials here, whether or not he was receiving illegal funds through his campaign, and whether or not he was currying favors for Turkish officials, when it comes to the opening of the Turkish consulate here in New York City. Now, when he had this news conference on Monday, he did address some of these allegations, no one has been accused of wrongdoing, it's very important to point that out. But he did address some of these questions. I want you to hear some of that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR ERIC ADAMS (D), NEW YORK:  I did not speak to any of the individuals in the FDNY. I did not circumvent the commissioner, the commissioner was the person that I asked. Can you look into this? And that was all I spoke with. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But as far as campaign donations that he has received, are allegedly -- which is being investigated, he says there are no straw donors in his administration, no quid pro. So, he's addressed these questions.However, he hasn't really given enough answers, a lot of what he's saying, we're cooperating with the investigation. So, we're seeing what this leads, no surprise that we're hearing about these names coming out though.",
