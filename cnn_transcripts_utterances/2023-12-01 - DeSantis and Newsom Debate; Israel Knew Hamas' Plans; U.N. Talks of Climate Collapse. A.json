I think there are a lot of Democrats who feel like they don't have a strong voice. They believe in the message, they believe in what the administration has accomplished, but the people who are out front, Biden and Harris, aren't doing the best job of messaging.

David, it's stunning to read both the \"Haaretz\" report, your colleague's report last night, the scale of the reporting that went into \"The Times\" piece.

They just didn't believe that Hamas was capable of pulling off something of this nature. We don't know whether it got briefed up to Prime Minister Netanyahu. We don't know how high those briefings got. But the plan that they had is clearly the plan that was executed. And it then raises the question, had Israel responded differently, had it moved troops down to there, had it reinforced these areas and the technology that the - that Hamas was able to take out, the censor systems, the automated weapons and so forth, had they done that, they might have been able to prevent this entire thing from starting and thus prevent the war and the retribution from happening.",

It is almost an identical blueprint to what is mapped out here and what they had prior written down. But that warning was completely brushed off by a colonel in the Gaza division.Yes, we don't know how high this went up, but the fact that it apparently went to a colonel who completely dismissed it, what does that tell you about how now they are operating in this offensive? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes, Poppy, that's one of the things that's kind of critical here. You've got to be careful about middle management in all of these situations. And, you know, when it comes to disregarding these kinds of warnings, it's always a bit of a black eye for the intelligence community. The collection here worked beautifully. The problem that you have is the analytical part in this particular case. So, it was a failure of imagination. And that failure of imagination, in essence what people tend to do is they tend to mirror image what they're themselves thinking or feeling or believing is possible onto the adversary. And in this particular case, that can have really fatal consequences. So, as far as what's happening right now, it, you know, makes the Israeli intelligence services work doubly hard to get things right. But they still have to be very careful not to mirror image the kinds of things that they expect Hamas to do. They have to make sure that they understand what is possible, even aspirational, and act as if the aspirational might actually become reality.",
