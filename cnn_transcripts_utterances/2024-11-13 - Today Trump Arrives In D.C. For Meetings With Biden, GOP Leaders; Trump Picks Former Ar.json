The two men in the same room -- once Trump gets there, of course -- for the first time since the CNN debate back in June.And it's not just that. While in Washington the president-elect is also going to be meeting with Republicans on Capitol Hill. In the -- in the Senate, Republicans are facing a new day. After the leadership vote there this morning it's going to be the first time that Mitch McConnell will not be the party's leader in the Senate in 18 years. The race to be the new Republican Senate leader is down to three -- these three men -- two Johns and a Rick. CNN's MJ Lee is at the White House. CNN's Lauren Fox is on the Hill. Lauren, let me start with you. What are you expecting from Donald Trump and his visits today?",

You can expect this to be a warm reception. That is, in part, because some of his staunchest allies have been in the House Republican Conference.In fact, yesterday at a Republican leadership press conference, you heard Speaker Mike Johnson say that he is actually going to go down to Mar-a-Lago this weekend to spend time with the president to discuss what agenda he wants to move forward when January comes. This is going to be a big day for new leadership on Capitol Hill though because in the United States Senate, starting at 9:30 a.m. this morning, you're going to see this first race for a new Republican leader in nearly 20 years -- two decades. Mitch McConnell stepping aside. That now is clearing the way for either John Thune, Rick Scott, of John Cornyn to take that mantle. And despite the fact that Rick Scott is getting a late surge of MAGA support it is really unknown who is going to win this race. That's because it's all going to happen behind closed doors by secret ballot. And despite the fact that so many of Trump's allies in the MAGA world have started getting behind Rick Scott, the underscoring reality is that Republicans that I was talking to last night on Capitol Hill made clear this is an internal Republican leadership election. Any one of these candidates is going to be able to work with the incoming president, Donald Trump, and they are arguing that therefore, it should be Republican senators who make this final decision -- Kate.",

That almost never does it. Why not charge the agencies with doing this themselves? And it's hard for Elon Musk to say he's an outsider when he stood on stage with Donald Trump more frequently than Melania Trump stood with him on stage.
