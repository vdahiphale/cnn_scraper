      "sentences": "And a warm welcome everyone. I'm Paula Newton in New York. Ahead right here on CNN Newsroom, Ukraine calls a deadly Russian missile strike on a public market a wicked and brazen act of terrorism. A manhunt is underway for a terror suspect to escape from a London prison while dressed as a chef. And the U.S. wants to know how an advanced microchip ended up in a Chinese smartphone despite sweeping efforts to keep such technology out of Russia's hands.The audacity of evil and utter inhumanity is how the Ukrainian president is describing a deadly strike on an open market area in the Donetsk region. You'll see it here, the surveillance video showing the explosion that killed at least 17 people and wounded dozens more. Everyday people just going about their day. The U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Ukraine says it's another example of the suffering Russia's invasion inflicts on civilians. Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russian terrorists destroyed shops, a pharmacy, and people who were just doing nothing wrong. The attack came as the Ukrainian counter-offensive moves into its fourth month now, and as the top U.S. diplomat began his third visit to Kyiv since the start of the Russian invasion. Antony Blinken announced a new infusion of aid worth more than a billion dollars. CNN's Melissa Bell reports from Kyiv. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MELISSA BELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The moment a peaceful market was flattened. The CCTV footage posted by the Ukrainian president, even as he prepared to meet with Washington's top diplomat. The Russian missile killed at least 17 people, including a child, in an industrial town just 19 miles from Bakhmut. VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  We know that area very well. We understand that they delivered a deliberate strike. BELL (through translator):  One of the deadliest attacks in months came just hours after the Kremlin warned that the United States was intent on keeping the war going until the last Ukrainian. UNKNOWN (through translator):  They are essentially going to continue to keep Ukraine in a state of war and wage and continue this war until the last Ukrainian without sparing any money for it. BELL (through translator):  Moscow's reaction as Secretary of State Blinken arrived in Kyiv, his third visit to the city since the war began.",

We've been seeing them recapture Robotyne and then some areas to the south, as well. They've been continuing making some gains, some gradual gains, albeit but some gains nonetheless.And this is difficult terrain as we've been discussing. This is areas that are heavily fortified, heavily defended by the Russians. They've built these trenches over months, really, and they have the air support above, as well. Ukraine, really, has not had the upper hand in this area and yet they have made these gains, made these successes. And this is why there is this confidence, this new energy here that they are making these gains and what will this now lead to? Is this the turning point? And really this new defense minister that you mentioned, Rustam Umarov, reflects this new energy as well. There's new leadership taking this counter-offensive into the next stage and he's mentioned already, Rustam Umarov that he's going to vow to take every centimeter back from the Russians that they've taken from the Ukrainians. That is the level of ambition here, really. But it's notable, as well, he's mentioned, that he also vows to take back all the civilians, all the captives from the Russians and that is referring of course to the prisoners of war, the children and the civilians that have been taken into Russian territory during this conflict.

One of the key features that has come out already and caused controversy, the Russians already reacting to it, are these depleted uranium tank ammunition. You can see on your screen there. This is controversial because they are slightly radioactive.Now, the U.S. insists they are not radioactive to a level that would cause any kind of civilian harm and they are perfectly safe to use in this conflict. Of course, Russia disputes this. They've called this already, the ministry --the foreign ministry coming out this morning saying this is an escalatory step by the United States and that this is a criminal act. Now, this kind of language used by the Russians against the United States in this conflict is something we've seen before and perhaps unsurprising given that this kind of assistance to the Ukrainians is crucial at this point for continuing to build and sustain momentum. That is according to Secretary Blinken and that is, of course, any kind of assistance, something that is going to be very concerning to the Russian side.",

CNN couldn't independently verify these images. For more than 50 years, Omar Bango and his son Ali Bango ran this oil-rich nation. Much of their wealth was kept in France. Most Gabonese, young and old, had only known the rule of the Bongo family and its cronies. So, for them, the military coup in the short term looks much better than anything that they've been living through. And one can understand that boost of immediate support.

Very significant increase upon the already massive levels of donations coming from the United States and others, but the Americans are way ahead in terms of their support for the Ukrainian war effort.But the critics in the United States are pointing to these very small yellow and white dots here on the map. These are the very small incremental gains that the Ukrainians have been making. Now, their critics are saying they're not getting through the Russian front lines hard enough or fast enough. The Ukrainians are response to that, and indeed more sensible voices, frankly, within NATO, are saying, well, this whole front line here has been a long anticipated, and indeed all of this stuff down in the South too. The Russians have had plenty of time, many months to reinforce. They've got at least three lines of defense in some areas, possibly five, that includes minefields, tank traps. It's now up to infantry to infiltrate these areas, clear the mines by hand, and then get that armor that the United States and others have been donating into the battle space. This is going to be where the concentration at the moment of the future operations of the Ukrainians are likely to be, and that is because they want to expand this area so they can use that as a bridgehead to go forward into Crimea and indeed cut the Russian supply lines to the east and west. But the Russians get a vote in this. If we take a look at what's going on the eastern front, we'll be able to see much more closely first of all where these Russian gains have been made, but also where the Ukrainians have been pushing them back, particularly here south of Bakhmut. But of course, just in the last 24 hours, the Russians have struck back, killing a large number of civilians and others here in Kostiantynivka in a missile attack with at least 16 killed, more than 20 injured. Now, that is part of the steady state of this war. The constant attacks on civilians behind the front lines is part of the Russian effort to try to drain the energy out of the Ukrainian war effort. [03:35:012] Now, of course, the new Ukrainian commander is saying that every single inch of Ukrainian territory, as far as they're concerned, will be liberated as part of that campaign. But again, the Russians are counterattacking, particularly here up near Kupiansk and all along this northern front here. They've actually made some minor gains there, the Russians have, but they've been assaulting with very severe and heavy numbers of armor, tanks in particular being put to use there. They are being held by the Ukrainians, but all of this is adding up to a degree of frustration among the Ukrainians, allies in the West, very often derived from a lack of understanding of what this battle space really is like. A0nd speaking of somebody who's been on the ground here, the NATO doctrine is you need three to one advantage in terms of troops from the Ukrainian perspective. Indeed, the troop numbers are actually the other way around. So, any kind of Ukrainian advance under those circumstances particularly without air cover and they have none so far is nothing short of something close to a miracle.",

Now, India's foreign minister is downplaying the absence of Russia and China's leaders at the G20 meeting. And although Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping will be skipping the summit, other G20 leaders are expected to be there, and that includes U.S. President Joe Biden. He'll be meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Biden's trip to India comes on the heels of Modi's state visit to Washington in June when Biden called the U.S.-India relationship, quote, \"one of the defining relationships of the 21st century.\" Joining me now is Josh Lipsky, a senior director of the Atlantic Council's Geoeconomics Center. And thanks so much for joining us in this lead up to this G20 meeting. You know, you argue that Xi not going to this summit changes the very character of the gathering and possibly jeopardizes its effectiveness. Why? JOSH LIPSKY, SENIOR DIRECTOR, ATLANTIC COUNCIL'S GEOECONOMICS CENTER: It's a very significant decision for President Xi to not attend. Not only is it his first time skipping a G20 summit, it's the first time any Chinese leader has skipped a G20 summit since it became a leader summit in 2008. So, Xi and his predecessor, Hu Jintao, had attended every summit. And it goes beyond just India's G20 presidency. I think it speaks to what China believes is the future of the G20 and whether they are deeply invested in that future. And that's why I think it raises so many questions. This is incredibly important coordinating body, one of the most important in the world. If the world's second largest economy is changing its posture towards it, we all need to take note of that.",

So, the BRICS nations are hosting the G20. Being inside that room, and let's be clear, China will still be there, the premier will be there, it's just Xi, the president who's not there.But China could do a lot more by influencing that conversation from the inside than trying to weaken it by not having Xi attend. So, it could be a strategic mistake, but the U.S. and others have to capitalize on that opportunity. They have to bring a lot of these emerging markets around the table, and there's a lot of divisions around those tables, even with Russia and China not represented by their leaders.",

After the two leaders spoke by phone Wednesday, the leaders cheered their cooperation one day after they announced they would expand those production cuts through the end of the year. Now that move, as Goldman Sachs warns, oil prices could climb then to triple-digit territory by next year if Russia and Saudi Arabia don't unwind their supply cuts.Now the bank had forecast Brent oil to be $93 at the end of 2024. Now it expects Saudi oil supply to be about 500,000 barrels per day smaller than previously anticipated. And analysts say if cuts are kept in place and Saudi Arabia only gradually raises production, Brent oil prices could climb to $107 a barrel by December of next year. They are currently now, as you see it there, standing at about $90 and 87 respectively, off a little bit so far in trade, but these are some of the highest prices we've seen in 2023.

Last quarter, nearly a fifth of Apple's revenue came from China. It's also a manufacturing center. We've seen a lot of back and forth between these two economic forces in recent months. As we reported last June, some Chinese ministers banned Tesla's from entering their premises over security fears. And looking back to November 2022, the Biden administration banned approvals of equipment from Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE over security concerns.
