That's what I talked to one advisor about today. Now, we do expect him to dive in on the economy, to talk about how the economy was better when he was president. But I do want to note that union members, union leaders, as well as labor experts have pointed to the fact that Trump's administration was inherently pro-business and not pro-labor, which is why you're seeing so many of these groups come out against former President Trump. But I am told by members of the union, of the A - UW union, that they will be at Trump's event tomorrow with their families, hearing what he has to say. Many of them say they still stand with former President Trump. And when I talked to Trump's advisors, they do believe that there is a way to maneuver Biden's policies, and I thought this was really interesting hearing Arlette talk about this, with the electric vehicles. [15:10:03] Essentially, that they believe that auto workers are not fond of these policies, and they think they can paint them as a way to move jobs overseas that will kill jobs here in Detroit and so that is what they're trying to sell. Now, again, the one thing I really want to point out here is that Trump won over this group in 2016, working class voters, as well as union members, in huge numbers Republicans hadn't seen in years. But he now has a past. He now has an administration and a record. And whether or not he can do that again, as his people say they can, that remains to be seen, Brianna.",

And I think it will do him some good. The challenge he faces, though, Boris, is as you suggested and some of the earlier commentary suggested, is that workers don't only decide who is on their side anymore by economic interest. They also make that decision based on cultural values. And the fact is that if you look at the exit polls among non-college whites who belong to unions, Donald Trump won about three fifths of them in 2020, and Republicans won about three fifths of them in the 2022 election. Now, Democrats did better with them in Michigan specifically. But even there, it was only about 50-50. So Democrats don't need to run up the score with these voters in order to be competitive in those key Rust Belt states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. They do need to remain competitive and you saw that - you saw where Biden was putting his chips today on economic solidarity at a time when cultural issues have pulled many of those same voters toward the GOP.",

Even if inflation is slowing down, it doesn't mean prices are going back down. And there is a strong sense among Americans that things are more expensive, the necessity of daily life than they were when Biden took office.On the other hand, Michigan will be a really interesting test case, Brianna, because the Big 3 bills that Biden's passed, the semiconductor bill, the infrastructure bill, and above all, the Inflation Reduction Act with the clean energy provisions, that's triggered over $500 billion in private investment in new plants and facilities since he took office, a boom in construction manufacturing. And while a lot of that has gone south, which is part of the reason for this UAW strike, the concern that the companies are using the EV transition to make a second transition toward a lower wage, non-union environment, Michigan is benefiting significantly. So this will be a real test case of whether the new jobs and new factories that the Biden agenda can credibly claim credit for inspiring can ameliorate any of that endemic concern about prices, which is real, is not going away and is a big cloud in front of all the other good news on the economy that he's been able to tout.",
