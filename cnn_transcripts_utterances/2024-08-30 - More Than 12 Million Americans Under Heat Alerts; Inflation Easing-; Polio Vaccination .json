The region was free of the highly contagious virus for 25 years, until the war broke out.Let's bring in CNN international diplomatic editor Nic Robertson. He joins me live from Jerusalem. Nic, the logistics on this have to be extremely complicated. How is this actually going to be put into place?",

      "sentences": "Yes, very, very complicated.The U.N. originally wanted a seven-day complete pause in violence all the way across Gaza, so it could implement this. What the Israeli government and Hamas agreed to was a three-phase approach. They would do the center phase first, then -- the center of Gaza first. Then the south, there would be a pause, and then the north, there would be a pause. So each of those three phases, three areas, they will get three days of pause in those areas. But each day, the pause actually only lasts from 6:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., so seven hours. They're targeting 640,000 children under the age of 10. They have got to vaccinate 90 percent of them to be effective. So if you just run the numbers pretty quickly there, if you have got nine days of vaccination across these three days, three different phases of seven hours a day, you have got 63 hours of vaccination time, 640,000 children to vaccinate. That's about 10,000 children to vaccinate an hour. This is in the middle of a war zone where people can't move around easily or afraid to move. And there's always a chance that the war or some part of it, some bit of conflict could spark up somewhere near one of these vaccination centers. So it is fraught. It is difficult, but because polo is now in existence in Gaza, one child, 10-month-old child now has a paralyzed left leg because of polio, the real threat is there, not just for the kids in Gaza, for the IDF troops in Gaza, they're also getting vaccinated,but for the whole region, this could spread. And that's why, although this is a massive challenge, it'll have to be repeated in four weeks because there's a second dose, although it's a massive challenge and not what the U.N. wanted, this is what they're going to go for. And it begins on Sunday.",

      "sentences": "It has been effective in American history.Franklin Roosevelt ran on The New Deal. Of course, he was running at a time of economic collapse, and he was running against an incumbent. But he didn't actually say what The New Deal was. Indeed, his ideas about what a New Deal should be in 1932 were very -- would be very different by the time it was 1934 or 1935. John F. Kennedy ran promising to make the country move again. Well, how vague is that? He ran a vibes campaign for the most part in 1960. Richard Nixon in 1968 promised to end the war in Vietnam, but didn't say how he would do it. He said he had a secret plan. He was as vague as he could be, again, saying:  I'm different from the people in power. I'm different from LBJ. In 2008, Barack Obama promised change. He did promise some policy changes, of course, but he was basically saying, we have had enough with the Bush administration. We have had enough with its wars. So, historically, a vibes campaign can be very effective, a campaign that is light on policy can be effective. The challenge, of course, for Vice President Harris is that she's actually in the administration at the moment. So, she is going to have to tighten how she explains balancing the green economy with old economy jobs that you don't want to go away. She has to explain a little bit better how she's going to approach the border issue and why it took three years to implement that executive order. What she has on her side is that she was -- she's vice president. Vice presidents don't make those decisions. It would be OK if she opened up a little daylight between her and Joe Biden.",

Some people are calling for a half-percentage point. We will get some more data between now and then. We will get another jobs report, for example. So never say never.

But somebody was asking me about this the other day, and it occurred to me that people who have lived in a perpetually low interest rate environment for a very long time until the last year might not always understand the answer.When they start cutting rates, what actually happens for consumers? What are people going to see that will change?",

      "sentences": "So, lots of different loans and other financial products are benchmarked against this interest rate that we have been talking about, the Fed funds rate, meaning that that's sort of the starting point, and then everybody sets their rates off of that, banks and other lenders.So that would mean essentially that, once the Fed starts cutting interest rates, you will start seeing credit card rates, auto loans, mortgages, those interest rates for those products fall. In fact, we have already seen some of that happen because these institutions are relatively forward-looking. They're expecting the rate cuts to happen. So, for example, mortgage rates have been falling, I think, more or less since April. So some of that is already baked in. But as the Fed continues to cut rates, you will see that filter throughout the economy as more and more financial institutions start to say, OK, credit is cheaper for us. We can make credit a little bit cheaper for our customers. And, therefore, they will bring mortgage rates down. Now, to be clear, I don't think we are going to get back to the zero percent Fed funds rate that we saw a few years ago, any time soon. I think that there are a lot of consumers out there, borrowers, who kind of got used to this idea that we would have really low interest rates for an extended period of time, potentially forever. We saw that following the financial crisis. We saw that following the pandemic. And those were really unusual circumstances. So just because the Fed is cutting rates doesn't mean that we should bank on, for example, mortgage rates going back to 2 percent or 3 percent, which was extraordinarily low, for a while. They will probably go down, but they're not going to be quite as cheap as they were during those unusual periods.",
