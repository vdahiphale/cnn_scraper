      "sentences": "How long will the honeymoon last? I'm Michael Smerconish in Philadelphia. Vice President Kamala Harris has been on a roll. Democrats are enthused. The money is rolling in, a record $310 million in the month of July alone. And poll show Harris outpacing President Biden's previous numbers. She's now running even with Donald Trump.Yesterday she officially secured enough delegates to lock up the Democratic presidential nomination. The launch has been flawless but choreographed and careful to avoid unscripted moments. But there are intangibles on the horizon. Last Wednesday, a Hamas leader was executed in Tehran, presumably by Israel. In response to the attack of October 7. Iran Supreme Leader has vowed revenge and the world awaits the next move. This on top of an expectation that Lebanon will respond after Israel killed that Hezbollah leader on Tuesday in Beirut. No wonder the New York Times Thomas Friedman just wrote that, \"If the tit-for-tat conflict between Israel and Iran and Iran's proxies escalates, President Biden and Vice President Harris by extension might face the fateful decision of whether the U.S. goes to war with Iran alongside Israel. Yesterday brought a disappointing jobs report, which fueled fears that the economy is weakening. Unemployment climbed to 4.3% and on Friday, the Dow closed down more than 600 points. Within the next 48 hours, the Vice President will announce her most important campaign decision, her running mate. The tool then barnstormed the battleground states starting Tuesday in Pennsylvania. Many pundits and the betting markets think that Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro is the favorite. That Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker released a video yesterday touting Harris and Shapiro only fueled perception that it's a done deal. Late Friday, Trump announced on Truth Social that he will no longer participate in an ABC debate but would agree to debate Harris on September for an event moderated by Fox News anchors Bret Baier and Martha McCallum at a to-be-determined location in Pennsylvania. He's asking for a live audience. It's unclear if Harris has agreed to those terms. Meanwhile, Donald Trump's week was defined by an appearance that he made before the National Association of Black Journalists where he volunteered that he's not sure whether Vice President Harris is Indian or black. It wasn't a hot mic. He chose to go there. He said quote, \"She was Indian all the way and then all of a sudden she made a turn and she became a black person.\" Why would he have said that? I have two theories. First, distraction. Harris's rollout has gone so well that he wanted to take control of the news cycle, even if he had to do so with a negative story. Second, because he was narrowcasting in the black community last week before Trump appeared at the NABJ Joe D. A Harrisburg Pennsylvania CBS network anchor went to a central Pennsylvania barbershop seeking some candid conversation among the revelations that some of the black men that he interviewed did not regard Harris as black.

He's probably irritated about that there was a delay in the programming. The questioner came out pretty hostile. If I was Trump, I would have said, Listen, guys, we're not going to agree on many things, maybe not even a 10 things. But let me just tell you here, I showed up here this morning, or this afternoon to take these questions that appear before you my opponent didn't.And let me just tell you a little bit about a few things that I did while President. Anybody in here attend HBCU? Show me your hands, right? I worked in a bipartisan fashion to provide historic funding for HBCUs. Where's Van Jones? Is he in the crowd? I worked with Van on the first step act to help release African American men from jail. How about did anybody collect the unemployment situation, the Afro- American community when I was president? Let's see show hands. I'm going to do that again. I think he had an -- he had, he has a record to run on, which is pretty strong in the African community.
