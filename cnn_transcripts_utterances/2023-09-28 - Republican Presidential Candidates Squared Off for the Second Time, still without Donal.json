The party's frontrunner Donald Trump was again not on the stage and that drew the ire of several White House hopefuls.Almost everyone blamed President Biden for something, the economy, crime, the border crisis, even the auto worker strike. There was also a lot of shouting and talking over each other as the candidates vied for attention. We have more now from CNN's Jeff Zeleny. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF U.S. AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: The Republican candidates tangled furiously during a two-hour debate Wednesday night here at the Reagan Library in Simi Valley, California. Time is clearly running out for many of these candidates to break through and emerge as a leading alternative to former President Donald Trump. That was clear from Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who early on in the debate directly confronted the former president. GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: And you know who else is missing in action? Donald Trump is missing in action. He should be on this stage tonight. He owes it to you to defend his record where they added 7.8 trillion to the debt that set the stage for the inflation that we have",

And look, in terms of anyone standing out from Trump, they all stood out from Trump because they stood on the stage. It was raucous. It was a lot of insults. It was a lot of interrupting.And all of them stood apart from Trump because the only one that came across looking better was probably Donald Trump. And he wasn't even there. Look, all of them, as we heard in Jeff's report, say that they went after Trump for many reasons, whether it was adding to the deficit as when he was president, whether it is evolving position on abortion, whether it is the fact that he did not show up on the stage. All of those attacks against Donald Trump, nothing really landed on him as them making the point that therefore they would be a better Republican nominee and therefore a better general election candidate than Donald Trump. And no one brought up the fact that he is facing four indictments, and no one brought up many of the legal issues that are currently facing Donald Trump, which in reality is a factor for the independent voters that haven't made up their mind on who they're going to vote for. So I feel like this was a missed opportunity for a lot of those on the debate stage because they didn't really land a direct hit on Donald Trump. All of them didn't go after.",

And I know I've spoken with many of them in the early states in Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina, and the pro-life cause that has hailed Donald Trump for what he has done for the life issue are very frustrated with him now that he is evolving on this issue, and they're ready to turn the page and find someone else.

They're going to stick by him, whether or not he shows up at the debate, whether or not he is indicted again, whether or not he is convicted in these indictments.His base will stand by him. And the more Donald Trump is out there making the case that he is a victim of what he calls a weaponized Department of Justice, and he is out there fighting for all Americans. He seems to be picking up support. He seems to be gaining in the numbers, and the rest of them continue to be 30, 40 points behind in these polls.

You know, granted this was a auto worker's strike, but Michigan is a battleground state and Donald Trump is working to get his message out, not just to middle class workers, but he really used the opportunity to talk about the environment and President Biden's policies with regard to energy and electrical vehicles and really use that to attack President Biden.And for the most part, Donald Trump is running a general election campaign against Joe Biden more so than our primary election against the Republican challengers.",

We need to winnow the field sooner, and we also need to unite behind one candidate because we cannot have a large fractured field outside of Donald Trump because that splits the vote.So, if any of these candidates were to decide that the best thing for not only the party, but for their own legacy, is to get out and put their support behind someone who has momentum, that would be the best thing for the party. But the problem and the reality is it's a numbers game. Right now, with Donald Trump with almost 50 percent of the vote, we need to really get all of the other candidates galvanized and united behind one candidate. And right now we're seeing head-to-head matchups who would be the best aside from Trump against Joe Biden and we're seeing polls that former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley is the best candidate in a head-to-head matchup with Joe Biden if the race were held today.",

As we have heard from U.S. officials since these events started to unravel, the prime focus immediately will be on his both physical and emotional health. He certainly will go through a physical exam at that military facility in Texas, but there will also be a focus on his state of mind.The Department of Defense has a very specific program that is operated at that military base helping people who may have been held captive, may have been held prisoner, basically assimilate and reintegrate, get used to everyday living once again. It has a very pronounced track record. It's something that Brittany Grenier was taken to when she was released from custody in Russia. Once all of that takes place, then the focus will be on some of the administrative issues, his legal status, his status with the military. It's very interesting to note that as we watch this release take place, we are getting almost contrasting explanations as to what happened. The North Korean government is calling this an expulsion that took place after an investigation. Yet when we listen to the United States and some of the remarks coming from the State Department, this being described as an intense diplomacy that involves help from the Swedish government as well as assistance from the Chinese government to help facilitate that release of Private King from North Korea over a bridge into China. There are still many lingering questions. Of course, investigators are going to want to talk to Private King. But one final point to make on this issue of concessions. Did the United States give in at all to perhaps sway or persuade North Korea to release him? The answer from the State Department has been a firm no. I want to read one particular quote from a senior official who said, the answer is simple, there were none, full stop.

North Korea, being very adamant that this was an expulsion that took place after an investigation. Yet if we listen to the United States Department, the State Department is saying that this was an intense diplomatic effort. It involved, of course, the United States, but giving a lot of credit to the Swedish government, even the Chinese government, for helping to facilitate this release from North Korea over a bridge into China, and then being greeted by the United States ambassador. One thing which is very clear, though, is the United States has been very adamant that no concessions were taking place.
