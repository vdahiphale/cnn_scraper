Was agreeing to events on the phone when he was talking to lawmakers without his team actually knowing. Was having the late-night phone calls with the old friends -- Chris Dodd, John Kerry -- checking in. And it was the first lady and his team that were trying to kind of rein things back in.I guess the question is that's -- it runs counter to the assumption I think you see sometimes from people that he's not with it. He doesn't have vigor. He isn't really kind of out there in a -- in a -- in a way that doesn't make him look 81 years old. And how does that translate, if that makes any sense? You know, if you look at this New York Times reporting that -- the new Sienna poll that just came out showing that he's actually losing young voters. And you make the point that this contributes to everything. Donald Trump winning young voters, which is a death knell for a Biden campaign if that turns into reality.

Because some of it is not just the number of events you do; it's how you look when you do the few events that you do do. And that's sort of where this tension is going.I mean, to your point, I think everyone that I've talked to on the team is really struck and think basically what Biden is doing at his age is extraordinary. I think the tension comes is that he does not understand that he cannot do as much as he did 10-15 years ago and is there a way that they can sort of rein him in in order to ensure that he is at the top of his game at all times. And that's sort of where this delicate dance goes into place where you basically need to tell the President of the United States you probably shouldn't do that event.",

How big a legal setback? Were you surprised? ELIE HONIG, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST, FORMER ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, FORMER FEDERAL AND NEW JERSEY STATE PROSECUTOR:  So, a very big setback for Mark Meadows -- not surprised. It turns out that trying to interfere with an election is not part of anyone's federal job description. Mark Meadows is not alone in making this argument. So we've now seen about a half-dozen or so people, including Donald Trump, in various contexts try to argue that well, what I was doing before January 6 was part of my job as president. As in Mark Meadows' case, chief of staff. As in Jeffrey Clark's case, part of the Justice Department. And they have all lost every one of these rulings across the board in state courts, here in federal courts. And it's really important to note about this Meadows decision. This was a three-judge panel of the famously conservative 11th Circuit. A unanimous 3-0 ruling. And the judge who wrote it that we just quoted, Judge Pryor, is a longtime staunch conservative. He actually was on Donald Trump's shortlist for Supreme Court. Donald Trump mentioned him by name as a potential Supreme Court justice.

There can be consequences. You could be sued if it's defamatory. If it's criminal you could be indicted. But what our courts are very, very hesitant to do is prevent somebody, whether it's a private individual, the media, from saying something in advance. That's what we call a prior restraint. It's a bedrock principle of our system that we are against -- we -- all of us. Our Constitution, our First Amendment do not go in for prior restraints except in the most extraordinary circumstances.

So they have to go through some protocols in those cases. The interesting difference between those and the swatting calls is the swatting calls came in by telephone, usually on voiceover IP where you couldn't capture the number. And the individual would call 911 or the Suicide Prevention Hotline and say I'm in this location and give the name of the Jewish institution, and say either I'm about to kill myself or I'm about to kill others -- which that's just going to generate a police response and likely, an evacuation.

A lot of consumers -- high-income households, middle-income households -- saved a lot of money during the pandemic -- the so-called excess saving. And that really has come in handy when inflation was really raging a year ago or two years ago. People could draw down the cash sitting in their deposit accounts and kind of supplement their income to maintain their purchasing power. And that's unique to the period. The other thing is I mentioned households locked in those very low rates that were enjoying two-three years ago. They did a really marvelous job of getting their mortgage rates down and now they're reaping benefits from that. So we have to be careful about drawing too many strong conclusions here. I think a lot of it goes to the circumstances that we're in.",
