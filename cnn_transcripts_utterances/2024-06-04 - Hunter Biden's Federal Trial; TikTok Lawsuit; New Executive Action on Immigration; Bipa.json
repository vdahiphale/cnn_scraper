The company is fighting back. We're following these major developing stories and many more, all coming in right here to CNN News Central. We are following breaking news.Any moment now, President Biden is set to unveil a new executive action that will dramatically curb the flow of illegal migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border between legal ports of entry. And the sweeping measure would effectively shut down the southern border in those places to asylum seekers, once unlawful crossings hit a daily average of 2,500. It's the president's most aggressive attempt to address the border crisis, an issue that has long been one of his biggest political vulnerabilities. And he's making this announcement just weeks before his first debate with former President Donald Trump. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is live now at the White House for us. Priscilla, the president is expected to speak any minute now. We're keeping our eye out for that. Tell us more about what we're expecting to hear.",

      "sentences": "Well, we expect him to take on the criticism that he has received about the handling of the U.S.-Mexico border, addressing it head on by taking this executive action that is very similar to one that former President Donald Trump took.Now, as to what it does, it shuts off asylum for migrants who are seeking asylum and have crossed between ports of entry, therefore have crossed unlawfully. It also would allow them to be turned back to Mexico or to their origin country, and it would exempt unaccompanied minors. This is a measure that could be turned on and off depending on the daily threshold of illegal crossings. Now, the president is expected to be flanked by some border mayors as well as by Democratic lawmakers who are supportive of this measure. But it's certainly not supported by all of them. In fact, we have seen over the course of the day some fierce backlash from progressives who say this is far too similar to what Donald Trump tried to do. But the president has repeatedly defended his actions on immigration and called on Congress to do more. If you recall, there was that bipartisan border bill that failed earlier this year, and the president repeatedly hammered Congress on that. So we anticipate we'll hear more of that in his remarks today. But there is no doubt, Brianna that this is a dramatic and drastic measure for Joe Biden, who in 2019 was saying that the former president shouldn't be clamping down on asylum seekers, that the United States was a refuge to those migrants. And today, he is taking an action to clamp down on those same asylum seekers. So it is certainly a significant policy shift for this White House, which over the years has repeatedly grappled with border crisis.",

      "sentences": "A source tells me that the president is expected to connect with Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. Senior administration officials have repeatedly said that this executive action really does also hinge on cooperation from Mexico. And we have seen that time and again as well between the U.S. and Mexico. Recently, Mexico stepped up their own interior enforcement, which helped them significantly in driving down the number of crossings at the U.S. southern border. Mexico has also agreed to take back certain nationalities other than Mexicans, Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, Venezuelans back to Mexico to, again, help alleviate the situation and create a mechanism of consequence for the U.S. So this is going to be very- it's going to be necessary to, have Mexico buy into this executive action for it to be implemented in the way that senior administration officials want to see it done.There needs to be, as they put it, consequence to people crossing the border illegally. But the only way to do that is if Mexico cooperates and those countries of origin cooperate with the U.S. So this is certainly not an easy task. It has been a challenge for this administration from the very beginning. So this is going to be an important call between the two presidents to discuss this executive action and, again, how Mexico intends to cooperate. Remember, Brianna, Mexico just had its presidential election over the weekend. So they're going to be in a time of transition as well. And I was told early on that part of the calculus and when this was going to be released, this executive action, was after Mexico's election. So all of that really coming together in this moment for this announcement by President Biden.",

      "sentences": "Well, Brianna, reaction is coming in fast and furious. Let me start with the top executive of Hidalgo County here where I am. This official saying that he's happy that this executive action is being issued today. And he says that he, like many other officials on the border, had been asking for some sort of reprieve, some sort of action by the administration that would deal with the immigration issue that we're and also protect the cross- border trade, which a lot of these towns along the border depend on. And so he says that he's happy about that, but he says that this executive order is a Band-Aid. Let me read to you a portion of his statement when he says, quote, But once again, we should note that the solution is but a mere Band-Aid in terms of solving this problem. Comprehensive immigration reform remains the sole solution, and Congress remains the sole venue to achieve this reform.Doctors Without Borders also very concerned about this executive action. I've interviewed them across the border in Reynosa, the port of entry that you see behind me. I've interviewed women who have been raped, extorted on the Mexican side while they wait for their immigration process on the U.S. side to happen. They are very concerned about this, about how this could put migrants in a very vulnerable situation. Doctors Without Borders issuing a statement saying in part, quote, today's decision will trap vulnerable people. Including young families in insecure cities in Mexico and put them in grave danger. I talked to an immigration official in Mexico who confirmed this. They are concerned that a closure of the border on the U.S. side could put a lot of pressure on the Mexican cities along the border because they have limited capacity for migrant shelters. And they're concerned that in a few days those could go over capacity. Now, the ACLU saying that they plan to sue the Biden administration. Here's what they said in a short statement saying, quote, We intend to challenge this order in court. It was illegal when Trump did it and it is no less illegal now. Now, what would the Biden administration say to all of this criticism that is coming in to our newsroom? They would say that this executive order is legal. That the Department of Justice is ready to defend it in court. That they are following all international conventions and protocols. And that there are humanitarian exceptions to this rule that would bar, in essence, asylum on the border. That there are humanitarian exceptions for unaccompanied migrant children, for certain medical conditions, and also for severe victims of human trafficking. Now, big picture, Brianna, what the administration appears to be doing here is imposing legal consequences to the illegal entry into the United States. We've heard them say that before. And this just puts it right front and center. I mentioned to you before, I mean, this is really border security on steroids happening very quickly, removing migrants very quickly if they have no legal basis to stay in the United States. Brianna.

He served as acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, ICE, under President Obama. John, thanks so much for being here with us. We know about how the Biden administration is talking about how it's using this authority that President Trump actually used for some of his policies, like the Muslim ban. How do you see the Biden administration hanging this order on that authority?",

Now, look, there's still some details we haven't seen yet, but based on all the information the White House has put thus far, they've tried to more narrowly tailor this in a way and I think they're thinking about the courts when they did that. Remember, not just, Trump didn't just try to use this authority for the Muslim ban, but also in 2018, he did try to use a very similar approach at the border to restrict asylum for people who would legally cross between the ports of entry. So, look, I think at the end of the day, in that case, the Ninth Circuit str down Trump's effort and ultimately it failed. I think the Biden administration had that in mind, but it remains to be seen what happens in the courts. Clearly, there will be serious legal challenges to this.",

I mean, this will allow the administration to close the border when you hit a pretty low threshold of 2,500 in a day, and then it'll be closed for a set period of time. Right now, we're doing about a hundred, even with the reduced flows we see right now, we're doing over a hundred thousand asylum claims a month, right. So, this will make a significant impact. But long term, as I think some of the folks have already said, this is not going to get solved really until we have congressional action. I know this is a cliche in Washington, you know, and the Democrats always say, hey, we need Congress to act. But the reality is we have a backlog of millions of cases in the immigration courts. We have Border Patrol agents who are strained at their capacity, ICE agents who are strained at their capacity. And the effectiveness of everything we're trying to do at the border hinges on us surging resources there.Politically, I mean, really, and also this is no surprise. This is the first time we've seen this. This has been going on for 10 years now. This is a problem that everyone's trying to blame each other. But it was existed during the Trump administration. It's existed during the Biden administration. We collectively have failed to act. It's that failure that we're paying the price for now. This is going to help, but it's not going to solve everything.",

And in this last February, they had this bipartisan deal that was really the most comprehensive thing they'd seen in a very long time that President Trump told Republicans to bounce. And that's what happened. That being said, and John, in part because he wants to make immigration a big part of this race. So to that point, there is a take that President Biden is doing what he's doing today because he has a debate coming up in a few weeks, because Trump is going to push him on this over the next several months, because Americans care about it. That it is a political act. Do you think that's fair?",

There's no denying that anymore. Now, we have hundreds of thousands of people coming in monthly. We have completely overwhelmed our immigration courts. The president did go to Congress and say we need resources to fund those immigration courts so we can process the claims. We need resources for the border patrol agents who really are breaking under the strain of this as it's been going on, as I said, for eight to ten years. Congress refused to act. You know, I'm not saying that that bill was the greatest bill. I'm not saying that today's actions-I mean, there's progressives who are very upset about the fact that the United States for the first time is saying that people who are fleeing persecution may not have an opportunity to seek refuge in the United States. These are serious consequences, right? It's a serious reversal. But the bottom line is there is efforts to make with Congress. Congress has refused to act and the president's left no choice.",
