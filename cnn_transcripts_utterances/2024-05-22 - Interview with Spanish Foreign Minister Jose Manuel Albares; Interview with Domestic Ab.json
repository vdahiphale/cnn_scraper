In New York, a former model has filed a new complaint against Sean Diddy Coombs saying that he drugged and sexually assaulted her back in 2003. This after CNN accessed the sickening video of the musician abusing his then girlfriend, Cassie Ventura. He had denied it for years. And we will not show that video of her being attacked, but you can see him, Combs, here in this short clip, chasing her with a towel wrapped around his waist. Now, we've been scouring the press reaction to the assault and to this video ever since it was released last week, and very little of it has been focused on the actual women at the center of this, the victims. Instead, it's been on the business and the career and the future of Sean Combs. Worldwide, one in three women have experienced some form of physical or sexual violence, and women of color suffer the most. Intimate partner violence, as it's called, is the key contributor to the higher rate of deaths compared to white women. And I want to discuss all of this with my distinguished panel tonight. There's Gloria Allred, she is the renowned women's rights attorney, and she's joining us from Los Angeles. Survivor and advocate Lejla Dauti here right with me in London. And April Hernandez-Castillo joining me from New York. Lejla, I mangled your last name. Please correct it for me.",

Where do I go now? Who do I turn to now? And there was just nothing. And it wasn't even that the support was lacking in quality, it just didn't exist at all. And it was very much a moment where I thought I was desperate to find women somewhere who were just like me, who had experience without experience, which is why I turned to social media and started sharing stories on behalf of the women in the community.

It just wants to destroy you. And really, it doesn't matter who you are, it can affect anyone. And, you know, I grew up with a mother and a father who loved on me, who set the foundation for me.

So, we have to empower her. And that's important.

So, Aisha Beliso-De Jesus is the co-founder of Princeton's Center on Transnational Policing, and her new book, \"Excited Delirium,\" explores the medical term that has long been used as a scapegoat for police misconduct. Like in the George Floyd case, whose murder by police four years ago this weekend sparked outrage. The author and academic speaks to Michel Martin about how legislators are now dealing with this invented disease. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "OK. So, again, I think that's where a lot of those of us who live in the general public heard about this term, because it was in fact citedin Derek Chauvin's legal defense. This, of course, is, you know, one of the four officers. He was the one most heavily implicated in the death of George Floyd. During his trial a Minneapolis police officer who trains others in medical care testified that recognizing signs of excited delirium is part of the training for new officers. But your reporting indicates that this is made up. This is -- this stuff doesn't even exist. So, tell me how you came to that conclusion. BELISO-DE JESUS:  I think it's important to note that, similar to George Floyd, the majority and almost all of the people who are considered or labeled excited delirium syndrome are actually killed during police interactions, right? They almost always involve some type of police use of force such as hog tying people, applying carotid chokeholds, kneeling on people's bodies, as we saw with George Floyd, tasing people injecting them with sedatives, as we saw with Elijah McClain, right? And so, forceful restraint is actually key to excited delirium syndrome. However, the syndrome has been used -- and what I argue in the book, and also, I think, what many people have come to realize is that it is an excuse or a cover-up or a medicalized -- medicalization of police violence. So, it's really crucial to think about the relationship between the use of forceful restraints, right, and the ways that these deaths are then labeled after the fact.",

      "sentences": "But somehow this did not terminate this idea of excited delirium. Why do you think that it has taken so long to for people to question thisdiagnosis? BELISO-DE JESUS:  When we think of medicalization of police violence, we think about how something gets labeled a medical term in the first place, right? So, medical examiners were using the term and were labeling these deaths accidents or unclassified. And so, for many years, a lot of the excited delirium deaths of people who have died excited delirium or labeled excited delirium were actually not given any answers. And because their deaths were labeled accidents, because these deaths were unclassified, not only was no one held accountable, but it just looked like a medical incident, right? And we saw that with George Floyd's death, when initially the police placed on their website a notice saying that a man dies in medical distress, right? And had it not been for 17-year-old Darnella Frazier, who actually posted the bystander video that showed Derek Chauvin, you know, kneeling on George Floyd's neck, the world would not have known that this was not just another case of a so-called medical distress. And I think because it's gone, you know, sort of under the radar for so many years, because in many ways, it's kind of -- it can be seen as a sort of perfect cover-up for police violence. And what it also reveals to us is how medical examiners and also, you know, paramedics, right, participate in police violence in ways that that we really can't uncover until we start to really understand how these structures work.",

      "sentences": "A 2021 study published in the Virginia Law Review found that of 166 reported deaths in police custody from possible excited delirium, blackpeople made up 43.3 percent of cases. And black -- and Latino people together made up at least 56 percent. And for people who, you know, aren't aware, that is far beyond, you know, the presence of black and Latino people in the population on the whole. So, what do you make of those numbers? What do you think that says? BELISO-DE JESUS:  Well, I think the other sort of reason why excited delirium has sort of operated under the radar for a lot of people is because it does allow us to sort of justify and blame the victims for police violence. There's already a long history of racializing, right, and medicalizing black and brown people in the United States and utilizing this sort of terms, these fears, right, of dangerous black and Latino men that are going to sort of, you know, cause havoc and be threatening as an easy sort of scapegoat to then cover-up this kind of violence. And I think that what excited delirium shows us is how these ideas are then entrenched in medical diagnoses. and this actually goes back to a longer history, even from slavery, right? So, for instance, in slavery, there was, you know, a host of medical terms that similarly racialized, right, black people as dangerous or threatening or violent, right? We saw it -- you know Dr. Samuel Cartwright in arguing for drapetomania, right? The idea that runaway slaves have a mental illness, that we're sort of crazy and unhinged, a kind of mania, and he advocated for amputating toes. And I think it is crucial to recognize that when Wetli's precedent is the lynching narratives from the south that argued that black men needed to be subdued by more heavily arming police officers, that there's a sort of long history connecting these links between medical doctors and police violence.",

And actually, while the police detained him, he yelled to people and said, they're going to George Floyd me. And -- however, Anderson's death was described by the coroner as heart failure and cocaine, which, in essence, is an excited delirium without the term, right? And then, just this past April, we can see Frank Tyson was also asphyxiated, similar, actually, to George Floyd's death. And Tyson's family members and attorneys have described him as a sort of George Floyd 2.0. He was subdued, handcuffed, and complaining of being able to breathe. And so, I think it's really important that we have ongoing awareness around not just the term, which I think is appalling and points to the racist history, but also the ongoing ways in which this happens.",

Is there anything that gives you hope that this can change? BELISO-DE JESUS:  I do have hope. And I think, you know, after George Floyd's death, we saw people come from across the world, really, I mean, in the United States, especially, but millions of people took to the streets to really acknowledge the violence that our society has engendered, right? There has been a significant shift, right? Before George Floyd's death, people couldn't even imagine the possibility of, you know, redistributing resources from the police towards, you know, other kinds of programs, educational programs, mental health programs, right? And that happened, right? We saw a movement of people really demanding -- calling towards a shift in our society. And we saw resources being diverted. And I think we have to remember George Floyd's death and remember what it -- what that call to change our society really did. It's not going to happen in one swift move, but I think slowly bringing these to our attention and creating new institutions or shifting our institutions towards healing and caring and health care and training can actually do a lot of work, and it has done a lot of work. And so, I am hopeful, even as I know that there's ongoing research that needs to happen.",
