There is an hour to trade left onWall Street, and if we look at the market, I think there, you're getting a very good example of the underlying push and pull tensions. There's a sort of feeling of do no harm, but not sure what's next, and that is what we'll be talking about because what the markets are reflecting, of course, is what's happening with the main events of the day. President Vladimir Putin is due to speak tonight. We await his first public response to the failed insurrection by the Wagner Group. The fears of future instability in Russia are driving up energy prices. We need to understand where things go next, and we will help you tonight. And Greece's Prime Minister promises major reforms after a resounding election victory that gives him the majority he sought. Were live in New York. A very good evening to you. It's Monday. It's June the 26th. I'm Richard Quest and yes, I mean business. Good evening. Within the last hour or so, the Kremlin has said Vladimir Putin will make a number of important statements this evening. Now, it will be the first time we've heard from the Russian leader since the aborted mutiny by the Wagner Group. Its leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin said today his march to Moscow was a protest, it was not a coup against Putin. In an audio recording of Prigozhin, he said he did to just prevent the destruction of his mercenary group, and that he stopped the march to avoid Russian bloodshed. Whatever the reasoning from both sides, the events of the last four days have pulled back the covers and exposed weaknesses in Putin's rule and the fallacies behind his invasion of Ukraine. Jill Dougherty is CNN's former Moscow bureau chief. She's now adjunct professor at Georgetown University. She's with me from Washington, DC. The thing that has struck me most over the last few days is listening to people like you who are to use that phrase when I was growing up \"gob smacked\" by just the events of the last few days, things happened that you would never dreamt would have happened, and we just don't know where this goes next.",

It just seems to have reiterated a lot of the stuff I think we've already been talking about quite a lot since this armed rebellion was put down. I think what's most interesting for me, sitting here in Moscow watching this is that it's been so long since we've seen Vladimir Putin in public, he hasn't come out and actually said anything since this rebellion was put down or whether it was negotiated away or whatever happened. And so, you know, finally, we've seen the Russian president sort of stand up in front of the nation, condemn this armed uprising, reiterate the deal that had been offered to the Wagner fighters who didn't take part, which is that there'll be offered contracts or are being offered contracts with the Russian military. And also condemned the loss of life that did occur, and of course, we've not spoken enough, I don't think about the fact that several Russian aircraft was shot out of the sky by Wagner forces, with a number of pilots being killed and Vladimir Putin referred to that loss of life and of course, condemned it.",

It does not sound like the charges against him necessarily have been dropped, although quite clearly, within that speech, there is a lengthy attempt to be sure that those Wagner fighters out there, consider themselves free to go to Belarus, free to join the Russian Ministry of Defense and he is quite clear that he considers them to be patriots who fought for Russia. So a short speech, certainly one also two in which we don't get any suggestion of concessions from Putin. He is not standing there and saying there will be changes in Russia's top brass, which was essentially the goal of Yevgeny Prigozhin. He thanks Alexander Lukashenko, a highly unlikely man, frankly, to have saved Putin as it seems to have occurred on Saturday, a man who Putin often seems to treat with distance and a degree of contempt as a subordinate, but seems to have stepped in here and engineered this deal. We don't really know where Prigozhin is in all of this, and it does appear at this point that Putin would like to see Wagner dismantled, going to the tone of that speech, you don't read in those lines of suggestion that Wagner is a force necessarily that he wants to see maintained. But a strident bit there, I think, to say, this episode is finished. You do still have to wonder why it's taken him the best part of well over two-and- a-half days to come in front of the Russian people and speak like this.",

I remember the 57 minute speech we had ahead of the invasionof Ukraine last year in February, which, you know, showed a man with a thesis he wanted to present to the world. This is short. It essentially thanked the Russian people for a solidarity, which -- a unified response to these events of the weekend, which we didn't really see that much of. I mean, there were people in Rostov, frankly, who seemed to be cheering the Wagner mercenaries on in what they did. We don't know how they were met along the road up towards Moscow, but this is certainly not necessarily events over the weekend, which has found people coming out the streets to purposely oppose them, quite the opposite in some of the scenes we saw in Rostov. So it's short. It's a bid to show he is back in control. Again, certainly, it does not mention Yevgeny Prigozhin by name at all, almost like he's a non-person now in Putin's Russia, and that may well be exactly what occurs and apart from his channel on Telegram where we hear audio messages, he ceases to have a role in the Russian elites. But the impact of what he did over the weekend and how weak it made Vladimir Putin look, you can almost see in his face, he looks gaunt, Vladimir Putin, he looks angry, and I think it's been a long time, frankly, for him to come forward, make the speech and yes, it was not a series of very significant statements like it had been trailed to be. It was a repetition of the offer of a degree of amnesty to Wagner soldiers, reminded that they were patriots who fought hard in the Ukrainian war and I should remind people that Wagner are brutal fighters who are behind some of the more savage attacks we've seen on the Ukrainian frontlines.

Putin's narrative has not changed at all. The Russian government position has not changed at all. Okay, there was nothing explosive in what Putin said. So in that case, and given that Prigozhin has been able to speak out again today publicly, again, criticizing Putin's Defense minister, why did Putin not round him up on Saturday evening? He had the opportunity. He has let him fly into the wind. We all assessed that if he goes to Belarus, he won't be safe there, because Putin can easily reach into that country. But why let this carry on? He calls him a traitor. Again, he is doubling down on the use of the word \"traitor.\" He used it Saturday, he is using it today. But if the guy is really a traitor, and you're the super tough, powerful president who doesn't tolerate disloyalty like this, why do you let this guy go away? That points to a level of weakness here. And I think, you know, Putin is trying to retake and reshape the narrative for the Russian people, but at the same time is exposing, a grand, an ability to actually take Prigozhin out of the equation and stop him being a voluble critic.",

They're a danger for him right now, he wants them under contract. He wants them part of Russian defense forces. He opened his speech by talking about the fight against Ukraine and how critical it was to be able to continue that. So, I mean, maybe part of the reason why he's continuing to allow Prigozhin to be there is because he wants some time to ensure that Wagner is stripped away, is effectively liquidated. But there is no question, he still considers Prigozhin to be a traitor. Prigozhin is the one that is throwing these patriots against their brothers. And as of right now, he didn't mention his name.

We appear to have a problem (INAUDIBLE) runs we do get to that. We'll bring it to just a moment. The instability of course, that's taken place is pretty much everywhere. And the depth and width of it is really unknown. It hasn't -- no, it hasn't sufficiently altered or shaken Wallstreet yet. We recurred that earlier in the program. If you look at the way the markets have been performing. Well, Andrey Illarionov is the President Putin's former chief economic adviser and he's with me now from Washington.

He said that the West was rubbing their hands as they were watching it. But he didn't explicitly say that it was a plot by the United States or by NATO, to take him out of power which in the end is something that the White House had kind of expected him to say. And that was really why they orchestrated this strategy of not really saying much over the weekend. And that was why President Biden really kind of laid low as this was unfolding on the ground there to avoid giving him the pretext to make the claim that President Putin or President Biden was orchestrating this to take them out of power. When President Biden got on a video call with other European leaders on Saturday, that was sort of his driving message. Don't let this get out of control, really kind of take the temperature down. Now whether anyone believes that going forward, I think remains to be seen. We did hear from the Russian Foreign Minister earlier today, Sergey Lavrov, who said that he was starting an investigation to see whether this was a plot by Western intelligence. So obviously, we'll see how that unfolds. And obviously, that's not something that the United States would necessarily take it for face value. But certainly, that strategy has been unfolding in a way it kind of works, because you haven't heard President Putin make that claim directly at least today, Richard.",
