      "sentences": "Well, Laura, this is a very significant development. Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Hamas killed in Tehran, this according to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. It's been confirmed as well by a Hamas statement saying that he was killed in a residence in the Iranian capital as he was in town for the inauguration of the new Iranian leader.Now, we know that -- that inauguration of Iran's new president was on Tuesday. We don't have an exact timing of when this killing took place. But it was the early hours of Wednesday when the news emerged. Now it is a significant development. We have heard, as you say, that Israel is saying it does not comment on foreign news media reports. Not an unexpected response from the IDF. It is one we have heard before when there have been these reports of high profile killings in other countries of Hamas or even of Hezbollah leaders. But everyone in the region does believe that Israel is behind this. Israel has made it very clear from October 7th, after that Hamas attack in Israel, that all of Hamas' leadership was considered a target, that it would be going after the political and the military leadership of Hamas. Now we know with Ismail Haniyeh that his residence in Gaza City was -- was attacked by an Israeli air strike just one month after those October 7th attacks. We also know that several months ago, a number of his children were killed in Gaza as well, so his family has also been considered a -- a target. Now, Ismail Haniyeh himself has been out of Gaza for some years now. He has been living largely in Doha, Qatar. He has been free to travel around the region. We know he has been to Tehran a number of times. He has been to Turkey. And so the fact that this has happened in the heart of Iran is very significant. The fact that -- that the assassination was able to take place, that the intelligence was able to be gathered in Tehran itself, is certainly something that is going to -- to send a chill through the Hamas organization. Now it is not the first time that the leadership has been targeted. We know that -- that the military number two in -- in Gaza, Mohammed Deif, Israel believes they killed him just recently. Also back in January, Saleh al-Arouri, who was really considered a -- a deputy political leader of Hamas, was also assassinated in Beirut. So this is not the first time that this has happened, but certainly the fact that it is the political leader of Hamas is a significant target. He has been very vocal. He has been very visible over recent months, not least when it comes to negotiations for a potential hostage deal to release Israeli hostages from Gaza and a ceasefire deal which those discussions were ongoing. One can only imagine that -- that this could well stall those at least in the short term. Laura?",

And just, you know, just to understand how this assassination happened according to the Iranian media, there, you know, new details that are being published some sort of aircraft fired a missile into Haniyeh's bedroom through the window and killed him.You really need to have very good intelligence and very good operational capabilities to, you know, conduct such an operation. This is when you add that to the assassination of Hezbollah's top military leader in Beirut and to an airstrike conducted by the U.S. military in Iraq against pro-Iranian militias, this is a very bad day for the pro- Iranian access in the region. And usually when Iran gets hit like that, there is a retaliation. Sometimes it's immediate. Sometimes it takes time. And I think that the Iranians are now starting to work on how are they going to respond, both directly and through their progress in the region, for that wave or for that series of hits that they just got in the last 24 hours. And another interesting point, the White House top Middle East official, Brett McGurk is now in the region. He had talks yesterday in Saudi Arabia, headed the delegation of all the top Middle East officials in the Biden administration. They were in Saudi Arabia to talk about the situation in Yemen and the Houthis. He's going to Egypt later today, and he's there while the whole region is getting more and more and more tense. And I think it will be very interesting to see whether McGurk changes his plans and goes to Israel and to other countries in the region, from Egypt, maybe to Doha in Qatar, maybe to other places, but his visit in the region is in a very interesting timing. Barak is -- is his presence in the region, does it make his safety more precarious at this juncture?",

Here is what we know. This was a 62-year-old man who had joined Hamas in the late 1980s. He also grew in power as the Hamas organization, became more powerful, he was increasing in his ranks. He had been a part of the secret collective leadership at one point in time.He became chief of the group in 2017. It was actually named a special -- specially designated global terrorist by the United States soon thereafter. He has been a part since the 80s, even engaging in peace talks with then former President Jimmy Carter. He was in Iran -- in Tehran, attending the inauguration of the brand new president there. He's also known to be one of the chief interlocutors between Qatar and Egypt in terms of hostage negotiations. Members of his family had been killed back in April as well. We're learning now that he has been killed in Iran, the White House has been made aware, but they have not made an official comment from about what has happened. And this just in, a Hamas official has released a statement saying that the killing of their political leader, quote, will not pass in vain, unquote. The statement goes on to say that the assassination of leader Ismail Haniyeh was a cowardly act. I want to bring back in Bobby Ghosh. Bobby, what is your reaction to that statement tonight, calling this an act of cowardice and that will not remain in vain?",

      "sentences": "Well, this news is just spreading around, and it's fairly early in the morning here in Beirut, so haven't seen specific reaction yet. But this certainly isn't going to help calm things in the region. I'm -- I'm -- I'm sure that many people are probably -- are probably going to come to the conclusion that Israel has decided that there's no hope in negotiations to release the hostages in Gaza, and so it's going after the negotiator. Ismail Haniyeh, who was the political leader of Hamas, not the military leader of Hamas, was heavily engaged in these negotiations, obviously not directly with the Americans or the Israelis, but through the Qataris and the Egyptians and others.He was the man passing away who was sort of stating Hamas' position. So it seems that Israel simply given up on those negotiations and his going ahead and eliminating the leaders of Hamas when the opportunity arises. And I think as -- as -- as other people who you've been speaking to this morning or this evening where you are have -- have made it clear that this really underscores that Israel has the ability and the intelligence to target its enemies wherever they might be. For instance, yesterday evening, at just before 8:00 p.m. local time here in Beirut, the Israelis have the intelligence to locate and kill Fuad Shukr, who's the -- one of the senior military commanders of Hezbollah, despite the fact that Hezbollah tries to maintain fairly tight security. And for the Israelis to be able to strike the political head of Hamas in the Iranian capital. And of course, we heard Barak Ravid saying earlier that it was as a result of a missile fired through window. Obviously, we're going to have to get that confirmed. But that would indicate a level of intelligence that perhaps we -- we haven't seen yet before. And as I said, it just sends a message that Israel has given up on the negotiations for ceasefire in Gaza, for the peaceful release of the hostages who are still alive in Gaza and is simply going forward with the assassinating the people it was in directly negotiating with.",

This region has been under major stress, obviously, since at least October 7th. What will this do to the political and military dynamic, given some of the statements that this might be a showing of a giving up on peaceful negotiations?COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes, Laura, that could very well be the case, at least in the near term, because when you go ahead and as Ben was talking about just now eliminating the lead negotiator for Hamas in these negotiations that they've been conducting in Qatar and in Egypt as well as in -- in Rome, that really puts a stop to any of those diplomatic efforts. And I agree with Ben that this could potentially be a -- really a -- a -- a way to stop every single aspect of these negotiations in the -- in the, at least in the short term, because what that does is it puts Hamas in a specific box right here. And now that they're or less leaderless on the political side, at least, it also puts a -- a lot of pressure on the military wing of Hamas. So what we can see is some kind of effort to consolidate power within Hamas. That is going to, of course, be a very difficult thing for them to do, because they're really forced now under a lot of -- of stress to deal with the Israelis, both in a military and a political way, with decimated leadership. And, you know, in terms of the future, Laura, what we could see here is the potential for greater attacks on Israel, some of them coming from Iran, from the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, because now Iranian sovereignty has been violated with the killing of Haniyeh in -- in Tehran. [00:25:36] So this this could really result in a major escalation of this conflict, not only between Hamas and Israel, but also between Iran and Israel.",

So those are the kinds of things that could happen.

So far, the only response we've gotten is that they do not respond to reports in the foreign media. And this is the very type of targeted assassination attempt, or targeted assassination abroad that the Israeli military, the Israeli government, the Mossad, Israel's Intelligence Service, typically would not comment on.But we are learning, of course, from other sources, that this was Israel that was behind this assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Iran which is an extraordinary feat at that, in terms of Israel's ability to gather the intelligence and then be able to take out Ismail Haniyeh in Iranian -- on Iranian soil, is really something quite remarkable that speaks to the reach of Israel's intelligence service and is going to raise major questions in Iran about the security of other leaders in Iran, whether Iranian leaders or the leaders of other Iranian proxies. Now Hamas, for its part, has said that confirmed Haniyeh's death and said it is either victory or martyrdom. But this is going to raise a million questions at this moment, a very tense moment in the Middle East. As we know, last night, Israel carried out a separate strike that killed a senior Hezbollah commander. We know that these ceasefire negotiations are still ongoing. We are at a moment of incredible tension where a wider regional war could potentially break out as a result of these various escalations that we're seeing, it should come as no surprise, however, that Israel has tried to take out Ismail Haniyeh, and in this case, apparently done so successfully. Israeli leaders have vowed since October 7th that they would target and take out any Hamas leader since the beginning of this war, and they would reach them wherever they could. And now the latest target of -- of an Israeli operation, apparently, was Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas' political leader. And this is also, of course, going to raise questions about leadership within Hamas. We know, of course, that there has been Yahya Sinwar, who is Hamas' leader inside of Gaza, directing many of Hamas' military operations there, but also having a critical hand in those ongoing diplomatic efforts. Ismail Haniyeh also had a major hand in those ongoing ceasefire negotiations, particularly given the fact that he was abroad, and -- and Hamas' political leader. And so now this is going to raise questions about who comes out on top with more influence in Hamas, and particularly more influence over these ongoing ceasefire negotiations.",

What do you make of those suggestions? CONRICUSAnd he also participated in the inauguration ceremony of the new Iranian president, alongside other Iranian affiliated terrorists. So I think that what we're seeing here is an important message. I understand that this may complicate the situation, probably in the immediate term when it comes to getting Israeli hostages out. And I for one, pray and hope that Israel will be able to get all of our hostages out, as many of them as possible, alive. But, you know, Israeli leaders said, both military and elected officials, they said this, I think nine or 10 months ago, all of the leaders of Hamas are dead men walking, and it's only a matter of time before they will face the consequences of their murderous attacks against Israelis on October 7th and since.",

I think Hamas is going to be in a situation where, as Jonathan was alluding to, you're going to have to do make some kind of a response if you're Hamas. However, your military capabilities are definitely going to be limited at this point. Hamas is basically a top down organization that requires a, you know, certain person to be in charge of things. And that's going to, I think, be a bit more difficult for them to exercise the command and control that they normally exercise in a situation where they're trying to go after Israeli assets.They may try to launch rockets, if they still have the capability to do that from Gaza. They may try to do some other things in a more localized fashion, but they're also going to be under a lot of pressure to basically reach some kind of an agreement, and that pressure is basically military and political pressure that is going to, I think, complicate some of the efforts that Hamas has. They will try to work together with Hezbollah and Iran to perhaps do some kind of a joint effort against Israel, but that is going to be something that is going to challenge their capabilities. So if they do anything, it might be something more in the shadows, as opposed to a more spectacular attack.
