      "sentences": "The numbers tell the story better than any words can. The Democrats have a majority but just barely,the vice president breaks the tie in the 50-50 Senate. The question is, can the Democrats keep that majority in a very difficult midterm election year climate, 35 Senate elections in all. Let`s look at three likely to determine which party controls this chamber come January. Let`s start in Pennsylvania. No incumbent here, Pat Toomey, the Republican is retiring. Democrat John Fetterman versus Dr. Oz, you know him from TV, he`s the Republican candidate backed by Donald Trump. So let`s go back in time, the 2020 presidential race, what will we look for on election night. We will start over here in the Pennsylvania suburbs. The Democrats need to run it up here. Fetterman now the lieutenant governor was mayor of Braddock, it`s out here near Pittsburgh. Can he do what Joe Biden did in say Montgomery County? These are the suburbs outside of Philadelphia. Look at Joe Biden`s margins. That`s why he`s president of the United States. The suburbs win against Trump in 2018, even more so in 2020. Can Fetterman match Biden in the Philadelphia suburbs? That is one key test. The other question, the flip side of that is, can Mehmet Oz run like George W. Bush or George H.W. Bush did in these suburbs? They used to be Republican suburbs or at least open to Republicans. Can Dr. Oz do that? Let`s go down to another marquee race, Georgia. Marquee because you have a Democratic incumbent Raphael Warnock. Marquee because you have a football hero, Republican Herschel Walker. Interesting because you also have a libertarian candidate here and on Georgia on election night, if you don`t get 30 percent plus one, then we have a runoff in December. So that`s one big thing to look for in Georgia. What else do we look for? Just like in Pennsylvania, Joe Biden won Georgia because he won in the suburbs. Here`s Atlanta Democratic base, obviously, Senator Warnock needs that. But how does he do in places like Rockdale County, moving away from Atlanta? Traditionally, Republican or purple suburbs, they have become more Democratic especially in the Trump age. Can Senator Warnock get anything like that or can Herschel Walker prove that he can contest for the suburbs? And just like Dr. Oz, as a newcomer to politics, Herschel Walker has to prove if he is to win -- see all that red? That is Donald Trump`s strength in rural America. Can Herschel Walker in a place like Dodge County -- not a lot of votes, it`s small but they add up if you win all these small counties by margins like that. Let`s come back to the Senate map and let`s move out west to the state the Democrats are most worried about and it`s a surprise. Nevada, you have a Democratic incumbent here, she is a Latina. This is a state where the Latino vote is critical. So why is Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto in some trouble? Number one, Laxalt is a big brand name in Nevada politics. So you have a very close race between the Democratic incumbent and a very well-known Republican. To win Nevada, you have to win Clark County and you have to win big. Clark County is the home to Vegas. If you can see that up there, it`s nearly 75 percent. It`s around percent of the statewide population if you can run it up here, you can win. It was reasonably close last time, right? Joe Biden just won Nevada that was a surprise to many Democrats. They thought he`d have a bigger margin. Why? Donald Trump made inroads among Latino voters, especially male Latino voters. So one of the tests is we watch the Senate race this time is can the incumbent, a Latina, dominate the Latino vote? That is critical. Or the Republicans keep making inroads. That could make that one incredibly close as we move from east to Midwest to West and count the votes come election night.
