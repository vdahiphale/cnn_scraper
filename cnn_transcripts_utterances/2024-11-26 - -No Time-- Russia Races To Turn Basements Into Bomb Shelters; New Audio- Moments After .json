Well, the Denver mayor is my guest OUTFRONT. Plus, is he the Democrats answer to Joe Rogan? Seven and a half million followers tuned in to him on election night, and he says he knows how the party can win back men. Let's go OUTFRONT Good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, the breaking news preparing for war. Russia tonight scrambling to build and fortify new emergency bunkers as their war with Ukraine enters a dangerous escalatory phase. Just listen to the governor of Russia's Leningrad region. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOVERNOR OF RUSSIA'S LENINGRAD REGION (through translator): We must bring all underground rooms, all basements that meet the shelter requirements to at least this condition so that it is dry. There are benches and a supply of water, the ability to go to the toilet in order to temporarily wait out some emergency situation. There's no time for talk. The deadlines are extremely tight. We already need to make radical decisions. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And that's because Ukraine is now using America's powerful longer range missiles -- missiles that Russia claims again, were used to hit twice Russian military targets in an airfield today.We're also learning that Ukraine's air assault has reportedly injured a North Korean general and killed a number of the more than 10,000 North Korean troops that Putin has brought to help fight his war, and now, of course, in this case in the Kursk region of Russia. And tonight, Russia is seeking revenge for the onslaught, overnight, unleashing a record number of killer drones as the current deputy chairman of Putin's security council and the former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, fires off a new warning tonight at the United States. Medvedev, claiming that the transfer of nuclear weapons to Ukraine isn't it would be considered an attack on Russia by the U.S., he writes that, quote, the consequences are obvious. Now, just to state the obvious, of course, there is no talk of the U.S. sending Ukraine nuclear weapons, but that is not stopping this rise in rhetoric and the fearmongering on Russian state TV.

If such a thing were to happen, the consequences would be devastating. And these sobering details come as U.S. intelligence officials are now warning American defense companies to increase security precautions following several additional acts of sabotage in Europe that officials have blamed on Russia. Nick Paton Walsh begins our coverage OUTFRONT tonight, live in Eastern Ukraine. Nick, there are reports of air sirens again going off in Kyiv, 24 hours ago, as we were talking, that was when the massive drone attack hit Ukraine. What are you seeing where you are?",

Appreciate both of you very much. So, Seth, you know, trying to understand what the situation is here, that the world is in. You know, you've got a NATO military official warning companies to prepare for wartime scenarios. Germanys deputy defense minister, foreign minister warning that Russia's outproducing 4 to 1 on ammunition nuclear bunkers in Russia. Germany saying they're getting bunkers ready. I mean, this is a scenario that were in right now. And then you add to that this reporting that that its possible that Russia was behind taking down this plane, this DHL plane that we played that air traffic control audio from. Do you think it's possible that that's the case? SETH JONES, PRESIDENT, DEFENSE &amp; SECURITY DEPARTMENT, CENTER FOR STRATEGIC &amp; INTERNATIONAL STUDIES: Well, Erin, it's not entirely clear whether the Russians were behind this specific incident. But I think what is clear and a range of U.S. officials that I've spoken to have confirmed is that the Russians are involved in a much more aggressive campaign of sabotage and subversion across Europe, particularly Western Europe. They've been involved in assassinations strikes against weapons depots, fuel depots, targeting of oil pipelines and underwater telecommunications networks. So this is in a sense, this is an escalation of Russian activity, mostly GRU, the main intelligence directorate of the Russian military, and the SVR, Russia's foreign intelligence agency, in Europe, really as a sign that that -- that they can escalate in the -- in the areas in the kind of the asymmetric domain.",

How concerned are you, general about wider Russian acts of sabotage? MAJ. GEN. JAMES \"SPIDER\" MARKS (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, there's no reason that we should assume that they're not going to try to take advantage of some real tradecraft that they have. They're not bound by any legalities. And so they will engage at multiple levels, as Seth indicated, lots of asymmetric activities ongoing, but very precise and devastating kinetic activities as well we should not be surprised. Again, we don't know what the facts are surrounding the crash of the DHL. We do know. We do know that there were those explosions that took place in the UK and Germany this past summer. So I think it's -- it's important for us to realize that Russia very much -- and let's be frank, there's a lot to unpack here from the reporting that you've just laid in front of us. I mean, Russia now has the narrative that the entire nation is under threat and under assault. They've got -- they've increased the threat of nukes. That's not new.

They have they have threatened to escalate to use tactical nuclear weapons. That has not happened so I think some of this is really it's a manipulation of a psychological effort. I think it is important to note that the Russians are in a tough spot, too. They've lost 600,000 to 700,000 wounded and killed in this war.

Sixty-day temporary ceasefire, President Biden says he thinks there should be a permanent ceasefire.Both the Israelis and Hezbollah pull back. The Hezbollah go about 30 miles north of the Lebanese-Israeli border, within those two months, the Israeli forces pulled back inside of Israel proper. The U.N. and Lebanese army go in to fill that military vacuum. But I think there's an aspiration here that Hezbollah, because it's so beaten down so defeated, so decimated at a leadership level that it will not be able to grow back. I think that's an aspiration that's borne out of hope more than reality over a period of time. But how it applies to Gaza significantly, because Hezbollah got out of this fight with Israel and signed or got into this ceasefire because it has decided not to support and continue to support the Hamas war. So the message to Hamas is you're on your own. You don't have -- you don't have Hezbollah shooting into Israel, supporting you on the northern border. So a reality check for Hamas now, you've got to make a deal. Where are you going to go? What are you going to do? There's no way out. The bombardment, the military efforts are going to continue. And President Biden said he's going to -- he's going to work with the Qataris, with the Turks, with others to hasten that deal. So it's significant. But Hamas has to bite. They have to go for it.",

And we live in a 24 over seven, 365 day information environment now that we have to be competing in in a much better way. Podcasts streaming services, TikTok social media, of course. My two boys, 22 and 20, they get their information from TikTok, right? And so, we have to start realizing that we have to be where the voters are.

Now her district when she first got elected in 2020, was sort of a moderate district. Then it got changed to a more conservative district in 2022. And that's where you saw her shifting her rhetoric on a whole bunch of issues. But at that time, she sponsored the fairness for all act and that was essentially a Republican bill that would have outlawed or banned discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. It did have carve-outs for religious institutions. And I want to read what she said at the time because it is just so different than what she said today. She said, quote, I strongly support LGBTQ rights and equality. No one should be discriminated against. I have friends and family that identify as LGBTQ. I understand how they feel and how they've been treated is important. Having been around gay, lesbian and transgender people has informed my opinion in my lifetime. That was her in 2021.
