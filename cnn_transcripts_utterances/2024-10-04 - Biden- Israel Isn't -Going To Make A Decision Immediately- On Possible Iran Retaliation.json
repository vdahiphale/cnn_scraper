For the first time in years, Iran's supreme leader led the country in Friday prayers, publicly vowing that Hamas and Hezbollah, he says will never be defeated. We will go live to the White House shortly, first to Ben Wedeman, who is in Beirut, Nic Robertson here in Tel Aviv. Nic, listening to President Biden's comments there, two things stood out to me.

      "sentences": "Well, the other day, we were in the southern suburbs of Beirut going on a Hezbollah media tour and the message was clearly that we're still here. We're still in control. That we're still striking the Israelis and certainly the Iranian strike on Israel was kind of a morale boost for Hezbollah because increasingly, there was a feeling among many people, including supporters of Hezbollah that Iran had in a sense abandoned them, that they were being mauled by the Israelis starting with those pager attacks and everything they came after, and people were starting to wonder where are the Iranians who are our great allies.So they seem to have had a resurgence of confidence also, given that they are inflicting heavy casualties on Israelis in South Lebanon. But there's lots of questions swirling around here in Beirut. For instance, Hassan Nasrallah, is he ever going to have a funeral? Has he been buried? Has he not been buried? And who's this successor? You know, there's two names swirling around. There's Hashem Safieddine, who's the head of the political council, or rather the executive council which deals with political matters, somebody pretty much the same age as Nasrallah, same background, they studied together in Iran. And then there's Naim Qassim who we actually saw speaking in the southern suburbs for the funeral of Ibrahim Aqil, one of the senior military commanders who was assassinated by the Israelis some two weeks -- ten days ago, roughly. And so, certainly, Hezbollah has sort of seems to have regained a bit of confidence, but the question is, are they going to name a leader or perhaps? Because Israel's relentless campaign of killing senior members of the organization, they might just keep it on the low down until perhaps there's a ceasefire or end of the war. God knows when that's going to be. But they seem to be able to function. And what's interesting in all of this? This is despite the blows Hezbollah has received here in Beirut, they seem to be still functioning in the south of the country with their attacks on Israeli forces that are trying to enter the country. There still firing rockets into Israel. They put out a statement saying that some of those rockets had reached as many as 150 kilometers inside the country. Now, take it all with a pinch of salt.

And what I mean by that is aircraft or missile capabilities.So, you know, just because there's no bombs going off right now, are no strikes going on, doesn't mean that Israel's been silent.

All right. So we will go to the White House now, CNN senior White House correspondent Kayla Tausche. And, Kayla, it was unusual to see President Biden walk up to the podium there, sounded like he wanted to tout the job numbers, but was there a deliberate effort there to walk back his comments yesterday regarding Israeli potential strikes on Iranian oil facilities. KAYLA TAUSCHE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Well, certainly, I think the White House was aware of the chaos that was taking place in the markets after he appeared to leave the door open to that price of oil spiked, stock market cratered for a time there. And so, yes, he did field a number of questions about the situation in the Middle East and the potential for escalation or further inflammation in the region. But he talked at length about what he saw is an appropriate response. And he suggested that the Israelis looked for what he described as alternatives to striking Iran's oil reserves, in the same way that he appeared to be completely opposed earlier in the week to Israel striking Iran's nuclear facilities. He also said that he does not believe that Israel has concluded how they're going to respond. And then he believes that there's going to be a little bit more time. And, Jim, he also bristled at the suggestion by a reporter that he was wanting to talk to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and had not been able to and suggested that they would talk when it was time and when Israel had concluded how it was going to respond. He said that there has been no better friend to Israel than his administration. When asked whether he thought that the reason why Israel was pumping the brakes on ceasefire talks both in Lebanon and in Gaza was because he, Netanyahu, wanted to put his thumb on the scale of the U.S. election and President Biden did not engage in that line of questioning. And that's when he said that there's been no better at her friend than his administration. So we covered quite a bit of ground as it pertains to the Middle East, even as you mentioned the purported purpose of him stepping out behind the lectern in the briefing room for the first time in more than 3.5 years, was to talk about the economy, Jim.",

You know, we've seen a number of strikes on the city of Beirut that have actually been very targeted where its just the apartment that is struck in the entire building doesn't come crumbling down. But then you look at the vast majority of the bombs that are being dropped here, and they're massive. They're bringing down entire apartment buildings, and just about everything else that is around it. We also see it in some of the other things that Israel is targeting. For example, water pumping stations, four of them have been targeted according to UNICEF. And then at least one instance, a team of mechanic that went to try to repair, one of them was targeted as well. If we look at what's happening (VIDEO GAP) at least ten medical facilities have been targeted. Some of them have been damaged. You have more than 100 health care workers that have been killed. One of my INARA staff actually, two of her cousins worked with Lebanon's civil defense and they were killed while they were on their way to try to help and rescue others. So there are so many instances here (AUDIO GAP) is Gaza that is happening again, people are terrified. SCIUTTO:  A hundred twenty-seven children killed in less than three weeks in Lebanon, nearly half of the people in Lebanon's emergency shelters are children, as we said earlier.

He has had a very fractured relationship with Kemp and the other Republicans in the state ever since. In fact, just this summer, Trump at a rally called Kemp, a quote, bad guy saying he is a disloyal guy and he's a very average governor. I can't think of a bigger insult that Trump can use for someone then it called them disloyal.

This is close to Fort Liberty and you can expect that a lot of the country sirens in the audience will be from military families.

This week, the Dominican Republican said they would actually begin deporting Haitians already there, citing an excess of immigrants.So what's happening between the Dominican Republic and Haiti right now? REICHLIN-MELNICK:  Well, Dominican Haitian relations have been strained for a very long time, especially on migration. Last decade, the Dominican Republic carried out mass deportation campaigns against many Haitians within the community revising their birthright citizenship law, effectively, meaning that there were tens of thousands of people who had been born in the Dominican Republic of Haitian descent, who ended up facing deportation and being forced to go back to Haiti. So their relationship between those country and the animosity between those nations is longstanding. And the idea that patients could simply go to the Dominican Republic is not really accurate.",

But as you well know, Trump's been making a lot of progress with Latino voters.Are you seeing that migration or move towards Trump in Nevada as well? MUELLER:  Yeah, I think that we're seeing a lot of outreach from both Republicans and Democrats to the Latino population, about one in five voters here are Latino. And I think that Trump is making some inroads and I think that taxes on tips is one of the things that he's really heavily emphasizing. Harris has also been emphasizing that as part of her campaign. So well see how that plays out once we hit November. I do think it's important though that when were talking about this economy issue, that we also bring up, that abortion is also a key player here in the state, right? We do have a ballot measure that's going forward that voters are voting on in 2022, when Catherine Cortez-Masto, Senator Catherine Cortez-Masto running for office, her opponent, Adam Laxalt, actually really hammered her on the economy. She ended up winning. Her response to him was to really push forward on abortion messaging, but she ended up winning by a very, very narrow, less than 1 percent margin. So I don't think that economy is always, it's really important factor here, but I think there are also other factors that voters and pendency to keep in mind.",
