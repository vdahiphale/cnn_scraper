But we're also starting to see the ripple effect from these three plants that are now shut down by the strike. General Motors and Ford announcing at least 2,600 workers will be laid off in the days ahead because their facilities can't operate while these three factories are on strike.

And I think that puts a lot of pressure on the company's representatives at the bargaining table. This is a union for lots of reasons that the company should believe can sustain a strike. And so there's going to be no easy out for the companies without, as President Obama said, coming up with a contract that's fair. I think it's really important that that came from President Obama because, obviously, he was president when this union made great concessions to save the auto industry in our country. And really what they're saying now, and I think this is resonating with the public, one reason why you see such high public support for this -- for the strike is that it's time for the union to share in the success of these companies. They bore really heavy burden when these companies weren't doing well. And now that the companies are taking in record profits, it's time for the companies to share those profits, share that success with these members.",

And that's central to our economy being successful. So I think continuing to reinforce that message.But this is a negotiation between the union and the companies. That's the system that we have. You know, it does seem to be working. A strike doesn't mean that our system doesn't work. It's a way of influencing what happens at the negotiating table. You know, as you said in your -- in the intro, there does seem to be some progress with the negotiations at Ford.

Now, this is part of President Biden's visit to the United Nations General Assembly, where he, too, on Tuesday, will be giving a speech.

Of course, we can also expect that there will be a focus on the war in Ukraine.

Officials said that they now believe that Chinese leaders have made a deliberate decision not to launch additional balloons since the one over the U.S. was shot down by American fighter jets back in February. And, importantly, the U.S. has not observed any new launches from China since that episode occurred.Now, the apparent suspension of the program comes as both the U.S. and China have sought to stabilize relations. But officials also say the suspension could be the result of Chinese President Xi Jinping getting pretty angry that the spy balloon crossed over the U.S. at all without his knowledge, and he was apparently not pleased that it caused such a diplomatic uproar, according to sources. Now, Chinese communist party leaders apparently even reprimanded the operators of that surveillance program over the incident, according to a source familiar with the intelligence. Now, importantly, the program was pretty extensive before it was halted. And the Chinese launched roughly two dozen missions globally in recent years. And so, the program could be deemed valuable again and it could be restarted, according to experts. So, how long this suspension actually lasts, that is going to likely depend on how U.S.- China relations play out over the next several months. We should note that President Biden and Xi Jinping could meet on the sidelines of a summit in San Francisco in November, though a meeting has yet to be confirmed. Victor, Amara.",
