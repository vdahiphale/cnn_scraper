I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.We start this hour with new headwinds facing two of President elect Donald Trump's key cabinet picks, Pete Hegseth for secretary of defense and Tulsi Gabbard for the director of national intelligence. Despite having a Republican Senate majority, some lawmakers say they have serious questions about their records, which could threaten their upcoming confirmation hearings. CNN's Alayna Treene is live for us in West Palm Beach, Florida. Alayna, what's the latest?",

      "sentences": "Right. Well, Jim, I think when you look at how quickly Donald Trump has moved to fill out the core Cabinet for his second administration, now really the attention at Mar-a-Lago is turning to how they are going to get some of these controversial picks through their Senate confirmation processes. And two of the names that are really, I think, you know, we're hearing from people on Capitol Hill, but also the Trump team recognizes might have some -- there might be some concerns about that they need to assuage among members on the Hill are Tulsi Gabbard and Pete Hegseth.Gabbard, specifically over some of her comments about her mistrust and skepticism regarding intelligence, but also some of the meetings that she has had in the past. I think, you know, her selection to be Donald Trump's director of national intelligence has really resurfaced her 2017 meeting when she went to Syria as a Democratic congresswoman and met with the Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad. That is one thing that we have heard kind of percolating now among senators who are going to be tasked with seeing her through her confirmation process. We heard some of them, including Senator Tammy Duckworth as well as Republican Senator James Lankford address this yesterday. Why don't you take a listen to what they said? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. TAMMY DUCKWORTH (D-IL): She is, in terms of the intelligence community, very unqualified. Plus, she is potentially compromised and could be and has -- is there questions about whether or not she is now a Russian asset? SEN. JAMES LANKFORD (R-OK): Well, we'll have lots of questions. She met with Bashir Assad. We'll want to know what the purpose was and what the direction for that was. As a member of Congress, we want to get a chance to talk about past comments that she's made and get them into full context. So, sure, there -- there's -- there's comments that are floating out there, but we want to be able to know the rest of the story. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Now, Jim, part of what the Trump team is going to be doing is they have kind of started assigning some people from the Trump team to help shepherd these different appointees through their processes. But also for their meetings on Capitol Hill. They are lining these different appointees up to go onto Capitol Hill to meet one-on-one behind closed doors with senators and try to figure out then what those core vulnerability are -- vulnerabilities are and then what they can do to try and give them reassurances and address those concerns before, of course, we see these confirmations play out in public.Now, as for another controversial pick, Pete Hegseth, he did go through those meetings last week alongside the VP elect, JD Vance. But some of the concerns that we've been hearing from senators is one, whether or not he's qualified or has enough credentials to be in that top role for the Pentagon. But also some of the recent reports we have been getting, and we recently saw that police report that was covered a lot last week on sexual assault allegations against him So some of these picks are going to have an uphill battle, likely, you know, very tense confirmation processes ahead. But this is really the focus now as Donald Trump continues to really name his last few names for his cabinet roles. This is really the talk among what's going on with the transition team and at Mar-a-Lago right now, seeing what they can do to get these people through because, again, Donald Trump chose these different people for a reason. They recognize that some of them seem unconventional, maybe not what normal traditional Republicans would choose. He wants these different people to be disruptors in these agencies. He's picking these people because he wants them in these roles. And so they're kind of back chilling as much as they can to get them through this process. Jim?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Jim, I mean it's a very basic function that the bureau plays here, has always played fairly uncontroversially. I mean there's been a couple of issues in the last few years. But the way it works is that you conduct the background check on behalf at the client's request. And in this case the client is the transition team or the new administration.And -- and the bureau does its -- the work that we are constantly relying on it to do. It's fair, it's impartial, it's complete. They go out. They take a look at every aspect of this candidate. They have access to information and systems that private entities don't have. And so they do a very thorough and complete job. They deliver that to the client. And then that information is also shared with Congress so that our lawmakers who ultimately in the Senate who approve the confirmations are all working off the same information. And so it's, you know, it would be like buying a house and, you know, not getting it inspected before you bought it. Like that's just something that everyone does because you want to know they want there to be complete transparency as to what you're getting into.",

Because, you know, I will say, Andrew, I imagine there are some viewers at home who are having a tough time absorbing, you know, something as lighthearted as a -- as a Thanksgiving pardon for turkeys when, I mean, there have been some really serious questions raised about some of these Trump cabinet picks. And I'm just curious what some of your thoughts are on that. I mean, you have the Tulsi Gabbard pick for director of National Intelligence.That obviously has some effect on the FBI's work. But there's also Donald Trump's pick for attorney general now that Matt Gaetz has gone by the wayside, the former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, who has said things like that they need to investigate the investigators in this country. I want to play a little bit of this and get your thoughts on the other side. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PAM BONDI, TRUMP'S PICK TO BE ATTORNEY GENERAL: When Republicans take back the White House and we will be back in there in 18 months or less, you know what's going to happen? The Department of Justice, the prosecutors will be prosecuted, the bad ones, the investigators will be investigated because the deep state last term for President Trump, they were hiding in the shadows, but now they have a spotlight on them and they can all be invented investigated. We can clean house next term. And that's what has to happen. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, certainly what we've heard is some new rhetoric from coming from the Kremlin and also from the deputy foreign minister as well. Jim, one of the things that we've really heard here over the weekend is the Russians really increasing their threats specifically towards the United States, saying that if the U.S. continues to support Ukraine the way that it has and also continues to allow Ukraine to use some of those surface to surface missiles to strike deep into Russian territory, continuously strike deep into Russian territory, that and then the threat is that Russia could attack American military objects. That's something that we heard from the Russians before the weekend.But once again today, with the deputy foreign minister coming out and saying, look, the Russians using a massive intermediate range ballistic missile against a Ukrainian city this past week is an indication of what the Russians are willing to do if their red lines are crossed. That's something that we heard from them. And one of the other things that the deputy foreign minister also said is that he said that the Russians, as he put it, have security concerns in that region and they are willing to ensure those security concerns by all means necessary, obviously, also meaning some of that very heavy weaponry. The other thing that we're seeing as well is sort of a waiting game the Kremlin seems to be playing as well, Jim, where they seem to be leaning towards and looking towards the Trump administration coming in. They obviously believe that there could be some sort of peace or armistice negotiations going on that could lead to a deal or some sort of ceasefire for Ukraine on terms favorable to Russia. That's something that a couple of hours ago we heard from the spokesman from the Kremlin who said that he believes that talk about peace and ending the war is something that's coming from President-elect Trump's cabinet picks, but not something that they're hearing from the Biden administration, Jim.",

But last month, the L.A. District Attorney George Gascon recommended that a judge resentence them, which could set them free immediately. Joining us now to discuss is criminal defense attorney and former prosecutor Ann Bremner. Ann, nice to see you again. This is a status hearing today. I -- I tried to press the new incoming DA about all of this on -- in the last hour of this program to -- to no avail. He wasn't really tipping his hand.

So basically, the judge today has to basically decide to say, will that date work for the new prosecutor? Will that date work for everybody else concerned? And what's going to happen there? Is it going to be a request for manslaughter, where they'd walk out the door? Would it be a request to resentence on homicide without special circumstances? That would be life with parole as opposed to without parole. They would go before a parole board and maybe be set free. There's all kinds of possibilities in this case, but it certainly has changed with the new DA.",

But now things are completely different. I think there are different sentiments. Now we have a conservative prosecutor. It is up to the judge ultimately. But the prosecutor has discretion. It's their case. And this prosecutor said he's law and order. That's what he ran on against Gascon, who basically was a woke DA he said, and that's why he won with this whole stance of law and order. So he's going to look at the whole case, he's going to read everything, he's going to talk to family members, he's going to talk to those that are against any kind of resentencing and make a recommendation to the judge. So that's huge.I mean, the judge has to be informed basically with what the DA tells him or her. And this DA may be seeing completely different tune than the last DA who lost an election. Some say he asked for re sentencing because for political reasons to basically win the election, which of course he didn't.",
