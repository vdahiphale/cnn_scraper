      "sentences": "OUTFRONT nextThe breaking news, Trump's interview with a probation officer wrapping up, the first of its kind in history. We have new details about the questions he faced and how his answers could affect his sentence, as well as who was in that room. Plus, a secret new recording tonight of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, this as the former Republican Governor Christie Todd Whitman breaks her silence about the man that she had publicly supported and introduced to the United States Senate. Does she now regret backing Alito? And it's the hottest stock in the planet. A little known company forcing Apple today to play catch up. We have a special report. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, the breaking news. Former President Trump just wrapping up an interview with a probation officer. This is a first, never an American history has a former president had to sit down with a probation officer because the former president has never been convicted of a crime. But here we are. This meeting was mandatory for Trump as he is now a convicted in felon in the state of New York. Trump answering questions from his home in Mar-a-Lago. Now, according to a source, the question answers lasted about half an hour and Trump was asked, we understand some of the basic questions that other convicted felons must answer those questions for a regular felon would include questions about family background, financial status, living situation and crucially, it chance for the defendant in this case Trump to say why he thinks he deserves a lighter punishment. Now there is no pleading the Fifth here, and the answers Trump gave will influence Judge Juan Merchan, who will formally sentence Trump in July. Here's the range: Trump is facing anywhere from probation to up to a maximum of 20 years in prison after being found guilty of all 34 counts in the New York hush money case. Now, one of the most important drivers into whether, you know, which extreme this ends up on or where it ends up in that -- in that band is whether Trump expresses remorse and that, of course, is not happening. Trump today posting online, I truly wish people would remember that all of these trials, in quotes, are concocted and run by the crooked Joe Biden White House and DOJ for the purpose of election interference and damaging crooked's political opponent, me, as much as possible. Of course, it always bears noting in a moment when he says that the Biden DOJ could have prosecuted this case and explicitly chose not to, and the White House -- White House officials privately call this case the runt of the litter. But Trump is going to milk this trial for all its political worth. And it comes as his top political ally today, Rudy Giuliani, is now facing some justice of his own, charged with allegedly conspiring to overturn Arizona's election. This just came out moments ago. What you're looking at on your screen is the mug shot of Giuliani, America's mayor, turned into Trump's fall guy, and that is his mug shot. And the state of Arizona, Maricopa County tonight. Brynn Gingras begins our coverage OUTFRONT live in New York. And Brynn, you've got new reporting about this interview between Trump and probation officers. What are you learning?",

Michael, let me start with you because you are the former New York City correction and probation commissioner. So, Juanita Holmes now doing that now. So what's your take of what happened today? Could have been obviously probation or regular probation officer assigned to the case, but it sounds like the commissioner herself was in the room as well as the general counsel. MICHAEL JACOBSON, FORMER NYC PROBATION &amp; CORRECTION COMMISSIONER: Well, you certainly expected someone more than just the probation officer to be in that interview. I mean, it's so unusual for 1,000 reasons, most of them obvious, but just the fact than it was remote and that Trump's attorney was there. Those are two very odd things in and of themselves. So, given all that, it certainly made sense that you would want someone other than the probation officer. It certainly makes sense to me for the general counsel to be there, the sort of equivalent of Trump's attorney on the probation side.",

This is -- this is a part of it.But you've watched the judge so closely in that room. A judge that Trump had referred to looking like an angel, but he was really the devil, was the way Trump put it. But a judge who, you know, his demeanor was always positive, serious, he never, never for betrayed any sort of emotion. How much weight do you think he will give this report, this interview that's -- the report that's going to come out of the interview that Michaels talking about?",

      "sentences": "I think he's going to take it very seriously, but like you said, Erin, he knows this defendant, he knows Trump. He saw him every day. He saw Trump violate the gag order ten times and he impose the fine for that.And I think he's going to really want to see whether there is remorse and he's going to take what's been going on in Las Vegas, the rally, what he's saying and all of the things that he saying now really don't show remorse. And I think that is going to have an impact. I'm not saying he's going to incarcerate him but I do think as to whether its probation or house arrest, or community service, he's going to go with something that's a little more serious. So, Mark, the way that it was described in Brynn's reporting, the way that Trump handled himself today was that he was polite and respectful and accommodating to the probation officer, and obviously, the commissioner and the general counsel who were also present for the New York Parole Commission, I'm sorry, Probation Commission. But this is the first time a foreign president's ever been in a situation like this, Mark. You've been in situations like this hundreds of times with clients. So, does the judge already have his mind made up when you hear accommodating, polite and respectful? Does that mean anything considering what Trump says about this, judge pretty much daily? MARK O'MARA, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: I think there is a pragmatic approach that he should be respectful to probation officer interviewing him. I've never had general counsel show up at the hundreds that I've ever been on. I've also never had the commission of Department of Corrections show up. So, obviously, everyone's looking at this very, very carefully. But, Erin, as we talked about last week, I do think that this judge as most judges who sat through the trial before sentencing, have most of their mind made up 90 percent or so. This is not going to, I think move the needle very much because everyone knows who Donald Trump is. Everyone knows about the facts of the case, which really interesting is whether or not they took this opportunity to give a written statement for a verbal statement of his position. I'm almost surprised if he didn't just because of who he is, although I tell my clients never to give a written or verbal statement at this stage, wait until you get in front of the judge.",

OUTFRONT now, former Republican governor of New Jersey, Christine Todd Whitman, who introduced Alito at his confirmation hearing back in 2006, and recommended him to the Senate judiciary committee. So, Governor Whitman, I really appreciate your time. And obviously, it's been a long time, nearly 20 years since you did that and you publicly vouched for Alito, you spoke out for him. And now, time has passed and you see him -- things he has done. You see his defiance admits this flag controversy. Does this make you see him differently or regret your support? CHRISTINE TODD WHITMAN (R), FORMER NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR: Absolutely, without question. I mean, I was willing to support him because I looked back at his record. And when I was appointing justices, particularly of the Supreme Court, or any of the judges what I look for is how many times said they've been overturned, did they write clear opinions, and were they able to judge cases based on the facts presented to them in that case? And I actually saw a case that Judge Alito had actually -- had decided in favor of a plaintiff that was clearly against what his personal convictions were relative to the matter of choice and abortion. And so, my feeling was, okay, he's shown that he will put aside his personal convictions to judge and decide the case based on the facts presented in that case. So, unfortunately, since he's gotten to the Supreme Court, that's just seemed to have gone by the wayside.",
