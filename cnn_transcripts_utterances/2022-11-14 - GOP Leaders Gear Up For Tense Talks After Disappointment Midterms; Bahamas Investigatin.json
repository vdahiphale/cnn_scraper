The leadership in the Republican Senate says we know you cannot have a plan. We're just going to run against how bad the Democrats are -- and actually, then, they cave in to the Democrats. They want to rush through an election because they don't want to do any assessment of what we've done wrong.

Kevin McCarthy is going to have, potentially, a challenge this week to try to run for Speaker. He's in more trouble, I would say, than Mitch McConnell. McConnell is seeing, right now, a lot of senators try to put the blame on him. And it's interesting because a lot of the senators who are most vocal criticizing McConnell are senators who are looking at running in 2024 and kind of want to win over Trump's base, and so they're not casting blame on Trump. In the clip you just aired, Rick Scott, for instance -- he was actually running Senate Republicans' campaign arm and he's saying it's silly to do the same thing over and over again and have the same results. And yet, he's not talking about Trump and the drag the former president really was on Republicans themselves.

It's the same crop of freedom caucus conservatives who are saying we're not going to give you our vote until you give us what we want in terms of rules changes.I would say the thing to watch carefully in the House is the motion to vacate. It's basically this rule that allows any conservative, any Trump ally to try to oust McCarthy by themselves -- one person -- if they're unhappy with him. And right now, they can't do that because of rules changes. They want the ability to do that and McCarthy has been very reluctant to give that over.

All right, looking at markets around the world this Monday morning to start the week, you can see Asian shares have closed mixed here. Europe has opened narrowly mixed. And on Wall Street, stock index futures are leaning a little bit lower here coming off their best week since June. Signs of cooling inflation late last week sent stocks up sharply. The S&amp;P rose more than five percent last week, the Dow up four percent, and the Nasdaq had its best week since March. Another inflation check Tuesday with the October Producer Price Index. Despite hints of a slowdown, overall inflation still near 40-year highs. It's tough, still, for both businesses and everyday Americans.

Morgan. But in the span of a week, the 30-year-old wunderkind founder and CEO of FTX, the mega-powerful cryptocurrency exchange, has resigned. Has lost his fortune. His firm is in bankruptcy.

And then this afternoon game was sloppy, and exhilarating, and crazy -- basically, everything that football sports fan would want.With the second half of the season underway, two of the NFL's best delivering in what was a wild game. The Vikings taking advantage of three turnovers by Josh Allen in the fourth quarter and overtime. So, a little bit sloppy. The game on the line here on fourth down late in the fourth quarter. Vikings wide receiver Justin Jefferson with a one-handed, game-saving grab that is arguably the catch of the season. He had 10 catches for 193 yards. That play put Minnesota right on the doorstep. But the Bills' defense answered the call, stopping Kirk Cousins and company on fourth and goal from the half-yard line with 50 seconds to play. So this is where it got interesting on the very next play. Buffalo quarterback Josh Allen fumbles the snap on the QB sneak. Erik Hendricks somehow recovers the ball across the line for a touchdown. That put the Vikings up by three. So if you thought it was over at that point, you're wrong. Josh Allen made up for that mistake. He marched the Bills up the field on a 5- play 69-yard drive that ended with that Tyler Bass field goal to force overtime. So the Vikings got the ball first. They had to settle for a field goal. Buffalo with a chance to win it and Josh Allen going for the touchdown. Patrick Peterson coming away with his second interception of the day to seal Minnesota's 33-30 victory. Allen faltering over these last couple of games. Too many mistakes for Buffalo and a big win for the Vikings who are now 8-1 for the season. The Bills fall to 6-3.

And here is your stat of the day if you are co-workers, if you are around the water cooler, if you're back at the office -- the Cowboys now 195-1, all-time, when leading by 14 points through three quarters. And much has been made about the Colts' new interim head coach, former NFL center-turned-T.V. analyst. Jeff Saturday taking over the program with no professional coaching experience. But he's starting his tenure with a win and that's tough to do in the NFL. Indy handing the Raiders their third loss in a row -- 25-20 the final there. All three of those losses coming to teams with losing records, so the Colts within a game of a playoff spot. A lot of people saying hey, listen, this guy doesn't have any coaching experience past high school.
