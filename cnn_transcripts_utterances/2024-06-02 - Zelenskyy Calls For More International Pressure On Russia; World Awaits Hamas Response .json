So let's start overseas where the U.S. is reaffirming its support for Ukraine as President Volodymyr Zelenskyy tries to rally world leaders to help his country fight off Russia. Today, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met with Zelenskyy on the sidelines of a key security summit in Singapore. Last week, the U.S. granted permission for Ukraine to use American- made weapons inside Russian territory. This is a big shift in U.S. policy. CNN's Natasha Bertrand is in Singapore at the defense summit, Natasha.",

      "sentences": "Alisyn, Presidents Zelenskyy of Ukraine, he met with a number of different leaders here earlier today in Singapore including Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin.And the two, according to a readout from the Pentagon, discussed Ukraine's most urgent battlefield needs, including their desperate need for additional air defense systems to really fend off the massive missile barrages that Russia is launching at Ukraine on a near-daily basis. And importantly, President Zelenskyy also wanted to thank Austin and the United States and President Biden for making that policy decision to finally allow Ukraine to use American made weapons to strike into Russia itself to try to defend itself against those attacks that Russia is launching from near the border with the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv. Now, the big theme though and the reason why Zelenskyy came here to Singapore was to try to rally Asian countries behind Ukraine, to try to get behind Ukraine's fight against the Russians. To not side with the Russians and to importantly participate in a very important peace summit that Ukraine has been organizing over the last several months in which it's going to be held in just two weeks' time. A peace summit that aims to develop some kind of formula to finally end the war between Ukrainian and Russia. And importantly, Zelenskyy was trying to get the Chinese to attend this peace summit, but the Chinese would not even meet today here in Singapore with President Zelenskyy. And they are not expected to attend that peace summit either. In fact, according to the U.S. and the U.K., China is actively supporting Russia's war in Ukraine by supporting its defense structure. So while President Zelenskyy did not get everything that he wanted here today, including that important meeting with the Chinese, he did say that he accomplished some very key things, including meeting face- to-face with some of these very important leaders and hopefully rallying an even bigger coalition of international partners to support Ukraine in its fight against the Russians, Alisyn.",

That's going to happen, of course, on the heels of the president outlining that hostage deal to try to reach a ceasefire agreement in Gaza. Now, the French president has come out and said that it is support of this proposal, but the U.S. has found itself quite isolated on the world stage in its support for Israel as there continue to be -- continues to be devastation in Gaza. So this will be an opportunity for him to shore up allies and partners in backing this deal in hopes of trying to reach an agreement. Although of course, as the president noted on Friday, this is a difficult endeavor, one that officials are working on around the clock behind the scenes. But certainly in a decisive moment as the president said, and trying to reach this ceasefire agreement in Gaza.",

      "sentences": "Alisyn after President Biden chaired the Israeli ceasefire proposal with the world on Friday and then followed up with a helpful tweet containing a graphic of the three phases of this ceasefire proposal, there were inevitable reactions from Israel across the political spectrum.First and foremost, from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who took the rare step of issuing a press statement on the Jewish Sabbath on Saturday in which he said that Israel would never agree to a full cessation of hostilities, which is due to come in phase two of this three-phase ceasefire proposal until such time as Israel's war objectives have been met. And he reiterated what Israel's conditions for an end to the war were. Number one, to destroy Hamas' military and governance capabilities. Number two, to get all the hostages living and dead back into Israel. And number three, to ensure that the Gaza Strip no longer poses a threat to Israel. And I think Netanyahu was also based on this statement on the Sabbath, trying to preempt the inevitable blowback from the far-right members of his governing coalition -- blowback, which inevitably came at the end of the Sabbath in which they said that this deal, this proposal, was reckless that it would amount to a capitulation to Hamas and that they wouldn't support it. They would pull their party's out of Netanyahu's governing coalition if this deal goes ahead. Now, if they make good on that threat, that would likely lead to the collapse of the government. The deal, if it does go through and Hamas approves it with Hamas right now. If that deal does go through to Israel's Knesset, the parliament here, it would no doubt still get through with the support of opposition parties. The leader of the opposition Yair Lapid saying that he would support it. Inevitably after that, the governing coalition would likely collapse. There will be fresh elections -- elections, which opinion polls suggest Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would lose. I know that's something else that's playing on his mind, Alisyn.",

And, you know, that is, it seems to me not in Israel's interests. I don't think it's in the U.S. interests and certainly not in the interest of the Palestinian people. I think that President Biden should not just have been and be advising Israel to show more restraint to push more toward an exchange of prisoners, et cetera, but also use the leverage that we have, which is largely the diplomatic support we provide at the U.N., and also the weapons shipments we provide Israel. And when President Biden has been willing to use that leverage there has indeed been a response from Israel, but I think he's often been too reluctant to use that leverage.",
