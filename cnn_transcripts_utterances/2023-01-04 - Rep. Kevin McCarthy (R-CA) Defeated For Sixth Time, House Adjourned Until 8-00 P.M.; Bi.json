Republicans huddling behind closed doors tonight after Kevin McCarthy's bid for the speaker's gavel lands with a thud for the second straight day. The next moves for McCarthy and his opponents are very unclear right now with the House adjourn until 8Another major story we're following tonight, new information emerging about the terrifying on-field collapse of Damar Hamlin. The Buffalo Bills say Hamlin is showing signs of improvement although he remains in critical condition in the ICU. This hour, the chief medical officer for the NFL joins me live for an exclusive interview. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM. Let's get straight to the spectacle on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives now adjourned until 8:00 P.M. Eastern. Our Chief Congressional Correspondent Manu Raju is standing by for us up on Capitol Hill. Manu, Republicans there working behind the scenes right now to try to resolve this deadlock.

      "sentences": "Yes. I've been outside that room where they have been meeting for the past hour or so. This is an essential moment for Kevin McCarthy, for the House, for the Republican Party and, frankly, the country determining who the next speaker of the House is, someone who will drive to party's agenda going forward, someone who essentially could determine key policy measures that could affect the lives of so many Americans.But that is unresolved at this moment where Kevin McCarthy along with a handful of his closest allies are behind closed doors with a handful of other members of that bloc of 20 members who have so far denied him the ascension to the speakership. Some of those members have pushing for a various changes, changes to the House rules, efforts to give them more power, more committee assignments, things to essentially weaken the speakership and give rank and file members like themselves more leverage over the sitting speaker. Those discussions are still ongoing. I am told by some of the members that there have been some progress along the way, including, earlier today, two Congressmen who have been in part of the talks before the meeting told me that -- who opposed McCarthy, told me that they are encouraged by the progress so far. But Kevin McCarthy has very little room for error. He could only afford to lose four Republican votes. And after the final vote, the sixth time he was rejected and was not able to get 218 votes to become the speaker of the House, several of those members still indicated they are hard no's, Andy Biggs, are for one, Bob Good for another, Matt Gaetz, a third. That means McCarthy has virtually no margin for error going forward as he tries to peel away other members who might be amenable to compromised. So, Wolf, we are at a moment here of deep uncertainty. The House cannot move forward, cannot govern, is essentially paralyzed until they decide who the speaker of the House is, which is why they plan to come back at 8:00 P.M. And at that moment, we will see. Will they move forward with another vote? Will the House Republicans try to adjourn for the night, something that will require 218 votes to do? All uncertain at this moment as they are behind closed doors trying to cut a deal as the Republican Party has been battling with each other for weeks, on publicly for the last two days with no end in sight.

And it makes it much more likely that people are going to continue to hold out and wait for that alternative to become much more of a reality.Scalise is not doing what Jim Jordan has done, which is to say, I really want to be judiciary chairman, I really don't want to be speaker, please do not put my name into nomination. Scalise has not done that, which has kept this name alive for Kevin McCarthy, and that's been really extremely problematic. The way I would describe where we are right now is that it's a good that thing that they're talking but it still would take a miracle for McCarthy at this point to become speaker. The talking is good because it means that things are moving in one direction or another but members on the Hill still don't know how many hard nos there are and how many people who are movable, and that is -- I mean, that is a very bad sign. I mean, they have been working on this for months. And the fact that they still don't know who is movable is deeply problematic is Kevin. KASIE HUNT, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL AFFAIRS ANALYST:  And the reality here is that it's been moving away from McCarthy. The momentum has been very, very slowly but it has been pulling away from him, not leaning toward him, which makes the job that he's trying to do right now all the more difficult. And, Wolf, I think, big picture, the really important thing to zero in on is the fact that this is really demonstrating what life is going to be like with Republicans attempting to have a governing majority in our United States Capitol in the House of Representatives, and this is the most acute preview of the hard things that they are not going to be able to accomplish. I mean, think about the person who does eventually get this job and what they're going to have to face down every time there's something hard to do, like raise the debt ceiling.

It's an alternative vision where at any given time, you can be thrown overboard. Who would want to do that job, right? If it's not McCarthy, who would want -- yes, my point is that it's not McCarthy, it means you're basically taking a weakened position, right?

He said something needs to happen today, some movement needs to happen today. And I think that that's what they are spending this intervening time trying to sort out. I just want to make one point about kind of this group of people exerting undue influence on the process in the Republican conference. This has been building even since the Trump days. They became empowered because someone like them, a Trump figure, became president. But even he stopped being able to control them. And I think that control is now totally out the window. So, you have people who are empowered by Trump but no longer controlled by him. And it's going to be a huge governing problem for this Republican majority because on every single issue, they do not want to play ball. And when you listen to what they are saying, if you listen very carefully to their demands, they're basically asking for every process in Congress to be done the way that each individual member wants it to be done.

We have 20. Ten of them are probably more hardcore than the other ten. Five or six of them seem to be cement, right?So, let's just assume for the sake of the conversation Kevin McCarthy somehow finds a way to be speaker, for how long? He would have very limited power. At some point, he's going to have to do something they oppose. Remember, most House Republicans have voted no for years. That's been their M.O., especially in the minority, vote no, vote no, vote no. But even in the one in a majority, voting against spending bills, voting against raising the debt ceiling. In just a couple of months, the United States government faces a choice. They are a part of the United States government, raise the debt ceiling or default. Think everybody at home. Pay your credit bills or default, right? Well, they have to raise it. So, if Kevin McCarthy goes along with Mitch McConnell and Joe Biden who will say the responsible thing for any government to do is raise the debt ceiling, yes, negotiate some tradeoffs, try to negotiate some spending cuts, try to negotiate some policy change. But the responsible thing to do in the end is cut the deal and vote, yes, well then they are going to say bye. They're going to come after whoever is speaker, whether it's Kevin McCarthy, Steve Scalise or anybody else. They're going to come after that speaker right then.",

Sanjay Gupta is with us as well. He's got some questions for Dr. Sills. But let me start. Dr. Sills, I know you're deferring, correctly so, to his medical team for the team that's treating Damar for any updates on his actual condition, but are you in touch with that team? Will they give a briefing to the public at some point? DR. ALLEN SILLS, NFL CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER:  Well, Wolf, we are in regular contact with that team and doing all that we can, of course, to support them. But I would anticipate that they'll do briefings as guided by Damar's family, which is what we all would want. We want to respect his privacy and their emotions in this time. So, we, as the NFL, have left them take the lead in providing updates but we are in regular contact with them and with the hospital and obviously with the Bills medical staff.",

It happens a lot more in sports like baseball, hockey, or lacrosse, where you got a high speed projectile that comes and hits an unprotected chest.So, I don't think at this point we can rule that out because it has been described in football players.

As you mention it happens one hour before kickoff, and that's the name, the 60-minute meeting. And it involves everyone on the medical care team from both teams. So, the team physicians, the athletic trainers, our independent personnel with our unaffiliated neuro trauma consultants, our airway doctors, our visiting team medical liaisons, the paramedics, the ambulance crew and the referee.That whole crew of people gets together one hour before the game. They review that emergency action plan. They talk specifically about locations of emergency equipment, who's going to lead if we have a cardiac arrest, how the chain of command will go. And that's an incredibly important part of our preparation. It happens before every single game, whether it's pre-season, regular season, international Super Bowl. And the referee is there because he or she obviously has command of the field and we want them to be involved as well. So, fans don't ever see that meeting. It happens underneath the stands. But to me, it's one of the most important thing we do on game day and it's part of the reason why in this tragic moment on Monday night we could have a quick, effective and really transformational response.",

And I've also cared for athletes at the high school and youth level and coached at youth sports. So, these are incredibly important questions.My answer as parent is, yes, I let my children and my grandchildren play sports because I think there are tremendous benefits. But what I want to know as a parent is, is that sports league prepared. Do they have an emergency action plan, do they have bystanders for people who are trained in emergency procedures, do they have a defibrillator present? To me, those are the key questions and I also want to make sure the league or the team that they're associated with promotes an atmosphere of safety. They're considering safety, they're keeping up with the latest in developments. And so, one of the important parts of my job as chief medical officer of the NFL is how can we help spread that work, how can we tell others what important in these areas. We know that not every youth league is going to have 30 medical professionals at a game the way we do in the NFL. But every league can have a defibrillator. Every league can have coaches in stand and bystanders who are trained in basic CPR and life support. And to me, that's the key element for all sports, not just football.",
