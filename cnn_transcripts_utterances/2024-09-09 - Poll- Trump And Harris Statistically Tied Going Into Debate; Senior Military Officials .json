      "sentences": "All right, 5Good morning, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt. It's wonderful to have you with us. Kamala Harris and Donald Trump in a statistical dead heat heading into tomorrow night's debate. A new national poll of likely voters conducted by The New York Times and Siena College shows Trump leading Harris 48 to 47 percent, well within the margin of error. That same poll shows that a strong majority of likely voters, over 60 percent, think the next president should represent a major change from President Biden. Only 25 percent of likely voters say Harris represents a major change compared to 55 percent who say she represents more of the same. Fifty-three percent say Trump represents a major change. Only 34 percent said he represents more of the same. This debate, the first and possibly only between Trump and Harris will be a critical opportunity for Harris to introduce herself and distinguish herself from Biden. Former presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg spoke with CNN's Dana Bash about what exactly Harris needs to accomplish tomorrow night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I mean, I think what we see in this polling and in other polling in the last few weeks is that she has improved her numbers greatly from where Biden was when he exited the race. She's seen a lot of momentum in the polling, but there are still gaps that have to be filled in. And she has been on kind of an introduction tour, right, with the convention and with the events that she is doing.And so the debate really, though, is the most high-profile, high- stakes moment for her to tell people about what she represents and the kinds of policies that she wants to introduce. And I think that's the other thing you hear from voters is not just that they want to know more but they really want to know what kind of policies she's talking about. And you've heard her talk a lot about the middle class -- economic policies that will help the middle class and that will help families. And I would expect to hear a lot more of that -- what she calls the \"Opportunity Economy\" that she wants to work on.",

But the bottom line is the dynamics on the stage are going to be very much driven by how Donald Trump has interacted with women over the course of his career. I think that's something I'm going to be watching for on Tuesday night because obviously, Hillary Clinton talked about there was a town hall debate where he sort of followed her around the stage.",

That voters know these things and that's not what they're going to lean into. And they are making a different choice than Clinton made. And there was debate, you know, Kasie, in the Clinton campaign at the time whether the focus should be on sort of character issues and moral issues versus policy issues. And there was a leaning into sort of Trump -- the Trump character. And Harris really has focused more heavily on sort of turning the page. I'm a new candidate.

A few seconds later they're cutting clips and blasting it out on TikTok and Instagram, right?So it's up to the campaigns to figure out which moments are going to elevate and make big and which moments get big that they don't necessarily want to get big. I think the Donald Trump side of things is going to have to make sure that they temper some of his moments down. We know that his campaign is trying to position him as being more rational and reasonable during this campaign and during this debate than he was last year. The other big thing that we're going to be watching for is how many Americans actually tune in to this debate. You noted there was 51 million between Biden and Trump. Now that seems like a big number Kasie, but actually, compared to 2016 and then some of 2020 it's not.

Even though we've seen he can be very quick on his feet, and he can have a lot of sort of one-liners and zingers, it also -- to your point with that clip -- demonstrates sometimes how loose he can be and how unpredictable he could be. And I think this election, a lot of people are looking at democracy on the ballot, decency on the ballot. Whether or not somebody can be an upstanding person on a world stage on this ballot.

For instance, he negotiated directly with the Taliban. He cut the Afghanistan government out of it. Now, you would never do that. I mean, the guy -- this is the guy that wrote \"The Art of the Deal\" but yet, one of the key players, he didn't even talk to. He negotiated for the release of 5,000 Taliban fighters that have come back to haunt us now. And everything that he did to try to set conditions to make this happen, he left an absolute mess. He also established a timeline, and that's something you would never do in military negotiation. You -- you're conditions-based, not date- based. So the entire thing was a mess.

We cannot let that happen again, Kasie. We've absolutely got to ensure that he never again comes up -- is President of the United States. So many -- just look -- what's perhaps most telling is look at all the people that used to work for him that now not only won't vote for him but believe that he is totally unfit for office. We cannot let his man -- this is a guy that coddles dictators. This is a guy that doesn't understand NATO. He thinks it's like joining a country club.

Detroit going into halftime up by a touchdown, but the Rams and their quarterback Matthew Stafford, playing on his old team, come storming back. Touchdown pass to Cooper Kupp in the fourth taking a 20-17 lead. Kupp had 14 catches, 110 yards. Game on. Lions' rookie kicker Jake Bates sending the game to overtime from 32 yards out. Then it was the David Montgomery show. Detroit winning the toss and their battering Rams running for 45 of his 91 yards on that drive, including the game-winning score. The Lions win 26-20. Miami-Dade police say they are investigating a traffic stop involving Dolphins' star Tyreek Hill. And one of the officers involved has already been placed on administrative leave. Video shows Hill being put in handcuffs, lying face down on the pavement one block from the stadium. Hill was released in time for the game and against the Jaguars he went on to catch seven passes for 130 yards, including an 80-yard touchdown in the third. Miami won 20-17 on a last-second field goal. Hill breaking out the handcuff celebration afterwards. He said he wanted to shine light on the situation, questioning what would have happened if he wasn't Tyreek Hill, and that he was still confused by his encounter with the police. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
