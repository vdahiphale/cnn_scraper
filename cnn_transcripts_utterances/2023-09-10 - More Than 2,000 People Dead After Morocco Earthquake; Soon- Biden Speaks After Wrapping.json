The rescue effort is still very much on the going. The -- pressure on these rescue teams over the last two days, it has been quite difficult to get to some of these villages, towards the epicenter. These are remote areas in the mountains, some of the roads have been damaged as a result of the earthquake. So, it has caused some delay getting those rescue teams there. We've seen videos, we've heard from eyewitnesses describe it themselves, searching for the loved ones beneath the rubble with their own bare hands. But, of course, we do know that the Moroccan government is taking the lead on that search and rescue effort, the military, of course, in charge of that process. Here in Marrakech, it feels as if people are beginning to return to some sense of normalcy, people are getting on with their lives. But there is still a sense of real fear here. You mentioned there's people been sleeping outside during the night. In another night, we saw families huddled in the streets, many of them afraid that their homes aren't safe, the structures have been damaged in that initial earthquake. They're afraid that there could be a powerful aftershock. And we have seen aftershocks today in that we only go towards heightening that sense of apprehension.",

At least that's the case.As you pointed out, within the decade, population in Africa is going to comprise a quarter of the world's population. So, I think that was an important point. It's also a real testament to Modi. The big winner here, Victor and Amara, is I think is Modi's India. He pulled off a relatively flawless summit, with a consensus and a declaration I think few people believed he could get, and he's seeking to become a bridge between the West, the developing world, and the Global South. So, for Modi, and there was very little criticism, probably no criticism of his human rights record, and his aggressive Hindu nationalism.

So to a certain extent the reaction to this from some former intelligence officials that I spoke to was sort of that old Casablanca line. I'm shocked to find that gambling is going on here. We do know that there have been a number of high-profile espionage cases involving Russian nationals in recent year. President Trump in 2018 expelled 60 Russian diplomats that the U.S. had identified as intelligence officers and ordered the closing of the Russian consulate in Seattle.Earlier this year the Justice Department under the Biden administration charged a Russian national who prosecutors had specifically said had been gathering information from American citizens about the then looming Russian invasion of Ukraine. One other thing to understand here that Wray mentioned is that Russia doesn't always use traditional intelligence officers to collect information. Moscow sometimes uses cutouts like a Mexican national arrested by U.S. authorities in 2020 for allegedly assisting Russian intelligence. Wray did say on Thursday that the U.S. has made good progress in identifying good old-fashioned Russian spies and taking them out of the country. But spying is also the world's second oldest profession as intelligence officers love to tell you. and so to some degree officials are always sort of playing whack-a-mole. One thing that we should never forget is that the U.S. is trying to do exactly the same thing. U.S. intelligence agencies are actively working to recruit their own Russian spies to provide information to the United States about Russia. The CIA just this week issued another recruitment video encouraging Russian citizens to contact them and showing them how to do so securely. So in other words, Victor, Amara -- the games continue.",
