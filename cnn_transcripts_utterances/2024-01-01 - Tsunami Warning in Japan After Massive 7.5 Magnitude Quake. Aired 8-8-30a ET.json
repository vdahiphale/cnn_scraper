      "sentences": "Good morning, everyone, and happy New Year. I'm John Berman, and we are following breaking news out of Japan this morning. A powerful earthquake measuring 7.5 has triggered evacuations and a tsunami warning. You're looking at the moment the quake struck, video from along the coast there. You can see the shaking. It went on for some time.Here's more video from the Ishikawa Prefecture in Japan. The population there is about a million people. This is on the western coast of Japan, about 185 miles from Tokyo. Again, from this footage, you can see just how long this shaking went on for. You can see the poles there on the left starting to sway. Ultimately, this did lead to some building collapses, and shortly, you'll see, dust rising from the collapsed building there on the left side of your screen. Again, very powerful shaking, felt by millions of people. About a million people or so in the more severe area where this earthquake struck. Japanese officials have not lowered their tsunami alert from a major tsunami warning. It is now a tsunami warning, period. They could expect waves of up to 10 feet there. And the aftershocks, they're warning, could last days. We are getting new video from inside a parking garage. You can see here, these cars just shaking there inside this solid structure. Again, you get a sense of the power of this earthquake. We have team coverage this morning. Derek Van Dam is tracking the tsunami threat. We're going to start with Hanako Montgomery, who is live from Tokyo. Give us the latest from there.",

      "sentences": "Yes, good morning, John. So right now, as you mentioned, the tsunami warning has been lowered. We're still expecting to see 10 feet of waves, though, so still very, very frightening and daunting for many people living in Ishikawa Prefecture. Just to note some of the damage that we've been seeing, at least 33,000 homes have lost power. Others have collapsed. We're seeing reports of people being trapped under their homes, as well.We're also knowing that about 1,000 self-defense force personnel have been dispatched and they're trying to confirm any of the survivors in Ishikawa Prefecture. We also know that 20 self-defense force planes and also other vessels are trying to confirm just the extent of this damage. So this powerful, powerful earthquake was also a shallow earthquake, which is very significant to note, because with shallow earthquakes, they can actually trigger very powerful and destructive tsunamis. Even though the tsunami level has been dropped down to just a tsunami warning, we are still expecting to see large waves coming out of the western part of Japan, John.",

However, of course this moment, this terrible, terrible moment in Japanese history, the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, is very present in many people's minds. Today is New Year's Day here in Japan, when people are celebrating with their families, with their friends at home, and suddenly, their TVs are telling them to evacuate, to get to higher ground. And just a very frightening moment for many people in the country, specifically on western Japan, that coast, where you actually don't historically see very many earthquakes of this size. So, again, just a lot of scared feelings and just a lot of tension right now to see what kind of damage this subsequent tsunami could bring to western Japan, John.",

It happened on the western coast of Japan, which is not one of the areas that I think we're really used to seeing earthquakes in Japan. This threat that you're talking about, how long will it go on for, Derek? When will people there breathe a sigh of relief?",

      "sentences": "Well, in terms of the shaking, so let's talk about aftershocks. This is just going off of previous earthquakes with similar magnitudes, we have aftershocks that can last for hours, days, even weeks after the initial magnitude earthquake, a 7.5 earthquake. And the way that's broken down, because this is a level of magnitude, depending on how far you go back in terms of power and strength of the actual earthquake. So on average, with a quake of 7.5 originally, we have at least one earthquake, an aftershock, I should say, of 6.5 or greater. And typically with this scenario, we also experience 10 or so aftershocks of magnitude of 5.5 or higher.So putting this all together, you've got to think about the type of construction that houses the homes, the apartment complexes in this area. It is a mixture of concrete in some of the more sturdier earthquake susceptible areas, but also some buildings and structures could made out of wood. So they have been destabilized. So initial aftershocks could potentially take down those buildings easier than it would be with the original earthquake. And then we've got to think about just the natural curvature of the Ishikawa Prefecture with the magnitude 7.5 earthquake occurring just offshore that is going to wrap around waves, and that's going to splash in between these bays and coastline that face west across this area.",

You can see where it hit, in the western coast of Japan. It happened several hours ago. We are seeing new video come in. You can see fire there that ignited sometime after the quake. This is the first time we're seeing this.Let's get more on this from Dr. Mohammad Heidarzadeh, senior lecturer at the University of Bath and secretary general of the Joint Tsunami Commission of the International Union of Geodesy Physics (ph). Doctor, thank you so much for being with us. What is your unique concern with this earthquake?",

And obviously, as Professor, you were saying, that is a major concern given what happened in 2011 with the Fukushima plant on the other side of Japan.But as of now, and again, we're watching this very closely, no abnormalities at the nuclear plants. Given that this happened on the western coast of Japan and if people look at a map, they can see the water there, the bay is between Japan and Korea and Russia there. We've been hearing some concerns that basically the water can cattle go back and forth, and back and forth there. What would that do?",

      "sentences": "Yes, definitely. This is actually an challenge that we have at this part of Japan, because they are having like a closed basin, and if we have a tsunami in a closed space, then the tsunami will be oscillating for 24 hours, sometimes 48 -- two days, 48 hours, two days, and this is going to be making large waves and the superposition of the waves could be making lots of lots of waves, very large waves.And this is very different from the east side of Japan, because at the east side, we have the open ocean, and the tsunami waves would dissipate into the ocean very rapidly, but here, the waves are kind of trapped and these trapped waves have been responsible, actually, for many problems, many -- the main disruptions in other parts of the world and this is a major concern and I'm sure that my Japanese colleagues are aware of that. And that's why they are asking everyone to stay away from the coast for a long period of time, at least half a day, and maybe it is better to stay away one day, because the largest wave is going to be coming maybe in the next few hours.",

So that's why these are the reasons that we have to stay away from the coast at least half a day and up to one day and to watch the coast closely, because the largest aftershocks are going to happen, usually, within one day after the main shock.",

We shouldn't really look back or wait for something -- just evacuate as soon as you have. And I think this is very simple -- it looks very simple, but still we are actually facing lots of problems in terms of the coastal evacuation. And still, some people in some parts of the world are staying, watching, and this is not really helpful. And certainly, we saw that in Indonesia in 2018. Of course, Japan is much more prepared. They have lots of tools. They have lots of tsunami warnings on their cell phones and there are sirens on the coast and we hope that this situation is going to be very, very better than 2011.",

It sounds like there are quite a number of buildings that have collapsed and maybe some people trapped in the rubble. We don't know yet any confirmation of fatalities. But unfortunately, I think there will be a few, you know, buckled roads, stopped train, stopped planes.

You know, this time around, it seems, fingers crossed, that it hasn't been nearly as bad as it was in 2011, but I think people take these warnings really seriously now.

You know, there are not very many of the 50-some odd plants, and some of them have already been decommissioned, so there are probably less than that now.But many of the plants never restarted after 2011, and those in the region were not operating before this earthquake, that being said, there is one with two reactors, right in Ishikawa Prefecture, which was the epicenter. They didn't report any radioactive abnormalities, thank goodness. But they did say that there was some power cut to a cooling pump for the spent fuel rods, for the nuclear fuel rods that need to be cooled, you know, for a very long period of time after they're taken out of the reactors. Those cooling pumps stopped for something like 25 minutes, but they're back online, and they say there are no problems with that now.

So that's one of the biggest problems for these kinds of disasters at the moment.  The governor of this prefecture did call in the Self-Defense Forces for help so that can often be an assistance to the overwhelmed police. The police are saying they're getting too many calls to respond to, so that's part of the problem that they, you know, the population is so low that even like the hospitals, they can't get enough doctors there to treat the people who are coming in.",
