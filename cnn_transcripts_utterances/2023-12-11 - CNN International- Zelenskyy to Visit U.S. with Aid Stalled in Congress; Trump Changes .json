      "sentences": "President Zelenskyy's visit to Washington on Tuesday will come at a critical moment as lawmakers are working to come up with a package that would include new aid for Ukraine, along with new rules on migration into the United States. And certainly, the fact that President Biden invited Zelenskyy to visit Washington tells you that the administration is looking for some kind of dramatic way to break the impasse on Capitol Hill.So, while he is in DC, he will meet with President Biden at the White House to discuss what President Biden's aides say is vital American support for Ukraine. But he will also be on Capitol Hill. Zelenskyy will speak to all senators at a meeting in person and he will meet as well with the Republican House Speaker, Mike Johnson. And certainly, his challenge will be in convincing some of these skeptical Republicans that the $60 billion in additional American assistance that President Biden is requesting for Ukraine could make a difference on the battlefield as Ukraine remains bogged down in this counteroffensive that hasn't necessarily changed the battle lines so far. But already you're hearing some Republicans sort of opposed Zelenskyy's visit. JD Vance, the Conservative Republican from Ohio, said that Zelenskyy will come to Washington and demand that Congress care more about his border than our own. And remember, these talks are tied together with this conversation about tightening the rules on migration into the United States. We did hear Sunday from the two senators who are sort of leading those discussions. The Democrat, Chris Murphy, and the Republican James Lankford. It did not appear as if they were any closer to an agreement, listen to what they said. SEN. CHRIS MURPHY (D-CT):  I think this is one of the most dangerous moments that I've ever faced in American politics, and I wish Republicans weren't holding Israel aid and aid to Ukraine hostage to the resolution of immigration reform.",

Because right now, as was just noted in that report, everything in the United States has been highly politicized. Obviously, we have an election coming up. And so, any issue and especially Ukraine, where you're talking about, you know, big amounts of money, you've got this package, overall package of $106 billion -- 60 billion of which would go to Ukraine, the rest would go to Israel, to the border and some other Taiwan, in fact, but 60 billion is a lot of money.And as American lawmakers look at it, they don't believe that there is much progress that the Ukrainians are making. And also, they know -- at least the Republicans know -- that Joe Biden is really kind of over the barrel on this. He needs to continue that funding that is a major purpose that he's set out to do. And so, they can hold him and they can pressure him on this issue of the border. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Now Trump had been expected to take the stand again in the civil fraud case, despite his lawyers advising him not to because of the gag order in effect that prevents him from criticizing court staff.On Thursday, one of Trump's lawyers said the former president was adamant about testifying because he wanted to reiterate how unfairly he had been treated by the judge and prosecutors in this case. Trump's lawyer, Chris Kise, released a new statement Sunday saying Trump had, quote, nothing more to say to a judge who imposed an unconstitutional gag order. And accused the judge of ignoring Trump's previous testimony in the case. The New York Attorney General issued her own statement on Sunday, accusing Trump of trying to distract from the facts of the case, which she says, proved he committed years of financial fraud and unjustly enriched himself and his family. Now it's important to note that the judge in this case has already ruled that Trump did commit fraud and this trial was simply to determine the damages, the former president must pay.

First of all, as Zach just said, Trump has already lost a piece of this case. The judge has already ruled against Donald Trump for the AG on one of the causes of action. It's not as if Donald Trump's testimony was going to get the judge to reverse himself.The other thing is, Donald Trump already testified in this case. He was called to the stand as one of the AG's witnesses. That did not go well for Donald Trump. His testimony was all over the map, was non- responsive at times, was self contradictory. So, looking at this from a lawyer's point of view, there is no reason for him to get up on the stand. Now politics and PR wise -- that's not my area -- but legally here he's done the least dangerous thing by deciding not to testify. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And Israel's, you know, continues to say that this is, you know, they're seeing some success when it comes to eradicating Hamas. They say they've now killed some 7,000 militants, Hamas militants, since the start of this conflict. But how they are prosecuting this war now that it has expanded is still a major focus.
