Shelter prices, as you just saw there, shelter prices did rise and that contributed to the rise in core inflation.Now hard to miss, shelter prices rising, food prices continuing to rise, gas prices continuing to rise. These are basic categories. These are basic necessities. So Americans are clearly still feeling the pinch. On the other hand, we saw some declines. We saw used cars and trucks, those prices declined. If you sort of zero into the food category, you see dairy prices fell, vegetables fell, fruits fell. So we are seeing some silver linings there in the report. In terms of what this means for the Federal Reserve, there are two questions that we often ask ourselves, will the Fed pause? And when will the Fed start cutting? In terms of a pause, the expectation is overwhelmingly that they will pause next week and they will not at least raise rates when we hear from them exactly a week from today. But when will they start cutting? Well, that's a different category altogether. I heard you earlier, Brianna, talking about mortgage rates. Diane Swonk, the chief economist of KPMG, saying in a note this morning, the Fed needs quarters, not months, quarters not months of fundamentally cooling inflation to cut rates. So basically we got a little bit longer to go.",

The NFL Player Association is calling for all stadiums to use high quality natural grass on the field. This after New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers suffered a season ending Achilles injury during Monday night's game. The players association says real grass is simply safer than artificial turf. Some argue, though, there is no difference between the two when it comes to injuries. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell says the league will rely on science to figure out the best way forward. Also, Hurricane Lee is likely to threaten parts of New England as the storm churns northwest in the open Atlantic. Right now, you see it there it is about 400 miles southwest of Bermuda. A tropical storm warning is in effect there. Lee is expected to weaken, but wind gusts could impact portions of Connecticut and Eastern Massachusetts on Friday night. High winds, heavy rainfall, storm surge, all of that could impact other parts of New England and Eastern Canada over the weekend. And a congresswoman is mourning the loss of her husband after a plane crash in Alaska. Democrat Mary Peltola's office posted the tragic news on Twitter, formerly X, saying that Eugene \"Buzzy\" Peltola Jr. had, quote, a delightful sense of humor that lightened the darkest moments. He was completely devoted to his parents, kids, siblings, extended family and friends, and he simply adored Mary. Eugene Peltola was the regional director of the Alaska Bureau of Indian Affairs for several years before he retired recently in 2022. Jim, very sad news.",

The announcement comes just weeks after authorities there said they're now actively investigating potential links between Rader and various cold cases in the region.He was arrested back in 2005, confessed to nearly a dozen brutal murders spanning from the mid-1970s to the early 1990s.

They don't and never have thought they have the information to arrest him on any case at this point, but they are continuing to follow all leads as they come in, because the focus is justice for any potential victims' families because many people in the Oklahoma and near the Kansas state line don't know what happened to their loved one that went missing during that time that Dennis Rader was active.",

And there was actually an attempt today, Boris, by a fishing research vessel in Greenland, which tried to tug the boat out, that has also failed.Now, you're looking there at a map. You can see with the circle exactly where this cruise ship is on the east coast of Greenland. There are some other ships nearby. There's help on the way. It just might take some time. So a Danish Royal Navy ship is en route. We were told it would get there by Friday morning due to some bad weather. That now looks like Friday evening. If there is an emergency, there is a dog sled patrol unit, it's very nearby. It's about an hour and a half away. It's been on board already to check all the passengers are OK. And we have a statement from Aurora Expeditions, which is the Australian operator of this cruise ship. They say, all passengers, the expedition team and crew on board are safe and well. Importantly, there is no immediate danger to themselves, the vessel or the surrounding environment. So hopefully that continues to be the case. This is very much an extended cruise.

Dimethyl sulfide, the indications of this kind of sketchy right now, but that would be associated with life. The bottom line is scientists look at that and say, yes, maybe there's a lot of water here. Maybe there's actual water. Maybe there is some kind of life here.
