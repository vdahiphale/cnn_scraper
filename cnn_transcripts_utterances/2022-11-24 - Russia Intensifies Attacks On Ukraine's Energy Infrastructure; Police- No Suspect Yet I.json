For the first time in 40 years, all of the country's nuclear plants were shut down. CNN's Sam Kiley is live in Zaporizhzhia at the site of one of those nuclear plants. This was also a protective measure, Sam.",

      "sentences": "Yes. They're not shut down in the sense that they are deactivating the cores and the reactors that would be very, very difficult indeed. But what happens is that when the national infrastructure of electricity is attacked in this way, the cooling system for those nuclear reactors gets compromised, and they have to switch to diesel generators that are on site. And of course, they are vulnerable to break down fuel supply, and so on.And if they fail, then you could go into a meltdown. So for the first time in 40 years, the nuclear powers stations across the country with supply 50 percent of Ukraine's power, electrical power, was shut down in this wave upon wave of cruise missiles that slammed into targets right across the country. Most were shot down, I have to say, Erica, but those that get through are clearly part of an ongoing campaign, the seventh wave the government says, of attempts by the Russians to break the back of the civilian back of the war effort here in Ukraine. Ukrainians, of course, as ever, so far, picking themselves up repairing the systems and getting the power back. But 10 people killed, including a two-day-old baby here in Zaporizhzhia. Erica?",

What's at stake?JOHN HERBST, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO UKRAINE: It's very simple, our security and our prosperity. Putin's war and Ukraine is only a prelude to further moves into NATO countries. And if he does, he'll to succeed in Ukraine and move for example, on Estonia or Latvia, we will be obliged to send American soldiers to fight and die to stop them there. So we will lose American lives. And the cost of doing this will be far more than the aid we sent to Ukraine. So the authors of that letter calling to end our assistance to Ukraine are sharply limited, simply don't understand American national security interest.

This new development as a result, in fact, of the success of American export controls, which have greatly weakened the soul of the Russian arms industry, so they need Iranian drones. But here to administration timidity is the problem. Those drones are wreaking havoc on Ukrainian civilians and Ukrainian infrastructure. If we sent Ukraine the attack missiles which can travel 300 kilometers, they could strike the basis in Crimea from which those drones are being launched.Many Ukrainian lives would be saved and Ukrainian infrastructure, energy, heating, water would be in much better shape. The administration is considering this but not agreeing from us. It's time for them to move.",

That would be Kaylee Gonsalves.And when you look at what the police are saying is that they've heard this through witness interviews of people who knew them. And several say that they heard this from several people. But police are saying they haven't confirmed this, nor have they been able to identify anyone.

Also, both Gonsalves and another one of these young people who was murdered Madison Mogen. They both tried to call a man shortly before they were killed. They now believe that that person who didn't answer those calls, was not involved in this as well. And her family, Gonsalves' family, believes that that was perhaps her ex-boyfriend, so they don't believe that's the person either.

And given the old, not in my house, and made it where some of the kids are not welcome there. And so it's hard for them on one end, it's hard for them because they don't have a family to go home and celebrate the holidays with, they don't have a family to be, have a laugh with, they don't have a family just to have a shoulder with and just hang out with and be there with.And it's not only for LGBTQ plus community. But, you know, for others who can't make it home as well, some college students, unfortunately, are still poor are still here for the holidays and can't make it back home to their places because of whatever reason. And so this is not only hard on our LGBTQ plus community, but it's hard on other communities as well. And so this type of event, and especially during this tragic time, after the unfortunate tragedy that happened just a few days ago at Club Q, this event is more important now than ever, to show that we here in Colorado Springs, we love and accept every person and we have a place where they can come and be their true authentic self, and have that environment to just love themselves in. You know, it's so important that this -- on this community know that they are welcome in Colorado Springs. There's many people right now, unfortunately, who are questioning their LGBT questioning, do I belong here? Do I have a place here? And we're trying to show them that, you know, you all do have a place here, you do belong here and you matter here. This isn't just a place for one side of use.
