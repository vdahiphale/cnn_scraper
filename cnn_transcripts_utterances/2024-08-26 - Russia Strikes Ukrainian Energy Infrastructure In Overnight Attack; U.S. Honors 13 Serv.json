The blast also killed about 170 Afghans. Today, President Biden released a written statement calling the servicemembers who lost their lives, \"patriots in the highest sense.\" And former President Trump laid wreaths at Arlington National Cemetery to honor the Abbey-Gate 13. He also laid flowers at the grave of Staff Sergeant Ryan Christian Knauss, who is the only member of the Army killed during the attack. And Trump also spoke on the phone with my next guest, as he did that, Ryan's mom, Paula Knauss Selph. Paula, thank you so much for joining us today, as you are remembering your son. And I do want to talk with you about your search for accountability over the bombing.

You may have inflammation of the brain in some cases. So that's why this is something that health officials are watching closely, particularly in Massachusetts. But when it comes to Triple E or West Nike Virus, Brianna, these are all good reminders that mosquitoes, they are some of the deadliest animals in the world because they spread diseases like this through mosquito bites. And that's why it's so important to try to avoid mosquito bites by wearing repellants, wearing loose-fitting clothing. Make sure your window screens are in place so mosquitoes do not fly indoors. And if you do have a mosquito bite and, if a few days later, you develop a fever or other symptoms, definitely talk to your doctor because you just want to make sure you're staying on top of things, especially around this time of year -- Brianna?",
