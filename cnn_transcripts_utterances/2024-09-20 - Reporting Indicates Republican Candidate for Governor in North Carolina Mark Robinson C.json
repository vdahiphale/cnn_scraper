And this governor's race is reverberating throughout that campaign, there is no doubt. Former President Donald Trump will be going to North Carolina tomorrow to campaign. We will see if he mentions this or appears alongside the lieutenant governor. That is unlikely. But look, the reality of this is this was already a very challenging race for Republicans, but North Carolina is emerging in the late chapter here of this presidential campaign as one of the closest swing states, and here is why. It was the narrowest margin of victory for Donald Trump in 2020, just 74,000 votes were separating he and Joe Biden. Now, Republicans are worried that this is going to sort of hurt the entire slate of candidates. The Republican senator in the state, Thom Tillis, made this very clear in a tweet last night. Let's take a look at that. He said \"It was a very tough day. We must stay focused on the races we can win. We have to make sure President Trump wins North Carolina.\" And he goes on to say he is worried about that, to support others candidates. \"If Harris takes North Carolina,\" he says, \"she can take the White House. We can't let that happen.\" So look, the fallout from this is slightly unclear. North Carolina has a history of splitting the ticket. The Democratic Governor Roy Cooper, he won in 2016 and 2020, and Donald Trump also won those years. So we don't know the fallout of this, but Republicans are worried that Mark Robinson and all of the baggage he has brought to this certainly it will hurt their ticket, John.",

He had a long record and was vetted, and the GOP and Trump world decided to go with him.

You see the top of the ticket, which in this case is the presidential race, can have a trickle-down effect below the ballot, on down-ballot below them. But it's very rare for the reverse to occur.

She is detouring, rerouting, going to Georgia to focus in on reproductive rights, to highlight, spotlight, especially these tragic deaths that have been reported by ProPublica. The mother of Amber Thurman was at that event, that streaming event with Oprah last night talking about what has happened to their family. The focus in on this, that is not -- that is not surprising.

      "sentences": "Listen, I think it's potentially hugely impactful, and it's a smart place for Kamala Harris to play. Listen the debate around reproductive rights, Democrats have wisely framed it as something much more broader than simply access to abortion. Abortion is an issue that the country is pretty 50, 50-50 on related to just whether they support or don't. But this is much more about the full suite of reproductive rights, getting lifesaving care if you're somebody who is losing a pregnancy, access to IVF, access to birth control.In this story, I don't know a woman left, right, or center that it doesn't break their heart, it doesn't resonate with them. And frankly, I don't know that I know a pro-life woman who thinks that you shouldn't get lifesaving care even if it requires an abortion, if it's going to protect the future fertility and life of the mother. So these are the stories that plays so well with swing voters, with moderate Republicans and the people she needs to win. And it makes it less about the radioactive issue of on-demand aboard portion that sometimes isn't really what's going to motivate swing voters. It's much more the broader aspect of reproductive rights.",

It's so much easier today to fight against things. And that's why abortion is an animating issue for Democrats, because in 2022 and now in 2024, they're fighting against the repeal of Roe v. Wade from the Supreme Court, which Republicans for 50 some years were fighting against Roe v. Wade itself and trying to get it repealed.So Kamala Harris is smart to go there. This is a margin of error race. \"The Atlanta Journal-Constitution\" came out with a poll this week. It shows that this race between Trump and Harris is a statistical tie in Georgia. And the issue of abortion is high on the list for young voters. And I also found interesting in that poll that black voters and young voters between 18 and 29 are the most likely to potentially change their mind. Very small percentage, about two or three percent, but those are the folks that Kamala Harris needs to reach. And this is the kind of issue that she can reach them on.",
