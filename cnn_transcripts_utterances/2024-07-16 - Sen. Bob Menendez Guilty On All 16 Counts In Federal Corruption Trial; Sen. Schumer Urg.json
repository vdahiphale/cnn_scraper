And that involves looking at the call records of seeing what -- who we was talking to and what actions he was taking officially after those interactions. And, you know, one of the men charged in this case initially agreed to cooperate and he was someone that testified at this trial, which his firsthand testimony, this alleged conspiracy. I think we're seeing the prosecutor start to walk up to the mic, so we should hear very shortly from the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, Damian Williams, who will be taking the podium to address the conviction in this case. I'm looking to see if he has walked out yet. I don't think he has. But he will be speaking to the cameras soon about this monumental prosecution of the sitting U.S. Senator. And the former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on these serious charges of acting as a foreign agent and using the power of his office. That was a theme throughout this trial, that he had abused and sold the power his office to do things that we're seemingly small, interfering in a criminal prosecution to help out a friend. But that were also so much more significant and more of a betrayal of the trust that the constituents had put in him to act on their behalf and represent them in Congress and not that of a foreign government.

This case has always been about shocking levels of corruption. Hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes in the form of cash, gold bars, a Mercedes Benz. This wasn't politics as usual. This was politics for profit. And now that a jury has convicted Bob Menendez, his years of selling his office to the highest bidder there have finally come to an end. I want to thank the career prosecutors and law enforcement agents and analysts who meticulously investigated and prosecuted this case. Their work is the reason why this shocking corruption has finally been unearthed and brought to an end. They are the best of the best. I'm enormously proud of them and proud to serve with them.

I'm the acting assistant director of the FBI's New York Field Office. Today is a day a victory and a victory for justice. Public corruption investigations like this hold our leaders accountable and ensure they serve the public interest and not their -- they serve the public's interests and not their own. This conviction comes after careful investigation and hard work by the FBI, IRS, any the U.S. attorney's office. The FBI's pursuit of truth and integrity was instrumental in securing this conviction. When an elected official betrays the trust placed in them, it undermines the foundation of our democracy. Thank you. SAM MANUEL (ph) GOMEZ, IRSCI: My name is Sam Manuel (ph) Gomez, and I'm with IRSCI, Criminal Investigation. I'm especially in charge in the New York Field Office. Thank you and good afternoon. Thank you to U.S. Attorney Damian Williams for hosting us today. It is a great commitment and collaboration between IRS agents, the FBI, and SDNY that today's verdict was possible. I would like to recognize the work of the FBI Public Corruption CI Squad, the SDNY Public Corruption Unit, trial attorneys and paralegals for the tremendous effort in presenting this case, and the SDNY tax attorneys. I will -- I want to specifically recognize the IRS CI special agent who worked this case in tandem with FBI special agents. Today's verdict is a reflection of all the hard work. Job, well done.

He, of course, was facing, back in 2017, bribery and corruptioncharges, which the jury didn't reach a verdict.

And I think it really redoubled their resolve to bring him to justice. And it was that little -- almost a bread crumb thrown to his -- to the FBI and his folks who've worked on the Menendez cases not just now, but for years, that that Damian Williams, a very solid professional by-the-book prosecutor, gave that extra important detail.",

He said, \"Today's verdict, finding Senator Bob Menendez guilty on those counts, demonstrates the Senator broke the law, violated the trust of his constituents, and betrayed his oath of office. It also shows that, in America, that everyone, no matter how powerful, is accountable to our laws.\" He says, \"Senator Menendez received a fair trial and due process of law as he was titled to under our Constitution.\" And he goes on to thank the public servants, obviously, who served in this case. He reiterated his call for Menendez to resign immediately after being found guilty of endangering national security and the integrity of our criminal justice system. And he says, \"If he refuses to vacate his office, I call on the U.S. Senate to vote to expel him.\" Back to sentencing, which is October 29th, shortly before the election here, what do you think is a reasonable and a just amount of time for Senator Menendez to serve for what he has been found guilty of?",

I have every faith that the law and the facts did that sustain that decision and that we will be successful upon appeal. I have never violated my public oath. I have never been anything but a patriot of my country and for my country. I have never, ever been a foreign agent.

The Bureau of Prisons will make an initial determination. And someone who has committed a heinous crime, but has nevertheless a well-behaved prisoner, not a security risk, can either initially or work their way up to a fairly low security incarceration. So in other words, the seriousness of his crimes, all the things we're talking about today, do not translate into a more secure kind of detention unless he himself is in danger.

It is at once a kind of down-and-dirty Jersey bribe, but also this much more important national security gloss that the jury has now found beyond a reasonable doubt. So these protestations by Menendez that he -- he didn't act that way will have zero purchase at sentencing as opposed to the legal arguments that maybe he can offer. So, yes. What is in the mind of Judge Sam Stein when it comes to this extra very important feature, that's what well find out on the 29th.

I want to just pull back for a second though and lay out the fact that, right now, he is receiving pressure to step aside from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. It's not clear that Schumer will be able to convince him. It's not clear if Schumer is going to try to call Senator Menendez. What we have seen so far is the statement from Senator Schumer. But we should point out that this call for him to resign is new from the majority leader. Prior to this moment, Schumer had made clear that he wanted this case to play out. He had said that he was disappointed in Menendez, that there are standards in the Senate. But he had not gone as far as asking Menendez to resign. We are also getting some new reaction from Andy Kim, who is running to replace Senator Menendez in this seat. In a statement, he said, quote, \"This is a sad and somber day for New Jersey and our country. Our public servants should work for the people. And today, we saw the people judge that Senator Menendez as guilty and unfit to serve. \"I called on Senator Menendez to step down when these charges we're first made public. And now that he has been found guilty, I believe the only course of action for him is to resign his seat immediately.\" And again, Brianna, we talked a little bit about this a few minutes ago. But right now, if Senator Menendez decides that he is not going to resign his seat, there is action that Senate leadership can take. And that includes calling for a vote to expel him from the Senate. That would take two-thirds of the members voting in order to do that. But, you know, Brianna, perhaps given the fact that the election is just around the corner, that is an option for Democrats. Especially given the fact that you can imagine some Democrats in red states, who already have tough elections, do not want to be talking about this as they are running back home -- Brianna?",

Convention goers cheered for him and his new vice-presidential pick, a former Never Trumper, the Senator of Ohio, J.D. Vance. The two became the official nominees of the Republican ticket last night. But tonight's theme of the convention will make a focus on making America safer again. That is to go along with an overall message of unity that Trump says he is pushing after nearly being killed. We're going to see how tonight's slate of Republican speakers are going to live up to Trump's call, including some former rivals, Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis.
