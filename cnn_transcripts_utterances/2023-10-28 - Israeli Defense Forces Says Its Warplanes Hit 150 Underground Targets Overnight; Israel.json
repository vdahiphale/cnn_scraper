I'm Fredricka Whitfield in Atlanta, alongside Sara Sidner in Tel Aviv.I'll get to you again, Sara in a moment as we start a new hour, we're following this \"BREAKING NEWS\". Israel's defense minister announcing a short time ago that the IDF has moved to a new phase in the war against Hamas. Israeli soldiers are now operating inside of the Gaza Strip. Overnight, the IDF's armored vehicles and tanks were on the move. But at this point, it remains unclear if this is actually the beginning of Israel's anticipated major ground assault in Gaza. And ahead of those troops entering the enclave, overnight, Israel unleashed an onslaught of sustained aerial bombardment that rocked Gaza. Buildings were reduced to rubble. And today, the IDF renewed its warning for civilians in northern Gaza to evacuate. Doctors there say they treated hundreds of wounded overnight, but they were also there have been many killed in the airstrikes. The IDF says the airstrikes targeted 150 underground Hamas combat spaces and terror tunnels. Israeli officials claimed they killed one key Hamas operative, who, it says, helped carry out the deadly October 7th terror attacks in Israel. And we're also watching new military activity unfold along Israel's border with Lebanon. The IDF and militant group, Hezbollah continuing to exchange fire on that front. CNN's Sara Sidner picks up our coverage on the ground there in Israel. Sara.",

We have seen just a fierce air attack from Israel over Gaza.We also know, as you mentioned, Fred, that there are troops now on the ground in Gaza. Although, it is not the main offensive that everyone thought it might be -- the ground offensive that everyone thought may happen. It is a much smaller group of people, soldiers -- Israeli soldiers that are in Gaza. We have been seeing the airstrikes feeling the rumble like thunder over our heads here in Tel Aviv from those airstrikes in Gaza and seeing rockets come over from Gaza, from Hamas into Israel. You are seeing those shots there of the Iron Dome, intercepting rockets one after the other. About a half dozen rockets have come over Tel Aviv in the last 30 minutes. Now, let's go now to our Jeremy Diamond. He is live in Sderot, Israel. Sderot is very, very close. As close as you can get really to Gaza, the border there. Jeremy, Israeli soldiers are on the move. We've been seeing some of the video of the trucks going in. But the IDF also renewing its message to Gaza citizens to evacuate. What are you seeing and hearing right now on the border? And I think we are getting -- OK, there is another rocket that is coming in, or IDF -- Sorry, one moment, I just need to turn around to see. All right. So, we just saw another -- you might hear a boom in a minute. We just saw another Iron Dome interception, just over my shoulder here. And we see those quite often. So, I just wanted to check to see where it was to make sure that we're in a fairly safe place. All right. Now to you, Jeremy on that border, which is extremely close to Gaza, what are you hearing and seeing there?",

And then, not too long, after you see them go out, we see them here in Tel Aviv. And of course, you've been in Ashkelon. What are you seeing as far as any damaged in Sderot?

In Ashkelon, I can tell you that just a couple of days ago, there were two impacts that were made. And so, it's important to keep in mind that while the Iron Dome does intercept, the overwhelming majority of those rockets, some of them do still make it through.Ashkelon, in fact, is the city that has seen the most rocket fire of any city in Israel. But what we have really been watching over these last several days, as Israel has intensified its bombardment inside of Gaza is we have seen those casualties inside of Gaza really start to rise in a dramatic way. More than 7,000 people have been killed. And of those 7,000 people, more than 3,000 of them are believed to be children, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, and that is the results, of course, of this bombardment. And of, of course, the fact that we know Hamas is very much operating within civilian areas. And, you know, just yesterday, the IDF claims that Hamas is operating from underground facilities underneath Gaza largest hospital, al-Shifa hospital, inside of Gaza. Where not only are critically injured people being treated, but also where thousands have been seeking shelter. Now, the IDF, the only evidence that they provided for that was this alleged intercepted conversation between two Gazans. They said they had additional intelligence that was shared with the U.S. and other countries. But, of course, we can't independently verify those claims, and Palestinians have denied it. But certainly, one of the main challenges of this operation being carried out by the Israelis now is the fact that there are those miles and miles of underground facilities that Hamas maintains not only where they are hiding many of these hostages, but also where they are hiding their fighters, where they carry out these various rocket attacks. And the fact that this underground city exists underneath the very real city above ground where civilians are as well inevitably leads to risk. IDF forces insists that they take measures to try and avoid civilian casualties. But we know, of course, that the toll of civilian casualties has simply been too high from just a human perspective as you watch what is happening on the ground in Gaza over these last several weeks.",

And there is talk of what a prolonged siege might look like in Gaza, and particular in Gaza City, because the Israeli military has told people to leave, go from the north to the south. But even the south is getting hit by airstrikes.What would this look like if they decided to do a full-scale war from the ground and the sky? ZWACK: Sara, this is a really, really hard question. I think first of all, they would work to seal off the city. Yet, they are -- they are struggling with creating conduits out for the Palestinians still remain up in northern Gaza. So, but they've got to seal it off, you know, the debate over -- the things that are going in and fuel, unfortunately, Hamas is also using lots of fuel for its tunnels and generators and all that. So, how do you manage that? A siege is hardest, as you saw on Leningrad and places like that, on the civilian population. So, while the presence of Hamas has a chokehold on that population, it's also wears out. Meanwhile, in that siege, we call it sat, I would have to believe that the IDF will be turning up the pressure on the ground, and just, you know, just block by block, basement by basement, tunnel by tunnel, trying to ferret out these guys. And also remember, we have the hostages there, which also makes this so devilishly complicated. But to sit and siege them -- besieged them with a lot of civilians on the top, still in there. I don't think it will work in that environment, for some of the reasons I've tried to suggest before.",

We're learning new details about the investigation to that mass shooting in Maine, Wednesday that killed 18 people and injured 13.We now know the shooter's body was found yesterday inside a box trailer at a recycling center parking lot in the town of Lisbon. Investigators say 40-year-old Robert Card died of an apparent self- inflicted gunshot wound, ending a two-day manhunt in southern Maine. The rampage in Lewiston was the deadliest mass shooting in the U.S. this year, and the deadliest since the Uvalde, Texas school massacre. I'm joined now by CNN crime and justice correspondent Shimon Prokupecz, who is live for us in Lewiston. So, Shimon, what more do we learn, last hour? SHIMON PROKUPECZ, CNN'S CRIME AND JUSTICE REPORTER: Yes, police certainly releasing a lot more information now that the shooter is dead. They said they were able to release more information on the investigation. We know that he was found last night at 7:45 inside this trailer at the recycling plant in the area where they've been searching for the past few days. What we learned is that police found a total of three guns; a long gun in his car, and then, two additional guns that were on him, or in the trailer, when they found him. We also learned that they are looking as part of the motive here as to what was going on in this individual's life that may have led to this. They say there is a mental health component to that. They were looking at that, that he thought people may have been speaking badly about him at these locations that he attacked, that he was hearing voices. And so, that is something that they are looking into. And what's helping them try to unravel all of this is the shooter's family. They say that they have been very cooperative and helping them. We also learned as we've been reporting the last several days, but now on the record confirmation that they found a note. When they searched the shooters home, they found a note that he'd left. The police describing it as a paper-style note. And in that note, he left information for a family member, indicating to police that he did not expect to survive. Here is police talking a little bit about that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But let's first start with CNN's Kevin Liptak, who is with the President in Delaware.

Alex, I'd like to start with you now, how might this military operation which includes being on the ground, although not an extensive ground war, but expanded military operation on the ground? How might that impact the lives of the hostages being held in Gaza and the civilians in Gaza where we know that thousands of people have been killed?ALEX PLITSAS, SENIOR NON-RESIDENT FELLOW, ATLANTIC COUNCIL: Fredricka, thanks so much for having me. So that's a great question and both of those in that sense. I'll kind of take them separately. For the hostages, I mean, Hamas took them, they are responsible for their safety while they're holding them. Israel has asked that civilians move south of Wadi, Gaza about halfway up the Gaza Strip, so that's about 1.1 million people. And so Hamas would be responsible for moving the hostages out of that area, in terms of their safety and security. We know that Hamas has somewhere between 50 and 100 tunnel complexes underground, so where all of those hostages are and who might be holding them is not completely known. We did hear from the two women who were released that said they were in a group of 25 at one point and then split up. So there could be multiple groups kind of all over the place throughout Gaza, which is what makes this such a complicated problem set. And the second question you asked about the civilian populace, and what's Special Operation Association of America and we are currently, you know, helping as we did in Afghanistan, as well as in Ukraine, along with partners from save our allies to help move, you know, citizens that are trapped inside Gaza to safe locations. So some of the NGO workers I'm working with on the ground there are reporting some pretty, you know, terrible conditions running out of water, you know, the typical health conditions that you would find with poor sanitation. And also having to treat burns with basically iodine and saline only, no antibiotics or post care. So the situation remains, you know, incredibly unstable. The humanitarian situation is getting worse. And it's really unsustainable in the long run.",
