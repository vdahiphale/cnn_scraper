The bills and this vote splintering House Republicans still and still threatening the Republican speaker's job.Let's get the very latest. CNN's Lauren Fox is joining me now with all of this. And, Lauren, House Democrats came to Johnson's rescue late last night in another key vote. Are they ready to do it again?",

Typically, these are rules that are passed out of this committee, this is known as the speaker's committee, and it is passed out of this committee with the Republican or the majority support. In this case, there were three Republicans who voted against the rule, which meant that Democrats swooped in at the last minute, voted to advance these bills, that means get this debate to the floor. And we do expect that to also occur today because there are a number of Republicans who have already said they are not only opposed to this legislation, they are opposed to voting on this procedural step known as the rule. That means that Democrats are likely going to step in to advance this set of three important supplemental packages, including one for Israel, one for Ukraine, and one for the Indo-Pacific.Now, this has been brewing for the last, you know, several weeks on Capitol Hill. Johnson, at one point, seemed like maybe he wasn't going to go forward. Then he announced on Wednesday that he was going full steam ahead. We expect the final votes on these packages to happen tomorrow. Then they will be tied together, sent to the United States Senate. That process could also get underway over the weekend. And then we could see a vote next week in the United States Senate. But, obviously, this has taken months, Kate. And this package that we are seeing today in the House, it looks very similar to what the Senate passed months ago out of their chamber. Kate.",

But the way it did this, by using quadcopters apparently, which it's used before in attacks that Iran blamed on Israel, attacks that assassinated various nuclear scientists and hit various nuclear bases, this was done targeting military bases so Iran could hide any damage from the public. So, it was a strike, yes, but very deniable by both sides and face-saving.

BETH SANNER, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Well, I think this puts everybody in a much better position. You know, we're all kind of breathing a sigh of relief. But looking ahead, I think there are two factors here. One is that I think Israel is showing that they were threading a needle to try to deter Iran, to try to put this reestablish deterrence, but at the same time keep both the United States, and very importantly the Arab countries that supported them, both overtly, like Jordan, but also through radar sharing kind of ISR information, UAE and Saudi, in defending Israel against this strike. And I think it shows that Israel understands that the best offense in the future in dealing with this really broad and deep Iranian threat in the region is not by being isolated, by having these partnerships. And so this could be really a very good move forward. But at the same time, risks of escalation remain.",

Fox, Trump plus three. \"Wall Street Journal,\" Trump plus three. CNN last month, Trump plus eight. Quinnipiac, Trump plus three back in March. And Fox, back in February, had Trump plus two. So, in fact, there isn't any real trend line that we're seeing away from Donald Trump. Despite what we're seeing nationally, in Michigan, we are still seeing that Joe Biden is trailing Donald Trump by a consistent - a small but consistent margin.

Fifty percent of voters viewed Joe Biden on average favorably in those states, compared to just 45 percent for Donald Trump. Look at the Joe Biden trend line, where he is now. Joe Biden is far less liked than he was four years ago, just 43 percent of voters now view Joe Biden favorably in these states. And Donald Trump, despite everything that has happened, everything that has happened, is actually slightly more liked, 47 percent favorable rating.So, this isn't just the lesser of two evils that's going on.

In fact, they're both trying to downplay it.With us now is the Democratic senator from the Commonwealth of Virginia, Tim Kaine. And, Senator, if you're like me, I went to bed last night with the news that Israel was conducting strikes against Iran. And there was a very real concern of this spiraling out of control. Yet we wake up and both countries are downplaying it. So, how do you explain it? SEN. TIM KAINE (D-VA): John, President Biden strongly urged Israel to avoid any response once the U.S., Israel and others very effectively defeated the missile and drone strikes that Iran launched into Israel. And that followed the Israeli attack on a consulate in Damascus that killed Iranians. The last thing we need is escalation right now. In this region we need to deescalate, hostage deal, ceasefire, de- escalation, that's what we need. So, yes, I was troubled when I saw that Israel had decided to wage a strike inside Iranian territory. But it seems, from what we know now, to be fairly calibrated, to send a message to Iran, you launched against our soil, we can read reach out and touch your soil, but we're not intending to cause great harm. And if that is the understanding now, both Iran and Israel want to show that they have capacity, but they want to de-escalate. Hopefully this will stop and there will be no more back-and-forth.",
