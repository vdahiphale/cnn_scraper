Tonight, Israeli Prime Minister BenjaminNetanyahu tells the military to fight with full force in Lebanon as he arrived in New York ahead of a speech at the United Nations General Assembly. This while the U.S. and its allies are calling for a ceasefire. We'll be live in New York, in Beirut, and in Haifa this hour. Then, a reality check from Florida, and what has been described as an un-survivable storm. Hurricane Helene barrels towards the U.S. and it's likely to cause catastrophic damage. Plus, Eric Adams become the first city New York mayor to be charged with fraud and bribery. We'll have details from outside the courthouse. But first, Israel says it has secured an $8.7 billion aid package from the United States to support its ongoing military campaigns. Yet, the U.S. is also leading a new effort to broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. The U.S., France, European Union and other allies are urging a 21-day pause in fighting, saying the situation between Lebanon and Israel has become intolerable, Hezbollah has not responded. But Israel is rejecting the proposal, pressing ahead with new strikes in Beirut and beyond. As it prepares for a possible ground invasion of Lebanon, Israel's Foreign Minister says there will be no ceasefire until residents of northern Israel can return to their homes, and 60,000 of them or so. Well, the White House says it coordinated the ceasefire plan with Israel, it says it can't explain the disconnect. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meanwhile has landed in New York ahead of his speech tomorrow at the United Nations. Today, the General Assembly heard blistering remarks by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, and he urged members to stop what it called Israel's all-out war of genocide against his people, saying Gaza is no longer fit for life. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAHMOUD ABBAS, PRESIDENT, PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY (through translator): Stop this crime, stop it now. Stop killing children and women. Stop the genocide. Stop sending weapons to Israel. This madness cannot continue, the entire world is responsible for what is happening to our people in Gaza and the West Bank. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

An Israeli strike hit a shelter in a refugee camp today, killing atleast 15 people, and that includes women as well as children. Israel says the building was a Hamas command and control center. One man whose relatives were killed as two rockets struck the shelter, shaking it like an earthquake, sending body parts, he says, everywhere. Well, we are covering these developments from all angles that you would expect. Jomana Karadsheh is in Beirut. Jeremy Diamond is in Haifa in Israel, and Alex Marquardt is at the U.N. And Alex, let me start with you because roughly this time yesterday, you and I were talking about the ceasefire proposal that U.S. and France, I remember you saying yesterday, were working feverishly on, right? As Netanyahu prepares to address the U.N. General Assembly tomorrow, what is your sense of whether this ceasefire is looking possible at all? Because in the last few minutes, we've heard there's a disconnect between the White House and what we're hearing from Netanyahu.",

Let me read it out for our viewers just for a second, Jeremy. It says \"the campaign in the north should end in one scenario, crushing Hezbollah and denying its ability to harm the residents of the north. The enemy must not be given time to recover from the heavy blows he received, and to reorganize for the continuation of the war after 21 days. Surrender of Hezbollah or war, that's the only way we return the residents and security to the north and the country.\" That does not suggest any sort of willingness, Jeremy, to consider a ceasefire proposal. So, speak to the forces at play and perhaps at this -- and the disconnect that we were just hearing about there with Alex.",

And when the Israeli Prime Minister this morning landed in New York and made very clear that there is -- they are nowhere close to reaching a ceasefire agreement. And instead, saying that the Israeli military is going to continue this fight against Hezbollah. And the one thing that changed is that in Israel this morning, there was a severe backlash against this -- these reports of a potentially imminent ceasefire agreement. And it's not only coming from Bezalel Smotrich and members of the far-right of the Israeli government, it is also coming from some of the more centrist figures in Israeli politics, Benny Gantz, a former member of this war-time cabinet, who is now back in the opposition, he made clear today that he believes that Israel has exhausted diplomatic options as it relates to Hezbollah. Yair Lapid, another centrist member of the opposition, he said that Israel should agree to a week-long ceasefire with Hezbollah, but not this three- week proposal that the United States and France had put on the table. And so, what is clear is that domestic politics, as it has been, so often the case, in particular, over the course of this war, is having an influence on the decisions that the Israeli Prime Minister is making. And clearly, he has listened to the messaging from members of the far-right who are threatening to leave this government entirely if no temporary ceasefire is put in place, as well as to other voices across the Israeli political spectrum who believe that right now what Israel should be doing is smashing Hezbollah up, destroying its capabilities to continue firing rockets on northern Israel and potentially even doing so by sending ground forces into Lebanon. It is clear, however, that the Israeli Prime Minister has yet to make that decision to send ground forces into Lebanon, even as the Israeli military is making very clear that forces are preparing for just that.",

We have heard from the Lebanese authorities saying that one person had been killed in that strike and several other people were injured. This took place in southern Beirut suburbs, one of the most densely-populated parts of the country. And this was just one of many strikes as part of this intense aerial bombardment that we are seeing taking place, mostly concentrated in southern Lebanon and in the eastern Beqaa region. Health authorities are reporting that 60 people were killed, more than 80 others injured in the last 24 hours. It's really been very hard to keep track of all these airstrikes because there have been so many, and Lebanese authorities, the government is saying that this is taking its toll on the civilian population. A short time ago, I sat down for an interview with the country's Health Minister Dr. Firass Abiad, and I started by asking him how he would describe the situation in Lebanon right now.

Jomana, thankyou very much, Jeremy Diamond as well as Alex Marquardt, appreciate it. Now, I want to go to Washington where Ukraine's President is about to meet with President Joe Biden at the White House. Volodymyr Zelenskyy is laying out his plan or is expected to lay out his plan for victory as we've been saying, over Russia, and pressing really for urgent assistance from the United States. This may be his final chance to convince the receptive American President of his country's war objectives. Mr. Zelenskyy will also be meeting separately with Vice President Kamala Harris later today. Kevin Liptak is at the White House with much more on this. And Kevin, good to see you. This meeting between both leaders really coming in the heels of the significant aid package for Ukraine, which I believe includes critical weapons package, air defense, but no mention as of yet from what I saw of Ukraine using long-range missiles to strike military targets in Russia, which we know is what -- something that President Zelenskyy was keen to get assurances from the U.S.",

Although, we did hear from the White House just within the last hour that they aren't expecting an announcement on this long-range missile question to come out of today's meeting. And certainly President Biden, while he has seemed more receptive to that idea over the last couple of weeks, he hasn't given sign-off yet, and that has caused some frustrations, not only among the Ukrainians, but also among some of the United States' European partners, with some members of the President's own party on Capitol Hill, who are essentially saying there's no time to waste here, we need to provide every capability that we possibly can to Ukraine in order for it to win this war. And that at the end of the day is the big topic of conversation in this meeting at the White House, is how does this war end? What exactly is the end game? President Zelenskyy is coming with what he calls his victory plan, essentially trying to say that yes, it is still possible for Ukraine to win, no, it doesn't have to cede territory to Russia as part of that. But it does need this urgent assistance and it needs it now, in order for it to battle back the Russian offensive. I think when you talk to American officials who have seen parts of this plan, who have been briefed on parts of this plan, there is some disappointment that it doesn't necessarily provide any kind of new strategic objective to win the war. It contains a lot of the old requests for more weapons, for more assistance, for more capabilities, but I think there is a degree of disappointment that it doesn't have more strategy involved in it. Now, we should say we haven't seen the precise details of this victory plan yet. They have been fairly closely-held. The Ukrainians wanted to wait until they presented it to President Biden before revealing it publicly.

But in the last few days, in fact, we've got sound right now from the president. Let's listen. JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: And that's exactly what we're going to discuss today, now that Ukraine -- how Ukraine is going to prevail in this conflict. And I see two key pieces. First, right now we have to strengthen Ukraine's position on the battlefield. And that's why today I'm proud to announce a new $2.4 billion package of security assistance. I've also directed the Pentagon to allocate all the remaining security assistance funding that has been appropriated to Ukraine, period, by the end of this -- my term, which is January 20. And this will strengthen Ukraine's position in future negotiations. Second, we look ahead to help Ukraine succeed in long-term. As you know better than anyone, we -- as we said at the Washington Summit, we have to support Ukraine in its path to membership to both the E.U. and the NATO, and continue to make reforms to counter corruption and strengthen democracy, which you're working mightily on right now. We have to ensure Ukraine has sufficient capabilities, and I mean sufficient capabilities to defend against future Russian aggression. So, I'm proud of the steps we've taken in our partnership on these fronts. Earlier this summer, we launched the Ukraine compact with more than 20 nations committed to Ukraine's long-term security. And yesterday, with over 30 nations and the E.U., we launched a joint declaration of support for Ukraine's recovery and reconstruction, some of it using Russian assets as well. And so, with both these actions, we're making it clear we stand with Ukraine now and in the future. We've got a lot to discuss. So, let me close with this. These two elements are critical to how this war ends. Let me be clear, Russia will not prevail in war. Russia will not prevail, Ukraine will prevail, and we'll continue to stand by you every step of the way. So, thank you for being here, and the floor is yours.",

This time yesterday, we were told that there was -- they were working feverishly, the U.S. and France, on this 24 -- 21-day ceasefire deal. Now, we're hearing that the White House is unable to explain the Netanyahu disconnect. Why -- I mean, does that -- first of all, what do you make of those developments? And what does that tell you about the state of the relationship between both sides? DANIEL LEVY, PRESIDENT, U.S./MIDDLE EAST PROJECT: Well, what we heard last night, and it's on the White House website, is the senior administration officials briefed the press, and they say, we've worked really hard, we've got the breakthrough, the moment's come, and the governments, the Lebanese and Israeli government, will announce it in their own way. OK. Fast forward to now, as you say, what has gone on? And it's easy to go to the place which says, you know, Netanyahu just takes enjoyment in demeaning and embarrassing this White House. But I think there's another way of looking at it, which is he feels he so has them where he wants them. After so many months where they have failed to exert any pressure that Netanyahu could treat something, which the White House works to bring its G7 allies, works to bring its Gulf allies, it really puts itself out there and he can treat this as a trial balloon.

And the Israeli home front is going to take a serious hit and will probably continue to do so. And therefore, he won't be able to return the 60,000 plus who have abandoned Israel's north.

So, what do you expect Netanyahu to do when he knows he has you exactly where he wants you? So, A, they haven't used that pressure. But, B, the rest of the world looks at this, and not only do they say, you are selective, not normative. Don't come to us and tell us you have to align on international law. Look at what the International Court of Justice has said, look at the arrest warrants requested by the International Criminal Court. But the International Community outside, the Global South and others, also look at a weak America. An America that can't control its allies. And this ally, in particular here, Israel, has gone off a cliff. I think people legitimately would say this is a nuclear armed state that has gone rogue, and rather than rein it in, you are continuing to encourage it up the ladder. Israel -- sorry, the U.S. Navy has six warships in the Eastern Mediterranean. The moral hazard lesson that sends to Israel, that if you want to do what you want to the Palestinians and remove the constraints of the Axis of Resistance, Iran and Hezbollah, then America is there, liable to be dragged in to this war.",
