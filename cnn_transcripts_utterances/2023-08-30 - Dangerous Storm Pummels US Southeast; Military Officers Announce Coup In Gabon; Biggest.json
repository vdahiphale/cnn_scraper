We'll be focusing on that. Major events occurring around the world. Let's take you through some of these headlines. Hurricane Idalia pummeling Georgia after a major flooding in Florida. After seizing power, Gabon's military junta appoints a general as president of the transition. And Australia sets a date for a historic referendum on how the Constitution recognizes the indigenous population. Live from Dubai, it is Wednesday, August 30th. I'm Eleni Giokos. I'm in for Richard Quest, and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. A very good evening. Great to have you with us. And tonight, Hurricane Dahlia is bringing violent winds and heavy rains as it moves over the US state of Georgia. The storm made landfall on Florida's gulf coast earlier as a major Category 3 hurricane, weakening to the level of Category 1 hurricane, but officials warn it remains incredibly dangerous. We've seen videos showing widespread flooding, collapsing infrastructure, even trees blown down onto houses by the force of the storm. President Biden just spoke in Washington. He says the effects of Idalia are being felt across several states. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

When you heard that storm surge forecast of 12 to 15 feet, longtime locals like Captain Mike Baker told me he feared that it would reach the roofline here of the Dockside Grill. Thankfully, that didn't happen, but the devastation is still obvious for so many people here. The homes that were built on stilts did okay, some of the lower lying ones along the river, this is the Steinhatchee River, flooded, and will be probably total losses, but it could have been much worse. This is one of the lesser populated parts of the state of Florida. The Big Bend there, a lots of beautiful nature here. Not a lot of dense population and that is a good thing given the insurance crisis that is plaguing the state. This now the third major hurricane in 12 months to hit Florida, which raises insurance costs for everybody regardless of where you live in this state. There is still much assessment to be made about the storm surge around Tampa area, Cedar Key, a barrier island which took the brunt of it. Still assessing the damage, still a lot of tornado warnings as this category now one storm heads into Georgia, but coming out and in surveying the damage so far, they're breathing a sigh of relief here in Steinhatchee.

That's expected in the next two to threehours, but for my colleagues who are down south, they have seen that flooding, and they've seen that heavy rain that you've been talking about. There has been a lot of loss of property down there. There might have even been some people who have lost their lives. Now, we're in Savannah, a city that's known throughout the world. One of the things that we've been pointing out, they are worried about the heavy winds in this area. If you look at the big bridge right here, that's the Talmadge Bridge. That has been shut down for safety protocols, and even during this live shot, you can see the gust of wind as it pops into us, as has been coming through, they are expecting winds as strong as 70 miles per hour. Now, the good thing about this storm, it's been moving so fast, they do believe it may start breaking up as they get closer to this area. Right now they believe this will be more of a wind event in the Savannah area, and not as much as a rain event. But to show you, they've been preparing by putting sandbags throughout the city, they've even brought in water barriers at some businesses. That way, they actually fill like these large balloons with water, put them around a building, and that way it stops the water from coming in. What they're worried about is the surge, and if you look right here, it's not close to high tide yet. We've got to kind of be careful as we get here because the wind is so bouncy, but you can see the water moving in the Savannah River. They're worried about the water here, coming up above the banks, and then crashing into some of these businesses. That has happened before. As we've been told, it should be around seven to eight o'clock tonight. When it starts, the rain really starts to impact this area. They're also concerned about power outages, and that is what the entire state of Georgia has been dealing with. The last time we checked and heard from the governor, we are talking about over 70,000 people in the state so far without power, and that's before all of these trees start falling because of the heavy winds. The moisture that's on the ground has weakened a lot of the root systems because of all that extra water, it makes it easy for some of these larger trees to start falling. Now, we are told emergency crews are on standby, especially in the Savannah area. They are thinking about doing curfews, they have not gotten to that just yet. So as you broaden this out, they're worried about pockets of heavy wind, downburst and tornadoes throughout the state of Georgia, as people start looking southward, especially to their neighbors in Florida, who have been impacted so greatly by this large, enormous hurricane as it comes on the ground.",

Of course, a great deal of Western health as well, but they are remarkably efficient. Still, the debris the missiles caused -- did lead to the loss of lives in Kyiv, which shouldn't be forgotten. These are civilians that continue to pay the price of this war regularly ever since that strategy began many months ago of trying to bring the war further inside Ukrainian territory than simply along the frontline. And I don't think it so much prevents the Ukrainians; if anything, it probably adds to their resolve. There is a great deal of determination and focus on those frontlines and on that counteroffensive and I would suggest that their resolve has actually probably never been stronger -- Eleni.",

And yet, he wasable to make big changes at \"The New York Times,\" increasing subscriptions dramatically. He says that he goes in with fresh eyes to see what needs to be done. You mentioned a few things, talked about the political landscape, the era of disruption, which is quite interesting because this is what the future is about. Where are the eyeballs going to come from. Is it going to be on digital platforms, on cable? What kind of mix sort of are we seeing in the market right now that warrants investments?",

So \"The New York Times'\" model was built on print subscriptions print very similar to how CNN's models are built on linear television. And that model obviously is declining. So what Mark Thompson did at \"The New York Times,\" was he really transformed the paper into a digital powerhouse. Of course now it's one of most relevant news organizations in the world, arguably with a much larger footprint than before, when it was a print- based publication. So the hope here, I think, is that Mark Thompson can take CNN's great journalism and transform the company, position it for the future, by making it stronger on digital platforms, while also moving the linear product, what people are watching you and I (sic) do right now, on to streaming, where people, where the future of the audience is going to be. That is the hope. It's a big challenge but he has had success transforming \"The New York Times\" in a similar way. And so I think the hope is he can do the same for CNN.",

Much appreciated.Now more on China struggling economy, which we've mentioned, is facing deflation, high youth unemployment and a lot more. We have Sitao Xu, chief economist for Deloitte China. He joins me now from Shanghai. Great to have you with us. I know we've been trying to get you online but glad we could establish contact. We've just heard that many U.S. companies are saying China is just not investable right now. They say it is uninvestable, talking about policy. Even policy aside, the current economic climate is very concerning. What do you make of this comment that some companies are saying we just don't want to put our money into this market right now?",

But that said (ph), I think the consumer sector itself will provide some cushion. So I do think the medium-term growth trend should be around 4 percent. But of course, policymakers will need to undertake certain reform; for example, the labor market, relaxation, (INAUDIBLE), so on and so forth. So that is how we see the Chinese economy going forward.
