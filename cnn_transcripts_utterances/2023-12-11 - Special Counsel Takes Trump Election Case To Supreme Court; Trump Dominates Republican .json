I'm Jake Tapper.And we start today with our law and justice lead, and a major development on whether Donald Trump or any president really has to face accountability for alleged federal crimes committed while in office. It's a basic test of our democracy at the highest level, are we in fact a nation of laws. This afternoon, special counsel Jack Smith filed a brief urging the U.S. Supreme Court to rule on whether the former president is immune from federal prosecution for his actions while he was in the White House. Smith is trying to keep the election subversion trial scheduled for next March on track. He's hoping to avoid delays that are coming as Trump's team fights this issue of immunity through lower courts. Trump's lawyers are claiming his actions around the 2020 election results are part of his official presidential duties at the time. It's an assessment with which the special counsel's team clearly disagrees. Let's get straight to CNN's Paula Reid. And, Paula, this question of immunity is already sitting with a lower court. So, why is Special Counsel Jack Smith going straight to the Supremes?",

Here, they're asking the Supreme Court to resolve two questions. One, does Trump have immunity from criminal prosecutions. Or, is he protected by double jeopardy because he was impeached but not convicted for similar crimes?Now, the special counsel doesn't think either one of these apply but they want this issue resolved because we know that Trump strategy here is to delay, delay, delay. He is litigating these legitimate constitutional questions. Well, Jake, that takes time, it can take months, even well over a year to work these questions through the entire appellate process and get them to the Supreme Court. Which is why the special counsel is saying, look, it's in the public interest for you guys to skip the middleman here, let's go to the court of appeals. You just take up these questions and give us an answer, so we can go to trial as scheduled. And they're actually citing precedent from the Nixon Watergate investigation. The Supreme Court was able to resolve a couple issues there pretty quickly. Look, it's unclear what they're going to do here, clearly, this is all about timing but interestingly, the special counsel gave the Supreme Court a middle ground, a compromise. And said, look, if you want to take on these questions, can you at least tell the court of appeals to do this expeditiously. And then try to decide these questions before the end of the term. TAPPER: Would this -- this is just for the federal election subversion case. There are other cases, the Georgia case, federal classified documents case, the New York case, the New York civil case. Would this have an impact on on any of the other criminal cases Donald Trump is involved in?",

Because you have a Supreme Court precedent, but this isn't necessarily about constitutional issues. Primarily, this is about delay.

And here's why, here's where we are -- Jack Smith has won this case in a district court. Now, ordinarily, Donald Trump would get to appeal first to the court of appeals in the D.C. circuit. That could take weeks, maybe a couple months. If Donald Trump lost there, he can then asked the court of appeals to re-hear the case, what we call en banc, meaning the entire court of appeals pack on another several weeks, maybe months, and only then with the Supreme Court even begin its interview.So, there's really just no way to get all that done between now and March 4th, which isn't that far away.

And Jack Smith, by the way, intentionally did not mention the election. This was simply about a vital public interest in moving forward because I noticed Donald Trump's defenders have said this is election interference, Jack Smith wants to make sure this happens ahead of the election so he's convicted.

If we look at recent examples, it happened at a couple times in the past years of. For example, the Supreme Court took a direct appeal and they let him skip the middle on Joe Biden's student loan plan. They also did the same thing on a dispute about immigration policy in Texas. They also did the same thing on the dispute about a Texas law that allowed private citizens to sue over abortions.So, the question the Supreme Court's going to be asking is, A, how important is this case, and, B, how time sensitive is it? And I think if we compare this case to those three precedents, it's as important or more important, and it's as time sensitive or more time sensitive. So, I do think the Supreme Court's going to take the case on the expedited basis. How will they rule, that is really an unknown. We don't have anything on point. Of course, this is the 6-3 conservative Supreme Court. However, they ruled against Donald Trump on some major rulings in the past. So, that one will have to wait and see.",

Again, that's if Trump wins.I do agree with Paula, this will have no impact on the hush money case, because that conduct almost entirely happened before Trump was president and it definitely will not impact the federal Mar-a-Lago classified documents case because that conduct was entirely after Donald Trump was president.

I should add, when I pushed ambassador to say beyond that question of the frustrations, she said point blank, this is important, quote, U.S. diplomacy is the most effective tool that we have for resolving this conflict.So, clearly, the UAE and many other member states really view the U.S. as an integral part of this process going on. She also said they played a key role in pressuring the Israelis to open that Kerem Shalom border crossing as Alex Marquardt in his previous report said it did not really open today. But expectations and hope are high that it open soon, Jake. But still, a severe crisis ongoing.",

Jones was banned from Twitter back in 2018, after previous ownership, after spreading false and malicious conspiracy theories, including the horrific ones about the Sandy Hook massacre, the nonsense that -- about the 20 children, six adults that were killed.

So, when Elon Musk took over Twitter last year, some people began to push him to allow Alex Jones back on the social media spy site despite this cruelty. At the time, Musk seem to respond in a very human way. Musk wrote, quote, my first born child died in my arms. I felt his last heartbeat. I have no mercy for anyone who would use the deaths of children for again, politics, or fame, unquote. But I guess that's out of the window because over the weekend, Musk fielded a completely unscientific Twitter survey to his 165 million followers. He asked to reinstate Alex Jones on his platform to which not surprisingly 70 percent of Elon Musk's followers, nearly 2 million voters, said yes. Musk later said, I vehemently disagree about what he said about Sandy Hook but are we a platform that believes in freedom of speech or are we not? That is what it comes down to in the end. And if the people vote him back on, this will be bad for X financially but principles matter more than money, unquote. We should also note that it was about a year ago that Mr. Free Speech there suspended some journalist for posting things he didn't like, including our friend, CNN's Donie O'Sullivan. Donie, since Alex Jones's account has been restored, now it's not just up there, it's actively being promoted across the platform? DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Jake, Alex Jones, it looks like he's grown his audience by about 100,000 followers, just since being put back on the platform. Our colleague Clare Duffy reporting that people have opened up, X, the Twitter app today, even if they haven't followed Jones. A lot of people have been saying that the algorithm feed promotes accounts suggesting to people that they should follow Jones's account. That is, of course, five years after he was an initially kicked off the platform. And really, this is so illustrative of what we're seeing happen with X, but also with Elon Musk, because he kind of journeys very publicly at this rabbit hole of conspiracy theories, Jake.",

And he simply did not show up for that.Now, the lawyers were then told, is real -- the lawyers are than told that apparently there was a power failure. The lawyers kept asking and the prison authorities then admitted that he was actually no longer on the list of prisoners who were inside that jail. So, what happened then is that Alexey Navalny's associates and his lawyer as well made a lot of phone calls to a lot of jails in the vicinity of that area and none of them knew anything about Alexey Navalny being there. So, as of this point, he is and remains missing. This obviously, Jake, leads to a lot of concerns among his family, among his associates as well because one of the things we do know is that over the past couple of weeks, he has had some serious health issues. In fact, the Anti-Corruption Foundation of which he is still the head, said that just a week ago, he actually fainted inside his jail cell, and had to be given an IV because he's been so weak recently, Jake.",

Which is set to take place on March 17th, it's around this time now that Alexei Navalny has disappeared.And one of the things that we've also seen is that the anti-corruption foundation of Alexei Navalny, they actually managed to buy some billboard ads in Moscow and St. Petersburg, on the face of them say happy new year to Russia, but if you click on the QR code, it dissuades people from voting for Vladimir Putin. So, that's certainly something that angered the Russian authorities. So, that's one of the things that the Anti-Corruption Foundation is looking into. One of the things, Jake, that we need to point out, Alexey Navalny wasn't supposed to be transferred to a different jail with an even harsher regime than the one that he's been in so far. And isn't that uncommon for prisoners when they're in that process of being transferred to completely be out of communication, to not be allowed to communicate at all. In fact, it is something that happened to Navalny in 2022 when he was put in the jail that he's been in so far. Nevertheless, the concern, of course, is massive right now among those who are supporting him because of his health issues, and they simply have absolutely no idea about his whereabouts, Jake.",
