(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOLODRYGA (voice-over):  Now, earlier, protesters stormed the parliament building where lawmakers have been considering a new finance bill that contains several tax hikes. Here you see a trail of destruction inside the dining area of the building. Elsewhere in Nairobi, City Hall was set on fire.",

We still heard some tear gas canisters being shot in the air a few minutes ago. Many of them appear to have cleared out, at least from this part of the capital, Nairobi. But we now can have a look at the aftermath of the day of protests. It's been an extraordinary day of violence and devastation and destruction across the city. And we want to look at this Carrefour market. This is a store just outside Kenya's Supreme Court. And you see on the floor strewn here this product of every kind. Sanitary pads, we've got bread, we've got flour, we've got clothes, we've got detergent. All there. As police kind of stay watch here. They've been here all day. We've got even -- that's chocolate there, biscuits. The amount of product here. The manager of the store tells us that the protesters breached the wall, they broke down the glass and the shutters and went right through. And the police are still here, standing guard to make sure the protesters don't come back. Their stated objective today was to try and occupy Parliament as part of what is called seven days of rage, today was supposed to be a total shutdown. But police did not allow them to occupy Parliament for long, even though they did breach the wall of Parliament and make it inside the house and even took away the mace from the floor of the house. As that was happening, we saw police use live rounds against mostly peaceful protesters who were only armed with banners and they were armed with flags. They were singing the national anthem. And after that we saw at least two bodies lying on the ground outside Parliament. One of them, a young man, harrowing scene with his brain splattered on the floor. Just the sign of how quickly these protests escalated. And also the criticism here, the heavy-handed, overly militarized police response to a largely peaceful protest. And I think the sign of that is we were talking earlier in the day to Alma Obama. She's the half-sister of former U.S. President Barack Obama. And while we were live on CNN, we were tear gassed repeatedly. We had to take a break. She had to take a moment to take a breath and say she was only here to support these young people who've been complaining about over taxation by the government of President William Ruto. And they have come out on the streets to let their voices heard. She said they didn't need to be responded to in this violent way. But after the end of the day, we saw at least three different buildings on fire. Uganda House down this block. We saw City Hall right next to us. And at least parts of Parliament that were on fire for parts of this afternoon, Bianna.",

But the second part is what happens. I think the level of anger on the streets today has been unprecedented and shocking to so many people, including myself. I knew that a lot of young people were going to come out today, but I didn't think that there would be that many, and two, that they would be responded to in such a violent manner. I think this has made a statement to the government of President William Ruto. He's not said anything yet. The Interior Minister has not said anything yet. But when he does respond, I'm sure a lot of young people will be trying to hear and pass through the statement to see if he really hears them when they say that life has become too expensive for them, the cost of living has gone out of control, and especially their sense of disillusionment. President William Ruto was elected by many young people who voted for him because he said he was a hustler in chief. He understood hustlers, and he was coming into power to look after them. They feel that he's turned his back on them, on trips constantly, international trips with large delegations, renovating statehouse, renovating the deputy president's official residence, while he keeps telling them that they have to tighten their belts.",

Don't just amend it, reject it in totality, because if it were to pass, we can't afford to live in this country. And that's why he has to be careful in his analysis and his response to this, because I don't think this is about to die down anytime soon. The protests were called for today, on Tuesday for a total shutdown, and on Thursday that said they will try and occupy a statehouse. And after the anger we've seen today, already on social media you see people angry about the deaths of these people, Amnesty International saying at least five people have been killed today. This will just offer renewed vigor to so many other young people who say they're willing to come out on the streets and die, because there's a famous Kenyan saying from a freedom fighter who said we'd rather die on our feet than to live on our knees.

It seems that there are other issues that are really underlying the sense of frustration here with the government. Perhaps it's corruption. Perhaps it's not addressing some of their economic needs as quickly as possible. RUBIDIRI (on the phone):  Right. That has been a concern from many Kenyans. Looking at, for instance, government spending, they feel there's too much excess there. You look at some of the line items in the budget, some unconstitutional offices getting money for, you know, projects that they feel are not critical to the country's running. Renovations, for instance, to the deputy president's office and home running into $9 million. So, Kenyans are asking why can't we cut back on some of these expenditures and channel that money to paying back the debt as opposed to putting that burden in terms of taxation on Kenyans who are already really burdened by the high cost of living in the country.",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Amal, meaning hope, was born two months premature. She died after just four days, her family says, a baby born into war in northern Gaza. It's a result of her early birth, the head of pediatrics says, which is a result of malnutrition and starvation of her mother. This is the fourth child that's died in this department this week. Amal's father says they were displaced with no shelter, food or water. A real starvation, he says. My girl died because of this. Hospitals across Gaza are full of malnutrition cases, doctors say. Needing special care that simply does not exist. Younis is nine years old. His mother takes off his T-shirt to show the painful evidence of malnutrition and extreme dehydration. She says he was healthy until they were displaced multiple times, from northern Gaza to Rafah, to a beach area where she says they don't even have a tent. Food was no longer available, his mother says. There were bad living conditions and polluted water. \"I'm losing my son in front of my eyes.\" More than 50,000 children require treatment for acute malnutrition, according to the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA. Eight months of war have decimated the health system, water sanitation and food distribution. Clean water has become a luxury many struggle to access.

So, this was a unanimous decision by the Israeli SupremeCourt, saying that the ultra-Orthodox, the Haredi, should be conscripted. They should be part of the mandatory military service in this country. It's difficult for the Israeli Prime Minister because it means that two of the Haredi ultra-Orthodox parties, which are part of his ruling coalition, may decide to leave the coalition. And they're certainly not going to be happy with today's ruling. So, that does put more pressure on the Prime Minister trying to stay in power. Now, the Supreme Court also said that any of the religious schools who do not -- who have students within their schools that do not agree to respect the draft notices, will then lose funding as well, this according to the Supreme Court. So, it really is putting pressure on a situation that has been brewing for years. The Haredi have had this exemption, effectively, since the founding of Israel, since 1948.

Then if you look at the bill and you look at the current situation the country is in, the country this year alone has to pay close to 1.8 trillion shillings in debt service or debt repayment against ordinary revenue target of around 2.4, 2.5. That means literally close to 60, 70 percent of the revenue collected is going to pay debts. The problem with Kenya Kwanzaa or the Ruto's government, when they came in, they chest-thumped and said, we will pay our debts, we will never default. And against advice that some of us gave them to say, go on the table with your creditors and negotiate a more palatable payment plan, lengthen the period of the debt. Because if you don't, you have no capacity to pay this debt in its current form and structure. Or if you insist on paying it in the current form and structure, you will either have to borrow more, which is what they're doing, borrowing from the IMF, World Bank, Eurobond market, they went back to Eurobond market in February. So, they're borrowing from John to pay Peter and kicking the can down the road. So, the Kenya government needs to reach a point and say, there's no way we can develop. There is no way we can implement policies. Because the role of the government is not to grow the economy. The role of the government is to create policies that make the private sector to be able to thrive. When the private sector thrives, then they employ people. And the more people who come into employment, the wider your tax base is. But you don't widen a tax base by going to start taxing basic things like bread and sanitary pads. So, if they can go on the table with creditors and say, we are not able to pay this debt in its form, we want to pay, can we reschedule? Can we lengthen the tenure? Can we reduce the interest that is on these debts, both domestic and external, to allow us leg room to implement policies that will actually grow incomes. And as we grow incomes, we grow aggregate demand. As we grow aggregate demand, we'll generate enough revenue to be able to comfortably pay without mortgaging the country for the next five, seven years if they try to pay it the way they want to pay right now.",
