This follows a wave of mysterious appearances in the skies over New Jersey, sparking major concern among residents, as well as among local and state leaders.The White House and FBI say there is no evidence to this point that the drones pose a national security threat or have any kind of foreign connection. But that's only adding to the confusion, because so far there are no explanations as to what they even are, where they're coming from or who might be launching them. For weeks now, the drones have been spotted over homes, critical infrastructure and sensitive government sites. Today, some frustrated lawmakers have gone from asking questions to demanding answers. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JOSH GOTTHEIMER (D-NJ): New Jersey can't become the Wild West of drone activity. No state can become the Wild West of drone activity. I've made this very clear to the FBI, to Homeland Security, and the FAA, the agency is chiefly responsible for monitoring drone activity. They must immediately disclose more information to the public. It's totally and completely unacceptable that you have all this drone activity going on that people are seeing with their own eyes. The fact that the federal agency is responsible for briefing the public, have not come forward in a clear way, is unacceptable. There has to be some explanation to the public for all this increased activity, and they must do so now. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Belleville borders the city of Newark and Newark, as we probably all know, Newark International Airport is right there, right in the middle of air traffic control.So that's really running up and down Route 21 here in Belleville, which is a direct conduit right to Newark International Airport. That's why it's gravely concerning to see so many drones in the air night after night. That video was shot on December 8th, but the last two days has been a hotbed.

There are objects that are flying within hundreds of feet above our homes. That's not good. That's just above the sight line, just above the tree line.
