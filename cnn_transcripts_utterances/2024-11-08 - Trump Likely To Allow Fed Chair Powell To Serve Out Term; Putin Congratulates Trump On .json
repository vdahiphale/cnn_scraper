And look, I'm glad you pointed out that most Latinos did vote for Kamala Harris.But one of the things I think that struck me is that Latino -- with Latino men the gap was particularly noteworthy. It really -- the numbers seem to show what a lot of operatives and sources have been telling me for the last couple of election cycles, which is that increasingly, Latino voters -- they just behave like the rest of the electorate. They don't want to be singled out necessarily or treated in a different way, right? I mean, if you look at this, Latino men broke for Trump 55 percent to 43 percent. I mean, that's not that far off from the way white men broke for Trump, for example. And this idea that Democrats can separate them out as this kind of homogenous group that needs to be spoken to specifically when, in fact, they are simply people from all over different places in the world. You know, they -- like, Irish immigrants once came here, or Italian immigrants once came here and then all become Americans. I'm interested to know kind of your thoughts and particularly, the woman that Ed found who had come from Mexico. She emigrated herself. She used the asylum process. Now she has concerns about how immigrants that are coming this time around are using that process. I mean, clearly, there's something about even his messaging around immigration that broke through with these voters in the same way it broke through with voters of all races across the country.",

      "sentences": "I know, 100 percent. I mean, the reality is that Trump has spent the past four and arguably his entire time in -- you know, his entire political career talking about immigration and railing against people that have crossed the border illegally. Talking about how much they are displacing people and all of that.On the other side of that we have not seen Democrats really aggressively campaign on immigration. The data point I keep pointing to is Republicans -- the Trump campaign and Republicans spent $243 million on immigration-related ads in this election since Kamala Harris became the nominee. On the other side Democrats spent $15 million -- $243 million to $15 million. So Latinos, like everyone else, were repeatedly just hearing the same message -- the same message about chaos at the border, people crossing, how unfair it was. That it was all these criminals. That they were taking your jobs. That they were displacing people. And they weren't hearing a compelling message on the other side. So I think that that's something also here to keep in mind. I mean, Latinos are watching the same channels as everyone else and hearing the same news as everyone else. And for immigrant communities it's so much about economic mobility. It's so much about coming to this country and getting ahead. And the economic anxiety that people felt was very real. We see it. Inflation disproportionately affected Black and Latino families. So I think if you combine just the relentless messaging on immigration that we saw from Republicans and you see just the amount of economic anxiety that was felt in this country it's just not surprising that Latinos, which are an overwhelmingly working class community, saw something in Donald Trump.",

      "sentences": "A senior adviser to Trump tells CNN the president-elect will likely allow Powell to serve out the remainder of his term, which expires in May of 2026, although that adviser cautions Trump could change his mind.Our next guests writes, \"Powell also repeatedly emphasized that the Fed's near-term rate path will not react to expectations about Trump's policy plans. Trump has often been a Powell critic, and during his first presidency flirted with firing the Fed chair. Powell said today that he would leave if asked to resign, nor does he think it's legal for a president to fire Fed governors from their positions.\" Jeanna Smialek, the Fed and economics correspondent for The New York Times, joins us now. Jeanna, good morning. It's wonderful to see you. Powell was very direct there, not always a tactic that tends to go over very well with the former president and now the president-elect Trump. Were you surprised by how direct he was in talking about that? And how do you think the politics of this affects the economic decision-making process? JEANNA SMIALEK, FED AND ECONOMICS CORRESPONDENT, THE NEW YORK TIMES (via Webex by Cisco):  I wasn't particularly surprised because I think this is the thing the Fed has obviously been giving a lot of thought to, I would imagine. Given that Trump made clear that he was thinking about first firing and then demoting Chair Powell during his first administration, I imagine the Fed has spent a lot of time on the legal possibilities around this. And I think that Jay Powell was trying to be as emphatic as possible in communicating that he doesn't think he can be fired while also leaving absolutely no room for misinterpretation. I think that's what that was yesterday. And so it's a -- it's very clear that he doesn't think that he can be fired, but that doesn't mean that this election isn't going to affect the Fed. They are going to have to take into account the policies that Trump is planning when they think about how the economy is going to shape up in the year -- several years ahead, and that could potentially affect the rate path, although it's just too early to tell exactly how and to what magnitude at this point.",

What does it say to you about where the Fed thinks that the economy is, and how do you understand -- I mean, they're saying we don't know yet what these policies are actually going to be so we can't make decisions based on hypothetical future policies that don't yet exist. But that said, there is a lot of power in the presidency to do -- deal with tariffs, for example, and that could potentially be inflationary.How are those things being balanced?",

      "sentences": "Yeah. So I think yesterday needs to be looked at as a short- term decision. The Fed made a single rate cut. I think that's an optimistic message all around in the sense that it suggests that the Fed thinks inflation is under control and that the economy is growing at a steady pace. It doesn't require it to do some sort of vague emergency rate cut -- just a normal sized rate cut -- basically, good news.Looking forward, as you say, of course, the president can have quite a bit of influence in areas that matter to the Fed. If you look at most Wall Street analysts, they assume that President Trump's policy packages, particularly the tariffs, are going to push up inflation at least a little -- some think quite a bit. And so I think there is this question looming over the future, but the Fed is just not prepared to talk about it yet because it really doesn't have enough certainty about exactly what those policies are going to look like, what the magnitudes are, when they're going to hit. At this point it's all campaigning and campaigning just can't drive Fed policy. And so I think we're going to have to wait and see a little bit more detail before we get more information from the Fed about how they're going to think about this as they go about their business.",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PUTIN (through translator):  These two last decades were not just filled with the most important and sometimes dramatic events of truly historic scale. Before our eyes a completely new world order is being formed unlike what we know from the past. For example, the Westphalia or Yalta systems. New powers are rising. People are becoming more and more aware of their interests, their self-worth, originality, and identity, and are increasingly insisting on achieving the goals of development and justice.

And one of the things that Vladimir Putin keeps talking about is he keeps saying that is something that shows that Russia is a sovereign nation and not a nation that is willing to be subservient, as he puts it, to that Pax Americana to a U.S.-dominated world, as the Russians say that they see it. But I think Vladimir Putin is really trying to create or at least trying to make it appear as though he's creating an alternative world -- an alternative world order, and I think the relations with China are one part of that. But one of the things, of course, that the Russians are really trying to build up is the BRICS community. It is this community of nations that are sort of on the cusp of being very strong economic nations where you have China, you have India. There are some other countries that are trying to get in there as well. What Vladimir Putin appears to be trying to do though is he appears to be trying to make himself the sort of leader or the Galionsfigur of that alternative movement to that sort of Western-dominated world as he sees it, Kasie.",

You know, that means a hearing before an immigration judge in which they can present defenses to deportation. Sometimes, Kasie, those defenses are I'm a U.S. citizen. Other times there are -- there are certain benefits under the immigration law that allow some migrants to stay in this county -- of course, asylum being one of the biggest ones. The problem is those courts are tremendously backlogged. Congress has never really funded the courts to keep up with the volume. So now, Stephen Miller and others are looking at the situation. They know that's the problem. Look, really quickly, during the last administration there was no lack of political will to deport as many people as possible. It's not like this is an entirely new concept. Yet, the Trump administration's numbers were below those of the Obama administration when it came to deportations. The reason why was backlogs in the immigration court. So the president-elect is going to need to push the envelope in terms of -- he's going to try through executive orders and other regulations and things like that to strip migrants of these rights to due process. We saw it before at the border and now we're going to -- I'm confident we're going to see it in the interior of the U.S. There will, of course, be lawsuits -- and it's a different court today -- but ultimately, testing the limits of how far he can go.
