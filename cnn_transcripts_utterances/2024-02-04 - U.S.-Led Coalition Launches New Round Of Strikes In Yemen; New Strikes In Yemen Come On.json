So, this is the third that the U.S. and the U.K. conducted joint strikes targeting Houthi weaponry and infrastructure inside Yemen, backed, of course, by a coalition that included the Netherlands, Denmark, Canada, Australia, Bahrain and New Zealand.And what we're told is that these attacks targeted 13 different locations, 36 targets which included commanded and control nodes and underground weapons storage facility as well as Houthi radars and helicopters. Now, of course, it remains to be clear -- remains to be seen whether this actually degrades the Houthis' capabilities to the extent that they're then unable to keep launching these missiles and drones into the Red Sea targeting commercial shipping. But we are told that the U.S. used F/A-18 fighter aircraft as well -- from the Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier that has been stationed there in the Red Sea, as well as Tomahawk missiles from the USS Gravely and USS Carney that have also been there trying to protect the ships that are seeking to transit the Red Sea amid all of this Houthi attacks. Now, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin released a statement shortly after the attacks unfolded. And he said -- quote -- \"This collective action sends a clear message to the Houthis that they will continue to bear further consequences if they do not end their illegal attacks on international shipping and naval vessels. We will not hesitate to defend lives and the free flow of commerce in one of the world's most critical waterways.\" Now, the coalition that has backed these strikes they said that their aim ultimately is to de-escalate tensions. And they are saying that they're not going to hesitate to continue to defense themselves, that is how they are framing this as part of self-defense action. But that -- you know, the Houthis, of course, are saying that they are going to continue these attacks until the war in Gaza comes to an end. And so, the U.S. military right now is grappling with how to continue its strikes on these Houthi militants in a way that actually degrades their capabilities for good.",

Welcome to you both, gentlemen.Colonel, let's start with you and just to get your assessment on this latest round of attacks this time targeting Houthis -- the Houthis, the Iranian-backed rebels. COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes, good morning, Amara. The main assessment that I have is that these attacks have been pretty successful in a tactical sense. One of the most important aspects of this is that they were able to get at -- missiles as they are being launched or being prepared for launch. So, the U.S. and the U.K. have clear indications that these missiles are going to be set up to target a specific vessel or a series of vessels, depending on the number of missiles. And that is a success. But on the other hand, when you have these kinds of efforts going on, it does nothing at the moment, at least, to alter the strategic balance that's going on. As Ben mentioned in his report, the Houthis are not only very tough and resilient but they are going to find ways to survive these attacks at least as they are being conducted so far.",

      "sentences": "Well, that's going to be the big challenge for them, Amara. Because if you think about the evolution of the Biden administration's approach here, first, they were doing essentially a policing action in the Red Sea, right? They were trying to have a number of patrol cars that were cruising around, trying to stop crime, as they viewed it. Then they moved to a defensive action which was to try to intercept these missiles as they came.About two weeks ago, President Biden approved new strike packages that basically said that any kind of missile or drone that was seen out in the open, put on the long trail could be destroyed. And that's what you saw happen last night. But there are two problems with this approach as it expands. The first is we don't know the depth of their supply lines here. So, as Cedric said, we know what we hit, but what we don't know is how quickly they can resupply. And the second is almost an ideological problem, which is that the Houthis don't exist to be in resistance to the United States. So, the more the U.S. does this, the more it sort of reaffirms their position. They're not there to administer a country. You know, they're not known for their social services. So, to some degree, we are boosting their status, even while we're degrading their arms.",

And then the attacks in the shipping areas, the commercial shipping in the Red Sea, continues by the Houthis, Colonel. So, does that make America look weak, I mean, even in the face of these strikes from the U.S., that they remain resolved, and will likely continue if, you know, their weapons systems have not been fully degraded?",

So, they've denounced the U.S. They've said the U.S. is making the problem more complex. They may be right about that. But they have not threatened retaliation.And the U.S. has been very careful not to strike Iranian sites inside of Iran. Or IRGC officers inside Iran. Now, the question is, do the Iranians just leave it at their verbiage which is what the administration is betting they will do? And to some degree, they have a lot to gain from just letting things play out here. Secretary of Defense Austin is already in discussions with the Iraq government, which was displeased with the strikes on their own territory, about removing those 2,500 U.S. troops that are remaining in Iraq. And remember, what's Iran's goal here, it's to get the U.S. out of the Middle East. Now, there will be a lot of troops left elsewhere. But, boy, if they can just sort of sit this out and get the Americans out of Iraq and make it more risky and expensive for the U.S. elsewhere, they kind of win by just sort of sitting back.",

And they are in the end a bit less vulnerable to those kinds of attacks than we are, although they can be effective and they can certainly stop certain things from happening, such as stuff that was very effective in shutting down at least for a time the Iranian nuclear efforts.

And that's going to be the concern as we go through the next 24 to 48 hours.An excessive rain fall risk pretty much for the entire state here to varying degrees. But the worst of it really is from San Francisco all the way down through Los Angeles. And Los Angeles specifically including Long Beach, Oxnard, up through Santa Barbara is under a very rare what we call high risk, a level four out of four. To emphasize how rare these actually are, there only for about four percent of days you get these issued. But they're responsible for over 80 percent of the flood damage that occurs in nearly 40 percent of the flood deaths. And for L.A. specifically, it's not just a high risk for today but also tomorrow. So, you're talking back-to-back days of that potential flood risk for the city of Los Angeles specifically. So, you're talking about life-threatening flash flooding river and urban flooding, also mudslides, landslides, debris flows, but also the added concern of high winds. And that's going to bring down trees also likely causing some pretty widespread power outages. You've got these high wind warnings and wind advisories. Wind gusts of 50 to 80 miles per hour. And for the first time in recorded history the National Weather Service Office in San Francisco issuing a hurricane force wind warning just down to the south and west near the Big Sur coastline. Those wind gusts around 90 to 95 miles per hour. You also have not only damaging winds but the potential for some water spouts and even tornadoes along the coastline here as well. That includes Monterey down through San Luis Obispo, widespread rainfall totals. When you're talking up and down the coast, you're looking at about two to four inches. But then when you get farther down to the south along the coast and in some of those valleys, you could be looking at four, six, even as much as eight inches of rain for some of these areas in a short period of time. Snowfall also going to be extreme. You're looking at three to even four feet of snow across much of the sea areas.
