Wonderful to have you with us. President Biden returns to Normandy, France, today to deliver a speech on the power of democracy, from a site separating the Omaha and Utah Beaches, that is where American soldiers scaled cliffs to secure positions against the Germans on D-Day, a key turning point for Allied forces in World War II. Yesterday, President Biden was on hand for the ceremony commemorating the 80th anniversary of D-Day, and we watched him meet with the fewer and fewer of the living veterans who stormed the beaches on that day. And, of course, he offered praise for their contribution to world history. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Now they have it and they're trying to make up gains that they've lost in Ukraine here.So, Zelenskyy is really going to be using this opportunity both this week and next week at the G7 to continue to push the U.S. to give them some of those defense weapons that they really need. He's been had success with Biden now allowing or supporting Ukraine, doing attacks, inside of Russia, which was huge and something that they had been pushing for, and really something that they want to see. They want to see the U.S. able to give them more opportunities to be offensive rather than defensive. They think that's exactly what they need to be able to win this war eventually.",

We saw him do this with the -- with the midterms and he's really tried to paint himself as a preserver of democracy.And right now, he's contrasting himself to two men. That's Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump. He believes Putin is a threat to Europe at large, that if he, Congress Ukraine, that he will not stop there. And yet at the same time, he's saying Donald Trump is someone who is not going to preserve this tradition of American foreign policy that has really been preserved across parties.

They're going to want to fire behind the Russian lines, those positions that are targeting cities like Kharkiv, right now. What does this do militarily over time? Because this is not a war that's won today or tomorrow, or next month, but probably were looking into next year or beyond, this thins out the Russian lines, it doesn't remove them, that it pushes back there Russia's sort of support positions, its ammunition stores, its fuel stores, all of these things that Ukraine needs to hit to weaken Russia as frontline, which ultimately is going to have to push that front line back.
