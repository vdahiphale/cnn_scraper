He did that. He did that.He served this country honorably for a lifetime. And tonight he knows it's coming to an end. It wasn't the end that he wanted. And I think it was powerful. I regret that he gave half -- it felt like he gave his acceptance speech and then moved on to the business at hand, which was to promote the ticket of Harris and Walz. But as for the rest of the night I think what you saw in some ways was the difficulty of switching in the middle of the, you know, three weeks before a convention. You have a different nominee and what you saw were I think partly was a convention that was planned for Biden, which would have been an alloyed carpet bombing on Trump, and the storytelling around Kamala Harris that was planned after, there were some powerful moments. Steve Kerr I thought was proudly strong. The segment on abortion rights. And those families was incredibly powerful and perhaps the most powerful moment was when Kamala Harris herself stepped on that stage. And you know, her tone was much different than the tone of some of those later attacks and it just shows how (INAUDIBLE) it was because of I suspect the late planning. And then I think you had some indulgent -- some speakers who indulged themselves by going longer. One footnote, I know everybody wants to get a swing at the bat here. This was a small moment. But I think one that I regret, which was Hillary Clinton was talking about Trump and the crowd started chanting, lock him up.

But then there were the parts of the speech, about a third of it, was the speech he realized a month ago that he had to give, which was the handoff speech to Kamala Harris; while still embracing his legacy and taking the fight against Trump, saying now it's time for somebody else to take the lead role in that; calling himself a volunteer. For me, it was interesting. We're not done yet. We still have Barack Obama and Bill Clinton. But I met Joe Biden in 1987. That was my first campaign for president: '87, '88. I was largely covering Governor Dukakis but spent a little time with Joe Biden in Iowa. My next campaign was 1992, and I got to know Hillary Clinton, then the first lady of Arkansas. She, of course, then went on to be a senator, secretary of state, presidential nominee. We still have Barack Obama and Bill Clinton to go, but this was the first chapter in the transitional handoff. You heard Joe Biden at one point talk about the assault weapons ban he passed with Dianne Feinstein. She is gone now. Her replacement in the Senate spoke tonight. Nancy Pelosi just released a book. She's here. She's very high- profile, but she's the former speaker now. So, this giant generational change in the Democratic Party that has been fomenting for a long time is starting to come into focus. Vice President Harris came on stage tonight. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was part of it. A lot of younger Democrats on the stage tonight, too. So, it's a little bit of both. But today was the first page, if you will, in that chapter.

We know he's still smarting over that.But then he passed the torch, because we've talked a little bit about this. After Milwaukee, if you remember, when Joe Biden was still in the race, where his only path was the Blue Wall states plus Nebraska's second congressional district. And even that was very unlikely, both from the polling and anecdotal reporting on the ground in those states. Now, Harris has several different paths. You could start with the Blue Wall. She has a Sun Belt strategy. The race has fundamentally changed. Let me just show you this way, using this polling here. And I'm going to stretch this out. Forgive me for turning my back just you can see a little bit better. This even is not as recent. We know Harris has had some continued momentum. But if you look at the race here, this is all the way back to March, right? And this is Joe Biden, the dark blue with Donald Trump. And they're running pretty even, but then Trump pulls up. And then you see since Harris is in the race, Trump's moved up, too. Support for the third-party candidates has gone down. In both parties, people are coming home. Trump's come up a little bit, but Harris has gone up more. This is national polling now. But by going up more, that has made her competitive. And when you have African-American women more excited; younger voters more excited; other voters of color, typically Latinos out in the Southwest, more excited, it puts her into play. She now has -- you can do five or six reasonable paths to 270. Now, I want to say at the same time, Donald Trump has those same paths, the same five or six, because it is such a close competitive race. But that's not where we were leaving Milwaukee. We were in a race that Donald Trump looked like he was on a path to a landslide. After night one of the Democratic convention, Harris now has the torch passed from Biden. She's in a much stronger position. The challenge, Anderson, is to use the next three days to make what is she -- right now, she has the baton. She has the momentum in the race.

And there's going to be a big focus on Harris and on the issues she wants to elevate in these next three days. And that should give them a bump. You don't get the kind of bumps that you could get, you know, I remember the days of the ten-point bumps. And I don't see that in this kind of an environment.

So therefore, the trade deficit in goods has increased under President Biden, not declined as this claim suggested. It was over $1 trillion in each of his first three years in office.

What it is, is an alternative calculation from economists in his own administration that factors in unrealized capital gains that are not actually treated as taxable income under current law. And there's nothing wrong with using an alternative figure when you explain it, as the White House does. But Biden himself uses it like it's a tax rate under current law. It's not. So what, Jake, do tax rate -- what tax rate do billionaires actually pay? A precise figure is not publicly known at the moment, but a study from two well-known economists estimated that the top 400 households paid an average effective tax rate of 23 percent in 2018, much higher than the president's number.",
