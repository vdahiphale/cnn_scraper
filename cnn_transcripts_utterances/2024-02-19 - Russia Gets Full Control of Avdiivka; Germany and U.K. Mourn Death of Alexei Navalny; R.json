I'm Anna Coren live from Hong Kong.Just ahead, a Russian flag rises over the fallen Ukrainian town of Avdiivka, a stark reminder of the challenges Kyiv's troops will be facing if U.S. aid dries up. But in Washington, the increasingly urgent calls to unlock additional aid for Ukraine are falling on absent ears. And Israel sets a deadline for the release of hostages before it expands military operations in Rafah. We begin in a town in eastern Ukraine. Russian flags are now flying over Avdiivka after Kyiv withdrew its soldiers after several months of intense battles. Ukraine is now waiting anxiously for U.S. artillery as a key aid bill remains stuck in the U.S. Congress. But U.S. House Republicans are on a two-week vacation instead of pushing along that bill. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says U.S. President Joe Biden reiterated America's support for Ukraine during a phone conversation. But Mr. Zelensky says that aid is critical to stop the Russian president's plans. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE (through translation):  The conversation with President Biden, very important points, including about Avdiivka and the need for continued, principled, and sufficient support for Ukraine. And each conversation clearly confirmed the key point. Ukraine alone can stop Putin and create conditions for him to be punished for all the evil he has done. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is demanding House lawmakers pass the bipartisan national security bill, saying Navalny's death is ringing an urgent alarm bell. And Vladimir Putin, quote, \"is watching.\"Navalny's supporters are calling on the government to immediately release his body. A Russian human rights group says nearly 30,000 people have signed a petition demanding that authorities do just that. Officials say Navalny died Friday after losing consciousness. The exact location of his body still remains unclear. Meanwhile, people around the world are expressing their outrage over the activist's unexplained death. Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in the centre of Berlin to pay tribute to Navalny. They blamed Vladimir Putin for his death. And in London, a temporary shrine outside the Russian embassy has been growing by the hour. Supporters have left hundreds of bouquets and condolence messages for Navalny and his family. In a moment, we'll look at how both stories are faring, aid for Ukraine and the death of Navalny, how they've become such hot topics in Washington and on the campaign trail. But let's first head to CNN's Clare Sebastian live in London. Clare, as we're looking at those images coming out of Russia, such an act of defiance, you know, hundreds of these people detained, dozens jailed because they are laying flowers, holding vigils, paying their respects to Navalny. They are aware of the consequences. Give us an update, please, on the public opposition within Russia and when Navalny's body will be returned to his family.",

The Russian state has this ever- expanding toolkit, essentially, of laws that they can use to crack down on any semblance of dissent. Free media are practically non- existent now in Russia.Amnesty International is talking about what it calls the abuse of vague anti-terrorism and anti-extremism legislation. It says that convictions for terrorism-related crimes are up 50-fold in the last 10 years. There's been an even bigger uptick since the beginning of the full-scale war on Ukraine. And it's not just those existing laws that are in place. There have been new offenses put in place since that invasion, the wartime censorship laws that have really changed the landscape within Russia, that have allowed the Russian authorities to crack down not just on opposition figures, but on regular people, regular internet users. Take a look at life under those laws. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SEBASTIAN (voice-over):  The woman being led away, not a known opposition activist, but a 67-year-old Moscow pediatrician. Her lawyer stands helplessly by. Moments earlier, in video provided to CNN, Nadezhda Buyanova (ph) surveys the graphic aftermath of a visit by federal investigators to her apartment. I asked them to be more careful, she says. Hers is one of a steady streams of lives turned upside down by Russia's wartime censorship laws. Her alleged crime, spreading knowingly false information about the Russian army, one of several new offenses created in the early turbulent days of Russia's full-scale war on Ukraine. Now, along with discrediting the army, they form a key pillar of the Kremlin's effort to stamp out all dissent and independent media. DARYA KOROLENKO, OVD-INFO ANALYST:  They will imprison old people, they will imprison people who have disabilities, they will imprison people with children, women with children. They just want everyone to be silent. SEBASTIAN (voice-over):  Almost two years in, thousands of civil cases have been brought under these laws and more than 400 criminal cases, according to human rights group OVD-Info, some resulting in long prison sentences. The crackdown is getting ever more fierce. Russia's parliament just passed legislation allowing the state to confiscate certain assets of those convicted.

Thomas, great to have you with us. I mean, Trump comparing himself to Navalny. I'm not sure how his mate Vladimir Putin would feel about that. THOMAS GIFT, DIRECTOR, CENTER ON U.S. POLITICS, UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON:  No, it's a completely absurd analogy, Anna, but it's something that you would expect from Donald Trump. I mean, Trump's playbook with the court cases is fairly predictable at this point, complain that it's election interference, blame it on a left-wing conspiracy, show no contrition, then declare that an attack on him is an attack on all Americans. Every single piece of evidence that we've seen so far is that embracing that martyrdom complex works for Trump, so he's going to keep on exploiting it. I think for any other politician, a case like the one that we just saw would crash and burn their political career. For Trump, it's just business as usual. And, you know, for Republican voters, every guilty verdict just reinforces this narrative that they've come to adopt. It doesn't matter, you know, if Trump's lying.

Hamas has a choice. They can surrender, release the hostages and the citizens of Gaza will be able to celebrate the holy month of Ramadan.\" Now, he promised that it would be done in a coordinated way with the Americans and the Egyptians, making sure that civilians were out of the way. This comes after the prime minister said that there's plenty of room for people to move north. But even Israel's allies are critical of this plan. And even the White House says that it is highly skeptical of whether it's even remotely possible for Israel to do this, given all the humanitarian challenges on the ground and the act of war that is happening. And case in point, you had airstrikes in Rafah on Saturday, killing six people in one incident, seven in another, according to a hospital director, and then the incident that you mentioned, Anna, killing 18 people in Deir al-Balah. And that is precisely where many people are fleeing to. And in that case, witnesses in the area, neighbors say that some of those who were killed had actually fled north from Rafah, hoping to find safety. But obviously they didn't find it there.

This was a domestic dispute and they say that when they received the call, they knew that this was a man who was armed. This was a man who barricaded himself in the home with his family. Seven children were in that home, ages two to 15. Those officers negotiated with that suspect for quite some time, according to authorities, but at some point, gunfire broke out. Officials saying that they know at least one officer died inside of the home, but it's unclear exactly what happened. They say they're still trying to piece all of this together, but they do say that that suspect had several guns.

Here's that deep Pacific moisture taking aim at the state and so the variety of weather threats primarily were expecting heavy rainfall, a lot of these areas that have already seen significant rainfall totals like San Francisco about 11 inches of rain so far this year, there could be an additional two, three, four inches of rainfall expected there, but it isn't just the rainfall. It's also the wind and the snow. And with the long weekend, lot of people probably trying to get to some of the ski resorts. That's going to be problematic, too, because and some of those rich tops were looking at snowfall in feet and wind 75, 80, maybe 90 mile per hour winds. So be careful if you're traveling up in that direction, it's going to be rather treacherous, also treacherous on the roads down into southern California where the threat, once again prevails. We could see the potential for heavy rainfall, could see downed trees, downed power lines mud flows, debris flows, there's a lot that could happen here over the next couple of days. What -- because this atmospheric river is moving so slowly, so the threat is multiplied over each day. All right, here we go. There you can see it where you see the pink, that's the front range, that is the Sierra Nevada. There's Santa Barbara. And the computer models, it really suggested that this area is going to see a tremendous amount of rainfall and already has this year two to four inches certainly likely, but extending all the way down towards Los Angeles and also into Orange County. So, we'll be here in the CNN weather center to keep giving you updates regarding this latest atmospheric river. So keep it right here on CNN. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
