I mean, you know, the idea of election fraud is braided into his broader message that the combination of demographic change and cultural change is basically displacing the real America, the real Americans. And so, it's a kind of a very short leap for him to make this argument. But it is important, Jim, to reaffirm and to note in polling, this week in \"The Washington Post,\" polling out literally in the last, I believe, a couple hours from CBS, most Americans view this as an insurrection. Most Americans view it as an attempt to overthrow the -- overturn the election and overthrow the government. And it's really important that roughly -- whatever question you ask, roughly one-fifth to one quarter, sometimes even 30 percent of Republicans say they recognize that what happened on January 6th and indeed what happened more broadly after the election from Trump was inappropriate and dangerous, and it remains a critical question what those voters do if he is the nominee. They have enormous power to affect the trajectory of their party in terms of its willingness to whitewash and accept all of this. So far, they've shown no inclination to use it.

He entered the hospital on Monday, and it was not until Friday that the Pentagon released this information publicly. They still have disclosed very little information about what caused this or how serious it was, but Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin tonight did release a statement saying that he was on the mend, looking forward to get back to work at the Pentagon and he acknowledged some of the questions about transparency regarding this matter. He said: \"I also understand the media concerns about transparency and I recognize I could have done a better job ensuring the public was appropriately informed. I commit to doing better.\" He added, \"But this is important to say, this was my medical procedure and I take full responsibility for my decisions about disclosure.\" Typically, senior administration and military officials will disclose that they are hospitalized about within 24 hours of that happening, but all of this is coming at a critical time when you think about the US involvement in the war in Israel and Hamas, also as Ukraine continues their battle against Russia, then there are other issues and concerns about the Israeli conflicts boiling over into a larger regional issue.

First of all, Austin's privacy, and the need to give a heads up to your boss if you're hospitalized.I don't know what the issue is with Secretary Austin. And by the way, he's an old guy like me. And in fact, we're friends and we're West Point classmates, so I know Lloyd very well, but only that this procedure was reported as an elective surgery that later had complications. Having worked in the medical field since I retired, that's not unusual. It was probably an elective surgery that he waited to get done during the holidays, when no one knew it was going to happen that became more serious than expected. Should he or his staff had notified the NSC or the White House? Sure. You always notify your boss if you're hospitalized or something and we don't know what occurred that didn't allow that to happen. But DoD specifically is prevented from talking about the medical issues of any of their personnel, including the SecDef due to privacy issues and HIPAA requirements, which require specific privacy and health care disclosures. You know, while Secretary Austin said he will try and do better in the press release as Arlette -- he also said, and I'll emphasize this, this was his personal medical issue, and he took full responsibility for the disclosures decision, so I admire him greatly for that. He has -- you know, in terms of the war going on, he has multiple deputies he trusts to continue the actions of the department while he is away, and he has been on a pretty tight schedule in both the wars in Ukraine and Israel over the last couple of months.

And I think that once you really boil the pot, if you will, and strike in a couple of these targets, with massive amount of kinetic activity, it's going to cause some unfortunate repercussions. So I think that, you know, there is a need to strike specific targets when we have key intelligence in Iraq, in Yemen, in Lebanon, but even those areas are -- you know, those are sovereign territories.
