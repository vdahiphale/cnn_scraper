Three Chinook helicopters, some of the largest in the U.S. military for heavy lift flew from Djibouti, some 750 or more miles across Ethiopia into Sudan, landing at Khartoum at the U.S. Embassy, securing the Embassy with 100 special operations forces on board those helicopters.Then getting everybody on board that includes diplomatic staff, family members and some nationals of other countries. And then getting them out safely, refueling in Ethiopia and continuing on the way to Djibouti. All of the members of the staff there, the family members as well, evacuated safely on those military aircraft. Of course, the risk was that this ceasefire, which both of the warring parties had committed to, would fall apart. And we already know there were violations of it, and it seems tenuous at best. But that was a real risk. However, U.S. officials who brief report others after the operation itself, said that the helicopters did not come under fire on their way in or on their way out. Of course, the more difficult question now, what happens to some 16,000 or more American citizens who remain in Sudan, many of them dual nationals, so Sudanese American. The State Department confirmed that it did reach out to at least some of them to inform them of convoys arranged by the UAE and Turkey to try to get out of Khartoum and either exit through Port Sudan or try to cross some of the land borders. Meanwhile DoD is considering setting up some sort of surveillance of the land routes out of the country. And is considering also trying to set up a deconfliction mechanism as it watches very closely the situation even as it deteriorates in Sudan. Oren Liebermann, CNN at the Pentagon. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

If he does make this announcement, I think it does two things. One, kind of the nuts and bolts of it, it unlocks this new fundraising potential for the president, and that's no small thing. This could be potentially a $2 billion campaign, and we do also expect the president to meet with some of his biggest donors at the end of this week.But the other thing that this would do, is sort of put to rest this ongoing speculation about whether or not he would run. And the president has been saying, you know, for almost two years that he does intend to run. He said, as recently as a week ago that he plans to run, but that hasn't necessarily put all of those doubts to rest. And you know the main issue with his with President Biden is his age. That is the reason why a lot of people around this country a lot of even Democrats have wondered whether he would go for a second term. If President Biden does run for reelection, he will be asking Americans to get behind the idea of a president serving well into their eighties. That is contributing to what you see in this poll today and what you've seen in polls recently. Is this lack of enthusiasm really for a second Biden term. This NBC poll today said that 70 percent of Americans think that Biden should not run for office that included 51 percent of Democrats, and that is in line with a lot of other polls. Now we should say that poll also included a majority of Americans who said that President Trump should also not run for president again. So, really, not a lot of it of a lot of enthusiasm for a rematch between these two men. But we will see how this plays out as this week unfolds. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Nobody else is breaking into double digits at this point. Not someone like Nikki Haley. Not someone like Mike Pence. Not someone like Tim Scott.But at this particular point, look, the former President Donald Trump has a clear advantage over Ron DeSantis. You can see we had two polls that came out this week -- two high quality polls -- one from the \"Wall Street Journal,\" one from NBC News. We see, you know, Donald Trump hovering in the high forties, right, 48 percent in he \"Wall Street Journal\" poll, 46 percent in the NBC News poll. Ron DeSantis close, but not really all that close, right, down 24 points and one survey, down 15 points in the other. So, you average them together what that's about, 20 points down on average. Someone like Donald Trump at this particular point of polling where he is, wins the nomination about 3/4 to 4/5 of the time. Someone like Ron DeSantis wins it about a quarter of the time. So, the fact of the matter is when you look at those numbers, Donald Trump is a clear favorite. But Ron DeSantis still has a real shot. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

One was the Black Sea Grain Initiative between the U.N., Russia, and Ukraine and, of course, Turkey to get Ukrainian grain flowing onto the global markets from those occupied Black Sea ports. And the second was a memorandum of understanding between Russia andthe United Nations because Russia has complained that its own food and fertilizer experts, which have been officially ring fenced in sanctions are not getting out to the global markets because of things like over compliance and sanctions fear and things like that. It now has a list of demands. Things like reinstating the swift access of its state agricultural bank, reinstating ports access for its ships, insurance, access things like that. It says those parts of the deal have not been met. And in the words of Dmitry Peskov a month ago, the deal cannot stand on one leg. So that is likely to form the focus of the discussions.
