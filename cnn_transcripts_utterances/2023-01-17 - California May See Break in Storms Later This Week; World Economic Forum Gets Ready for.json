The White House says they don't exist. Investigators are searching for two people still missing in the deadly Yeti Airlines plane crash in Nepal. Authorities say rescuers have recovered 70 bodies so far. A committee is on the ground looking through the debris, black box data as well, social media content to find out what led to that crash. Winter weather creeping across the U.S. more than 10 million people are under winter weather alerts right now thanks to a storm system that could dump up to two feet of snow in parts of Colorado. Storms moving in from California are also set to spread snow and rain across parts of Utah, Arizona and New Mexico. This according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. California could see clear skies later in the week after the week of rain. The deluge has wreaked havoc across the state causing more than a dozen deaths so far. Residents have endured power outages, mudslides and mandatory evacuations as the flood waters rise. CNN's Natasha Chen has more from the Bay Area. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NATASHA CHEN, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): In California, another big storm after a series of atmospheric rivers ravage the state, eight million people still under flood watch.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BARBIE NADEAU, CNN CONTRIBUTOR (voice-over): Italy's most-wanted Mafia kingpin, finally arrested after 30 years in hiding. PASQUALE ANGELOSANTO, MILITARY POLICE MAJOR GENERAL (through translator): As a part of investigations coordinated by the public prosecutor's office of Palermo, we arrested fugitive Matteo Messina Denaro inside a health facility. NADEAU (voice-over): Messina Denaro was last seen publicly in 1993, shortly before he went into hiding. After he was convicted in absentia for the assassinations of anti-Mafia prosecutors, Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino, both killed in separate targeted bombings in 1992. Police had been searching for him ever since. Messina Denaro is thought to have led the Cosa Nostra Mafia in Sicily since the arrest of his predecessor, Bernardo Provenzano, who was captured near the infamous Sicilian town of Corleone in 2006. Messina Denaro has multiple convictions for murder, including the kidnapping and death of a 12-year-old boy, whose body was dissolved in acid.
