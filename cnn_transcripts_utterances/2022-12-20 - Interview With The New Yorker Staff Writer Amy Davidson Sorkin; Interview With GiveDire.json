I'm Sara Sidner in Los Angeles sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. It is a meeting that has been years in the making and highly anticipated, and one more headache for former President Donald Trump. As the House Congressional Committee debates making his tax returns public at last. This only, a day after a dramatic and historic decision by another committee looking into the January 6th insurrection, referring the former president to the Department of Justice on four criminal charges. Trump, the only declared Republican contender so far for the 2024 presidential election, offered a defiant response saying, these folks don't get it that when they come after me, the people who love freedom rally around me. It strengthens me. What doesn't kill me makes me stronger, he says. So, how did the committee reach its decision and what are the consequences for the former president? Correspondent Paula Reid walks us through this unprecedented moment in American politics. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. BENNIE THOMPSON (D-MS) AND CHAIRMAN, U.S. HOUSE JANUARY 6TH SELECT COMMITTEE:  We are prepared to share our final findings with you. PAULA REID, CNN SENIOR LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voiceover):  In a historic hearing, lawmakers on the January 6th Committee laid out why they believe that Justice Department should pursue at least four criminal charges against former President Trump. REP. ELAINE LURIA (D-VA), U.S. HOUSE JANUARY 6TH SELECT COMMITTEE MEMBER:  President Trump lit the flame. He poured gasoline on the fire and sat by in the White House dining room for hours watching the fire burn. And today, he still continues to flan -- fan those flames. REID (voiceover):  Lawmakers concluded there is evidence of obstruction of an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the United States, false statements to the federal government, and inciting or assisting an insurrection. REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD), U.S. HOUSE JANUARY 6TH SELECT COMMITTEE MEMBER:  The president's actions could certainly trigger other criminal violations. REID (voiceover):  The Committee also released a summary of its final report, Monday, describing an extensive detail how Trump tried to pressure anyone who wasn't willing to help him overturn his election defeat, while knowing that many of his claims were not true. The Committee played previously unseen clips from interviews with top White House aides like Hope Hicks, who shared what happened when she challenged Trump on his election lies.",

He had fought the subpoena of his -- some of his e-mails at his -- separate e-mail address that he had. They litigated that and it was that litigation that not only gain them a lot of important and quite incriminating materials, but let some of the questions about what happened be aired in a court. And the judge who adjudicated that claim is through -- Judge Carter, he probably heard a quote from him, from his findings in that a lot. He was the who said that, what he saw going on in the conversations between Trump and his people with law degrees was really a coup in search of a legal theory. It allowed some discussion of that. There is also a litigation involving the Committee and the National Archives in which, you know, Trump and his allies have made all sorts of quite spurious privileged claims. You know, executive privileges as if Trump is still and always would be president and could just tell anybody not to speak. And those have actually had an airing in court, and Trump has lost, or the Trump side -- the Trump team has lost. And that's important because it means that the Committee's work and the evidence that they can put before the public and other investigators, that allowed the Committee.

First that so many people around Trump kept telling him he'd lost. And they kept telling him that his plans for holding on to office were illegal and unconstitutional. It's particularly striking, I think, for a lot of people with the -- how they documented the pressure that was put on Mike Pence, his vice president. How -- and how many people said this is not right. There is no way to watch the hearings and hear the witnesses and feel that somebody made a good faith mistake about this. Now, I hasten to say that, you know, when we talk about the hearings, it was mentioned yesterday that, in what was released yesterday, which is just the executive summary of the report, the rest of the report comes later this week. That we saw either in person or in video clips maybe 70 witnesses, but the Committee interviewed about 1,000 people.

You know, that -- some of that argument does seem possibly to have gotten through in key races. It didn't solve anything, but it might, in a funny way, give Democrats the courage to keep making that argument. To not say, you know, this is never going to reach anybody, because it seems to have reached some people and that's a proof of concept, if nothing else, that it can reach more people. That you can talk this through with people, you can get people to least be in the conversation about what it meant, that they haven't completely written it off. Now, I would also say, you know, about the ball being in the Justice Department's court, I think that the people in the Justice Department would say, it's been in our courts for a while, and it's going to stay in our court. You know, there have been about 900 criminal charges scaled already. They have been at it. It's interesting, there's a moment in the executive summary where there is a comment that, usually when Congress makes a referral to the Department of Justice, that it's about something that Congress has just come up with or has found in the course of its work. And they recognize that this isn't in that category. It's not news to the Department of Justice that this happened, and that a lot of crimes may have been -- were committed on January 6th. There is some divergence in how they are approached, and of course, there is a question of Donald Trump. You know, the Justice Department has gotten a lot of flak for -- are they being too slow. They have been very methodical. And, you know, it's easier really, as a committee, to, you know, say, we're going to refer Donald Trump to the Department of Justice, then you actually have to make a case.",

And we had people who stopped and said, what is the constitution want me to do? And they attack (ph) on that. You saw that in the videos that the Committee obtained of people, of the Members of Congress who were told, you know, it going to take -- it takes quite a while to clear out the cap on this. And they said, no actually, we have to get back in there right now. The Committee sees itself as part of that process, of part of that stop and question and ask, where do our constitutional values lead us? And part of that is, as you said, saying, well, you know, there have been a lot of criminal charges against people who are in the mob. What else were they part of, and what are the different ways that our justice system can approach that at the highest level as well as at the lowest level? That moment of taking responsibility, I think, stands out. I think the Committee has tried to do that and -- but it's -- you know, I think it's important to remember that the Committee is not standing alone in this. There is so many investigations going on and it's not going to end with the Committee being disbanded. This report, it's going to get us further, but it's not going to be the final word yet. I mean, maybe we'll hear -- you know, it's not inconceivable that we will have a moment when Donald Trump is actually questioned in a court of law about his role in this. And if we get to that point, that might -- you know, that's part of the work that we are seeing now from the Committee. But in the end though, I think that what stands out is that people are going to -- in future years, go to the polls with a clearer picture of the consequences of different kinds of folks and about the choices that they make too.",

Inflation in many African countries has gotten completely out of control. Many countries are now facing a debt crisis. So, they have borrowed a lot of money, often from China, over the last few years, and are struggling to repay it on flexible interest rates. But the fundamental problem is that Africa remains one of the very poorest regions in the world. And in fact, it's been a great failure of the world. There were 167 million people living in poverty in Africa in 1980. And today, there are 470 million people. And this is something that we should be taking a long hard look at.

One person might need to get their kids back into school. Their neighbor might need to fix the roof. Somebody else might need to put some food on the table. And giving cash to people is the most efficient and effective way of delivering support. And it gives some dignity. It gives them choice. It lets them be in charge of the decisions in their own lives. But one of the things that is holding us back is that are immense psychological blocks to giving cash. So, a huge amount of money is wasted with the United Kingdom, European donors, the U.S., refusing to give cash, and often giving things in kind, which communities don't want, don't need, and have to sell for cash to get what they actually do need.",

But of course, if you really want to balance Chinese influence you have to think about the whole world. As you've have pointed out, places like that Democratic Republic of the Congo produce enormous number of the rarest metals which are vital to things like mobile telephones, to semiconductor chips. And Africa is also the big growing story in terms of population. One in 10 children born in the world will be born in Nigeria alone by 2050. It is the place where migration will come from, pandemics will often come from there, there are global security threats, but it's also a great place of opportunity. And what the U.S. needs is to be innovative. It's not going to be able to spend this much money as China, but the reason we are trying to encourage the U.S. to think about being imaginative and using things like cash, is that by doing so they can help everyday people living in extreme poverty in Africa and have a different American attitude. Instead of the Chinese who tend to focus on working with the elites, doing big infrastructure, the U.S. should be leading the way in ending extreme poverty.

And if someone doesn't have a phone, we will issue them with a telephone. That allows us to transfer cash directly from someone in the United States or Europe right into the hands of the most extreme poor. And the results are revolutionary. It is extraordinary how what would be a small amount of money for you or I, can be life transforming in a poor community in Africa. You see the most wonderful things on education, on housing, on people getting livestock. Amazing improvements in nutrition, in education enrollment, all coming from cash. And I would encourage people to look at it seriously, not necessarily, only at GiveDirectly, but at other people who are doing it because it is the great undocumented revolution in international development.

And it was superior to -- for 20 years or more where GDP per capita in Britain was growing faster than the United States or any comparable country. And that came to a grinding halt into doesn't it with the financial crisis. Since then, incomes have stagnated, inflation has taken off, our borrowing is now out of control. And as you say, we now find ourselves in a situation where everyday people are hurting. They are finding that things are costing them 10 percent more and their wages are not keeping up. So, they've gone on strike. But of course, Britain, unlike the United States, is a place where many more people rely on trains and cars. So, train strikes affect them. Where we have a National Health Service, so when nurses go on strike that affects every clinic, every hospital in the country. And we are stuck between a rock and a hard place. The government feels like it can't increase all of these public sector salaries because it would cost them many, many tens of billions of pounds at a time when they can't afford to borrow more. And one they're worried, they'll cost more inflation. But at the same time, ordinary people are struggling to heat their homes.",

And it -- there are images in this movie you will never forget having seen, but at the same time there's an enormous amount of heart and warmth and kindness in this movie.

It's in a way a critique of the public school system, and its many failings, and how it doesn't serve a lot of communities well. But at the same time there's just so much heart. And I guess this is a theme across both me and Stephen. This show has so much heart and so much appreciation for the profession of teaching.

But then, you go online and you see people talking about other people in the same way. I feel like, while it wasn't by suicide, when I think of Chadwick Boseman and his shocking death and how, before he died, there were a lot of people who were commenting on how thin and frail he looked. And were being really, really mean. And then, you know, once we found out after the fact that it was because he was ill, people said the same thing. I think there's just a cycle here, and I would love to see some change in how we talk about these things, but it's really hard. Our collective memory is so short. But I do think there is a larger theme about mental health and keeping -- maintaining your mental health and taking care of it.

And so, to see her really shine in Jordan Peele's \"Nope\", in this really big, sort of, breakout role in a mainstream Hollywood movie, and then also see her hosting \"SNL\" and revealing her pregnancy, Beyonce in a way, and really shining and that platform. I think being able to see her come from this child star, she's been in the business for, you know, 10, 15 years. And she's really -- she's always had that talent.
