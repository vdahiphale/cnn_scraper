      "sentences": "It's a bit of a mystery. We don't really know. He hasn't been seen in public since August 29th. A little bit more than two weeks ago, and he didn't show up at a meeting with senior Vietnamese military officials that was scheduled around September 7th.And there was never really public -- any public explanation for why. So there were questions asked to the Chinese Foreign Ministry today, where is the Defence Minister? Is he under investigation? And the Foreign Ministry spokesperson kind of said I'm not really aware of this situation. Meanwhile, the Reuters news agency, it has ten sources saying that the defense minister is actually being investigated and it has to do with military procurement, which he used to be in charge of before he got this current job. Now, you've got the U.S. Ambassador to Japan, that's Rahm Emanuel. He's basically been trolling the Chinese government on Twitter on X. Last week he had this post where he said, quote: President Xi's cabinet lineup -- that's President Xi Jinping of China -- is now resembling Agatha Christie's novel, \"And Then There Were None.\" First, the foreign Minister Qin Gang goes missing, then the Rocket Force commanders go missing. And now Defense Minister Li hasn't been seen in public for two weeks. What is he referring to? Well, back in July, the foreign Minister Qin Gang of China, suddenly he stopped showing up at meetings with senior U.S. officials. He didn't attend a regional summit and people started asking questions. Where is he? And then abruptly, he got stripped of his post and his predecessor was put in as the foreign minister. And then there's been two top officials who were -- two officers running the Rocket part of the armed forces -- that's basically ICBMs and nuclear weapons -- they kind of disappeared and suddenly were stripped of their positions and replaced with no explanation. So what does this all get to, Brianna? Well, we don't know what's happened to the Defence Minister exactly. We'll be watching that. But there's a pattern here of senior officials in Xi Jinping's government suddenly disappearing. No explanation why. Being replaced. And that's kind of how governance seems to work in China these days -- Brianna.",

And it's finally starting to show impacts along the coast of the U.S. 80 mile per hour winds with 100 mile per hour gusts. This is moving fast at 18 miles per hour. So while this is going to stay away and avoid a U.S. landfall. Most likely you have to remember that tropical storm force winds extend about 300 miles from the center and so we are going to see tropical storm force winds along the Cape, Eastern Massachusetts possibly as well as Maine.And so, the biggest threat with this is going to be really the power outages. Because when you think of the strong winds, the downed trees, power lines, things of that nature. Most likely staying at category one all the way through tomorrow morning and we're going to be seeing this just shoot up into Canada over the weekend. So the forecast satellite and radar showing the rainfall pushing through. We're going to see just a couple of inches of rain across New England. Highest amounts are going to be across eastern Maine and then on into Canada. Where we could see anywhere from 2 to 4 inches of rain. But we do have those tropical watches and warnings up. The forecast wind gusts, we're going to see the strongest winds along the Cape, Eastern Massachusetts tonight. Once we get into tomorrow morning, that's when the peak winds will reach Maine and then this will quickly push on out by tomorrow afternoon. So the storm surge looks to be about one to three feet. We could see some coastal flooding, some beach erosion, things like that. But I think the biggest threat, Boris, is going to be the power outages.",

But the good news for him and his fans is, successful surgery on that Achilles underwent this past week -- midweek -- successful surgery. And that is a really encouraging sign. But no question, this has been a highly emotional and tumultuous week for both Rodgers and the Jets nation as a whole. Simply a whole roller coaster of emotions.You know, a week ago Jets fans were dreaming of a Super Bowl triumph from their new prized acquisition, who is a four-time MVP and now they are left wondering if, and indeed when, he will come back to the field of play. He will turn 40 years of age later on this calendar year. And he's been conducting, actually, Jim, his first on camera interview since Monday's season ending Achilles injury.

Just like fellow greats and fellow icon of the sport, Tom Brady. Well, the road has now become a whole lot tougher for him. But I know this much. I would not count him out, as I say, turns 40just before -- well later on this year in December in fact. As for the Jets, it doesn't get any easier at all for them. They play at the Cowboys on Sunday, this coming weekend. We'll be watching it all very closely indeed. As I said off the top, I do want to wish the player himself all the very best in his recovery.

And what he will be doing, President Zelenskyy, will be trying two things.One, to get the rest of the world's nations who are not necessarily on Ukraine side, who are still straddling the fence, who take a lot of Russian narrative about this war and who are hurting, by the way, because of the grain shortages and the food prices and the hunger due to all of this. And he's going to try to address them and get them on side. Then he's going to go to Washington, as you say, and he will meet with President Biden and individually, we understand, with members of Congress, the Senate, et cetera. No joint address as he did before. But his job there is to say thank you but we need more. And this counteroffensive -- I was in Ukraine just a week or so ago -- and I see that it's making progress, but they definitely need more if they are to achieve what the United States and NATO has laid down as a marker that they must win -- and Putin must be defeated.
