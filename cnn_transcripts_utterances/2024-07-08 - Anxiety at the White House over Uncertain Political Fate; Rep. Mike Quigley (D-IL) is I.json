New reporting on how people around Biden are feeling as Democratic lawmakers are heading back to Washington for the first time since the CNN debate. Why so many think this week is the one that will decide it all.Hurricane Beryl lashing southern Texas right now. More than a million people without power in Houston, the nation's fourth biggest city. We are live on the ground for you. And Boeing agrees to plead guilty to conspiracy to defraud the U.S. government. Families of crash victims, though, are furious, calling it a sweetheart deal. I'm Kate Bolduan, with John Berman. Sara is out today. This is CNN NEWS CENTRAL. So, the new CNN reporting this morning is describing the Biden White House right now gripped by anxiety and uneasiness as the president is facing intense pressure to prove his doubters wrong and at a critical moment. Lawmakers are returning to Capitol Hill for the first time since the CNN debate that shook the Democratic Party to its core. The president remains defiant, vowing that he is staying in and can get the job done. This morning sources say that multiple top House Democrats told Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries on a call yesterday that they don't believe that Biden can. That they believe Biden's time is up. CNN's Kayla Tausche is at the White House. Kayla, what are you hearing? What's going on with - inside the White House right now.",

      "sentences": "Kate, I've been on the phone with several officials this morning to talk about the mood ten days out from that disastrous debate that really unsettled the Democratic Party and lead to widespread questions about Biden's future as a candidate for the 2024 election.The mood is somber. It's anxious. It's despondent. There's widespread uncertainty about how the White House will go forward and how President Biden will try to assuage concerns and actually whether he can do that considering the fact that his strategy up until this point, staying the course, aggressively hitting the campaign trail and giving interviews to talk about how he - you know, acknowledges that he had a bad performance, but is not going anywhere, that so far that has not moved the needle for Democrats. And now I've learned this week he's going to be aggressively working the phones, once again calling Democratic lawmakers to try to assure them that he hears where they're coming from and that he is - you know, he is willing to work with them on a path forward. This after he spoke with more than 20 House Democrats last week to the same effect. And some of those House Democrats then came out and vocally supported him. But the - behind the scenes there are still growing calls to figure out whether Biden should step aside and whether he can be replaced on the ticket. Yesterday, on that virtual meeting convened by Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, at least five senior Democrats who serve as the ranking members on influential committees in the House themselves said that they could no longer were support Biden. And now the full Democratic caucus is set to meet on Tuesday to figure out whether that's a message that needs to be essentially collated and provided in short to the White House. So, this is what the White House is facing is President Biden meets with dozens of world leaders here in Washington, as he visits battleground Michigan on Friday, again aggressively campaigning, trying to convince the American people and his own party that he's up for the task.

And again, what I was stressed to the president is, this isn't just about you, it's not about loyalty, it's about being pragmatic. We have to be honest with ourself. And it's not just the White House at stake. And all of these seats are going to be very, very closely contested. And only a handful of seats control both houses.Every vote counts. So, the top of the ticket is essential that it be very strong. And again, we're going in the opposite direction. The president has to respect that.",

I don't know how the president will react to that. We simply must go forward, get our job done in Washington, D.C., and, again, try to express to the American people why this matters, and to our president.

I don't think anyone understands what the blueprint is because nothing else can move forward unless - unless and until President Biden makes that choice.You know, I have people all the time saying who would you be for? You know, we're just not there yet. There are rules. There's a process. It has to be seen, as you know, as legitimate to the American people. So, we have to follow the rules and the process. But we're not at that point yet. So, what we're facing right now is a situation where the election cycle is getting worse. The numbers that we're facing here, not just in the White House race, but in all these congressional races are not getting better. So, we're in a horrible situation until that gets resolved.",

And again, there's a lot of processing that has to take place.And, frankly, a lot of the polling, it will continue to come out. I think it will influence peoples' decisions. So, I can't read the minds of my friends in the Black Caucus, but I suspect they're going to be doing the same thing all the other members is, is taking time to deliberate and talk and discuss this matter.",

You know, it - he's only acknowledged that he had a bad night. You know, that isn't particularly helpful. I think the fact that he said a few statements like, you know, I can't schedule things after 8And I think the thing that bothered me the most is when he said, you know, when asked, well, what if we lose the House and the Senate and the White House, and things don't just work? He just said, well, if I gave it my best effort, then that's all that you can ask for.

He received 14 million votes, 87 percent of those votes cast. And by the number of delegates that have already been pledged to him, he is the presumptive nominee by a wide margin. He goes on to say, \"do we now just say that that process doesn't matter? I decline to do that.\"At the close of the letter, though, he says this, \"the question of how to move forward has been well-aired for over a week now. And it's time for it to end. We have one job. And that is to beat Donald Trump.\" He notes that there are 42 days before the Democratic convention, 119 days before November 8th. And he warms the party against any weakening of resolve between now and then that could be seen as cracks, or fissures, from their opponents. And that could open them up to even more criticism. He bids Democrats to band together. Just in advance of senators are expected to meet for lunch tomorrow and talk about the open question on - in their chamber about whether they have real concerns about whether the president should step aside, as well as the House Democrats. They're all - all party meeting that is expected to happen tomorrow as well after some senior most members of the party in the House raised concerns yesterday on their private call.

Unclear, John, whether those - whether those conversations will fall on deaf ears, whether many of those lawmakers have already made up their mind at this point. But I've been hearing from a lot of people in the White House, in the DNC this morning, who are worried about that issue that the president raised in his letter about if Biden ends up being the nominee a few weeks from now, if all of this was just an exercise in futility, how much damage was done to the party and done to their ticket in the interim whether there's actually even a viable process that can be run that gives them a better outcome.
