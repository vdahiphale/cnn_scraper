That is, according to \"Doctors without Borders\", most of the organization's programs across the country have been suspended and that is along with 250 other humanitarian programs.

Russia's foreign minister is in Cuba as part of the Latin American tour. Tuesday he was in Venezuela meeting with President Nicolas Maduro where Sergey Lavrov offered support and called for the lifting of U.S. sanctions. His trip to Havana comes at a time when Cuba is re-electing its leader for a second term. CNN's Patrick Oppmann has the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): For decades, it was a question that obsessed policymakers from Washington to Moscow, who would succeed the Castro's once they left power in Cuba. Only in 2013 did Raul Castro and the speculation by announcing Miguel Diaz-Canel, as First Vice President and his heir apparent. Comrade Diaz-Canel isn't an upstart or an improvisation he says, his trajectory has lasted nearly 30 years. An engineer by training and a long-time Communist Party bureaucrat, Diaz- Canel in 2018 became President of Cuba, the first Head of state on the islands since the revolution, not named Castro. But his tenure has been marked by nearly every calamity imaginable. A month after Diaz-Canel took office, Cuba suffered one of the island's worst aviation disasters when a plane operated by the state airline crashed, killing 112 people aboard. U.S. economic sanctions, many of which were lifted under the Obama Administration were renewed with a vengeance by then President Donald Trump. Generous shipments of oil from socialist ally, Venezuela have waned as that country grapples with its own economic meltdown. The pandemic shuttered Cuba's tourism industry, for the worsening already widespread shortages of food and medicines. Then on July 11, 2021, thousands of Cubans took to the streets in the largest anti-government demonstrations since the revolution. Within hours Diaz-Canel went on state TV to order those faithful to the government to attack the protesters. The order to combat has been given he said, the streets belong to the revolutionaries. The crackdown on protesters led to more economic sanctions from the Biden Administration, which may only further unify the communist run government. On Wednesday, Cuba's National Assembly will meet and is widely expected to approve a second five-year term as president for Diaz-Canel.",

You know, one is a militia force that was hired off as a mercenary army. The other is a professional army; they see themselves as a professional army, even though they've committed scores of human rights abuses, over the decade in the country. But they are properly trained; they've been trained by the Egyptian military. And they sort of have a proud tradition of trying to defend Sudan's constitution. And so, I think that these forces represent really diametrically opposed visions of the country. And so, I don't see how it's going to be very easy to get them to negotiate. The reason they're fighting now is because they could not agree on a security sector reform program that would have seen the creation of one unitary national army that would be subservient to civilian leaders.",

Again, he was a, he sold the RSF as a mercenary army, and made fabulous wealth as a result of that in Yemen and Libya, working for Gulf States. So, he has used that money to arm himself very heavily, and to recruit very heavily with, you know, arguably more than 100,000 troops right now. So, his revenue stream is certainly contributing to this, but we can't forget the Sudan Armed Forces, the military owns, you know, half of the economy. They you know dug in to military and non-military commercial operations alike. So, they have an independent revenue stream as well, they don't rely on any kind of national treasury. And there, of course, getting assistance from outside actors right now, whether it's Egypt, or the United Arab Emirates, or neighboring states. I think very quickly, we're going to see this devolve into a much more regional configuration, if we can't get the parties to begin talking very soon.",

Testimony on that is happening today before a U.S. House committee. Meantime, the Taliban's decision to remove woman from public view is set to cost Afghanistan with a new U.N. report predicting international aid will fall dramatically this year, worsening an already catastrophic economic crisis. The U.N.'s Development Agency says if international aid falls by 30 percent Afghanistan's GDP would contract by 0.4 percent. And so far, the humanitarian aid plan is only 5 percent funded for this year. Per capita, annual incomes could fall to just over $300 next year, which would mark a 40 percent drop since a year before the Taliban takeover. The U.N. warns there will be no escape from poverty without women in the workplace. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ABDALLAH AL DARDARI, U.N. DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME: The engagement continues. We speak to them every day. And we present the numbers that we are presenting to them, showing how detrimental the absence of women in public life, education and work is to the future of the Afghan economy. But at the moment we don't see any positive response. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And that it's not just Jews coming here it is, the heads of state from the countries that were affected Poland, and who was the perpetrator, Germany, I mean, that says a lot. And the fact that you have so few Jews left here, because two and a half million, I believe were murdered. Two and a half Polish Jews, including most of Wolf's Polish family were murdered here. There are so few Jews, who are currently living here, and yet, you're seeing and you're going to see this with the ceremony later today. People walking around, absolutely no personal connection to Judaism but walking around with these and these are daffodils and the daffodils are symbols of, of hope, and of rebirth. And this comes from the time of the Warsaw Ghetto. And they wear it like this, which is also intentional, as a sign in a memory of what Jews had to do during Nazi occupation, which is where Jewish star on their body either on their repel or on their arm. And so, it is important, everybody here understands and really around the world important to remember. So that this saying that we have never again actually lives out, especially at a time with anti-Semitism on the rise, not just here, but even more so in the United States.",

And like Wolf said, we actually went into the gas chamber that still exists where his grandparents were likely killed. And we saw at Birkenau, our great grandparents were Hungarian. So, they were taken there pretty late in the war in 1944. And we learned that they were probably likely taken straight to the gas chamber and then the crematorium. They also have a cattle car, part of the trains that were used to bring all of the Jews in there. And just seeing all of that being on the ground, where our great grandparents walked to their, to their death was really, really sorry, it's hard.
