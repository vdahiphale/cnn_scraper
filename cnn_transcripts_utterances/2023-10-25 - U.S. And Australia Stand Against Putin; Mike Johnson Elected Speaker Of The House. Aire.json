Australia is a critical partner, together with the United States and 50 other nations, 50 other nations we've been able to put together, all doing our part to support Ukraine. And I want to thank you, Mr. Prime Minister, for the new package of military aid you recently announced, -- and it's for Ukraine.Look, Australia and the United States also share, in my view, a commitment to upholding international rules of the road, including freedom of navigation. Just this past week, the PRC vessels acted dangerously and unlawfully as our Philippine friends conducted a routine resupply mission within their own, their own exclusive economic zone, the South China Sea. I want to be clear; I want to be very clear, the United States defense commitment to the Philippines is ironclad. The United States defense agreement with the Philippines is ironclad. Any attack on the Filipino aircraft vessels or armed forces will invoke our mutual defense treaty with the Philippines. And Mr. Prime Minister, today we renewed our commitment to defend the values that are at the heart of this alliance, and we continue to stand as one to forge a better future for both of us and all the region. So, I want to thank you again for being here. Thank you for your partnership and your leadership in this critical moment. And I'd like to now turn it over to you.",

He will become the next speaker of the House. The Republicans finally, after all these weeks, managed to get their act together and do this.

And Mike Johnson has none of those things, has none of those qualities and none of those characteristics. He's relatively new. And in this particular environment, Wolf, that was the biggest plus for him. That was it.It's that he doesn't have a lot of personal baggage and that he doesn't have the connections because in this environment, the connections that leaders have made have only made enemies out of a lot of the people in their own conference. And that really speaks volumes, Wolf, about where the House Republican conference is and frankly where the Republican Party is right now that is still led by the former president, Donald Trump.",

Jake, you're in Tel Aviv right now. I wonder, I assume you heard what President Biden had to say about the Israel-Hamas war that's ongoing right now. The president was very supportive of Israel's what he called right and responsibility to protect itself. He says Hamas does not represent the vast majority of the Palestinian people in Gaza or any place else. He was very critical of Israeli settlers in the West Bank, attacking Palestinians in the West Bank. And he was very strong in reaffirming his commitment to what is called a two-state solution, Israel alongside a new state of Palestine.  I wonder how the Israelis and the Palestinians in the Middle East, where you are, Jake, are going to react to what we just heard from the president.",

First of all, I don't know that his views that Hamas does not represent the views of Palestinians is completely agreed upon. Michael Oren, the former Israeli ambassador to the United States, you've had him on your show. I've had him on my show. His view is that Hamas is actually representative of what Palestinians generally believe. And in fact, he argued that the reason that the Palestinian Authority on the West Bank has denied the people of the West Bank an election in years and years is because if they were to have free and fair elections in the West Bank, Hamas would win in a rout.That is his argument. But beyond that, I think the larger point he's making is that the terrorist tactics of Hamas should not be blamed on the 2.3 million, million. Right now, we're just going to look at some of the footage on the Hill, and we see that Speaker Johnson, newly elected Speaker Johnson, is being welcomed, welcomed on the floor of the House.

And I'm very confident in the discussions that I've had with Democrats and Republicans that there is very broad support for the AUKUS arrangements and that there will be support for the legislation going forward.And I think that would be a very good thing. It is in the interest of Australia, but it's also in the interest of the United States.

It is in Australia's interests as well as China, but I believe in the global interest for us to have a relationship where there is dialogue. And hence, I welcome the fact that I have been invited to China. I'll be traveling at the same time as we will commemorate 50 years since the first visit by an Australian Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, to China in a short period of time now.And I think that is a positive thing. It is good that various senior representatives in the US administration have had meetings with their Chinese counterparts in recent times, because dialogue is always a good thing. Through dialogue comes understanding and comes a diffusion of tension. We want a peaceful and secure region, but we want one as well that's based upon the rule of law and where national sovereignty, including issues such as the South China Sea and the right of passage in that important waterway there, the East China Sea, the Taiwan Straits, is respected. And that is Australia's position.

But the fact is that I have met with Xi Jinping more than any other world leader has. I've been over 68 hours of private meetings, he and I, with simultaneous interpreters, starting back when I was Vice President, because it wasn't appropriate for a president of the United States to be meeting with the vice president.So, I travelled 17,000 miles with him. And I've subsequently, in addition to that 68 hours, I've also had another, they tell me they keep meticulous contact, another, I think, 12, 15 hours of discussions, just he and I. And I think that he is realizing that there are, for example, his Belt and Road Initiative. Well, we're going to compete on that. And we're going to, we're doing it a different way. The Belt and Road Initiative has ended up dead in the noose for most of the people signed on. We are working with our G7 partners to provide infrastructure for the very nations that he's trying to deal with. We want to, for example, -- at the G20, we were able to act on a proposal I had to bring, to build a railroad all the way from Riyadh, all the way through the Middle East, Saudi Arabia, Israel, up through Greece, and then across the, not the railroad, but pipeline across the Mediterranean, up into Europe.",
