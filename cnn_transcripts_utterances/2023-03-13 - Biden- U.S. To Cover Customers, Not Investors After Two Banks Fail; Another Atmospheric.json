And Signature Bank which saw a run on its funds as for SVB's collapse. Today, the president announced regulators are taking them over.

You'll just listen to what you just heard that a week ago, a bank that was considered the gold standard now no longer exists. That creates very real anxiety, rarely real concern. I think the concern from administration officials was that there would be significant outflows of deposits from a number of institutions, a lot of which they had been watching, viewed as very much risk -- at risk or potentially on the verge of failure. And they needed to do something to step in the way of that.And you saw that in a very dramatic manner, really two different steps that were taken yesterday, both backstopping all deposits for both SVB and from Signature Bank in New York, which failed on Sunday. And then on top of that heading -- having the Federal Reserve establish its lending authority that would give these middle and smaller banks -- midsize banks, smaller banks access to a lending window to ensure that they would be able to maintain liquidity. Now, both of those are critical to having ensured that the market has confidence that these banks can still exists, that depositors have confidence that the deposits are safe, and trying to calm things down to some degree. But also, a very different set of circumstances than in 2008, which the president made very clear he wanted to underscore today. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

What the president said is true.The FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund is funded through bank assessments. The Federal Reserve's lending facility while it is set up with $25 billion from the U.S. Treasury. They don't expect to have to utilize any taxpayer money. However, make no mistake about it, the full faith and credit of the U.S. government is behind these moves. They don't expect it will cost any taxpayer money at all throughout the course of the process.

I talked to a current employee at Silicon Valley Bank and he was dumbfounded by how all this went out, specifically the fact that CEO Greg Becker. He went public with the extent of the bank's need for cash before privately lining up the financial support they needed to get through the storm.This employee said that you know that was absolutely idiotic. They were being very transparent. It's the exact opposite of what you would normally see in a scandal, but their transparency and forthrightness did them in. And here's why. The argument is that this set the stage for a panic, right, customers ended up pulling out $42 billion on Thursday alone in a classic run on the bank. $42 billion context, that is a huge amount of money. That is about almost a quarter of the bank's total deposit. And be -- by the end of that day, by the close of business, the bank had a negative cash balance. They had run out of money. I talked to Yale professor Jeff Sonnenfeld, who's an expert on management issues, and he called this a tone-deaf botched execution by the bank. He sums it up this way. He said, \"someone lit the match, and the bank yelled fire.\" Now, I should note that the CEO did reportedly apologize to his employees about what happened. I think the question now, of course, is whether or not this massive response from Washington is going to be enough. Investors are on high alert for whether or not there's other banks that are in a similar situation. Regional Banks, they got clobbered late last week. I would have thought that we would have seen a bit of a rebound after what the government just announced last night, but not so much. Look at that on your screen. You see losses of 40 percent, 60 percent from some of these major banks, First Republic Bank, Western Alliance, Comerica taking significant losses. I think the math --",

So, in addition to the FDIC now ensuring all depositors including those who didn't have insurance, and guaranteeing all of their deposits, they took this extra extraordinary step over the weekend. And they created an emergency lending facility really to act as a backstop -- the treasury really the backstop here, putting some $25 billion on the line suggesting that the financial system is whole, is sound, and that, of course, is to prevent this continuing on -- this contagion effect to impact other regional banks.

You know, I really hope people are held accountable here, particularly the regulators, the Federal Reserve, who supervise this bank, and it was hardly a Gold Standard Bank.

Goldman Sachs says they don't think the Fed is going to raise interest rates at all because of all of this stress in the banking system because of what Aaron was just talking about, which is that the Fed rate hikes have created a situation where the bonds that some of these banks are sitting on that they rely on for capital has lost a lot of value.
