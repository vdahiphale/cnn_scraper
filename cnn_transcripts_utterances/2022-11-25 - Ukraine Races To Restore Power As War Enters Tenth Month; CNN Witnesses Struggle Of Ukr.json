Now, all this really pertains to all facets of the public sphere. We're talking about media, radio, television, also the Internet as well, but even books. And the fines are really steep. It ranges from thousands of dollars for individuals to tens of thousands of dollars for legal entities or companies. And if you're talking about foreigners, they face up to 15 days in prison and then possibly being deported. Now, we were watching some of the proceedings in Russian parliament, and essentially what the lawmakers there were suggesting is that they believe that the west was trying to spread homosexuality here in Russia and undermine traditional Russian values. In fact, the speaker of Russian parliament called this law the answer to Blinken. Of course, talking about the U.S. Secretary of State. Well listen in to some of what the speaker parliament had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VYACHESLAV VOLODIN, CHAIRMAN OF RUSSIA'S STATE DUMA (through translation): It is the best answer to the United States Secretary of State Blinken. Stop imposing on us foreign values. You destroyed your values. We'll see how it ends. But that is sad for sure, because it is sodomy. I can't say it in any other way.
