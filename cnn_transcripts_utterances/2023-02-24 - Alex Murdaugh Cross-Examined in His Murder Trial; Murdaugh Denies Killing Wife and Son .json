She has served as a lie detection expert for the FBI, the CIA and for the ATF. She's also the author of You Can't Lie to Me. Sara, so, I want to start with you first, though. A lot has unfolded in this questioning today. I want to start with one of the things that Dianne talked about, because I think this is really critical to the case the prosecutors have to make. They spent a lot of time on this four-minute period of time, right, where he made 283 steps asking Alex Murdaugh to explain what he was doing in that time. What do you make of what you heard from Murdaugh but also that amount of time is a very short period of time. Do the prosecutors make their case that he was doing something nefarious at that time, perhaps cleaning up after the murders?",

You know, I think that the prosecutor at some point it looked like Murdaugh is cross-examining the prosecutor as opposed to vice versa.And the prosecutor was trying to get these sound bites from him. He has been doing this for hours since yesterday, and he is not getting them. He is trying to -- the prosecutor is trying to prolong how long Alex was at the kennels, Alex did a good job at saying, I didn't want to be down there, it's gross and sweaty, I had just taken a shower, I just wanted to go down and took the bird out of the Bubba's mouth and came right back and left. So, yes, he couldn't really explain the steps, but, again, it's going to come down to -- I've had a lot of clients who have lied. Most of my clients lie. It's about whether the jury believes you now despite having lied before, and I think Janine can speak to that.",

I thought that he said, well, I lied because I was paranoid and the paranoia comes from the addiction, because it wasn't really digestible to me.And today, because Waters chose to go there, and I thought that was a big mistake, you cannot go down the road of addiction because it is not the same for everybody. The number of pills you take, the amount of money you spend, the withdrawals you experience, the functionality -- I'm around a lot of attorneys who are just like Alex Murdaugh, who are functional, who are winning trial, but absolutely strung out on drugs, whatever the drug choice might be. So, it is a mistake to try to question somebody's addiction especially because it is not just him self-diagnosing himself, we have text messages with his family, we have text messages with the victims, we have other testimony that he was always fidgety, and that could have been when he was withdrawing. So, it was a big mistake to go down that rabbit hole by the prosecution. I think he did humanize himself. I don't know if the jury is going to make the connection between addiction and the cornerstone of addiction, which is conning, lying, covering up, living a double life. Those are things that are common to someone who is an addict and they become programmed to do that. Now, that is just a fact. I just know because I've been around it personally and professionally. But, you know, I think that it was a mistake to go there because I think that he explained himself very well. I think he humanized himself with the second part of why I put a client up on the stand is to explain facts. I think there are many instances where Waters doesn't really know what he is even wanting from Alex Murdaugh. And then he is surprised by the answer and then he gets really annoyed and really frustrated. And I'm told that jurors, some are rolling their eyes, which is to me a death knell.",

Look, there's a lot about Alex Murdaugh that makes him really quite a character on the stand. But you do have to put it into the context, as Sara was saying, that he is an admitted addict. So, when you look at things like the licking of the lips and the poking out his tongue, his mouth is dry, what does that signal to you from a body language perspective, and do you think jurors will attribute that perhaps to either lies or his addiction?",

We see something very interesting when he pushes his tongue inside his mouth, they are called the pacifiers. The higher the pacifier, the more stress and anxiety. And this high level pacifier, pushing the tongue inside his cheek, you see it often. They even do this, actors, in movies. And it indicates usually the smugness, this contemptuous (ph), where it is demonstrating like this is a joke, like I'm being contemptuous.But this is interesting. He is very charming. Yesterday in the courtroom, they had a couple of jurors crying at the same time. We have mirror neurons. If he cries and we cry, that makes us like him because we experience it. I think the prosecuting attorney is going to have his hands full here with the jury. I would say the best way to detect deception is to not have the effect (ph) of the person you're looking at and analyzing if they're crying, if they're screaming, if they're mad, if they're screaming, if they're mad, if they're contemptuous, if they're disgusted. You have no effect (ph). You will make a better decision on if this person is telling the truth. The fact that two jurors were crying yesterday, two female jurors, this is not good for the prosecuting attorney, because it is going to be very hard to turn the tide on those two women to say, oh, no, you just were duped, my dear, because we have this innate -- I said do you want to be right or do you want to be effective. Most of us want to be right. And the body language, he leaks a lot of disgust, and this is disgust. This disgust is repelling contaminated objects. It doesn't belong here. If anything, we should have sadness here, authentic sadness, we should maybe have fear. Hey, who did it? If it wasn't him, who did it? Where is that? Where is that part of him?

It matters and it goes to the whole sloppy investigation, the totality of this, that they really singled him out, they decided he killed his wife and son, and it was like we're not interested in talking to you anymore, you know?

That is nearly 40 percent of the country's entire population.But the world has rallied behind the besieged Ukrainian people symbolically and materially. All over the world, you see those symbols down accepting millions of refugees and providing tens of billions of dollars and counting in humanitarian aid and military aide. As we speak as well, western tanks are being sent over to Ukraine. Putin expected that these alliances would splinter with his forces on NATO's doorstep, but, in fact, the opposite has happened.

President Biden began his day with a call with G7 leaders and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy showing that not only is Kyiv standing one year later but also, of course, crucially, that coalition of nations that have really provided Ukraine with economic, financial and military support, as well as impose severe sanctions on Russia to show that that coalition is very much still standing.And we just got a joint statement from the G7 countries committing in that same statement to intensifying that support on all of those different fronts over the course of the coming months and years, a long as it takes, as we have heard President Biden say, as long as Ukraine continues to fight off this war of aggression being waged by Russia. What we're also seeing from the United States is additional military support, $2 billion in security assistance coming, bringing the total U.S. security assistance over the last year to $32 billion, and also a string of new sanctions announced today which the Treasury Department is billing as one of the most significant sanctions to date. Especially what they're doing here, Abby, after a year of trying to cut off Russia from the global economy, what they are focusing on in particular over the next year, and I spoke with the deputy treasury secretary about this over the last week, is focusing on trying to seal the cracks in these sanctions evasion efforts that Russia is doing, specifically to continue to try and bring in revenue to Russia and keep its war machine going. And so many of these sanctions that were announced today are, in particular, going after companies and countries that have helped Russia evade some of these sanctions to try and limit those efforts. A lot of this is focused in particular on some products, dual use products, as they are known, civilian technologies that can be also used for military purposes. And so that is where the work is now focused over this next year and something that administration officials are very clear-eyed about, the challenges that lie ahead in terms of continuing to arm Ukraine, increase defense production amid concerns about dwindling ammunition supplies and also focusing on sealing those cracks in the sanctions effort. But interestingly, if you listen to Jake Sullivan last night on CNN, what he did make very clear is that despite the challenges ahead, the U.S. believes that Russia has already lost this war. In terms of lost this war, failing in its initial objectives to take Kyiv, to subjugate Ukraine and to make it a part of Russia. Abby?",

It's something that administration officials have been talking about over the course of the last several days, saying that they do have intelligence indicating that China is considering that possibility and issuing stark warnings of the consequences should China move ahead with that, but, so far, the administration not willing to share that underlying intelligence publicly.
