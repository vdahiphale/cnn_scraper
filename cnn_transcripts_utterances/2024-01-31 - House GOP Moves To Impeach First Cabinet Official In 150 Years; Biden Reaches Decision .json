We want Biden to take it into his own hands, which is a change from what we have heard from Republicans who have used the fact that Democrats have been unwilling to come to the table on border negotiations in the past as political ammunition for them. And now, they are saying, no, actually, we're not going to get behind any of these border measures, which would be very conservative and restrictive because they think Biden needs to be doing more. And, of course, all of this is in 2024 as we're heading into an election. HUNT:  Yeah. No, to that point, my colleague Manu Raju questioned Speaker Johnson about the Trump of it all yesterday.

We know that he has allies in Congress, who have endorsed him and who stay in communication with him.And we know that around the time that Trump has been speaking loudly about his opposition to this bill that's being formed in the Senate, we have also started to hear more frequently from Speaker Johnson and from these Republicans. So you can kind of do the math there. It seems that there is at least some form of influence, of course.

I suppose the overall objective here is that they plan to strike back more powerfully than they have done thus far in response to attacks.The overall objective is to degrade, deter and avoid escalation. They want to degrade the capabilities of these Iran-backed militias to prevent them from being able to carry out such attacks in future. They want to show them that they really shouldn't carry out such attacks in future because of the response. And we could argue that the announcement by Kataib Hezbollah in Iraq, which is the most powerful Iran-backed militia there, saying it's going to suspend attacks against U.S. targets. It says to avoid embarrassing the Iraqi government, but perhaps that could be seen as having been deterred by the U.S.'s planned response. I suppose the final thing avoiding escalation. But we have already seen with U.S. attacks from the U.S. and its allies against Houthi rebels, which have been menacing in the strait and the Red Sea, that hasn't deterred and hasn't completely degraded their capabilities. The presence of a strike force in the Eastern Mediterranean hasn't prevented Iran-backed Hezbollah in southern Lebanon from carrying out the attacks against Israeli targets. So it's unclear as to what kind of attack could have the desired effect without going into the escalatory phase. The one thing we do know is that it probably won't be on Iranian soil -- Kasie.",

And then Zelenskyy came out later on saying it doesn't feel it's at a stalemate. So, a difference in messaging there. And obviously, it's not great the head of your military says it is at a stalemate when you want to show the world that you're making progress and you need more funds other countries to try to press ahead with that progress. It doesn't work politically to describe it as a stalemate, but perhaps the military was just being realistic there and perhaps a lot of people would agree with that.",

Then it's who picks up the bill and just a general sense that the European Union, U.K. can't get the same funds together.So a huge amount of pessimism about Ukraine's ability to keep up this effort to push forward across the Russian lines. And, you know, it's gone to the extent now where other countries in Europe are setting up defenses because they maybe next. There's even talk of conscription in the U.K. to try to support forces on the front lines -- for those European frontlines against Russia.
