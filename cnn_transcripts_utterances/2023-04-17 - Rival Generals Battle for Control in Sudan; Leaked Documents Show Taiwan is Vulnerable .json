Here's a look at some of the top stories that we're following right now.About 30 minutes from now House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, he's going to be delivering a pretty big speech at the New York Stock Exchange. He's expected to essentially lay down his marker as the high stakes battle over raising the nation's debt ceiling kicks into high gear. Sources tell CNN House Republican leaders are moving behind the scenes now to get their caucus to rally behind a plan that would raise the debt ceiling for one year and also, though, come with a bunch of strings attached. Also, the high stakes and wildly expensive trial between Dominion Voting Systems and Fox News is being delayed. The trial, which was supposed to start this morning, has been pushed off until tomorrow. The reason why, still officially unclear. \"The Wall Street Journal,\" though, which is owned by Fox News parent -- the -- Fox News' parent company, is reporting that Fox has made a last minute push to settle the defamation case out of court.

This morning there is worry the country may dissolve into civil war as two rival military generals fight for control of that country. Take a look at the video here. It appears to show a military headquarters up in flames. Another shows fighter jets flying over the capital city of Khartoum. And today, residents woke up to the sound of more artillery fire. More than 100 civilians are dead. Behind the chaos, these two men, Sudan's Army Chief General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and Mohammed Hamdan, Dagalo, the commander of the Rapid Support Forces, a paramilitary group.Now, they gained power during the bloody conflict in Darfur, nearly two decades ago. But in 2019, both of the men worked with the army to overthrow Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, who was the first sitting head of state charged with war crimes by the international court. And just two years ago they both played a crucial role in another military coup that ended with what was supposed to be a power-sharing deal between the military and civilian groups. But, just last week, violence broke out after a disagreement over how the paramilitary and the military would integrate, creating the violence that we are seeing unfolding now. John.",

The findings are part of the dozens of highly classified documents that were leaked online allegedly by Massachusetts Air National Guardsman Jack Teixeira. This latest intelligence assessment comes as tensions are at an all-time high, of course, and just a week after China conducted three straight days of military drills near Taiwan, CNN's Ivan Watson is joining us now to - he's looking into this report, what we know, what we don't, and also, Ivan, how Taiwan is responding to all of this.",

Well, right off the bat, the defense ministry of Taiwan, Kate, they've come out with this statement saying, quote, we respect outside opinion on our national defense, but a foreign media cited unidentified documents and the content was obviously not factual. And then went on to go -- went on to say that Taiwan's military is prepared to defend Taiwan's airspace in the event of an attack from mainland China.Now, let's backtrack to the actual reporting by \"The Washington Post.\" CNN has not seen the actual document that they're referring to, the leaked document. And we've requested comment from the Pentagon. Still waiting for an answer on that. \"The Washington Post\" says that -- that there's a pretty grim assessment, arguing that there's a lack of coordination within Taiwanese air defense, that its defenses would be easily overwhelmed, that they don't have the right radios for communication, they wouldn't be able to coordinate attacks on different targets, and that barely half of the aircraft in Taiwan's air force is fully operational right now. So, it's pretty grim stuff. And this comes again after the tensions last week where China conducted these exercises all around Taiwan. This was partially in protest of the president of Taiwan visiting the U.S., meeting with the House speaker, going to Latin America as well. I do need to point out that a U.S. guided missile destroyer, that's the USS Milius, it conducted what the U.S. Navy calls a freedom of navigation operation transiting the Taiwan Strait on Sunday, trying to show that the U.S. will -- Navy will sail anywhere it deems to be international waters, much to the chagrin of Beijing. Just an ongoing sign of the ongoing tensions in that contentious region. Kate.",

So, let me back up for a second.In 2021, a young woman by the name of Effie came forward in a press conference with famous lawyer Gloria Allred and she claimed that she met Armie Hammer on Facebook, that they had an on and off again relationship for several years, and that it turned violent allegedly and that he allegedly raped her in 2021. I mean in 2017. The LAPD opens an investigation. Here we are now. The LAPD has turned over their investigation to the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office, and they are looking into this. So, it's unclear if they are going to bring charges. We have reached out to Armie Hammer's team for comment. But I want to tell you previously what Armie Hammer said to Airmail. So, he did an interview in February, and it was the first time that he had spoken out about these allegations personally, not through an attorney. And, John, he said, quote, I had a very intense and extreme lifestyle. A whirlwind of travel and sex and drugs and big emotions. Now, he, you know, stands adamantly by the fact that he did not do anything that was not consensual. Now, just a little bit ago we got a statement from that woman, Effie, to CNN. And I'd like to read you what she is telling us. She says, quote, I am severely traumatized by Armie. I feel disgusted that he's not taking accountability for what he did to me and that he's resorted to attacking me. Armie has no remorse. He continues to cause pain, and I don't think he's changed at all. So, obviously, we've reached out to Armie's attorneys and his publicist for further comment.
