He does not want to go to trial and he wants the judge to toss it.Today is the first of very likely a series of hearings where he's going to be making those arguments through his lawyers and they're going to make -- be making the argument that he had a lot of power as president to determine what records are his. And, yes, he took the national security documents out of the White House at the end of his presidency and thus they're his because he says they're his. They're personal papers. Now, the Justice Department, they have been very clear, the National Archives has been very clear, for the entirety of this investigation, this case, and since Trump left the White House, that that's not how it works, that these are presidential records, that there are rules and laws around how they can be handled because it can jeopardize national security if there aren't parameters about what documents are the publics, the United States' government's documents versus what are personal papers of the presidency. We're going to hear all of that in court today and be listening very closely to see what Judge Aileen Cannon does. This is not a day where she's likely to make a ruling on what to do here. She's going to be listening to arguments. But Trump is going to be in the courtroom, which always can change the tenor of how things go because he will be sitting there in front of the judge as the criminal defendant in this case. On top of that, we still are waiting for a bunch of other things. Kasie, in this case here in Florida. When is it going to trial? That is still up in the air. We're waiting to see if Judge Aileen Cannon says anything about that today as well. Kasie.",

I want to sort of expand our conversation in terms of two key issues that are going to drive this race, this presidential race, are both on display today, immigration and abortion rights also. But let's start, Ashley, with the immigration headlines that our Priscilla Alvarez talked about earlier in the show. The Biden administration considering using Guantanamo Bay as a processing center for Haitian migrants if there's a crisis because of the domestic, political instability that's going on there. It's clearly pretty remarkable that, I mean, when people hear Guantanamo Bay, that's going to kind of set off certain things in their minds, right?",

I mean he became a towering political figure on the back of the idea that building a wall was the right way to keep immigrants out, and people responded well to that. And there's just -- look, anything that happens, the situation in Georgia with the murder, you know, that became a big issue at the State of the Union.And so, I do think - look, the Biden administration has always had a problem with communicating effectively about things. And I think that the American people -- when I listen to voters talk about immigration, they want to be humane. They are not trying to be inhumane. But they always say things like, I want people to come the right way. And what they mean is, we want to know who's in the country. We want to, you know, have a real way that is legal, that we're processing people. And I do think Joe Biden's got to get out there on this issue and say, we need to balance humanity with the rule of law. HUNT: Right. All right, so we've covered a very significant vulnerability. Let's talk about something Democrats see as a real asset for them in this campaign, Molly, and that's abortion rights and protecting reproductive rights. We've learned Kamala Harris is planning to visit a Minnesota abortion clinic, a Planned Parenthood, which is not something that a sitting vice president or president has ever done. And I think it's worth pointing out that the clinics themselves, before the fall of Roe, were a huge flashpoint in the abortion wars. I mean it - you know, if you were on the liberal side of the issue, you know, they will ask for volunteers to escort people through the crowds of protesters, often carrying very, you know, grotesque signs and saying things to people basically to cross the line to get into the clinic itself. What does it tell you that suddenly Democrats are embracing this to the point that they're sending Kamala Harris to a clinic? MOLLY BALL, SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Well, it tells you that, as you said, that this is a -- they view this as an important -- probably the central political asset for this campaign. And - and I - and I think for Democrats, there's -- they need to break through to voters that this is actually at risk. There's a sense -- and Vice President Harris has been the administration's chief messenger on this issue. They view her as very good at making the case about reproductive rights, what they've been calling reproductive freedom. She's been touring the country and talking about this for more than a year now, basically ever since the Supreme Court decision. And for, I think, for the - for the campaign, there's the feeling that, number one, people don't necessarily - well, people don't know where Donald Trump is on this issue because he hasn't said. He, obviously, was responsible for the - for putting in places the Supreme Court that overturned Roe, but he has not said what kind of national policy he would support going forward, whether he would favor any kind of federal ban, what kind of limit he would favor, what other kinds of details, because ever since that decision there have been a lot of questions about how - how we should move forward as a country or whether it should be left to the states.",

And we've now seen places like Texas and other - with laws that are sort of close to that idea of punishment. But at the same time, because Donald Trump is a liberteen (ph), as a human, like, when I listen to voters talk about him, voters are like, this guy doesn't care about abortion. This guy has paid for abortions. You know, they just -- they don't think of him as somebody with sexual morality or somebody like a Mike Johnson or a Mike Pence, and that gives him the sheen of sort of moderation. And so the Biden administration and this campaign is going to have to work extra hard to really make it seem like they are at - that Donald Trump and the court and the Republicans are all after these rights, after IVF, and push that as hard as they can.",
