Snow, ice, and a dangerous winter blast sweeping across the U.S. as thousands of flights are canceled. We are live in the CNN Weather Center with what is coming next. Plus, the January 6 Committee releases its final report on the deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol, laying out the case against former President Donald Trump. And for the first time, Vladimir Putin uses the word \"war\" to describe his invasion of Ukraine. We begin this hour in Washington where the House committee investigating January 6th has released its final report. Without specifically mentioning Donald Trump, the panel concludes that anyone responsible for an insurrection should be barred from holding public office. The report goes on to detail a concerted effort by Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 election. Chapter titles include the big lie, I just want to find 11,780 votes, and a coup in search of a legal theory. The committee outlines a scheme to submit fake electors from states that Trump lost, and at least 200 attempts by Trump and his inner circle to pressure state election officials. The report includes testimony that Trump wanted to walk from the White House to the Capitol on January 6th, and it says, the White House should have canceled Trump's rally at the Ellipse because of the risk of violence. More now from CNN's justice correspondent Jessica Schneider. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

There was no doubt in their minds.In fact, there is some evidence in the report that he was -- that the team was going to work on his presidential library. They were getting ready for the aftermath of his presidency. And so, any notion that he did not know or he had any doubts about there being this massive election fraud is really put to rest. The people closest to him let him know, told him, in no uncertain terms, that he had lost the election, that there was no massive election fraud, and despite his efforts to go -- file the many cases that he filed in court, he lost in the court. His efforts to revamp the Department of Justice, that failed. And despite all of those efforts, he continued to persist with the big lie.

In the report, they detailed how the lawyer basically walked her through this process. Later, we know that she will be stuck with the team if she said the right things, that she remained the team player, that she would be rewarded for giving some kind of testimony. She pushed back from that lawyer. She ultimately fired that lawyer and move forward to give the testimony that has been very critical to the destination.

And as we wake up in the morning with this flash freeze, Alison, our temperatures are going to be near record.Look at this, 39, that is what it feels like, 39 below zero in Des Moines. Actual temperature? Nine degrees. What counts is what the wind has factored in. We have wind gusts. In Cleveland, 26 miles per hour. Thirty-nine miles per hour in Indianapolis. That is enough to cause wideout condition which, by the way, likely happening at this moment with the snow coming down. Wind chill warnings from the northern plains to Texas, on up into the mid-Atlantic. Other areas are dealing with advisories. Regardless, this could be potentially deadly if we are not heeding the warnings themselves. Eighty-four hours, Jackson, Mississippi is expected to be below freezing. This can lead to your pipes starting to freeze up. So, one of the things that you can do is keep your temperature at your house around 65 degrees Fahrenheit, open the doors where the pipes may be so that warmer air can circulate, and make sure that you're allowing your faucets to drip, keep that water moving. Another thing is frostbite. If you're exposed to 35, to 45 below zero wind chills, it only takes five to 10 minutes for frostbite to hit. Speaking of, we have wind chill values that are going to be below zero for the next three days. Alison was talking about this. This is travel time to see grandma and grandpa, mom and dad, or to finish your Christmas shopping. You need to make sure you're bundled up, all the extremities, the gloves, the scarves, everything you can do to protect your skin from this kind of weather. Blizzard warnings, by the way, still in effect across the northern plains and the Great Lakes, now pushing into parts of New York, like there in Buffalo, water town, where visibilities are expected to be down near a quarter of a mile with temperatures, of course, feeling much colder and snowfall reaching near two feet in some of these locations.

Of course, this is the first time since Russia's invasion of Ukraine began that President Putin has publicly described this as a war, not a special military operation. He has been very careful -- the Kremlin has been very careful to maintain that terminology throughout since the invasion began.But we have heard, since those comments were made, from one U.S. official, who has said that an early assessment from the U.S. government is that this may well have been a slip of the tongue. But, of course, officials will be watching to see over the coming days and weeks whether this was in fact an accident or perhaps whether we might start to see a shift in rhetoric from President Putin and from the Kremlin over the coming days and weeks. Of course, this comes off the back of that landmark meeting between President Zelenskyy and President Biden in Washington. We've already heard from the Kremlin and President Putin, they say that neither leader, according to the Kremlin, showed any willingness to listen to Russia's concerns. Of course, Russia is now concerned given the fact that President Biden and the U.S. government has signed that landmark aid package to Ukraine, including crucially the transfer for the first time to Ukraine of the Patriot air missile defense system, which is something that Ukraine has been pushing for some time now. Take a listen to what President Putin had to say about this.

Over this week, more than 80 percent of the country's population will see at or below-freezing temperatures. Some places way below like Denver, where the temperature dropped nearly 40 degrees in just an hour, hitting negative 15 by Thursday morning, or Wyoming where a state trooper took this video, zero visibility, and temperatures 60 degrees below zero. Elsewhere, parts of the Midwest are doing what they can to keep up. One of the biggest concerns in a winter system like this is the roads. And this dome is part of what it takes in a city like Chicago. You're looking at 50,000 tons of salt inside that, crews come in and out of over the course of the day to try and help keep these roads somewhat manageable. The city has about 400,000 tons of salt and more than 300 vehicles in its arsenal to fight back on this second official day of winter.",

The chamber will reconvene January 3.The U.S. economy grew much faster in the third quarter than exports previously thought. The Commerce Department released its final reading Thursday. It found that U.S. gross domestic product grew at an annual pace of 3.2 percent between July and September. The previous estimate was 2.9 percent. The stronger-than-expected reading was due to increases in exports and consumer spending. U.S. stocks took a dip due in part to Thursday's GDP report. Investors are concerned that the stronger-than-expected showing could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise rates more than expected in the new year. The main three indices fell with the Dow dropping more than 700 points before rebounding to end the day about 350 points in the red. The former CEO of the bankrupt crypto company FTX is now free on a $250 million bond. Sam Bankman-Fried appeared before a judge in New York on Thursday. The judge agreed to a bail proposal presented by prosecutors and lawyers. The terms include bond and electronic monitoring bracelet and being on house arrest at his parents' home in California. It's Bankman-Fried's first appearance on U.S. soil since his arrest last week in the Bahamas. He's accused of stealing billions of dollars from customers of his defunct crypto trading platform. Arraignment for those charges will happen at a later date. The next generation of artificial intelligence is here. It's called ChatGPT. It's a chatbot that can provide thoughtful and human-like if sometimes inaccurate responses to questions. It already has more than a million users after debuting just a few weeks ago, Tom Foreman has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Allowing cars to drive themselves, composing songs that mimic popular artists, and producing this digital painting that took the top award at a Colorado art show. This is all the work of artificial intelligence, computers that don't just do what they're told, but in a sense, think, learn, and create. And right now, ChatGPT is rattling the AI world turning out stunningly humanoid writing. Just ask Douglas Rushkoff, a renowned author, and professor of Media culture.",

In the late 1800s and early 1900s, automobiles were relatively primitive by today's standards and were primarily used by wealthy individuals or businesses. Ask you to write a sonnet in the style of Jerry Seinfeld. I'm just a stand-up comic telling jokes on stage. I make them laugh and that's all I do. But sometimes life's a joke. It hits me low.
