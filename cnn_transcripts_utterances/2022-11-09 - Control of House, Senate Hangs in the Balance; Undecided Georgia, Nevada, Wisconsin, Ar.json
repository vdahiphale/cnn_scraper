Welcome to viewers in the United States and around the world.Right now, control of Congress still in limbo while votes are being counted in key races across the nation. In the House, the magic number for control, 218, which means Republicans only need 19 seats to hit the threshold, and they are leading in 21 competitive races. Democrats, as you know, have a much tougher road, they need 40 seats, they're only reading in 24 right now. Over in the Senate, we're watching four tight races that are still too close to call. Nevada, Arizona, Georgia and Wisconsin, both Democrats and Republicans currently hold 48 seats. It takes 51, of course, to win an outright majority. Now, despite the possibility, Republicans could win a narrow victory in one or both chambers. An adviser for President Biden says the White House feels, in their words, vindicated this morning, now feeling confident the Democrats have seen one of the best first midterms for an incumbent president in decades. I want to begin with what is left to decide out west, in Nevada's Senate race, 2020 election denier Adam Laxalt is leading incumbent Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto right now by two points. The Nevada governor's race, too close to call, with only 80 percent of precincts reporting, it could go either way. CNN's Rosa Flores joins us now live from Las Vegas. Clark County where -- you are in Clark County. What's going on there?",

      "sentences": "Well, you know, Anderson, because in this very tight race with razor thin margins, the details matter.I want us to nerd out a little bit about Clark County. Let me tell you about this. 1.3 million of the registered voters are in Clark County there in Nevada. That's more than 70 percent of all of the voters in the state of Nevada. And this county leans Democratic. Now, the turnout so far is 45 percent. This is according to Clark County official website. Now, we want to break that down for you because these details are important. Election Day vote, 10.9 percent of those 45 percent turnouts, early voting, 14.8 percent, absentee voting, 19.5 percent. And here's the breakdown between Senator Catherine Cortez Masto and Adam Laxalt. Catherine Cortez Masto has 50.97 percent, and Adam Laxalt, 46.21 percent. That means that the Democrat here has a less than a 5 percent margin, and, again, in Clark County, it leans Democratic. Now, what's important about Clark County to know too, as well, and the state of Nevada is that, in 2020, the state of Nevada shifted to a universal mail vote. And what that means is that everybody that's registered got a ballot in the mail, unless they opted out. And so, Anderson, the key question is going to be how many people actually put that ballot in the mail yesterday. Because so long as it is postmarked yesterday, it could be counted until Saturday. And so we don't know how many of those ballots are out there, but we do know that a lot of times these mail-in ballots lean Democratic as well. But the key question will be, will that give Catherine Cortez Masto enough of a lift to actually keep her seat. We don't know that.",

As you know, John Fetterman defeated celebrity Dr. Mehmet Oz to capture an open seat currently held by the GOP. CNN's Harry Enten it's at the battleground desk. What's your exit polling showing about Pennsylvania voters? HARRY ENTEN, CNN SENIOR DATA REPORTER:  Yes. So, the one thing that I think we think about Pennsylvania, it's a state that flipped from Barack Obama to and Donald Trump and then back, of course, to Joe Biden in 2020. And the reason that Donald Trump did so well for Republicans was because he did very well among white voters without a college degree, who make up the clear plurality of voters in Pennsylvania. I think there was this question, could John Fetterman, sort of what the outfit he wears and visiting all those rural areas that have a high number of white non-college educated voters, could he cut into the Republican margin? What was that margin among white non-college educated voters yesterday in Pennsylvania? You'll see that, in fact what happened was that fetterman lost among white non-college educated voters by 24 points. You say, okay, wow, Oz ran away with those voters. But, in fact, Donald Trump won among those voters two years ago by over 30 points, so it does seem like Fetterman was able to cut down on the margin. And, of course, there was the issue of the campaigns, right, where Fetterman had his weaknesses and Oz had his weaknesses, the idea, of course, that Oz didn't live in the state for very long. And so the exit poll asked, has Oz lived in the state long enough to represent it effectively in the United States Senate? Look at this, just 42 percent of Pennsylvania voters said that, in fact, he had lived in the state long enough to effectivel serve in the Senate. The clear majority, 56 percent, said, no. Now, of course, health, was he healthy enough to actually serve following his -- situation with Oz where the clear majority of voters didn't side with Oz, the clear plurality of voters did side with Fetterman. 50 percent said that Fetterman's health was good enough to serve the state effectively in the United States Senate. Now, of course, there was also a gubernatorial race on the ballot, right? And there was this whole question with Doug Mastriano. He was, of course, an election denier, and he went around saying that the 2020 election was fraudulently decided, which, of course, we know is not true. Here's what we asked. Who do you trust to handle Pennsylvania elections? 51 percent of Pennsylvania voters said only Josh Shapiro, the Democratic candidate. And among that 51 percent, look how they voted. They voted 99 percent. Get this, 99 percent to 1. So, Josh Shapiro was able to win this race solely on this issue. The fact is that Pennsylvania vote handle elections effectively, they didn't believe that that at Doug Mastriano, and ultimately -- caught by Josh Shapiro. Anderson?",

Take a listen. No sound. Well, he basically declared the race over, although he did say that it was important to wait for all of the ballots to be counted. And here's something interesting. We heard that he was supposed to speak, Ron Johnson was, this morning. That speech has apparently been canceled. We have not heard from Barnes'. A statement was issued by one of his spokesman late last night, saying, we always knew this race would be incredibly close. We will wait and see what Wisconsin voters have decided after all of their voices are heard. But one bright spot for Democrats is the race for governor. Governor Tony Evers declaring victory Tuesday night. He has won a second term. And that means he will have the power to certify the 2024 presidential election in this battleground state.

Is that going to help him? Or does he have to run alone? That certainly might not help him, given that he spent a big part of his speech last night talking about horse manure and comparing himself to Ricky Bobby from Talladega Nights. So, he is that problematic candidate that Senator Mitch McConnell was talking about.Georgia is also where we can look at what's going on with key demographics for Democrats, particularly black voters. Black men did not break Republican. Black women and white women, dramatic difference there, where 70 percent of white women voted Republican. 90 percent of black women voted for Democrats.

If it had been a bad night, that would have been a kind of full blast today. And as we said before, for Trump and for the Republican Party, the issue is there were five states that picked the president. Trump picked nominees for the Republican Party, and all of those states, and most of them, and maybe all of them are going to lose candidates in his image. The Republican Party was wiped out again in the suburban counties that recoiled from Trump. Those same counties recoiled from these Trump- style candidates.

And so the trend particularly in presidential elections is to think that they have this huge mandate to swing for the fences but also that we only have X amount of time and power before the other side gets here, so let's do everything on a partisan basis as quickly as possible, which becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy, it invites a backlash against them. And so that's why we've had these pendulum swings going back and forth. I expect more of the same.On Ron's point about the predictive value about this, it's possible. I'm a conservative. I think Joe Biden deserves his low popularity. The party could misread this. I don't think Joe Biden is a particularly competitive candidate for re-election. And the idea that because he did have these historic midterms, that somehow he is poised to run away with a re-election when he won the first time by promising to be a nonpartisan, sort of above the fray return to normalcy guy, that's just not his brand for lots of Americans now. So, it's just a completely different thing. Meanwhile, just one last data point, J.D. Vance in his victory speech thanked 34 people by name. None of them were Donald Trump.

Abortion, the significant advertising dollars spent locally focusing on that issue.These are things that are broadly accepted by the American public as popular, but in the polarization in Congress have somehow become divisive issues, along the lines of right versus left.
