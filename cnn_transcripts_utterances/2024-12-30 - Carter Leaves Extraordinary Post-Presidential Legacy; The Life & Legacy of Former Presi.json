We're now learning that he will lie in state at the U.S. Capitol, and President Biden will deliver a eulogy at Carter's state funeral in Washington, D.C., on January 9th, a day that Biden has declared as a national day of mourning.Today, Carter is being remembered for the arc of his extraordinary life, from peanut farmer to the 39th president of the United States. He served just one term in the White House, but went on to redefine what a post-presidency could look like. Today, many are honoring him for his humanitarian work, and also for the deep love that he shared with his wife of 77 years, Rosalynn Carter. CNN's Eva McKend is in Carter's hometown of Plains, Georgia, for us. Eva, tell us how people there are processing the loss and putting the focus on Jimmy Carter.",

President Carter post-presidency could have lived anywhere in the country or around the world, but he chose to return here to Plains, a town of just a few hundred people.And over the coming weeks, we will hear about his lifetime of service, his character, his courage, but for the people here, he was their neighbor. Not long ago, he would be walking here in downtown Plains, right here on the main street, or teaching Sunday school at church here in this community. We caught up with Bonita Hightower. She owns one of the few restaurants in town. And here's how she's thinking about President Carter's legacy. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BONITA HIGHTOWER, OWNER OF BONITA'S RESTAURANT: You know, I'm really - it's a happy sad, only because he left so much. You know, he had - he left a nice path for anybody that wants to do something great, you know, from Plains, Georgia or wherever, a small town, and he did it. He fulfilled and then he came back home to rest. I think that's what we're all supposed to do. So, I feel really great, because he impacted so many lives. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He was on duty once in the Pacific, this is after World War II. And he was on lookout post, and was literally swept off the bridge of the submarine.And then in a miracle, was swept back onto the bridge of the submarine. I mean, he was an extraordinary lucky seaman on that day. But his life was like that, just one extraordinary chapter after another, running for the presidency after one term as a governor. That was a pretty thin resume. But, you know, it was 1976 and the country was exhausted from the Vietnam War and morally exhausted by the Watergate crisis. And here comes the completely unknown, virtually unknown politician from the Deep South, who promised integrity and that was what he ran on.

      "sentences": "I think for both Mrs. Carter and for President Carter, the notion that every human being has value, every human being has worth and has dignity, very much played out in the work of the President's Commission on Mental Health. It was groundbreaking in that one of the mental health commissioners was actually a woman who was in recovery, who had suffered from serious and persistent mental illness the first time ever that someone with lived experience had been asked to play a role in setting mental health policy.And that reflected both President and Mrs. Carter's belief that even ordinary people have extraordinary experience and that they need to be engaged in public policy. I think that the commission also focused a great deal of attention on public attitudes about mental health and mental illness. And that it's hard to believe now, but 50 years ago, people were afraid to even talk about the subject. And most people were afraid to admit if they had a mental health problem. People were afraid to seek help. And we were afraid to finance it in a way that gave people access to health. President Carter himself understood the importance of making mental - good mental health services available to folks. And he also, because of his great confidence in Mrs. Carter, was committed to making sure that the recommendations that the commission made were implemented. And so, among other things, there were significant increases in the level of funding for research. There were significant increases in funding for the prevention of mental health. And there was even a national plan for providing services to the people with chronic mental illness who had been released from large state institutions without appropriate supports in their own communities. So, I think that the mental health - the attention that we have to mental health today, the fact that stigma has begun to lift, and the engagement of folks in building strong community-based services are all a result of the work that the President's commission did.",

It's the fact that, you know, Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter were a husband and wife who were in some ways just ordinary citizens like the rest of us. And I remember being in Plains one Sunday, attending the church service with the two of them on - because I wanted to hear President Carter teach a Sunday school class.And at the end of the service, Mrs. Carter asked me to go back to the house and have lunch with the two of them. She told me that Jimmy always made lunch after church. And so we went back to the house, and President Carter served me his two specialties. One was a peanut butter and banana sandwich. The other was - served on whole wheat, please (ph.). The other was a tomato, vidalia onion and mayonnaise sandwich served on whole wheat. And when he gave it to me, I said, sir, I'll never eat that much. She looked at me and said, you can take the leftovers on the plane with you and eat it on your way back to Boston. So, I share that with you because President Carter was a remarkable human being. And his faith was truly at the core of who he was. But it was his commitment to human rights and his belief that there was dignity and worth to every person, that it's those beliefs that will continue to animate the work of the Carter Center. Mrs. Carter and President Carter, as partners, have built the Carter Center into a strong and vibrant organization. And it will be an enduring legacy to the values that both of them held dear.",

And it appeared to me from that shot, it was directly underneath, that flaps had been extended and it would have been. They were in final approach. The flaps would have been set that, you know, halfway down. But when it hit the runway, the flaps did not appear to be extended and certainly the landing gear wasn't down.There really is no explanation for that. Because the landing gear, if it does not go down automatically as instructed, you could manually release them. So, it's not clear why that occurred. And the other perplexing thing is the speed that the plane hit the runway. I mean, it was going far faster than any landing speed, which is about 140 knots for a 737. That was going far quicker. And it landed down the runway, which meant there wasn't much runway left to run out, so it's very perplexing. I've heard one speculation that perhaps they were trying to do a go around and they didn't drop the landing gear.
