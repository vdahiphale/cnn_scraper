The Department of Justice announcing that they're going to review the use of force policy, de-escalation policies of the Memphis Police Department. This is something that the community there has been asking for, something that the Tyre Nichols family has been asking for. They've been asking for the DOJ to commit it.It's different than what we're seeing being announced there by Merrick Garland in terms of a pattern and practice investigation. So, that could happen here too. So, that's what DOJ is doing right now in Memphis. They're reviewing the policy -- some of the policies. The other thing is significant. You know, we keep hearing about these specialized units. And you hear the Attorney General talk about the Louisville Police Department specialized unit and the problems that they had there and the community complaints about it, this Viper unit. Well, now the DOJ is saying that they're going to review the specialized units all across the country -- all across the country. They say that police chiefs across the country reached out to them looking for guidance and assistance. So, they're going to review that as well all across the country, which is, of course, significant as these police reviews get underway. As for Memphis, look, you know what you heard there from Merrick Garland. I was just in Memphis last week. We spoke with sources, we went and met with people, and some of the very similar complaints that Merrick Garland was just talking about there in Louisville is happening in Memphis. People have raised issues. Police officers have raised issues with the way the specialized unit there, this Scorpion unit was operating. So, we could see something very similar happened eventually in Memphis. But for now, what's happening in Memphis is he going to have this DOJ review, but also this video. A video that's going to come out new information that the city is expected to release in connection to the death of Tyre Nichols.",

She's the Chief Economist for the global financial services firm KPMG. It's good to see you again, Diane. So, Jerome Powell, he's back on the Hill.

The United States was once the leader in women's participation in the labor market among what we call prime-age women, 25 to 54. We're now the laggard. We not only are the laggard, we're not even back to the previous peak we were at in 1999.We've come back to February 2020 levels after the recession, this she- session, as you pointed out. But the bottom line is, we like all of other developed countries and are developing competitors in the G20, which is really the G19 because Russia is not in anymore, but that's ridiculous. Even our neighbors to the north in Canada have a 12 percent higher participation rate among prime-age women than we do in the United States. And the biggest penalty women face is having children. That is part of biology. Other parents face that penalty as well. It really gets to the issue of the childcare crisis and parental leave in this country. And we need all hands on deck. We can't afford to lead people not participating in the labor force when women are also the ones out attaining men now on education. 60 percent of college grads are now women. Even higher percentage now entering into colleges. We have to worry about men too. This is not a zero-sum game. And I think that is the wrong framing. But it is really hard to be standing here today and seeing where the United States sits relative to the rest of the world and how little ground we've made up given how hard I've worked to try to change the equation.",

Mitch McConnell for one said that he disagreed with how Fox News portrayed it. He said he aligned himself with the concerns raised by the U.S. Capitol police chief saying that it was offensive, saying he was cherry-picked, and said they did not portray the true violence that happened that day.Kevin McCarthy on the other hand -- other hand, defended it and said he did not regret the decision at all. I pressed him about the efforts by Carlson to whitewash this and whether or not he was OK with that. And he said that he's for transparency. That is in the view of McCarthy. He didn't explain why he chose Tucker Carlson, who was -- someone who has had a history of downplaying the deadly violence from January 6. But there are some members of the House Republican conference who did push back on Carlson and on McCarthy's decision here. That includes Congressman Dan Newhouse, who's one of ten House Republicans who voted to impeach Donald Trump in the aftermath of January 6. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP.
