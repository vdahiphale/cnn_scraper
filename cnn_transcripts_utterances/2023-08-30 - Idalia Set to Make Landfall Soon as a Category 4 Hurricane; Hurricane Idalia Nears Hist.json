      "sentences": "Welcome back. Well, we are following breaking news this morning, a very big story, a very big storm. Florida is bracing for Hurricane Idalia, which is rapidly intensifying as it nears landfall. Idalia is currently a Category 3 storm with winds of 125 mph, just shy of a Category 4 storm. The storm is currently 60 miles from the state's capital of Tallahassee, Florida and 90 miles west of Cedar Key, where they have measured sustained tropical storm force winds and gusts of 47 mph.Now Florida's West Coast is already being whipped by the outer bounds of this storm. Streets in Tampa are flooding, and in Pinellas County, the storm surge is already impacting roadways. This hour tornado watches are in effect for 7 million people across western Florida and flood watches are in effect for 21 million people across Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas. For more, let's turn now to the Public Information Officer for Wakulla County Sheriff's Office, Lieutenant Jeffrey Yarbrough. Lieutenant Yarbrough, thanks so much for your time, especially in this moment. And this is happening soon. Landfall is certainly going to happen soon. There's been a lot of preparation leading up to this moment. Where do the efforts stand right now? What still needs to be done before landfall occurs? LT. JEFFREY YARBROUGH, SPOKESMAN, WAKULLA COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE: I mean, in our county at least we're kind of in a wait and see. You know, I was speaking to one of my colleagues earlier and so that kind of I feel like it's going to be a -- it's a question of bad or worse for us, depending on what moves the storm makes now is going to depend greatly on what kind of effects we see in in our particular county.",

It's going to be the biggest, you know, cause of damage and potentially loss of life. So beyond that kind of general issue that we're dealing with, we're very much focused on the path of this storm and that might sound cliche, but right now, as it gets closer inland 15-20 miles to the east or to the west is going to have a huge impact on the amount of effects that we feel in in Wakulla County.",

If you didn't evacuate and you're in the affected area, please don't go out and try to assess damage yourself. We understand the curiosity and the interest in doing so, but emergency responders' first priority in these situations is to get roadways cleared begin to do -- to do damage assessment and then to help citizens who may be trapped. And it's made all the more difficult if other people are on the roadway clogging up those areas. It also hinders the ability of people like lineman to come in and begin restoring power.",

As we're starting to see, we have seen, the effects 120, 130 miles away from the direct path just showing the scale. Derek, what are you seeing right now?",

We know that a lot of people have left and they have boarded up as Hurricane Idalia makes its way to shore.Right now, we are in a little bit of a calm. Just a few minutes ago there was a big burst of wind. We are starting to see those bands as well. We are basically standing where a lot of the boats and the tourism happens here, although it's a small town, about 3,400 people, a lot of people come here for one thing, they come to see the spring, which is gorgeous, crystal water and the manatees. But right now you're hearing sort of that squeaking. Things are moving because the water table here is so high. And it is such a low, low place that even City Hall could be impacted if the storm surge hits at what is expected, which is between 7 and 9 feet. That would be well over my head if the storm surge hits this place the way they think it might. Now these storms tend -- do tend to wobble. They do tend to move a bit and so everyone of course is hoping that it doesn't hit here that we don't see those kinds of storm surge, but you can't take the chance. And so authorities have told everyone in this town to evacuate. They don't have to go far. They just have to get to higher ground. All Right, we're going to go now to Derek Van Dam, who is in an area where the flooding is already happening in Tampa about 80 miles south of me. Give us a sense of the scene where you are -- Derek.",

There is a reason why people live in the Tampa Bay area and in places like Crystal River because they want to be near the water and they and it's a beautiful place to live until it's not and that storm surge happens.We can hear those winds, Derek pushing that water and probably pushing you guys around as those bands come in. Thank you so much for your reporting there. We'll check back in with you in just a bit. I want to get to Allison Chinchar, who is our meteorologist, looking at all this. She's got some very cool ways to illustrate what we're going to see. And what is going to happen as this storm, this monster storm his shore -- Allison.",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's right. So I mean, the thing is we just saw what it looks like with Derek out live as that water starting to begin to rise. But the real question is, what does it look like as we start to see more of that water rise? Now normal sea level, again, you can see those waves kind of crashing in along the beach towards the homes by two feet. Again that water line starts to creep awfully close to the house. By 4 feet, now you're starting to get inundation inside of homes and even business as well.But we're not stopping at 4 feet with this storm. You're going to have some areas that pick up as much as 12 feet. So now you're talking the entire first story of a home or a business is now underwater from all of that water flowing in. And I know that's hard to conceptualize, to say, oh, but that probably won't happen. But the thing of it is, 12 feet is expected. When we take a look at the map showing exactly where all of this water is expected to go. Yes, there are areas where you're going to see 12, if not even more than 12 feet across these areas. Basically east of St. Marks all the way down through Cedar Key. We're forecasting 12 to 16 feet from the National Hurricane Center. But you saw on that 3D image even 4 feet is enough to start inundating homes and businesses. And you're going to have that over near Apalachicola, down towards St. Petersburg and Sarasota. So even some of these other areas that maybe say don't get as much as 12 feet, maybe they say get four or six, you're still going to have inundation of that storm surge inside of homes. So let's look at where the storm is now. Sustained winds have it ticked up to 125 mph. It's moving to the northeast, north, northeast at 17 mph. It is expected to intensify even more, getting up to a Category 4 right before landfall, crossing over into Georgia and then the Carolinas before going back out over open water. Again, we've talked about storm surge being the big concern, but also flooding from the water coming down from above you. So as we take a look at the forecast radar again landfall time still looks like it's between about 8:00 to 9:00 a.m., roughly this morning Eastern Time. Then the system continues to slide into Georgia. You're likely going to have power outages across Georgia, South Carolina, even North Carolina possible as this storm continues to make its way out towards the Atlantic as we go through the rest of the day today. You've already got some of those really heavy bands starting to impact not only the Panhandle, but also the peninsula of Florida. Further down to the south. We've already started to see several tornado warnings this morning. Still one active just to the east of Orlando, and it's because of those tornado warnings, we do have a tornado watch in effect for a few more hours. An additional one is likely to end up being put out for this morning because this area is going to continue to see tornadoes and also too, we could be seeing them eventually in states like Georgia as well as the Carolinas as we go through the next 24 hours.",

We've seen those happen in this area before, very, very stark. A lot of different things that can harm you, even though it is quite beautiful. Allison Chinchar, thank you so much. Derek Van Dam, thank you for showing what's happening there in Tampa and I want to send it back to the studio where Phil is -- Phil.",
