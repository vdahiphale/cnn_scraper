Now, testimony underway at this hour over Donald Trump's trial and those involved the hush money payments to the adult film star Stormy Daniels. Here's Trump, again, we should say he criticized the judge just before the proceedings today. You see him walking in there. Former \"National Enquirer\" publisher David Pecker is now back on the stand. Now he's testified about paying to kill bad stories about Donald Trump when he was running for president in 2016. Our senior crime and justice reporter Katelyn Polantz has more on this now from Washington. As you have been following every inch of this trial, we are back now with cross-examination of David Pecker. What are expecting Trump's defense attorneys to be able to do here? I know Emil Bove started yesterday by really trying to assess whether or not -- really two things, trying to assess whether or not this was standard operating procedure with other celebrities and politicians for the \"National Enquirer\" and also crucially how much direction he was taking from Donald Trump over this.",

They're trying to dilute or counter the things that David Pecker put into evidence that may be helpful to the prosecution proving their case. So when you're questioning a witness, you can try and impeach them so damage their credibility or you can take that evidence that they've already talked about, in this case, the catch and kill schemes that David Pecker testified as being part of his willingness and agreement to help Donald Trump's 2016 campaign. They're trying to counter that. The way they're doing it is diluting it with many other examples, talking to David Pecker about how often the \"National Enquirer\" was running negative stories about people in the political world who would be natural opponents to Donald Trump, like the Clintons, like Ben Carson, asking him and having him testify that, yes, there would be negative stories about those other people in the \"National Enquirer\" quite likely, even if there had not been conversations with Trump about stories like that being helpful to him. There was a conversation in August 2015 between Pecker, Donald Trump, and Michael Cohen about how they were helping the campaign. The other thing that they're able to do is talk about how this might not be that different from the \"National Inquirer's\" checkbook journalism. The standard practice of how they would buy stories, rights to stories, and then not publish them. Sometimes in coordination or an agreement with a celebrity handler that happened. So they're trying to place this in less of an unusual context. But the prosecutors have evidenced the jury has already heard that this was an unusual case in that Donald Trump was running for president and he was doing this. He was working with Michael Cohen because David Pecker understood it would be an embarrassment, not for him personally, but for his campaign. The all-important point there in this business falsification of records case -- Paula.",

And then the issue of whether the probative value, that is the value of that evidence was outweighed the prejudicial value, and here the court basically said you were piling on, it was way too much. The probative value of many of these women who took the stand far -- did not outweigh the prejudicial value. And as a result of which it interfered with Mr. Weinstein's right to confront witnesses against him and to be tried on the issues that were supposed to be before the jury. We see this a lot of times when the case may not be as good as it should be. And so therefore, you look for extraneous evidence to try to prove that there was motive, there was intent, there was no mistake by Mr. Weinstein and it got to be too much at some point. And the cost celeb that went around it made it even worse. So I think it is -- you're really judging the oppression of the court. Most courts don't want to overrule the broad discretion that a trial judge has. But in this particular case, that's what they did. This is exactly what is happening in this case. That is, they're bringing in Miss McDougal. I don't know them as McDougal does anything more than established what we call similar transaction testimony.

Unfortunately, the same thing is happening to innocent Palestinian people in Israel today. I demand that both of these issues be evaluated in this context, and that the brutal oppression of Palestinians stops immediately. In general, the West doesn't see the big picture here. They see it only from one side or the other. And I think we are more realistic.
