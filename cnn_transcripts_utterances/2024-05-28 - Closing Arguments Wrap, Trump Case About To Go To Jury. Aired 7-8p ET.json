      "sentences": "OUTFRONT nextBreaking news, the Trump trial in its fourth hour tonight on closing arguments, and the final word from the prosecution still going. How is the jury responding? Plus, guilty. That is what former Trump White House attorney and OUTFRONT regular Ty Cobb is predicting tonight. He's here with us to tell us why. And a family affair. Trump's adult children in the courtroom room today, except for Ivanka. Where was she? Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, the breaking news: the prosecution in Trump's criminal trial is about to resume its closing argument. They right now are in a very brief break and it is continuing. We are now going into the evening as they tried to get this done. The prosecutor, Joshua Steinglass, has been speaking for nearly four hours. This after the defense had gone for two-and-a-half hours. It's been a long day. Steinglass for the prosecution right now, laying out his case chronologically as he tries to dismantle team Trump's arguments. So far, basically, they've tried to take five weeks of testimony from 22 witnesses and put it on an actual timeline. So that means David Pecker, Hope Hicks, Stormy Daniels and a lot of time, well over an hour today, spent on Michael Cohen and the reason that Steinglass did that was that the defense in their closing statements spent much of the time going after Trump's former fixer. Steinglass telling jurors, quote: We didn't choose Michael Cohen to be our witness. We didn't pick him up at the witness store. The defendant chose Michael Cohen as his fixer because he was willing to lie and cheat on his behalf, adding: This case is not about Michael Cohen. Well, that, of course, is the big question whether the jury buys that or not. And according to people inside the courtroom, juries -- jurors are paying close attention to Steinglass. Their eyes watching his every move, and the jurors also intently watching Trump's attorney as he tried to pin the entire case on Cohen and his lies, saying if -- putting this on Cohen, and you can't convict. At one point, Blanche, Trump's lawyer, listed every person that the defense says Cohen has lied to and they listed his wife, his children, his co-workers, his banker, the Justice Department and, quote, every single reporter he talked to for about a year. And then they tried to really lay it on fix, saying Michael Cohen is the GLOAT, literally the greatest liar of all time. That's what they want the jury to take away from this tonight. And the major question is how these closing arguments will affect the jury. Will they sway the men and women, seven men, five women on Trump to convict or acquit? Paula Reid is OUTFRONT live outside the courthouse to begin our coverage. And, Paula, I was down there with today. I know you've been working, so much reporting here and you've got some news from your sources on the Trump team. What are they telling you?",

They may go back and have a quick verdict to convict.And so until you get a jury that is somewhat deadlocked and are having real problems and making a determination rendering a verdict. That's when the dynamite charge comes out. And just very briefly to be clear, the dynamite charge doesn't say to change your conscientious opinion. In fact, in the language itself, it says we're not asking you to do that. What were telling you is that there's no jury who would be better than you, who would evaluate this case differently from you, who would take it more seriously than you. So go back there, do the best you can to not stay wedded to your view if there's an opinion that perhaps can move you out of it. And I think that is appropriate.

But he did too much of what he said this and this is what we think. And I think you have to get into your story immediately. And he did get into the story. He talked to about what happened in August of 2015 and the Trump Tower, how the conspiracy started. Then he got into the minutia, Erin, he started talking about on this day, this call happened in on the 24th at 8:04, and he just went too detail. The jury was following. They were all alert.

It's long.Mark, our reporter in the room noted that there was a moment where a juror smiled softly and raised her eyebrows when Joshua Steinglass, the prosecutor in this four plus hour closing arguments said, hope you're getting all of this. Now, Mark, I'm not trying to read anything into her reaction. You know, people are standing very close to each other in these settings and having some sort the connection. It does raise the question though bigger picture, have the jurors already made up their minds and obviously you've done so many cases from Zimmerman and others. Is this -- how much weight do these arguments have? O'MARA: So I think the arguments have a lot of weight with the lawyers who are stating them because that's why we went to law school, right? But the harsh reality is human psychology of jurors as we bring them into your courtroom, sit around for a couple of hours and give him a bunch of information, it's always my position that most jurors individually have made up their mind well, before closing argument. Unfortunately, they may or may up their mind before the trial is finished. The evidence presentation, but that's just the harsh reality of who we are because we are so used to making up our decisions in a moment. It is not human, humanly possible for us to wait until the very end. But we tell them to. So in this case, the smile by that when jurors probably seen that going guy get ready, move on. I will tell you, I think four hours for closing argument by the state is way too long. Keep it simple. Here's the facts. We proved it. Come up with a dozen maybe facts that are undeniable and then show the law and say, go back and convict. And tell them that we know you listen and move forward this four hours. I think really almost causes if you think about it very quickly prosecution is hurt by complication. The defense is helped by complication. You make it more complicated. There's reasonable doubt. You go into here. It's very simply. And then the jury will listen to you in the building and so many complications that the jury thought about that and worried about that.",

You want to make your point and sit down, tell them what you're going to do. Do it, tell them you did it. This is what Trump did. This was his intention of doing it. This was his motivation with respect to doing and this is how he did it. That's it. And so, I just think there comes a point where too much is way too much. And I think the reality is when you lose people, you do yourself a disservice and that's not the point of closing argument. The point of it is to sum it up, bring it home, and let them know this is why I win. You lose the jury, you lose the case.",

      "sentences": "I want to bring in Paula Reid here because as she's again outside the courthouse with your sources on both teams of attorneys here, Paula.But I'm curious as to what you understand the strategy of Trump's team was. I mean, that was a two-and-a-half-hour of closing argument, right? Did they -- did they think that was going to be short relative to what the prosecution is going to is doing right now, do you think they're surprised by the length of this prosecution close? REID: Yeah. I think they are. Earlier today, as we reported, they expected to go about two-and-a-half, three hours because they believe that's about as long as any juror wants to hear from a lawyer and closing. Todd Blanche stuck pretty close to that. He was around three hours. But they had another goal and that was to prevent Joshua Steinglass from going into tomorrow. So they were trying to keep it short enough that Steinglass did try to draw this out too long. It would annoy the jury. Now, with some help from the jurors who are willing to stay late tonight. And the judge, it appears that this will likely wrap today, but they have a lot of reasons for wanting to keep it tight. What was so interesting to me though, about the defense, this morning is it had been laid out for me that they, of course, are going to try to distance the defendant from the allegedly falsified documents. Of course, you're going to do that. That's right the heart of the case. Of course, they're going to attack Michael Cohen's credibility. But what was surprising is everything that happened in-between those two arguments, Todd Blanche spending a lot of time, getting a lot of oxygen to things that really just didn't matter. And I think that that's one of the things that surprising that he brought up Karen McDougal, that he sort of went into the weeds and a lot of issues. These are really won't make or break the case. And the general consensus seems to be, he could have done a great job in just an hour, hit a few key themes and instead he was, as he has been throughout this trial, effective at times, but also rambling and sorst of taking a long winding road to get to that key point.",

The jury's given a week off, not -- and able to go about in the regular world, not sequestered. And they don't get transcripts of what happened in the prior month.So is there somehow a psychological pressure on the lawyers? Well, they checked out for a week and they're not going to remember anything I said in the past month, so I'm going to try to like diarrhea them out, the whole thing today?",

But yes, they do forget, we are so used to this because we look at we report on it, we take our notes, juries don't. This stuff has become sort of intellectual gobbledygook with them by the time the jury or the witness got off the stand.

They were in that room and they tried to influence the election and he went over the three laws that could possibly be the underlying law that he breached, you know, the tax fraud, the campaign finance, and the election law.

So if you're not sort of sensitizing that juror to the fact that this is the highest standard we know beyond virtual certainty is beyond a reasonable doubt.

But if he were going to fly off to another state Wisconsin, Arizona, he would have to get explicit permission from the probation agency.",

I mean, he produced rehash the entire case over the past five hours, but or and he concluded is closing by saying, quote, the name of the game was concealment and all roads lead inescapably to the man that benefited the most, the defendant, former President Donald J. Trump. He also said that Trump has a right to a fair trial and the prosecution has the burden to prove this case beyond a reasonable doubt.
