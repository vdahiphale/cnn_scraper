Welcome to CNN's ongoing coverage of Israel at war. I'm Julia Chatterley, in New York and good evening. Tonight, \"This is a time for war,\" Israel's Prime Minister rejecting calls for a ceasefire as IDF troops appeared to push deeper into Gaza. Israel's military says it's killed four senior Hamas operatives and dozens of Hamas fighters. This video captures the moment an Israeli tank apparently opened fire on a passenger vehicle. The IDF says Hamas uses civilian equipment for military purposes. The IDF also says it rescued an Israeli soldier from Hamas captivity during its ground operations. Ori Megidish was captured during the October 7th terror attacks. You can see her here with her family. She is said to be in good health. Meanwhile, Hamas has also released a video showing three women identified as Israeli hostages. We won't be showing you that footage, but Prime Minister Netanyahu condemned its release as, quote, \"psychological warfare.\" During a primetime speech, he also dismissed international calls for a ceasefire, saying Israel will never give into barbarism.

But unfortunately, not all of our colleagues have been able to protect their children. We have one colleague, Amal (ph), whose son was killed in an airstrike in Rafah just two weeks ago. They have fled from the north to the south, seeking shelter. Amal's son was only seven years old when he was killed. He's an innocent child. This is just one story of the over 3,000 children who have been killed over the last three weeks -- a little over three weeks. And these children have absolutely nothing to do with what is happening around them. They have no say in the matter. And the reality is that their parents as -- try as they might just cannot protect them. They can't protect them physically, and they can't protect them from the trauma that they're experiencing from hearing airstrikes every day and every night. In terms of what our staff has been able to do on the ground in Gaza over - - since October 7th, it's been extremely limited because they have had to focus on taking care of themselves, taking care of their families, and making sure that their basic needs are accounted for. It's very, very difficult for them to find basic necessities. Even for us to be counting -- doing a daily headcount with our staff can take hours because of the connectivity issues. We have, however, been able to provide cash grants to some of Gaza's most vulnerable families, which we're able to do remotely, and then the families are able to use their phones in order to get that cash and buy goods while they're still available on the local market. We know that the window of opportunity for cash assistance to be effective is rapidly shrinking as -- not only are we struggling to get aid in, but absolutely nothing that is going to markets, nothing that's being sold has made its way into Gaza since before October 7th.",

And so, by all means, I mean, sanctions on charities can give rise to significant restrictions in fund flows to Hamas and other organizations. But it really depends on, of course, the size of the charity and its effectiveness. Because at the end of the day what the US is trying to avoid is to over-sanction and to harm the innocent parties in Gaza and elsewhere, while trying to really restrict the funds to Hamas.

For Russia where there is an oil price caprestricting the price at which Russian oil can be sold or there could be potential sanctions, there's a multilateral network involved involving the EU, the broader G7, Japan, UK, Canada, Australia. The problem with Iran is that that is much more often -- much more regularly been a unilateral approach the US has taken. In other words, there's not the same sort of network of multilateral support that the US necessarily has dealing with Iran that they had with Russia. That being said, it's certainly a possibility. And I think that perhaps in light of some of the atrocities that have been recorded and that will probably continue to be recorded from Hamas, that could be a buy-in. But as we even saw just the last Friday with respect to the diversion and diversity within the EU itself regarding whether or not they're even going to vote for general assembly resolution calling for a ceasefire, that diversity suggests the EU itself doesn't have a common position with respect to Hamas and perhaps even Iran. So the likelihood of getting everyone on board, I think, is much more limited. And so I think that's going to be the challenge of being creative in this context.",

People are afraid of losing access to US banks to, again, not necessarily stymie Hamas directly, but put a line in the sand around Hamas. It's in anybody who touches Hamas could potentially face the same fate. And so that's going to be the strategies and network effect that try to sort of get folks to be nervous enough about engaging with Hamas that they don't even potentially do so.
