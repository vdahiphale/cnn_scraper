The NYPD now says Luigi Mangione's fingerprints match those found on evidence near the crime scene and that the gun found on Mangione matches shell casings recovered from the shooting.Also breaking, the FBI director announces his resignation, Chris Wray stepping down at the end of President Biden's term as President-elect Donald Trump looks to replace him with a fierce loyalist, Kash Patel. And this hour, we'll share a CNN exclusive. For the first time, one of the alleged victims of Sean Diddy Combs is detailing his claims that the music mogul drugged and sexually assaulted him. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. First up tonight, significant new developments in the murder investigation of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Police now say fingerprints and shell casings from the scene of the shooting all point toward the suspect, Luigi Mangione. Let's bring in CNN's Shimon Prokupecz. He's in New York with details. Shimon, we're also learning more about Mangione, what, losing contact with his family and his friends in the months leading up to the shooting.",

And what we're learning from law enforcement sources, Wolf, is that on November 18th, when his mother reported him missing to the San Francisco police, she told him that she had been calling him repeatedly and that he wasn't answering his phone, he wasn't picking up, but also significantly was that his voicemail was full and that she was not able to leave a message, not able to make contact with him since July 1st, Wolf. That is what she told police, that for months, she had been trying to reach her son and she was unable to reach him, believing that he was working at a place in San Francisco. She called the San Francisco Police asking for help. Now, what she also told police was that there was no reason for her to feel that he was going to do any kind of harm to himself or to anyone else. And it's unclear, Wolf, at this point, what other actions the police took. But this is significant because it shows that for months and months, he had sort of gone quiet. No one was able to get a hold of him and his family was so concerned they finally went to the police trying to get help. What happened after that is simply unclear at this point, Wolf.",

It talks about how -- the reason he wanted to do, allegedly, the shooting was because he wanted it to be targeted. He wanted it to be precise, and he didn't want to risk innocent people. There was talk about potentially a bomb, we're told by sources. But he was concerned, allegedly, that he would harm innocents. The other thing, Wolf, in this spiral notebook, we're told, is that he said that he wanted to, quote, whack the CEO at the annual parasitic bean counter convention. And police believe that that was the convention that he was at, the conference that he was at, Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, here in New York City at the Hilton Hotel.

So, really, what this does is it paves the way for the FBI to have an entire leadership change when Donald Trump takes office in early -- in January, obviously.And so we anticipate, and you can see there, Patel making the rounds in Congress. He's been talking to senators ahead of his what we expect to be a confirmation process. And right now, you can see that a lot of them are falling into line.

I think that there is a very, very important principle to be maintained here, and that is the principle of the FBI's independence. And I think that under the circumstances, to me, my opinion, the best way to do that would have been to stay in his position until the new president came in and decided to take whatever steps he wanted to take. In other words, let the president-elect be the anomaly. Let the president-elect be the person who goes on record having undermined this principle of the independence of the FBI.This is something that we have treasured for the last 50 years. It is the very core of the post-Watergate FBI reforms. It's essential to the FBI's culture and its understanding of itself and its role in this country the fact that it remains independent from the day to day political will of the presidency.

That is the only currency of a Trump administration. It is personal loyalty to President Trump.The position of FBI director, however, and every other major federal position, you don't swear an oath loyalty to the president.

You said this outrage towards health insurance companies should be a major wakeup call for them. But if their incentives are to grow their profits sometimes at the expense of people's health, do you trust them to meaningfully reform? KEVIN O'LEARY, SHARK TANK INVESTOR: I think they have to. I mean, this is quite a backlash. This is the power of social media. Corporations saw this first in the Anheuser Busch Bud Light case, where they lost $6 billion worth of market cap in six weeks. They'd never seen that before. This is occurring because people are frustrated with the appeal process in all health insurance. And so what the executives have to do at UnitedHealth and frankly the whole industry is appeal to reality and say, look, it's on us now. We understand you're unhappy. I mean, this murder, this assassination is horrific. There's nothing good to be said about that, and there's lots of problems with it. But at the end of the day, what it's leading to is the frustration of the users of healthcare. And everybody's affected by healthcare. They should be coming out now saying, look, we get it, we have families, too, we're people, we have children, we care about what you think about, and we're going to automate this process and make it better or do whatever they have to do. But when you appeal a case, it's not a delay situation. And if you have a valid claim, you get paid out. That's what insurance is supposed to do.

At this point, social media is now the jury, and it doesn't like what it sees.

You got to read the room and realize right now that the public is turning against you. They are your customers and they don't like it.

And you got to hear that. So, if you're an executive saying, get me more security guards, wrong answer. That's just wrong.
