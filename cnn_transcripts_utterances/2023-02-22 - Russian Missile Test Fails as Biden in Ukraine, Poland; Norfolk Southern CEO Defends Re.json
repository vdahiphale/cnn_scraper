They say it was a Satan II intercontinental ballistic missile like the one you see right there on your screen. Putin was previously -- has previously bragged that it's unstoppable and can strike anywhere in the world. That is, if it can get off the ground.

But one of the officials tells CNN the test likely failed, and here's why. The test was scheduled to take place just before Russian President Vladimir Putin's state of the nation address on Tuesday. And had it been a success, Putin almost certainly would have mentioned it there. And yet, in the hour, 45-minute speech, there was absolutely no mention of that Sarmat missile. Its Western nickname, as you point out, the Satan 2 missile. U.S. officials do tell CNN that there was proper notification given by Russia to the United States ahead of the missile launch. But the timing here can't be ignored. Right before that speech, where Putin was looking for a victory. He didn't get it on the battlefield. Perhaps he was looking for it from a successful missile test. And he has bragged about it before.
