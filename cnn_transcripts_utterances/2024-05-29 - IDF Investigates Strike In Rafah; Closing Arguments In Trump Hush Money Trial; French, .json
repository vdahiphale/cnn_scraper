(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANNA COREN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Last week's deadly landslide in the highlands of Papua New Guinea that is feared to have buried alive more than 2,000 people is still active and growing according to government officials, triggering mass evacuations in the area. The PNG defense forces have told more than 7,000 people to leave as the threat to life continues. It comes as villagers and emergency crews tried to dig through the debris, which officials say stretches over nine hectares, more than nine football fields, and is six to eight meters deep in earth, rubble and boulders some as large as shipping containers. Heavy earth-moving equipment has reached the area but is unable to be used on the site due to the instability. The densely-populated village that was hit on Friday at 3:00 a.m. while people slept was located on a highway, the lifeline of the region, which locals say had more than 100 homes, shops, the school, church, gas station and a lodge. All of it is now buried. The people who lived there were mainly subsistence farmers. A handful of bodies have been recovered so far and funeral processions have begun.
