Russia responds with missiles. We'll have more on that in just a moment. Then brutal atrocities being committed in Sudan as the conflict there rages on. We have an exclusive CNN investigation. Plus, racial discrimination and routinely using excessive force. Just some of the findings in a blistering report about the Minneapolis Police Department in the wake of George Floyd's murder. But first, tonight, explosions in Kyiv as a peace mission gets underway in the Ukrainian capital. A delegation of several African leaders, including South Africa's president is trying to mediate a peace deal between Kyiv and Moscow. They just met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and will head to Russia for talks with Vladimir Putin. That's expected to happen on Saturday. African countries have not been spared, of course, by the war in Ukraine. Food and energy prices have shot up because of the conflict making it even harder for struggling economies. Well, Ukraine's foreign minister said these missile attacks are a message to Africa that Russia does not want peace. Sam Kiley is in Ukrainian capital with more in Kyiv. And Sam, I was just looking in the last 45 minutes or so, we heard from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who said that any peace talks with Russia are possible only after the complete withdrawal of Russian troops from the occupied territories. Do we know what this peace mission of these African leaders are proposing here to the Ukrainian and the Russian president?",

      "sentences": "Well, broadly speaking, they're asking for a cessation of hostilities, a withdrawal of Russiantroops and then peace talks. So they're not that far away from the position of Zelenskyy and, indeed, of Zelenskyy's western allies. So, I think the slight difference might be that figures such as Cyril Ramaphosa; the president of South Africa, has a pretty good relationship with Vladimir Putin, personally. And the two countries are reasonably close. They had Naval drills together recently much to the irritation of Ukraine and her western allies. And the hope was that people like Ramaphosa might go from here on to the Kremlin and start to try and find some means by which this conflict could be de- escalated. But the fact of the matter is -- there are two facts of the matter. The first is that diplomacy was somewhat undermined by a missile attack against this capital city whilst this very high-level delegation was in town. In the past, there's been -- the Russians have tried to avoid doing just that. And secondly, the Ukrainian position is absolute. They are absolutely consistent with this, Isa, and have been since day one of this war, that they will not tolerate any kind of a diplomatic initiative or peace talks, until every single Russian soldier is out of the country. And of course, they are feeling a bit more robust about that position now because they are getting more help from their western allies. From the Ukrainian perspective, everything is coming too little and much too late. But they are stronger than they were a year ago. They are prosecuting a counteroffensive. It is going to be bloody. It's not going all their way, but they believe that they are making significant gains and they may be able to build momentum. And they hope, ultimately, that the Russians will collapse, the Russian forces will collapse. That would have dangerous implications for Vladimir Putin. He, meanwhile, of course, today, has been saber-rattling or rattling his nuclear weapons once again, saying that if the territorial integrity, sovereignty or future of the Russian federation was threatened, then, he might use nuclear weapons. A very sinister development just to see he's talking about moving tactical nuclear weapons onto Belarusian territory, where they were within striking distance of not only Ukrainian targets, but of course, much closer to other targets too, not least, the Baltic states.",

Although, I have to say that there's not a lot of optimism, given the Ukrainian and the Russian position at the moment, that this African initiative is going to, you know, have much chance of success. And you know, on the issue of the deployment of tactical nuclear weapons to the neighboring country of Belarus, obviously, it's concerning. Obviously, it raises the tensions in this region. But it's also been seen, I think, you know, I mean, the United States for instance has said it's got no reason to suspect that Russia is moving closer to using nuclear weapons. And so, it's not changing its nuclear stance. But I suspect it's as much about reminding the western military alliance, reminding NATO of the seriousness and the high stakes of confronting Russia. Remember, there's a NATO Summit planned next month in July in Lithuania, which is right next door to, obviously, Russia, and Belarus as well. And it's part of the messaging that the Kremlin is putting out there that, you know, you could -- you can have these NATO Summit. You can -- you can support Ukraine as much as you like, but you're still going to have to contend with the very real military threat that Russia can potentially pose.",

The conflict is now in its third month with more than 2,000 people believed to have been killed. Doctors without borders describes the capital, Khartoum, as a violent situation that almost defies comparison. Fighting broke out in April between Sudan's army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces. The U.S. State Department is warning that attacks on civilians must end. Well, a Sudanese rights organization say atrocities are being committed in Darfur, and CNN has uncovered evidence that the Russian mercenary group, Wagner, is complicit, continuing to support the RSF; that's Sudan's Rapid Support Forces paramilitary. Throughout the months of fighting, despite calls by U.S. and others for support to cease. In an exclusive CNN investigation, we uncovered the Russian supply lines prolonging the conflict between the RSF and Sudan's armed forces that has displaced around 2 million people since mid April and push the country further into a humanitarian crisis. The RSF denies links to Wagner and any involvement in mass rape. Well, as part of this investigation, CNN verified uncorroborated incidents of rape perpetrated by the RSF, including one which was captured on video. Now, we feel it is important in the face of the RSF's repeated denials to broadcast part of that video. But we must warn you it is graphic and it is disturbing. CNN's chief international investigative correspondent Nima Elbagir brings us this story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) (ARTILLERY FIRE) NIMA ELBAGIR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): The fighting on the streets of Sudan is relentless. Ceasefire after ceasefire has not helped. Forces previously accused of genocide returning to a well-worn playbook -- terrorize, expel, and ethnically cleanse. The paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, RSF, are currently engaged in a fight for dominance with Sudan's army. But years before that rivalry spilled blood in Sudan's streets, they were implicated in atrocities in Darfur. Now, once again, Darfur to the west of the country is stoked by the specter of genocide. The damage wrought by these forces is so extensive you can see it from satellite images. This is Al Junaynah, west Darfur. Hundreds killed, whole districts razed to the ground. And it's not only Al Junaynah that is burning. This is Ad Douiem(ph), and this, Kutum.",

But it goes on to show a girl, believed to be just 15 years old, being raped. You see here a man in light-colored fatigues marching those worn by the RSF, we've paused the video just before the camera pans to show another soldier wearing the same uniform forcing himself onto the prone girl. CNN verified and geo-located the area where this happened. We're not revealing the exact location in Khartoum, to protect our sources and the young girl. This is not an isolated incident.

And it's one of those things that you may not notice on your computer, but just about every corporation has it because it's useful to send files from A to B.

Because, you know, there were -- the hackers were kind of tinkering with this software early on to try to see where they might be able to get in. And so the scale is, you know, we're talking several hundred, potentially here in the U.S., impacted in terms of data exposed. Now, that doesn't mean that there's any disruptions or anything like that, because the hackers are basically trying to get in, steal data, and then extort their victims.

And so, Patrick, while Cuba may be denying this, what we have been seeing for some time, it is really China's growing power and influence in the region. You have covered Latin America for some time. Is this raising eyebrows?",

And, you know, as you said, the U.S. is maintaining the China has a base here in Cuba. And we got a -- to that alleged site. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) OPPMANN (voice-over): Are these antennas on a Cuban military base evidence of a secret Chinese spying facility on an island just 90 miles from the coast of the United States? Or are U.S. allegations of a spy base here, as Cuban and Chinese officials, say simply Cold War era saber-rattling? The White House initially dismissed reports of increased Chinese spying capabilities from Cuba as not accurate, but then made a partial about face saying those upgrades occurred but before President Biden took office. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: in fact, based on the information we have, the PRC conducted an upgrade of its intelligence collection facilities in Cuba in 2019. (END VIDEO CLIP) OPPMANN (voice-over): Cuban officials deny there's any kind of foreign base spying on the U.S. from their island. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

A sold-out stadium welcomingLionel Messi and his World Champs, Argentina, a ticket to the match against Australia costing hundreds of dollars. The city's Workers' Stadium awash of blue and white. But one young fan seemed to take Messi-mania too far, breaking onto the pitch, hugging Messi and high-fiving goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez, evading security for around a minute, an unruly moment in an otherwise tightly organized event, as most mass gatherings in China are. Later, the young fan apologized. \"Messi, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry to meet you this way,\" he says. \"I really wanted your autograph but they were chasing me, so I didn't ask for it.\" But in the country unused to acts of disobedience, many cheer the young man. The crowd lauding behavior that is across the world met with fines, stadium bans, even arrest. State media did not broadcast the pitch invasion. That is standard practice around the world. Later, one news website ran a comparison of different social media reactions, some in support of the young fan, some against. But in a country whose national soccer team has long struggled, even rigid state media commentators acknowledge his insuppressible passion for the sport and its global superstar.
