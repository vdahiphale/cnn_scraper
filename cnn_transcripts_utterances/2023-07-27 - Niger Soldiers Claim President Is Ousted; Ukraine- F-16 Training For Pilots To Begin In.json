A group of officers appeared on national television Wednesday night, saying President Mohamed Bazoum was ousted. This his election two years ago was an historic first for Niger.And concerns are growing that his removal could be a massive blow to the fight against Islamic insurgency in the region. Larry Madowo is monitoring those developments. He joins us now live from Nairobi.

It's literally just a few hours since these men in military fatigues showed up on national television and declared that they had taken over power from President Mohamed Bazoum, dissolve the constitution and closed all land and air borders. Their reason is because the breakdown in security as well as social economic conditions there. And President Mohamed Bazoum was the first time that there was a peaceful democratic transfer of power in Niger since independence from France in 1960. This country has been a key part of the West's Security Strategy in the Sahel. It's surrounded by countries like Mali and Burkina Faso where the jihadist threat is at its peak. And this was a rare, peaceful, generally peaceful part of the neighborhood, even though it also does face the jihadist campaign with the groups affiliated to both ISIS and al Qaeda.But now with this, it's a huge setback for democracy in the country. We've been seeing tweets a short while ago from the office of the presidency in Niger. One of those tweets said that the hard-won achievements will be safeguarded. All Nigerians who love democracy and freedom will see to it. This presidency account also did repost a tweet from the country's foreign minister Hassoumi Massoudou has said a coup attempt has been underway. And history also go -- goes on to say that this act of (INAUDIBLE) officers aims as elsewhere to call into question our hard-won freedoms, our democracy and the progress made.

It is slow but it is significant. They've spent weeks combing through these defenses, demining areas, crawling in the words of the Ukrainian foreign minister, you know, several 100 meters a day in some cases.And now, I don't know if we can bring up the map to show the front lines but we're seeing advances in a number of areas too. In the southern region, in Zaporizhzhia, south of Orikhiv, both Russian or Russian mainly, Russian installed, officials and bloggers saying that Ukraine has started a major offensive just south of that town in Orikhiv towards Melitopol. They're trying to break through the Russian land corridor connecting Crimea and the Donbas. Also, to the -- to the east of Velyka Novosylka, that's seen as sort of an access route to Berdyansk because they're pushing down along a river there and they are reportedly making a serious push around a town called Staromaryevka. A small village really. I think we can show you some video there which we have geolocated that shows what purports to be Russian forces leaving their positions as Ukrainians move in. I think you really get a sense looking at this of the kind of terrain they're dealing with. These are, as I say, very small villages, quiet rural areas and heavily defended, heavily fortified of course by Russia. Also on the eastern front in Bakhmut, they are pushing a number of settlements to the south of the city to in particular as they tried to encircle it. So we're seeing a Ukrainian push in a couple of areas. But alongside that, of course, Rosemary, they continue to have to deal with these missile barrages this morning. The regional military administration in Odesa saying one person was killed in those missile strike. They also dealt with an afternoon barrage yesterday involving a number of different kinds of missiles. The Air Force saying it shut down about 40 of them. So the Ukrainians having their air defenses tested even as they make these pushes along the front lines.",

So truthfully, before the offensive started a few weeks ago, I was concerned about how tough it would be for the Ukrainians to continue to maneuver against some of these defensive positions enhanced by the Russians. So yes, it is going much slower.It's the first time the Ukrainians have attempted something on this large of a scale and offensive operation with new equipment that they've just recently received. So I kind of thought it might go a little bit slower than anticipated, but it is going along the routes that they're looking to achieve and with a geared toward the major objectives that have always been a part of the campaign.",

But they can't -- they can't actually describe that in the press or they'd be condemned by their leader for going against the war.So, I think many of these drones that we're seeing hit within the Russian territory at fuel locations that ammo caches, in terms of government buildings, I think it's an attempt by Ukraine to use all of the resources at their disposal to attack Russia and help them not feel safe anywhere. What it also does, Rosemary, and this is critical. It draws some of the forces that are on the frontlines away from the frontlines back into Mother Russia. So, when you have to defend not only against a potential Ukrainian assault, but also bring air defense equipment, as an example, back to some major buildings, like we saw in and around the ring in Moscow, then you know that you're affecting the ability for Russian to defend inside of Ukraine, and that's very important.",

I mean, you know, if you think about why do you raise rates, it's because the economy is growing too strongly. I mean, we still have a very, very tight labor market. It's really quite unexpected, I would say, at this point in a recovery cycle, that we should be at the place that we're at. In some ways, I think that the U.S. continues to benefit from the fact that a lot of other parts of the world are in worse shape, you know, you've got really runaway inflation in the U.K., you've got a major slowdown in China.
