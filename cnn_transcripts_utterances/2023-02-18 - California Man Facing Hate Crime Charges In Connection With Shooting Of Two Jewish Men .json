I'm Paula Reid in for Fredricka Whitfield.We begin this hour with yet another hate crime targeting the Jewish community as our nation faces an alarming rise in antisemitic attacks. Today a California man is facing up to life in prison after he allegedly targeted and shot two Jewish men in separate incidents earlier this week. According to prosecutors, the first shooting happened Wednesday morning as the victim walked to his car after leaving religious services at a synagogue in Los Angeles. The second incident happened the next morning just three blocks away. Video shows the victim just moments after he was shot in the arm. Police say both men were taken to local hospitals in stable condition. Let's bring in CNN's Camila Bernal live in Los Angeles. Camila, what are authorities saying about the shootings?",

You mentioned two different shootings, but very, very similar, both happening as these men were walking back from their synagogue on Wednesday and then on Thursday. After the shootings, of course, police started searching for the person responsible.A 28-year-old man was arrested about an hour away from this neighborhood, and then police started looking into his background and also saying that there's history of antisemitism and that type of behavior. He was messaging and texting his classmates with hateful messages. We also know that he told authorities that he was looking at this area because there were kosher markets here. He also told police that he targeted his victims because of what he described as head gear. So, again, just things that were easily identifiable in terms of his victims. The U.S. attorney looking into this case vowing justice. Here he is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MARTIN ESTRADA, U.S. ATTORNEY, CENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA: This type of criminal conduct is completely unacceptable. Hate crimes have no place in our community.

The school is expected to honor the victims during the opening of the men's and women's basketball games. Three students died and five others were injured after a gunman opened fire on the campus earlier this week. It's still unclear why the gunman, a 43-year-old man with no known ties to MSU, targeted the university. And a Louisiana police officer is charged with a negligent homicide in connection to the shooting death of an unarmed black man. According to authorities, 43-year-old Alonzo Bagley was shot after Shreveport police responded to a domestic disturbance call at an apartment complex earlier this month. His funeral was held earlier this afternoon. This week, Shreveport officer Alexander Tyler was arrested as investigators released body camera footage of the incident.

And what they are saying is they are seeing Beijing appearing to want to creep up to the line of providing lethal military aid to Russia in such a way that it can do it without getting caught.Now, the officials are not being specific on the precise type of intelligence here, but it is being relayed to the nations. And I spoke to the president of the European Commission, Ursula Von Der Leyen, a very significant political figure in Europe today, and I asked her about what Kamala Harris was saying, the vice president was saying, about United States seeing an increased support coming from China to Russia. And she said, look, we're aware of this, but this is something that we need to monitor. We need to look for evidence, she said, if this is escalating to a military level. So it is clear that this message from the United States is being received here in Munich, but it does appear that some allies are saying, OK, we need to see what this evidence is. So it will, of course, cause concern here, because there is a real concern in Europe that if China does support Russia, this could really influence the war in Ukraine. If it does edge toward that military support and provide, perhaps, more components for more missiles, perhaps missiles themselves, perhaps just ammunition. China has a massive production capability. And this is a time when Russia is running out of military hardware and ammunition included. So this warning is being taken very seriously, and allies and partners here are looking to see what additional evidence there is and precisely what China does.",

Hundreds of students and parents crammed into that meeting in Bayville denouncing bullying and sharing their own stories of being hurt. It was the first board meeting since 14-year- old Adriana Kuch took her own life after being attacked by four students. Current and former students told the board of school district officials that they did nothing about reports of being bullied. Amid this latest heartbreak, there's now a renewed push by U.S. lawmakers to protect children against cyberbullying. At a Senate Judiciary hearing this week, lawmakers from both sides of the aisle lashed out at big tech companies and called for federal legislation to regulate social media. The push comes as a new CDC report shows teenagers, especially girls, are experiencing more violence, suicidal thoughts, and mental health challenges. Joining me is Jody Baumstein. She is a licensed therapist with Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. Jody, the stories that we're hearing, the statistics on violence, depression, suicide among teens now being revealed, it's a really scary time to be a parent. So what can we as parents do? JODY BAUMSTEIN, LICENSED THERAPIST, CHILDREN'S HEALTHCARE FOR ATLANTA: Pay attention to the warning signs. We want to believe that depression looks a certain way, but we've seen it time and time again. You could be at the height of your career, an athlete, a celebrity, and depression doesn't discriminate. So we really want to pay attention to major changes in mood and behavior. Listen, we all have ups and downs, but this is about excessive sadness, excessive hopelessness, extreme fatigue. They have such low energy they can't get out of bed. The other thing we're talking about is when all of a sudden, they're not engaging in activities they used to enjoy. This is something that was pretty big in the report, that so many high school students were talking about the fact that they couldn't engage in regular activities because of this sadness. And we also want to make note of the fact that some kids are not going to actively say that they're suicidal. They might engage in reckless behavior. They might talk about not having hope for the future, and we need to take that seriously every single time.",
