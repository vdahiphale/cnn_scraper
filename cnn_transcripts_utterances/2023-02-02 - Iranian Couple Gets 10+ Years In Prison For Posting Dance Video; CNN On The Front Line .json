They were denied access to a lawyer, according to human rights groups, given very little in the way of due process or a fair trial, and eventually brought in front of this very notorious judge -- Judge Abolqasem Salavati.And I say his name because he is someone who has been sanctioned directly by the United States. He's been called the judge of death by rights groups because he's known for handing down these very lengthy prison sentences or even the death penalty in cases of protest. But yet again you're looking at this beautiful young couple now spending 10 years potentially in jail all because they danced in the streets of Tehran.",

The Bank of England also expected to raise rates for the 10th time in a row. On Wall Street, stock index futures right now narrowly mixed here after a big rally on the Fed's decision to slow the pace of interest rate hikes. The Nasdaq closed two percent higher. The Dow reversed a 500-point drop earlier in the day. The Fed approved a 25-basis point hike -- a sign medicine is starting to cool inflation may finally be working. A big tech earnings day is upon us, too. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, and Starbucks set to report later today. On inflation watch, gas prices holding steady overnight at $3.50 a gallon. All right, Facebook parent company Meta -- the stock is a big mover overnight. Shares rocketing nearly 20 percent higher in after-hours trading.

He is known for talking about wanting to make big investments. Talking about the future of the company and this future version of the internet called the Metaverse. But last night he didn't talk very much about all of that. Instead, what he talked about is the fact that the company wants to focus on efficiency this year.

But specifically, they're really looking at the labor market because they want to see what's happening with wage pressures. So they'll be watching things like the jobs report, of course, tomorrow. They'll be looking at the payroll numbers. But particularly, we're going to be watching average hourly earnings because that's going to give us a clear indication of whether or not wage pressures are coming down even as the labor market stays very tight. And the importance of that bit is that if they are able to bring down wage pressures fairly well while the labor market stays strong, that means that they can potentially achieve this soft landing that they've been aiming for.

And if they can do that then you don't necessarily need to see as many job losses as you typically would after this aggressive hiking cycle. ROMANS:  It's so interesting. We've seen the Fed aggressively raising official interest rates. We've seen bank savings rates only go up a little bit.
