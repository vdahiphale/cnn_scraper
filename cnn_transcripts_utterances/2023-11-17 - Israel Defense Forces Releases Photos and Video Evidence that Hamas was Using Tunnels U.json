New overnight Israeli forces say they have discovered the body of a second hostage near Gaza's largest hospital where Israeli troops have been conducting an ongoing military operation. This comes as the Israeli military says it found a tunnel, a Hamas tunnel shaft and a stash of guns, grenades, and other combat gear at the hospital. The IDF released these videos. They say this is proof. Hamas accuses Israel of making baseless lies. CNN cannot verify the claims.

Meanwhile, the IDF says they are now in the third or fourth day of operations in the Al-Shifa complex. The primary purpose of that is to uncover more underground Hamas infrastructure. The first bit of evidence they put out a couple of days ago fell short of conclusive proof that Hamas was using the hospital above ground to protect themselves below ground. They say they uncovered weapons in the hospital itself, certainly not establishing underground presence.But they put out more imagery and more photos and video that you showed just a short while ago of what they say is the entrance to an operational tunnel of the terror infrastructure used by Hamas underneath the hospital itself. The problem is, we are not independently on the ground there to verify that and we can't see inside the tunnel. That is what we would expect to see to further substantiate the claim that has gotten U.S. backing that Hamas is underneath the hospital itself as part of their infrastructure, their complex, their command and control, and their operations. So that is what we're waiting to see now. Meanwhile, in the hospital itself, conditions growing even more dire. The director of the hospital told Al Jazeera doctors are having to make harrowing decisions to try to keep patients alive, including, for example, amputating some patients' limbs because they can't keep infection away from the injuries. Meanwhile, there are also questions about premature babies there and patients who need kidney dialysis. So that is a look at what's happening inside the hospital itself as we near what I believe would be the fourth day of IDF operations there and in the vicinity.",

Had they long abandoned the site or did they just flee moments before the IDF moved in? It's difficult to say.What is very troubling, however, is the thought, the notion of babies dying in incubators because the hospital staff has evacuated the hospital for their own physical safety. It must be extraordinarily painful for a health care worker to abandon a child in an incubator. And so there has to be a way to thread this needle. I know, for example, U.S. special forces would be very adept at going after their objectives, their military objectives, while minimizing civilian casualties.

It goes on and on. Joining me now is Congressman Anthony D'Esposito, who's one of the New York Republicans who's been driving a campaign to have Santos expelled from Congress, good morning, sir. This is a shocking 56-page report. But so far, your new speaker. The new speaker of the House is not pushing for his expulsion. Do you agree with that, or is it time for him to go? REP. ANTHONY D'ESPOSITO, (R-NY): No, listen, I thought that Santos should have been ridden from the House of Representatives months ago. I was one of the ones that led the charge a couple of weeks ago, along with my New York freshman, in order to put the expulsion resolution on the floor. Obviously, it wasn't successful, but I do believe that it helped the Ethics Committee move their investigation along. I would hope, and now the rest of the conference and the rest of the House of Representatives are getting a bird's eye view of exactly what New Yorkers thought all along. HARLOW: But the House Speaker Mike Johnson's statement from his team called it troubling, right? All of these findings, but then went on to say they encourage all involved to consider the best interests of the institution as this matter is addressed further. Do you think that is a mistake not to have come out and called for his expulsion? D'ESPOSITO: I think that the speaker, I spoke to the Speaker yesterday and he's given me the same advice as he gave me three weeks ago, and that was, do what you think is best for the conference and for your district. And I think that that's what many of my colleagues are going to do. I believe that the speaker who has had conversations with us, also spoke to the chairman of the Ethics Committee yesterday, who put out a statement that he was going to put forth a resolution today to expel George Santos. I am confident that a majority of the conference is going to come together after reading, if not yesterday, then today, the ethics report and send George Santos on his way.",

There are many individuals who make it through the system who do their penance and have very successful lives.

D'ESPOSITO: I am absolutely not saying that. I think people should have second chances. But there are better ways to handle that than sending a message to individuals who are committing crimes that if they check boxes that it's going to be eliminated from their record. And to try to say that it's a public safety policy is absolutely ridiculous when we have the governor, the prior governor, and the state legislature who are the most anti public safety that I've seen in a long time. So, it's completely hypocritical. If we want to focus on public safety, we should be focusing on the issues at hand. And that is the disaster that they have made of cashless bail, of criminal justice reform. They made changes to our Criminal Justice Reform System without ever having conversations with law enforcement officers, without ever having conversations with people who are actually putting handcuffs on people who are wrestling guns out of individuals on the streets. They never had conversations with them.
