Also this hour, we'll check in with CNN's John King on the fifth and final leg of his battleground tour. John is now in Pennsylvania, a crucial swing state for both presidential campaigns. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. We begin our coverage tonight with a fallout from Donald Trump's latest attack on Liz Cheney, the former Republican representative turned Harris supporter. CNN journalists are covering both campaigns in battleground Wisconsin right now, one of a handful of states that will decide this historic race. First, let's bring in CNN's Kristen Holmes. She's following the Trump campaign for us in Milwaukee right now. Kristen, Trump has been responding to questions about his ugly Cheney comments throughout the day.",

Then he said this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I think that Liz Cheney is a disaster. All she wants to do is blow people up. She's a war hawk and a dumb one at that. And if you ever put her into the field of battle, she'd be the first one to chicken out. She wouldn't fight, she'd chicken out so fast. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The campaign is trying to project calm and confidence about what they expect as potential chaos and confusion that Donald Trump and his campaign could try to sow next week. They are talking to reporters about the fact that they have had a legal team, for example, in place since 2020 to try to be prepared for all different kinds of misinformation, disinformation, potential lawsuits, other kinds of confusing rhetoric that could come from the Trump campaign, essentially saying they are prepared for anything and everything that could come from the Trump campaign.

This does not, as one source said to me, help close the deal with those critical independent, suburban women voters and swing voters.One other thing that a source mentioned to me, Wolf, is that there is real concern about what this means for a second Trump term. As we've reported it's believed the guardrails will be gone. There will be no General Kelly Mattis, General Milley, Vice President Mike Pence. And so they're really worried that this forecasts what Trump would do. One last thing a source close to Liz Cheney pointed out to me this afternoon that we have to notice that Donald Trump goes after her over and over again.

He's went into some very obscene places, not just in this campaign cycle, but in every election cycle that he's participated in, he has called for violence before. This isn't anything new. So, even if -- you know, even if Scott is right, even if it wasn't as bad as people are making it out to be, this is certainly not the first time. And it's not even the worst thing that the former president has said. So, I think he should be fully held accountable for his words. He's called in many instances for his political opponents to have violence visited upon them. And this especially happens with women who whom he disagrees with. So, I think that the former president knew exactly what he was saying. He knew exactly what type of picture he was trying to paint. And he knew exactly who he was talking to when saying that. If we are to dismiss this, we are to also dismiss the rhetoric around January 6 in his rally leading up to the assault on the Capitol.

And as Kristen Holmes noted earlier in the program, that doesn't happen often, that he will walk something back or try to clean something up. Usually, he'll double down on things like this. And so, clearly, I know his campaign advisers are telling him, look, you need to walk this back. You need to make clear what you were trying to say. But in my view, in these highly charged times that we live in, I don't care if he disagrees with Liz Cheney's foreign policy and what point he was trying to make. It is unacceptable to suggest that nine barrels should be pointed at her in the face. And this is someone that he has already said should face a war tribunal.And this isn't the only person that has criticized him, who he has kind of alluded to wanting to go after. His own former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mark Milley, he has suggested that he should face execution, okay? So, this is someone who is unhinged, increasingly unstable. And so I do think that these remarks, I don't care what the context is, they're unacceptable. And this kind of rhetoric should be condemned. And it is really pathetic in my view that the Republican colleagues who served with Liz Cheney are defending these remarks and aren't saying, hey, you know what? We need to tone it down because I remember a lot of Republicans after two assassination attempts taken toward Donald Trump, who were saying we need to bring down the rhetoric and bring down the tone. Okay, so where are the calls then for the same? Because I don't think that under any context, you should say that guns should be pointed at someone's face.",

They thought they had a win. Hillary Clinton lost Pennsylvania, and she lost the presidency. In 2020, of course, Joe Biden won big in these suburbs, and he became president.Let's use the mini magic wall to pop up where we are. Again, look at all that red in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, right? Donald Trump runs it up in rural Pennsylvania. We know that. He did it in 2016. He did it again in 2020. So, where am I? I'm south of Philadelphia here in Delaware County. You see Biden got 63 percent of the vote here, right? This is a blue area, but there are pockets of Trump support. The big question is what will the margin be this time in 2024? Listen here. This is Kristin Caparra. She's a Republican. Her neighborhood used to be Republican. She says she's outnumbered now in Drexel Hill. It's about six miles from here by Democrats. But she is going to vote for Donald Trump. She says she's glad the campaign is going to be over because of all the T.V ads. She wishes the Democrats would vote Trump policies and not be so annoyed by his character. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It's good to see you.This is a rejection of the Republican National Committee's arguments that would have stopped the counting of certain provisional ballots in Pennsylvania, this key state of Pennsylvania. The Supreme Court essentially unanimously said that a state Supreme Court ruling that had said these ballots could be counted should stand. In dispute, Wolf, were ballots that would be cast provisionally after voters had been notified that their mail in ballots were flawed, that they hadn't put their vote inside what's known as a secrecy sleeve before they put the full ballot into the mail. And there had been a dispute over whether those people who had ballots that were essentially voided because of how they voted in error by mail without the secrecy sleeve could do a provisional ballot so that allows these ballots to be counted in Pennsylvania. And I just want to say that this is a win for the more Democratic interests in the state. And it comes just two days after the Supreme Court actually sided with the Republicans in Virginia and allowed the purging of some 1,600 voters there who were suspected of not being citizens -- Wolf.",

Wolf, if Pennsylvania turns out to be razor thin, where a small category of provisional ballots like what were seeing in these cases might make the difference, this order does not tell us how the Supreme Court would deal with that issue a week, two weeks, three weeks from now. It just says we're not stepping in today. If Pennsylvania turns out super close, I think were going to see a rerun of this very dispute, you know, on the far side of the election as well.",
