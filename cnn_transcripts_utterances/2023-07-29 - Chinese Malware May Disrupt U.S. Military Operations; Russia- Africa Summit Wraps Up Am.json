The \"New York Times\" is reporting the Biden administration is searching for malicious computer code that it believes China has seen inside key U.S. systems. According to \"The Times\" the malware may target power grids, water systems and communications for military bases in U.S. and around the world. That could disrupt or slow U.S. military operations which could be devastating in a military conflict, such as a potential Chinese attack on Taiwan. CNN's David Sanger helped break this story. He's a national security for responded for \"The New York Times\" and a CNN political and national security analyst. David, this sounds pretty terrifying. How concerned is the White House?",

They haven't said very much about it.We actually got on from one of the rare moments when we got a glimpse of this in May when Microsoft and the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, and others put out a warning about some Chinese malware. It was found in Guam. Now, Guam of course is the home of a very major American military base. And it was the opportunity for us to sort of pull the string and sure enough this malware has been found in infrastructures all around the United States and military bases elsewhere in the world. We don't know how aimed it is at military bases themselves because frequently the bases use the same water, the same power, the same telecommunications grids that everyone else in the area uses.",

But so would California, so would Pacific Command -- Indo Pacific Command in Hawaii. So there are a lot of places that the Chinese would have to worry about.And remember, this malware may not be crippling, may not be crippling for war. But in most of the Taiwan contingencies that people have done tabletop exercises about, what they've learned is that a few days or weeks matter. If the Chinese were able to take over the entire island and of course they have been threatening to do so since the Chinese revolution that put Mao in charge of the mainland in 1949, then, you know, a short period of time to hold the island would make a very big difference.",

You see offending malware that you think, well, let's clean it out. Of course as soon as you clean it out the Chinese or whoever else placed this, wouldn't have to just be Chinese malware, would recognize you removed it. And that would give them time to come back in.

He praised the peace deal. He said it was a good basis for conversation. But he trotted out old arguments, saying that a cease-fire right now is not possible because Russian forces are under attack from the Ukrainian side. He says that Russia has never rejected a peace plan, and then he went on to say as he has been since the beginning of this war, that Russia is fighting against neo-Nazis. President Putin also weighed in in the ongoing counteroffensive in Ukraine. He argued that Ukraine has suffered significant losses both in terms of manpower and equipment.

But if anyone thinks, right, that you're not going to be fair to the former president, we have to remind people that in your role as liaison to the Mueller probe, I mean, you were one of the authors of a memo laying out why the former president should not be charged with obstruction of justice based on what was uncovered in the Mueller probe.So I just want to read for you really quickly the outline of the obstruction case here. I mean, they're saying, you know, he suggested to his attorneys that they falsely represent to the FBI that Trump did not have documents called for by the grand jury, directing Walt Nauta to move boxes, to conceal them from his own attorney, suggesting his attorney hired or destroy documents, providing the FBI and the grand jury some documents while claiming he was cooperating fully causing a certification to be submitted to the FBI and the grand jury, falsely representing that all documents called for by the grand jury subpoena had been produced, and attempting to delete security footage at the Mar-a-Lago club. Based on your assessment if you had to draft a memo about whether they should pursue obstruction, what is your assessment of this case for obstruction of justice? O'CALLAGHAN: Yes, so obviously you have to have the evidence to get all of those allegations into court when you bring the case. But just on the -- this is clearly a speaking indictment, meaning that you're putting a lot of details so people actually know the strength of your case, and by all objective standards seems like a pretty strong case of obstruction here.

And he, according to the allegations in the indictment, knew that the grand jury was investigating this and specifically engaged in that conduct and conduct with others including the new defendant De Oliveira to specifically obstruct that grand jury proceeding.

And so that is a very -- you need to as an individual, the government needs to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that there was some benefit to you that you expected to obtain by obstructing the investigation. So his defense would be that. As we know going back to he could have declassified these documents whenever he wanted, that's what his lawyers have been saying and he's been saying from the beginning. So he's going to say, I didn't have any corrupt intent because I didn't think they were classified because I had declassified them. That's an interesting to tact. I do think that the conspiracy charges that were added, including De Oliveira and some of the facts there, are specifically intended to show what's known as consciousness of guilt, if someone actually believed that they could keep these documents and they had no problem keeping those documents, why did he go about instructing others to try to attempt to destroy security camera footage of them moving the documents around? Why did he give instructions for people to do these things? And it looks like they have witnesses who will corroborate each other in having received those instructions. So that's good from a prosecutor's perspective. Again, good consciousness of guilt evidence that having these other counts allows you to get in before the jury to help you prove the other accounts that are already charged. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The folks that we're speaking to here, say for them, it's extremely important to continue to go out onto the streets. They see they need the government here to understand that there's many people here in this country who are not happy at all with this judicial overhaul, and of course in September, the Supreme Court is going to deal with that case, and they say until then, they're going to keep coming out -- Paula.",

The area's utility provider says at least 64,000 customers are now without power. And Yosemite's half dome standing nearly 5,000 feet above ground is every outdoor adventurer's dream climb. The hike itself can take up to 16 hours round trip, and it's not for the faint of heart. But for 93-year-old Everett Kalin, it was a chance to accomplish another life goal with three generations of his family. So joining me now to talk about this incredible feat is Everett Kalin himself and his son, John who joined him on the climb. I should also know that his granddaughter, Sidney also went on the climb, but she cannot be with us tonight because she is at the Taylor Swift concert. So Everett, I want to ask you, what made you decide to do this now at 93? EVERETT KALIN, CLIMBED YOSEMITE'S HALF DOME AT 93 YEARS OLD: Well, I tried to think of something I could do. Two years ago, I jumped out of an airplane up in Novato near where we live, and as I thought about it, it seemed like this would be a wonderful opportunity to climb this higher height.",

He says he wants to climb half dome. I thought he was pretty nuts. Jumping out of an airplane was already kind of out there, but you know, jumping out of an airplane, gravity is going to do its piece, right? And all of a sudden having to climb up a mountain and be fit and as a backpacker myself, I know it's pretty strenuous. I kind of thought he was joking and he was -- no, he was dead serious.
