From squabbling with witnesses at congressional hearings to instigating the ousting of former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, Matt Gaetz's approach has long made him a controversial figure in Washington. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MATT GAETZ (R), FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE:  And it makes people -- you may not see this from, you know, like the ivory towers of your law school, but it makes actual people in this country when the president calls -- you don't get to interrupt me on this time. From those who would grovel and bend the knee for the lobbyists and special interests, who own our leadership, who have -- oh, boo all you want. I rise to nominate the most talented, hardest working member of the Republican conference who just gave a speech with more vision than we have ever heard from the alternative, I'm nominating Jim Jordan. Speaking -- what night are you speaking? Are you speaking tonight? You took that stage. You would get booed off of it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Stranger things have happened.Look, I think the fact that this report was even released, right, for a former member who had resigned, who had taken himself out of any potential to be in the administration, shows just how little love there was for Matt Gaetz in the house. This is not someone who was beloved by his colleagues. This was someone who was really a thorn in their side. And so I think the fact that this report even came out is just sort of the latest -- the latest evidence of that.",

      "sentences": "Kevin, I want to get your reaction to something. So this was in an op-ed in \"The New York Times\", written by the deputy editor of \"The New York Times\" Editorial Board, David Firestone. And he says in it, when you read through the details, you can see the commonality between the two men and the reasons Trump held Gaetz in high esteem. It's not just the contempt for women as disposable commodities for hire or plunder, it's the contempt for the law.So, Kevin, do you think we continue to see Trump standing by Gaetz? And does this hurt Trump at all? KEVIN FREY, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, SPECTRUM NEWS NY1:  Well, I mean, we already saw that message you had earlier in the show that Trump wrote to Gaetz. And this is kind of the one open question, which is, yes, he was not confirmed by the Senate and his campaign was just getting out. There was no love lost for him, particularly on Capitol Hill. But could he potentially try to put him into a position in his administration that doesn't require confirmation on Capitol Hill? That's kind of the one outstanding question. And certainly, Trump still has him in his orbit and clearly appointed him as AG before. Obviously, that all fell apart because he saw him as someone who was an ally and someone who could act in his interest to essentially try to tear down or upend the Department of Justice. And so it is an open question as to where exactly he lands next and how long he will stay within Trumps graces. SOLOMON:  Yeah, I think one thing sort of heading into the new year that's also an open question is, is mike Johnsons future? I mean, obviously totally, completely different. But I want to ask you about the upcoming speaker election. Here's what one Republican said earlier this week. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I think that number -- that answer is definitely yes, right. Given the margin, 1 or 2 votes there, you know, scores of Republicans who feel like he's been a poor leader.The second question is, are they willing to sort of start off 2025 this year, that they're coming in with a trifecta in government? Trump returning to the White House? Do they want to start that with a protracted speaker battle? And I think one person who will, you know, give us clues as to how to answer that is Trump himself, right? Does Trump want to expend political capital saving Johnson if it looks hairy on the hill? And I said, I think that will be, you know, the top story line to look for as we move into the speaker battle at the beginning of January.",

I mean, initially and you heard Speaker Johnson say just moments after the house passed the bill that he had just spoken to Trump. Trump, you know, I'm paraphrasing here, but he said something to the effect that that Trump was sort of happy or pleased with how it all came to be. Politico has some reporting that Trump is anything but pleased with how it all came about.Where does Trump stand on this?",

And I mean, to build off of what was just said, Representative Tim Burchett, who was one of those that voted to get rid of McCarthy last Congress or the currently ending Congress, basically argued the other day to some reporters on the Hill that this is all going to be decided by Trump and what he wants. He's going to be the one that picks the next speaker of the house. There was that reporting in politico, which is pretty for Johnsons future, in no small part because Trump is reportedly very annoyed that he doesn't see Johnson as having enough of a spine to do his bidding on the idea of the debt ceiling, which has, because it did not get done within this most recent package, it gives Democrats a deal of leverage heading into the next Congress.Democrats already had a deal of leverage heading into the next Congress because of the fact that the margins are so slim, because of the filibuster in the Senate and because, quite frankly, Republicans struggle to coalesce as a unified group. And when you have a vote margin of 1 or 2 at most, getting things like reconciliation, a giant tax package done is going to be difficult. Throw in the animosity that could be caused by a speaker fight, and that sets up a recipe for really disaster for their legislative agenda.",

The green and gold scored touchdowns on each of their first three drives, and it was pretty much over after that. The Packers cruising to a 34-0 rout.

Just before halftime the Sixers star called for a charge against the Spurs Victor Wembanyama. Embiid picking up a technical foul for arguing the call.Then he followed referee Jenna Schroeder around the court, earning another T and the second ejection of his career. The Sixers would go on to win the game 111-106, the final. Turning to hockey, Buffalo finally back in the win column, the Sabres dominating the Islanders to the tune of 7 to 1 last night, putting an end to their 13 game losing streak. Captain Rasmus Dahlin led the way with a career high four assists, while 20 year old forward Jiri Kulich notched his first ever two goal game. The Sabres and their fans can savor this one for a while. They're off until Saturday, when they host the Chicago Blackhawks. And in a donation tradition that has happened each year since 2018, look how great this is. This is fans of Spanish La Liga soccer team Real Betis and making it rain during halftime of their match on Sunday, showering the pitch with thousands of cuddly stuffed animals. And these toys are going to be donated to disadvantaged children over Christmas and the New Year. Fans setting a new record this year, by the way, collecting 20,000 toys, all of them going to somebody in need. I just think its so sweet.
