President Biden said that those tariffs could potentially jeopardize relations with some of the United States' closest allies.Now, earlier this week, Trump said he wants to move forward with imposing 25 percent tariffs on all imports from Mexico and Canada until the two countries do more to try to curb the flow of drugs and migrants into the United States. These comments from President Biden are quite significant as they mark the first substantive criticism that he has made of the president- elect and his policies since the November 5th election. Here is what Biden had to tell reporters a bit earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  I hope he rethinks it. I think it's a counterproductive thing to do. You know, look, one of the things you've heard me say before, that we have an unusual situation in America. We're surrounded by the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, and two allies, Mexico and Canada. And the last thing we need to do is begin to screw up those relationships. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Biden during the campaign and Democrats had criticized President Trump's proposals relating to tariffs, saying that they would increase prices here at home for Americans. And now the president is warning that it could threaten the way that the U.S. interacts with allies, like Mexico and Canada. Going forward, he gave that advice to Trump, saying he thinks it's something that he should reconsider when he takes office.",

Trump has almost seemingly declared victory in the immediate aftermath of this call. In fact, an aide for Donald Trump posted to social media that one call and this is fixed, essentially is what she said, saying that Mexico had agreed to all but close the border in response to these threats of a 25 percent tariff.Now, The Mexican president said that this call was positive, and she was very complimentary of the conversation that she had with President-elect Trump. However, she was also clear to point out that the status quo has not changed, that the border, in her mind, has already been affected immensely by the policies that they have put in place with President Biden. And what's also unclear is whether or not what Donald Trump believes happened or what the Mexican president believes happened was enough to resolve the 25 percent tariff threat that Trump has warned is coming once he is installed as president. And I reached out to the Trump transition team to ask if the comments that they had yesterday satisfied Trump to get rid of that 25 percent tariff, and I did not receive a response from the Trump transition team.

She's making it clear that no policy changes have actually taken effect, but Trump is declaring victory for policy changes. LANCE TROVER, FORMER SPOKERSPERSON, GOV. BURGUM'S 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN:  Yes, I'm going to take the side of our president-elect and not the president of Mexico that has allowed tens of millions of illegal immigrants to flow into this country over the course of the last several years. And, look, when it comes to these tariffs, Donald Trump has many tools in his toolbox. That's not the only tool. I would also just caution Mexico and say, look, I don't think you should underestimate Americans' tolerance for getting this border situation under control, for getting this fentanyl crisis under control. I saw it firsthand when I was out on the campaign trail with Doug Burgum, people whose families have been devastated by the fentanyl epidemic in this country. So, if I were the president of Mexico, I would get to the table and bring some real solutions and help work this problem out and be ready for January 20th, because it is a brand new day in this country.

This kind of violence and these kinds of threats are absolutely not acceptable.But you also can't ignore the fact the kind of violent language that Donald Trump has used, that Elon Musk has used, that the right has used to go after government workers who are innocent, to go after Democrats themselves, to go after, frankly, people who are interested in keeping our democracy. Let's not forget who caused the insurrection four years ago that attacked our Capitol and who encouraged his own supporters to go and make sure that the election results were not certified. That was not Democrats. That was the president-elect, Donald Trump. So, let's not take that away and let's focus on making sure, that everyone turns down the heat in this very divided, very polarized era. It's Thanksgiving Day, for God's sake.

We just had that huge attack from Russia. The Russian president saying that that is in response to these ATACMS missiles, these American long-range missiles being used to strike inside of Russia. Is this the kind of escalation that the Biden administration has long feared, one of the reasons they didn't want to give those ATACMS to Ukraine? Is this part of the fear that Russia could in fact do more against Ukraine? WILLIAM TAYLOR, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO UKRAINE:  No, I don't think this is what the administration had been fearing, Alex. They had been concerned about other forms of escalation. And this conventional and Putin says this is a response to the use of ATACMS in Russia, clearly not the case. I mean, number one, we know what Putin has in mind, what he's been doing for, let's be clear, 1,009 days. He's been trying to dominate Ukraine. He's been trying to take over Ukraine. Or another way that he said it is to wipe Ukraine off the map. So, this isn't about this big attack being a response to ATACMS, it makes no sense. It's nonsense.
