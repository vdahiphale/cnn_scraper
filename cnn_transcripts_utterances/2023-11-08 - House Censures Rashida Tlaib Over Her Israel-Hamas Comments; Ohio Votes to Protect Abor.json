      "sentences": "Last night, the House voted to censure Rashida Tlaib over her comments about Israel and statements that are considered flatly anti-Semitic, like using the phrase \"From The River To The Sea\" in a controversial video she tweeted out last week. That phrase is perceived by Israelis and Jews as a call for the elimination of the Jewish state of Israel, which sits between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea.Just before the vote, Tlaib, the first Palestinian-American member of Congress, spoke on the House floor. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. RASHIDA TLAIB (D-MI): I can't believe I have to say this, but Palestinian people are not disposable. We are human beings just like anyone else. My city, my grandmother, like all Palestinians, just wants to live her life with freedom and human dignity we all deserve. The cries of the Palestinian and Israeli children sound no different to me. Why I don't understand. Is why the cries of Palestinians sound different to you all? (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yeah. My colleagues, Annie Grayer and Melanie Zanona, and I hearing about tensions growing within the House Democratic caucus that have only persisted as this war carries on, as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza gets much worse and a debate that is happening along regional lines, very much along ethnic lines in the House Democratic Caucus. Not just for what we saw with Rashida Tlaib, the 22 members voting to censure her, many of them Jewish members, but also on just how -- whether to express support for Israel itself.There are a number of Democrats who believe that there should be calls for a ceasefire. Many of those members, more progressive members. Many of those members, Muslim Americans. Many of them don't want to go nearly as far as where Joe Biden is on this issue, which also underscores the larger Democratic debate over the president's handling of this. Now, we are learning about things that are happening behind the scenes, one of which was a comment that was made by Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. She's a prominent Jewish Democrat. She was pushing for a resolution that was adopted on a bipartisan basis on the House floor just a couple weeks ago to reaffirm support for the United States for its war against Israel. I asked her about that resolution and about Democrats who may vote against it, and she had some sharp remarks about those Democrats, which set off an uproar. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RAJU (on camera): There is this vote that's going to happen on the Israel-Hamas resolution on the floor. Are you concerned that some Democrats may not support this? REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ (D-FL): I would hope that all members would support a resolution that condemns terrorism, the brutal attacks that were perpetrated against the Israeli people that were killed. They have 218 hostages. They took 222. Someone who votes against this I would think doesn't have a soul. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "And that comment sort of prompted outrage among key Democrats and particularly, the 15 who voted against that measure. Some of them, all of them minorities, some of them Muslim Americans and some of them braving this directly to the Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries who has sought to tamp down these tension internally, tried to get these members on the same page as this divide has been growing.We're told that one of the members even talked to Debbie Wasserman Schultz and was concerned that that is a racial trope that would be used to calling someone soulless, something that could be interpreted very negatively among African-American members in particular. Wasserman Schultz, we are told, indicated she was not aware of that when she made that comment here. But Dana, all showing the divide that is just persisting as this work carries on, the debate within the Democratic Party that is now spilling out into public view, but very much a private debate as well.

But again, looking ahead and understanding far better than I where the electorate is in Ohio, and that is it is an electorate that voted for Trump in 2020 by eight points. You're going to need some Trump voters to vote for you. And that's the only way you can get re-elected. So, what is your message to them?",

One of the reasons is I take on an interest group. I took on the railroads after they did the damage in East Palestine. I have taken on the drug companies. We have now a cap of $35 on insulin and $2,000 per year out-of-pocket drug costs. I have taken on the oil industry. I've taken on the corporations that outsource trade. That's why I do well among working voters.The last thing I'd say is I wear this pin on my lapel. It's a depiction of a canary in a birdcage. The mineworkers took the canary down in the mines to protect themselves because they didn't have unions in those days strong enough or government that cared enough to protect them. My colleagues, when you come to the Senate, you get this fancy $100 -- $300 pin whatever, that they give you to put on your lapel and it says, \"I'm important.  I am a senator.\" I wore that for a couple days, then I put my canary pin back on because it helps me focus on workers, helps me focus on women's rights and civil rights. It helps me do this job and keep in mind why I'm there and whom I'm fighting for.",

And all the polls show that he's having a very hard time getting traction. Are you worried that what you just said, your message for Sherrod Brown will not be enough to win over voters in this polarized environment, particularly when you're going to be on the same ballot as Joe Biden in Ohio?",

It's making sure that I keep that focus on fighting for workers and standing up against interest groups. That takes care of itself.I mean I will certainly run a campaign in the next 12 months, but if I do this job right, and I plan to do this job, people know I mean it when I stand up against presidents of both parties on bad trade agreements. People know I mean it when I take on Wall Street and the drug companies. People know I mean it when I took on the railroads. They laid off a third of their workers, Norfolk Southern, and then not as many trail (ph) rail inspections, all that. Funny then there's no surprise that way.",
