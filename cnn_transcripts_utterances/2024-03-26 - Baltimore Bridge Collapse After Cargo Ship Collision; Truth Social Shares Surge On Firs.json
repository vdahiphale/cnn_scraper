Those are the markets, and these are the main events of the day. A may-day call, probably saved the lives before a Baltimore bridge collapse. The warning allowed authorities to hold off traffic on both sides of the bridge. The collapse forces global shippers to divert cargo or avoiding the Port of Baltimore. And Donald Trump's media company ends today more than 10 percent up on its first day of trading. It lost ground at the end of the day. We are live from London, on Tuesday, it March 26th. I am Richard Quest. I mean, business,. Good evening. Rescue teams are searching for victims following the stunning bridge collapse in the Baltimore area after a cargo ship, a massive container ship hit it last night. This is the scene at the moment. Eight people were on the Francis Scott Key Bridge when it was struck by the ship called the Dali. Two of those on the bridge have been pulled from the water alive. A councilwoman now says one body has been recovered. Apparently, the ship lost power moments before crashing into the bridge. The governor of Maryland says its crew had issued a may-day. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. WES MOORE (D-MD): We had a ship that was coming in at eight knots, so coming at a very, very rapid speed. I have to say, I am thankful for the folks who once the warning came up, and once notification came up, that there was a may-day who literally by being able to stop cars from coming over the bridge, these people are heroes. They saved lives last night. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

What we have unique here with this angle is with the sun hitting it now and the angle that were at, you can really see the point of impact where the Dali slammed into the Francis Scott Key Bridge there. You can see the tangled metal, the concrete from the bridge support that also collapsed. You can also see that portion of the bridge stanchion, that metal on the top there that is basically draped over the bough of this vessel. This was, as you mentioned, a massive container ship, the Dali, about a little under a thousand feet long, about 140-feet wide, 116,000 tons and with that kind of force, this gives you a really good visual of just the point of impact and the violence of force with which it struck the bridge. You can also see some rescue vessels all around here. There have been helicopters flying, about 50 divers have been in and out of the water all day long. You mentioned the conditions, you had an official on a moment ago talking about the cold air and the cold water. The water is about 46 to 48 degrees Fahrenheit; very, very dangerous conditions for a human to be in for more than maybe two hours, so anyone who did plunge into the water was in extreme danger for that period of time. As we swing over here, Richard, I am just going to show you kind of the other impact of this horrible accident. It is the economic impact. You can see this vessel over here, that's the Carmen, that's a large container vessel that ships cars and light trucks into the Port of Baltimore, that's basically stranded. All major ship traffic is now completely halted into and out of Baltimore Harbor. You're talking possibly in the billions of dollars if this stretches on for days and weeks, which is expected to, Richard. Ship traffic has been completely diverted away from this harbor and again, you've got not only just businesses that depend on these goods coming in and out, you've got hotels and restaurants in the city of Baltimore that depend on it as well.

Everything that is in the water there, there is not enough of an opening there for any major vessel to come through. Plus, there is a lot underwater that you cannot see, so it is going to take days and weeks just for them to get heavy equipment here to be able to recover and kind of salvage some of this wreckage from the water. And once those large floating cranes get here, it is going to take them a while. They have to chop up these fragments into smaller pieces in order to remove them. That's going to take days and weeks, too. So you're talking about just a major disruption here, Richard. We were told by the governor of Virginia not too long ago that some of the ship traffic, the ocean carriers are being diverted to the Port of Virginia, which is in the Hampton Roads area, maybe about 70 or 80 miles south of here. So they will be able to take in some of the ship traffic, but again, that's not going to alleviate a lot of this.",

That's because the basis of the doctors' argument is that they might at some point have to treat a woman who comes to their emergency room, potentially with complications from this mifepristone abortion pill and that these doctors might have to treat that woman even though they disagree with abortion, so that was the doctors' arguments. The government and drug manufacturer, they argued, look, the type of injury the doctors are putting forward is just far too removed, far too hypothetical to really prove the basis of a lawsuit and a majority of the justices seemed to agree with that. The lower courts though disagree. They let this lawsuit move forward. They said the doctors had standing and they even ruled in favor of the doctors. They said that they should block certain aspects of mifepristone, making it harder to obtain, although that ruling has been on hold. So it does seem from the arguments, 90 minutes we saw today that these justices might get rid of this case and not even get to a heart of this issue, which is did the FDA follow the proper procedure when it made this abortion pill easier to obtain. Here though was Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson and she worked to make the point that look, doctors don't really suffer an injury.
