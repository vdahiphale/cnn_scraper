We cannot look at this deal without acknowledging those realities and the way that Vladimir Putin has played this. Matthew, appreciate it as always.Also, with me this hour, CNN's Nic Robertson, our international diplomatic editor. Nic, as we look at all of this, as Matthew rightly points out here, right, there is this aspect of it, Putin saying he wanted parody essentially in this deal, which then brings us back to just how quickly this sort of sham trial for Evan Gershkovich moved along and how quickly that conviction came for him on these, I think we can call them trumped up charges of espionage, just ahead of this deal getting done. That happened just, of course, last month. What we also heard from President Biden there, he was talking about the importance of working with allies. What I was struck by is, I believe it was our colleague MJ Lee, who shouted out a question to the president at the end of those remarks that he just made at the White House, asking what Germany offered up in exchange to agree to this deal, because it was a big deal, the person that they released there. And President Biden said nothing. Nic, as we look at this from this global perspective, from what this means for these allies on the world stage, just walk us through the importance of that admission.",

      "sentences": "I think it's very important for President Biden to project this image to European partners that a Democrat president is one that's going to work in their interest, because I think they're all aware at the moment that a Republican president, which it still seems to be a possibility in the elections in November is not going to be minded to work with allies and with partners. It's going to be much more isolationist.So, I think this is an important message for allies. Obviously, it has deep domestic resonance in the United States because it will -- he will hope, obviously, encourage people to vote for Kamala Harris. But in the context of what he said about the Germans, about the German chancellor, he thanked him specifically. Think about here for a moment, the tempestuous relationship that Former President Donald Trump had with Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor's predecessor, Angela Merkel, at times seemed to berate her. And at one breakfast meeting, I can't remember if it was a G20, a G7, or a NATO meeting, you know, coming in and essentially telling her that Germany needed to pay more for NATO, a very sort of transactional type of relationship. And what President Biden is saying here is this is done through friendship with allies through common interests. It's not transactional. The Germans said, look, we took this decision because we had an obligation to the safety and security of German citizens. There were two Germans who were released, Rico Krieger, who was held in Belarus. He was a humanitarian worker and a German resident who's an opponent of Putin, an outspoken opponent of Putin. Ilya Yashin was also released. So, the Germans did get a couple of people released, but there was no quid pro quo, if you will, in that relationship with -- when President Biden asked for Germany for that help. And that's really what President Biden wanted a signal there, and that's what the Germans are today of signaling as well. They wanted to help out the United States, that they've said that about their reasoning as well for why they did this. So, if you are Europe -- if you're in Europe and you're a European leader at the moment, you will certainly look upon the achievements of President Biden and hope that you can have a similar president in the next -- after the next election. Of course, no one in Europe gets a vote. No European leader gets a vote on this. They have to wait and watch, but this will be an object lesson in how they hope it will turn out.",

There's nothing that will stop Putin from doing this again. And I think what we need to do is, I think, it is the right call, get these people out. Paul Whelan has been there far too long. Evan Gershkovich had no business being in a Russian jail. Get them out. But now, we've also tried -- we have to try to build a greater position of strength vis-a-vis Russia.",

In fact, it's not even clear we're increasing our defense budget. We've got to be moving in that direction.

And so, I would say that if you had not had Joe Biden sitting in the Oval Office, I don't think this would have happened. But as I said in my remarks, there were a lot of other people who played a central role in building out the pieces of this and then executing on that. And the execution phase of this, to get this level of coordination together, to have those planes all land on the tarmac at the same time from multiple different countries with so many different individuals coming from Russia and going back to Russia really extraordinary.

It is difficult to send back a convicted criminal to secure the release of an innocent American. And yet, sometimes the choices between doing that and consigning that person basically to live out their days in prison in a hostile foreign country or in the hands of a hostile power.So, from our perspective, we have assessed and analyzed that risk and we have judged that the benefit of reuniting Americans, of bringing people home and also of vindicating the idea that the American president and the American government are going to do what it takes to protect and secure the release of innocent Americans, that that benefit outweighs the risk, and that's how we have proceeded. I would point out in addition to that, that in periods of time when the U.S. government didn't tend to do prisoner exchanges, Americans were unjustly detained and held hostage overseas. In periods where we did, Americans were unjustly detained and held hostage overseas. So, I think there are real questions. And Roger Carstens is the hostage negotiator at the State Department has actually pointed out that in this analysis, it is not quite as clear cut that the evidence actually demonstrates the kind of result that your question speaks to that, you know, a lot more people get taken because we do these exchanges. But it's something that we have to pay attention to, and it's something that makes these decisions by the president, not simple decisions, hard decisions, and yet, as he did today, he was prepared to make them.

It's been clear just how momentous and historic of a day it's been with this massive prisoner swap. But Jake Sullivan, the president's national security adviser, he's not one to really get emotional.And during that briefing, he was fighting back tears as he was talking about the welcome news that he was able to share with the families of these Americans that they would be released. This is something that he along with his team have been furiously working on behind the scenes, and he described the family members as being overjoyed and gave us a little bit of a -- little bit of color as to what that looked like this morning with the families coming to the White House, waiting to be invited into the Oval Office when the president, his team knew that these Americans had been released, that the exchange was complete. There was two phone calls made, one with Paul, Evan, and Alsu. The -- each of the family members were able to talk to the three of them who were together. Then a separate call with Vladimir. So, this has been, again, a momentous day, one that you really can't overstate, but it was also one that took a long time to get here. You think back to December of 2022 when Brittney Griner was released and the president, when he also gave an address at that moment, had acknowledged that Paul Whelan wasn't part of that exchange. Of course, Evan Gershkovich had not yet been detained. And he said at the time he could feel the mixed emotions from Paul's family. Well, that's not the case today because they're all part of this deal. And so, that is something that the president himself was commending when he was flanked by family members. And later today, he will be joined by Vice President Kamala Harris as they go to the tarmac and they greet these prisoners when they're released over the course of the afternoon, according to the national security adviser, the president will also be making a slew of calls to world leaders to thank them for their help. The president saying earlier today that they really stepped up and it was because of the strength of alliances and partnerships that they were able to get this across the finish line. Because again, Erica, in this entire process, the U.S. had to find people that Russia would take in exchange for these Americans to be released, among others and that required looking across the globe, and it was why some of those conversations were so key with Germany and Slovenia.",

Brett, good to have you with us this hour. As we look at what we've learned, just in the last hour or so, hearing from both the president, hearing from the national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, as we look at how this deal came together and the fact that it really was in the last couple of weeks, according to Jake, that they steadily gained confidence were his words after that call on July 21st with the prime minister of Slovenia, but they were holding their breath and crossing their fingers until this moment actually happened. Just walk us through what those moments would be like in the White House and just how delicate a dance this is.BRETT BRUEN, FORMER U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL, FORMER DIRECTOR OF GLOBAL ENGAGEMENT, OBAMA WHITE HOUSE AND PRESIDENT, GLOBAL SITUATION ROOM:  Well, I think a delicate dance is a good way of describing it because it involves so many intricate steps, and I think the fact that it wasn't just one other country, but you had multiple other countries that had to see it both in their interest, and in some cases, as it sounds like with the president's conversation with the prime minister of Slovenia, they had to be convinced, and this is not an easy thing to do, having been in the room for some of ttose discussions, because what the U.S. administration is asking is essentially go against your own interest on this one, and in the longer run, it will serve your interest. So, I will say, well, you know, Jake Sullivan mentioned that there were no specific favors that were promised. There are certainly a whole lot of IOU stacked up on the desks of, you know, German foreign ministry folks, of the Norwegians, the Slovenians, the Poles.",

And I think we saw that with the tension of Evan after Brittney Griner's detention and then release.And so, I think there, you know, is a slippery slope here.
