The Israeli military is issuing a clear message today that their operation in Gaza is continuing to evolve and intensify. The IDF Chief of Staff telling Israeli commanders to, \"we will enter the Gaza Strip\", and that we don't know when that ground incursion may happen.We're getting more signals that it could happen soon. Starting today, Israel is ramping up its air strike campaign, all while more troops, tanks and vehicles continue to line the Gaza border. Palestinian officials, meanwhile, say the Israeli operation has already killed nearly 4400 people. And aid groups are warning that the humanitarian reality of life in Gaza is only getting bleaker. The first aid convoy allowed into Gaza entered through Egypt's Rafah crossing today. But the crossing only opened for that short period and aid group say the flow of aid into Gaza isn't nearly enough to meet the need as Clarissa Ward reports.",

But officials are saying that they're hopeful that this is the start of something more sustained, more continuous.The U.N. believes in hopes that potentially tomorrow or on Monday that more of their trucks could go through. Today those 20 trucks were Egyptian Red Crescent trucks. They drove through the Rafah border crossing. They unloaded that aid with was food, water, medicine. Palestinian trucks then loaded the aid and drove it through to the Gaza side. Now there's a meeting today of Arab leaders here in Cairo. It's called a conference of peace. President Sisi, the Egyptian President spoke in the last hour or so he said, this is a welcome sign. But it's not enough. We need to build on this and establish a sustained humanitarian corridor. We need a humanitarian ceasefire as well. And beyond that, we need to work on establishing some kind of a peace process a two state solution, so quite a long list of things that need to happen. Right now there seems to be consensus, at least on that first step of trying to establish a more continuous or sustained humanitarian corridor. The hospitals at this stage are barely functioning. The fuel supplies according to one U.N. person who I was speaking to will be out our own depleted in two or three days. So that is a vital resource that is desperately needed, and negotiations ongoing to try to get at least 100 trucks in every single day in what will be the beginning of a continuous corridor. And hopefully eventually also, the establishment as the Israelis had previously mentioned, and also President Biden, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken have some kind of humanitarian zone where some of the 900,000 displaced people inside Gaza could find some refuge and some respite. We are still though a long way from that.",

The IDF says a ground operation is in the offing with the aim of totally eliminating any future threat from Hamas.Earlier I spoke with the IDF International Spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conricus. Just take a listen to what he had to say. LT. COL. JONATHAN CONRICUS, IDF INTERNATIONAL SPOKESPERSON: That is a challenge because we have seen Hamas, tampering with humanitarian goods. We've seen them steal fuel that was intended for civilian purposes, specifically in order to fuel pumps that pump water for the population to drink. But Hamas stole that fuel that could have fueled those pumps for more than six days, which is really essential. So it will be a challenge and we don't have boots on the ground in the area. We will try to use technological measures in order to make sure that there are no weapons.

This wasn't our initiative and not our choice on the 7th of October when Hamas crossed into our borders and butchered civilians, and raped and took hostage. That is what unleashed this unfortunate situation.What we are doing now is simply trying to help ourselves and defend our civilian population. But at the end of the day, we will try to make it as least difficult as possible for the civilian population while making it the most difficult for Hamas and all of those who support Hamas.",

Now, the Egypt peace summit has now ended without any accord or joint statement. Arab leaders had gathered in Cairo on Saturday to try and secure a ceasefire.However, Israeli and Senior U.S. officials weren't present. The Egyptian President criticized the international community for not doing enough to end the violence, calling on them to address the root cause of the problem. He's now renewing calls for a two state solution and encouraging others who attended the summit to do the same. Let's discuss with Francis Ricciardone Former U.S. Ambassador to Turkey, Egypt and Philippines and a Former President of the American University in Cairo. Ambassador, good to have you with us tonight, there was never going to be a statement coming out of this never mind a ceasefire from these negotiations. But there does seem to be a shift particularly from Western leaders that they steal back Israel's right to defend itself. But again, they calibrate that it has to be within the confines of international law. What did you take away from this peace summit? FRANCIS RICCIARDONE, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO TURKEY, EGYPT &amp; PHILIPPINES: Well, you know, at one time, it would have been considered a breakthrough to have the leaders of so many Arab States very explicitly calling for a two state solution. That's nothing new for the Egyptians. Since the Camp David treaty of peace, it has been Egyptian policy and more to the point of American policy, Republican administration, and Democratic administration. Every President since time has called for a two state solution. President Trump, equivocated of it, but didn't disavow that. And we're firmly back on that as the United States position. It's hard. It may prove impossible. But that has been resolute American policy. So the leading voices of the Arab world coming up behind that are, I have to believe that's a positive thing for every claim of Israel for the Palestinians for a way out.",

Despite the rage that eats feels the hurt the victimhood, the rage, the outrage, very understandable.President Biden was, I thought very artful and clear in his stating, he was very sincere and said he has compassion for both sides. But if, on the Palestinian side, there can be a strengthened resolve the Palestinian Authority has signed on to his two state solution many years ago, Hamas has not. In Israel, there's been a large debate about this. Most Israeli governments from the right have not signed on to that. But it would take quite a see change, to see if the Israeli side would sign on two state solution. And then both sides work together to make that happen, but how we get from the current horrible situation to negotiations. I don't see how we do that without de-escalation and a ceasefire as first steps toward the immediate things of return of the hostages and humanitarian relief and then to that end to really deep conversations supported by outside parties, the United States and the rest of the Arab world toward a two state solution.",

And certainly they they've dealt themselves out of any long term solution to the question of Palestine. So I think they're already thoroughly discredited. But they have the guns. They have the power to intimidate those 2 million people that are there. How that would be resolved? I don't know. I can't see how an Israeli invasion will do that, sadly, honestly.",

And as your guest was saying, trying to imagine that from where things stand at the moment is very, very difficult to do. Because at the moment, it seems that things do stand on the verge of an incursion by Israeli troops. We don't know when that's going to be. We haven't seen any perceptible de-munitions of the forces that are around here. Over the past couple of weeks, we've seen a lot of forces moved into the area. We have seen from our own travels around the sort of Israel-Gaza border today that there are still areas full of tanks and full of armored personnel carriers that don't have troops with them yet that are parked up military bases. So there is still heavy military equipment that Israel can bring potentially into the fight. But for all those troops that were sort of rushed forward to be close to the border with Gaza, hard to know, for us, because we don't have access to them, how ready they are for an incursion. But it does seem that Israel still is positioned for it. And so it does feel as if it's relatively imminent at the moment.",

I think that the hostage takers are professional they know what they're doing. Hamas has been doing this has been doing this sort of thing in this part of the world for many, many, many years. They know the leverage that hostages bring, that's why they take them. They didn't accidentally take hostages, they deliberately took hostages. So I think there is definitely space for diplomacy on multiple levels on multiple fronts through multiple vectors and we hope and pray that is the answer. At the same time, we're going to continue to operate to not get in the way of diplomacy to absolutely not get in the way of diplomacy or not getting away if anything.
