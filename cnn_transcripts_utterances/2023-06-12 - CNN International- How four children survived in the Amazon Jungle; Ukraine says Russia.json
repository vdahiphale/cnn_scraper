Former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has died in Milan at the age of 86.

      "sentences": "Yes, really going back to the early 1980s, Max, Berlusconi was somebody who's very much a larger than life figure on the Italian scene. Firstly, in 1980, he began he founded Italy's first private national television station, providing an alternative to the state funded rather stodgy state broadcaster.And starting in 1994, he got into politics, he was elected Prime Minister. This was a man who had no political experience whatsoever in terms of holding any public office, but he went on to be the Italian Prime Minister who held that position the longest since the end of the Second World War. Now, we've been hearing a variety of statements from Italian and international figures commenting on his death. Sergio Mattarella, the Italian President has put out a statement calling Silvio Berlusconi, a great political leader. Now he also Berlusconi had a very warm personal relationship with the President of Russia and for instance, on his 86th birthday, Mr. Berlusconi, received from Vladimir Putin 20 bottles of Russian vodka. The Russian leader has put out a statement today, marking the death of Silvio Berlusconi, in which he says he will be remembered in Russia as a consistent and principled supporter of strengthening friendly relations between our countries. He made a truly invaluable personal contribution to the development of mutually beneficial Russian-Italian partnerships. So he had a very mixed legacy. This was a man who after more than 20 years of dominating politics, when he finally left the position of Prime Minister. He left the country in something of an economic catastrophe. The Italy's debt said I'd written risen to record levels, the Italian economy during his years as Prime Minister did not grow at all. Nonetheless, he was a very popular figure among certain segments of the Italian population, who saw him as an everyman who understood their troubles, even though he in the end wasn't able to do much about them, Max.",

That's because he's planning to give a speech. But let's go through what's going to happen over the next 24 hours or so.So Donald Trump is traveling from New Jersey flying the whole way south to Florida to come to his arraignment. His initial appearance in federal court, the first time he will ever be seen in court, the first time responding to this set of charges this unprecedented 37 count indictment that he willfully knowingly kept classified national security records outside the protection of the U.S. government after he left the presidency. So Trump is going to be in the Miami area. Overnight, he's going to be talking with his lawyers about what to expect in court it could be quite a short hearing. He's also expected to be there with his co- defendant who is accused of trying to obstruct the Justice Department invade investigation with him for moving boxes of classified records around of around Mar-a-Lago so that they couldn't be found by investigators. They both will be appearing in court at about 3 pm tomorrow where they will be hear their charges, and then very, very likely enter these pleads of not guilty. That's quite expected to this phase. And Donald Trump himself has said he will be pleading not guilty tomorrow at that time. But one of the big questions going forward is what happens after that? How long will things take that's going to be in the hands of a federal judge Aileen Cannon appointed in this district for a lifetime appointment? Here's what special counsel Jack Smith, the man that's overseeing this prosecution for the Justice Department had said about the case going forward when he spoke publicly on Friday.

But this case could get complicated. The judge could want to slow things down.And also it's about classified information. So that takes some time in court as well. And so there are a lot of questions right now on how far into the presidential campaign period this is going to go. Could this case go the whole way into 2024 where voters are making decisions, including about Donald Trump headed to trial, Max.",

This was not completely out of the blue as you mentioned, her husband was arrested, questioned, released.The party treasurer same thing or home was searched in April. The party headquarters was searched as well all because of this probe. This police investigation into the party finances and specifically 660,000 pounds more than 800,000 U.S. dollars that was earmarked for Scottish independence campaigning. So Sturgeon yesterday was arrested. She was held in question for more than seven hours and then released without charge pending further investigation. And we've now heard from Sturgeon herself who put out a statement saying in part, to find myself in the situation I did today when I'm certain I have committed no offense is both a shock and deeply distressing. Innocence is not just a presumption I am entitled to in law. I know beyond doubt that I am in fact innocent of any wrongdoing. Now, there are some in her party who are suggesting that she ought to resign her party membership at least temporarily. She though says that she will continue to stay on as a member of the Scottish Parliament. Her resignation in February also came as quite a shock to British politics because it came so out of the blue and especially given that in January, you had her being asked about the resignation of the New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern. And Sturgeon was insisting, look, I have plenty left in the tank and then she said this, watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NICOLA STURGEON, SCOTLAND'S FORMER FIRST MINISTER: Just 20 in the tank at the moment, if I ever don't mean just on a single day, everybody wakes up some days and thinks they don't have enough in the tank. But if I ever reached the point, but she has clearly reached I think overall I just can't give the job. Everything it deserves then I hope I have the same courage she's had insane.

Why we didn't find them. One reason is the jungle is very, very complicated. The trees are very close, it's very dense.

Charming and with a flippant sense of humor, Berlusconi's off the cuff remarks and missteps with protocol were often criticized. He welcomed the newly elected U.S. President in 2008 by complimenting Barack Obama on his quote \"suntan\", a left German Chancellor Angela Merkel waiting during a NATO summit. And his close friendship with Vladimir Putin got him in hot water after he disclosed he had reestablished his friendship with the Russian President in late 2022 after Putin sent him 20 bottles of Russian vodka for his birthday. He later blamed Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for starting a war, putting him at odds with Meloni. The Prime Minister often surrounded himself with beautiful women.
