The focus of Israel's war in Gaza has become al Shifa hospital and Israel has long said that Hamas uses that hospital to cover up what it says is an extensive terror network underground. It's something Hamas and hospital officials deny but clearly Israel believes it is building its case with the exposure of what it says is a tunnel shaft on the hospital's grounds. CNN's Oren Liebermann entered Gaza with the Israeli Defense Forces Saturday night to see the tunnel shaft and what lies beneath. CNN reported from Gaza under IDF escort at all times. And as a condition for journalists who join that embed, media outlets have to submit footage filmed in Gaza to the Israeli military for its review. I'll let you watch. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

We offload at the al-Shifa hospital, pick our way along even center street (ph) nor what's left. We have to keep our lights off most of the time or risk exposing our position. CNN reported from Gaza under Israel Defense Forces escort at all times. As a condition for journalists who join this embed with IDF, media outlets must submit footage filmed in Gaza to the Israeli military censors for review. Now at the hospital compound, we wait inside a structure to make sure the area is secure before moving the short distance to the exposed tunnel shaft. And here is the entrance. You can see what looks like a ladder accessing to it. And as I step over here, it's very difficult to see how far down it goes. But it looks like there's almost a central shaft or a staircase, and then the shaft disappears then down into the darkness. We move around the opening for a better look at the shaft itself. It's clear from here that this is meant to go deep underground. Which direction does the tunnel go? MAJ.

They then say they had intelligence that she was taken to Shifa hospital and murdered by Hamas there. We had been previously told that she had been murdered by Hamas but these are more detailed about that. Now, what we don't know is how or whom carried out the independent pathological investigation or what that intelligence is. But the IDF says they now have this intelligence. Her body was brought out of Gaza only several days ago. Then the IDF says they also have video that shows that a Nepali hostage and a Thai hostage from Israel were taken through the hospital as well. And the reason they were working in southern Israel at the time as many Nepalis and Thais come as essentially migrant farmworkers and some were taken as hostage. So we're learning more, at least according to what the IDF says, about how Shifa hospital was used in the days after the October 7th attack.",

All right. Priscilla Alvarez for us in Wilmington, Delaware following the president today. Thanks so much. And I want to bring in CNN global affairs analyst Kim Dozier, also CNN military analyst Retired Major General James \"Spider\" Marks and former CIA operative Bob Baer. With all of you here, I think we've got a lot of these angles covered. General, I want to talk first with you. Let's go back to this new IDF video that Oren Liebermann was just showing us a few minutes. Israel says it shows this Hamas tunnel at the al Shifa Hospital. What do you make of that and what you're seeing as you're watching that? MAJ. GEN. JAMES \"SPIDER\" MARKS, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: We shouldn't be surprised that there's been the discovery of this tunnel access. The fact that it is on the al Shifa Hospital grounds, I think that's what's most significant. And clearly the IDF has some additional work to do to see where it's connected and where it leads. Clearly, it's part of that larger labyrinth of tunnels that exists. And I think what's really important is that at this stage of the military operation, this becomes an incredibly precise and very slow methodical operation on the part of the IDF. The pressure, however, is from the international community to show evidence. And so there will be this clamoring of immediate identification of what type of access that Hamas has had to these tunnels. What have they been using with these tunnels. And I think in many cases that's simply additional information. The fact of the matter is, they've got this tunnel complex and they used this thing quite aggressively in order to facilitate their movement so that they can then pop up, conduct operations, get back down in these tunnels into some level of sanctuary. So I think the IDF understands the pressure from the international community. They've got to respond, but we have to be able to understand that this is an operation that's going to take some time.",

What they're also doing is going into these tunnels with robot drones and other means that keep soldiers out of harm's way, and they're also examining all of the go-pro video evidence that either got uploaded by the Hamas terrorists themselves or taken off the bodies of the Hamas fighters that they were able to capture. All of that is being analyzed to get the names of the operatives and to figure out who to track down. In some cases Israeli military officials tell me they know where these people are, but they're so embedded in the population including in southern Gaza, that that's why it has to go so slowly.",

So I think we're -- but I'd like to say one thing. Don't forget vis-a- vis the hospitals, that Hamas owns Gaza Strip. You don't go into these hospitals, you don't leave them without somehow getting the permission of Hamas. They're everywhere. So this is what the problem for the Israelis are. They've got so many targets to hit. They can use algorithms, they can use drones. But at the end of the day it's a popular insurgency, a guerilla war.",

Several other Protestant denominations have gone through similar splits for the same reasons. What happened this weekend was that the North Georgia Conference of the United Methodist Church met on Saturday to vote on whether to accept the decision of hundreds of its churches to leave the denomination. And in the end, Jessica, the conference voted in favor of allowing 261 churches to leave the denomination, among the main points of contention are the role of LGBTQ clergy, and same-sex marriage. The official plans to break away, as you mentioned before, started in 2019, after the National United Methodist Church made a decision to allow those congregations to leave by December 31st of this year. The 261 congregations who want to leave represent more than a third of the nearly 700 churches that are under the north Georgia conference of the UNC. After the vote, but the leadership and the lay members of the denomination expressed deep sadness. Let's take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BISHOP ROBIN DEASE, NORTH GEORGIA CONFERENCE LEADER/UNITED METHODIST CHURCH: I realize how sad this time is, for so many, including myself. I just hate that those who are leaving us, will not have the opportunity to meet or be with. May God's peace be with you. BOB DIXON, LAY MEMBER, NORTH GEORGIA CONFERENCE LEADER/UNITED METHODIST CHURCH: The ones that hurt the most are the ones in the crosshairs. People that are workers in the church are not necessarily trying to win an argument. These folks, they feel like they lost their identity. They lost their identity of the United Methodist Church, and it feels helpless. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We do believe it came together kind of last minute, this wasn't on his schedule originally, and this is a boon for the former president.Abbott and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis are seen as close, but you have communicated, both of them have been involved in shipping migrants from their states up into the blue states, as part of their efforts to raise awareness to immigration. So it is a win for former President Donald Trump, in that sense. However this also comes as we have learned so much more about Trump's proposal for a 2025 agenda, particularly when it comes to immigration. As you noted, his rhetoric has been ramped up, anti-immigrant, and we also learned about what he plans to do if you look winds in other term in office, and that includes mass deportation and detentions. His plan would essentially call for building detention camps, for migrants who are rounded up around the country to be held at until they are deported. This is an extreme escalation from what we saw in 2016. That's something that he's clearly doubling down on. Even today, he mentioned the border, talking about how Biden has created a situation where we have won the most unsecure borders in the world. This is something that they believe is going to help him win in a 2024 general election, against Joe Biden. And you just have to see how that plays out. But again, today, a win for Donald Trump with this endorsement, and coming at a time where we just really trying to piece together what it will look like if he wins in another term.",
