REP. MARIA ELVIRA SALAZAR (R-FL): It's both parties that need to educate themselves and understand what is it that we need. It's the Democrats that need to understand that, first, for the first time, they have agreed that the border needs to be secured. And it's for the Republicans to understand that we have to secure the border. We passed H.R.-2, which is very strong border security measures, but at the same time, we need to then understand what are we going to do with those people who have been here illegally for years and do not have a criminal record.

Number two, only 5 percent of the military budget is dedicated to Ukraine. And, number three, if we abandon Ukraine, we know that the war is going to be a lot bigger, and a lot wider than just the Ukrainian territory. It could touch NATO. It could touch Poland. We know that there is no accountability for Mr. Putin. So it's time to stop him, without shedding American blood. So, yes, we have to support Ukraine.

That's sent alarm bells to Washington and Wall Street because it meant higher gas prices and higher inflation. But look, as you can see on that chart, things have completely reversed. We've seen U.S. oil prices drop below $83 a barrel. It's been quite the 180. And this does mean good things for gas prices. We've seen gas prices start to move lower. The national average dropped by two pennies today, $3.77 a gallon, down seven cents over the last week. And a veteran oil analyst tells me this is just getting started. He thinks by Halloween, we could see the national average fall as low as $3.25 a gallon. That would be huge. I do want to caution this is just a forecast. There could always be a disruption or an OPEC move that messes with the forecast like this. Still, Pamela, it does feel like, for the first time in a long time, drivers are getting real relief on the gas pump and more should be on the way.",

A group of doctors wanted to see if the risk really was higher with these drugs than with older weight-loss drugs.So they looked at medical records for people using these drugs known as GLP-1, which is a liraglutides in Ozempic and Wegovy and using those specifically for weight loss and not diabetes. And also an older version of medicines in this class. And compared them with a weight-loss drug that works in a different way. They found that, indeed, there is a higher risk for some of these issues. Pancreatitis, a nine times higher risk. Inflammation of the pancreatic. Bowel obstruction, and gastroparesis, which is a stomach paralysis, about a four times higher risk for those. It's important to note though that still the risk was rare, about 1 percent or less that they saw in the records. Still as millions of people are starting to take these medicines, doctors say it's important to pay attention to the potential risks, particularly when using them for weight loss and not diabetes, for the risk-benefits, decisions might be a little different.",
