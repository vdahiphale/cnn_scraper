Voters on Tuesday rejected a Republican-backed measure that would have made it harder to amend the state's constitution. Now this comes ahead of a November ballot in which voters will decide whether to enshrine abortion rights in the state's constitution. With nearly 90 percent of the votes counted, 56 percent of the people have voted no while 44 percent said yes.Tuesday was the first of a two-step process to determine whether November's (INAUDIBLE) a simple majority. CNN's Jeff Zeleny breaks it all down for us. JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Ohio voters roundly rejected efforts to make it more difficult to amend the state's constitution in the nation's latest fight over the abortion battle. A special election called in Ohio to raise the threshold to amend the state's constitution with the November ballot in mind when there will be a question about enshrining abortion rights protection was defeated. The vote no side of the equation, defeated the vote yes side. This was all on measure called Issue One. It would have required a 60 percent supermajority to change the state's constitution. Again, this would affect abortion and other matters. But it certainly was in one year after the Supreme Court overturned Roe versus Wade. This is the latest example that we've seen across the country of support for abortion rights winning out. Now this is the beginning of the campaign and supporters made that clear in Columbus, Ohio -- (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It encompasses nearly 1 million acres surrounding the Grand Canyon and much of this land is sacred to the tribal communities who live in this region. Part of what this national monument will do is it will protect this land from any potential uranium mining. That is something that tribal leaders and environmental groups had pushed for for quite some time. And the president officially making this a national monument, as he signed that designation here on Tuesday. Now, the president also used this trip as a chance to highlight his climate agenda, warning against what he described as MAGA extremists in Congress who are trying to undo some of his initiatives. But the president made the case for the role that the U.S. can play when it comes to the issue of climate change. JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  Well, there's a lot of good that's going to come from the sacrifices we're dealing with taken on the climate crisis. Folks, these are investments in our planet, our people and America itself. Protecting our outdoor treasures, making our nation more resilient. But some MAGA extremists in Congress are trying to undo it all. I didn't get help from the guys on the other team. Every single solitary person voted against this historic clean energy investment. And now, many of them are trying again to repeal these parts of the bill, but we won't let them. There is too much at stake.",
