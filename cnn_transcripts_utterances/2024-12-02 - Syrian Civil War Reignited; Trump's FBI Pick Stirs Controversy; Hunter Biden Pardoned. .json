It is a decision we are told that was made over the weekend as the president was spending the Thanksgiving holidays with his family in Nantucket. Officials are stressing that this wasn't a decision that the president made lightly, that he really wrestled with the decision, going back and forth before landing on the decision to eventually pardon his son. Of course, the White House is getting a ton of questions about this reversal, including White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre as she was on her way to Angola, where the president will be spending a couple of days, reporters asking her to explain why the president decided to do a sudden 180. And she made clear, notably, that this actually did in part have to do with the results of the election in November. Take a listen. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)",

Meantime, the president-elect has announced plans to tap Kash Patel as his new FBI director.

One was the Missouri attorney general, Andrew Bailey, as well as Kash Patel. Now, staunch loyalists to Donald Trump, as well as his family, were pushing Kash Patel, but obviously Patel is incredibly controversial, as you noted. Now, it came down to the fact that they were having these different interviews with these various candidates, and Donald Trump just wasn't that impressed by Bailey. That's what multiple sources told us, that he wanted to go with someone who was a firebrand, a bomb thrower, like Kash Patel. Now, obviously, again, this is incredibly controversial and is going to set up a fight when it comes to Congress because of the fact that Patel has no real experience with the FBI. He's not a former agent. That's generally a role that goes to a former agent. The other part of this is the fact that he has essentially said that he would go along with whatever it is that Donald Trump wants to do, including gutting the entire FBI. And there's a lot of questions as to what exactly that would look like. Now, I do also want to point out one thing, one other thing, because this is something that's going on right now. We have just seen reporting in \"The New Yorker\" about another one of Donald Trump's controversial picks who is currently up on Capitol Hill, Pete Hegseth, who has been nominated to be secretary of defense. In this reporting which was done through a whistle-blower account that was given to \"The New Yorker,\" it says that Hegseth was forced out of two roles in which he ran veterans groups because of misconduct. And one of these whistle-blower reports, it says that he sexually pursued female staffers. It also says that he had -- was repeatedly intoxicated during his time as a leader of these organizations. The reason I'm pointing that out is because we obviously know that Donald Trump's team had been on edge when it came to Hegseth because of that 2017 sexual assault allegation that they were unaware of. How this plays into that is something we're going to be watching closely as we were told that Donald Trump's team also told Hegseth pretty directly they didn't want any more surprises. Unclear if this is a surprise. One thing to note, when it comes to allegations of intoxication, there was another letter here that was obtained by \"The New Yorker\" that says that he was passing out, that his behavior was despicable. One thing that we know about the president-elect, because of his brother's relationship with alcohol abuse, it is not something that he tolerates from the people around him, obviously something to watch closely.",

So he had no easy choices here. But, nevertheless, choosing to issue this pardon for whatever reasons he did after so many times saying he would not is a really bad look for him. And I think it's potentially a destructive thing for his party. I think it creates the appearance of hypocrisy. And I think it will -- it could go to supporting what I think are misguided opinions, but, nevertheless, people's opinions that the system is somehow stacked in favor of Democrats against Republicans.

Then, a carefully negotiated plea deal agreed to by the Department of Justice unraveled in the courtroom with a number of my political opponents in Congress taking credit for bringing political pressure on the process. Had the plea deal held, it would have been a fair, reasonable resolution of Hunter's cases.\" Part of the reason it fell apart, though, had to do with the disagreement between Hunter's attorneys and the judge over whether other potential charges against Hunter could be processed in the future, right?

However, there are reasonable arguments that could be made to say that Hunter Biden was treated differently than other people who were engaged in similar criminal conduct and who would likely have not been prosecuted to this extent of the law. Hunter Biden endured a, what, five-year investigation, in which these are the only charges that came out of it. So I think this narrative that he was a subject of some sort of unfair persecution, there is some facts to back that up. It's clear that the president believes that's what's going on here and that most of it was generated -- targeted towards Hunter because of President Biden's role in the White House.",

CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Well, that's a really great question. And there are so many different things that actually have happened in this whole thing. But, first of all, they have -- when you look at Syria in general, you see all these different rebel groups right here. So we have basically had a static map for the last about 10 years or so. But there have been actions that have been going on with all of these different groups, and especially this group right here, this area right in this green area. This part, these Syrian rebels have been very active in the Idlib province area and now in the Aleppo area. And that has made a difference, because now, even though there have been instances every day for the last 10 years or so, now we have actually seen momentum because all the different elements that are supporting the Syrian regime are now weakened.",

And since that point, it has been largely a state of no peace, no war. But as you heard Colonel Leighton sort of lay out there for you, essentially, the backers of al-Assad in the form of Russia, in the form of Hezbollah, in the form of Iran have been distracted by other battles. And so the rebels really saw this as a moment to exploit the vacuum and try to make another push. Within a matter of days, they are now in complete control of Idlib province. They are in control of the city of Aleppo, Syria's second largest city, the center historically of its commerce. They are making pushes in the northern Aleppo countryside. And most recently now, they have been issuing warnings to people who live in Hama, the central city, the fourth largest city in Syria, that they should avoid any space or place near members of the regime, giving an indication that they are preparing for an offensive there as well.

And I do think it's important as well to just highlight that, beyond the sort of fighting forces, you have half the population of Syria who were displaced from their homes during the worst of this fighting. You have true atrocities that were carried out by the regime of Bashar al-Assad, using poisonous gas against his own people, using nerve agents like sarin gas against his own people. So this is a war that has been absolutely devastating to the ordinary people of Syria. And yet there are very real concerns as well about who these rebels are, what their end goals are, and how much unity really exists between them ultimately, because, again, as you heard from Colonel Leighton there, a lot of different cooks in the kitchen, a lot of different backers with competing agendas.
