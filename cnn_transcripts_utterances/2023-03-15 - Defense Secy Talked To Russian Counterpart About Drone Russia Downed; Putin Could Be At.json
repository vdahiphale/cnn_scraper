It remains unclear at this point whether they are actually going to try because as you mentioned, Victor, this drone is in about 4,000 to 5,000 feet of water in the Black Sea. It's going to be very difficult for anyone to retrieve, let alone the U.S. because the U.S. does not actually have any Navy assets in the Black Sea right now. However, they did leave open the possibility that they could call on allies in the region to try to recover it. What they have said is that the Russians, what the Russians have said is that they will likely try to recover it, but the U.S. ensuring that they have taken steps to mitigate any potential intelligence value of that drone so that anything sensitive does not fall into Russian hands. And we are told that the U.S. actually did wipe all of the sensitive software off of that drone as it kind of plummeted into the Black Sea. Victor, Bianna?",

And so right, if you've gone all the way up to the act, if you clip it, because you're flying too close, the intention was there to get close and do that harassment.
