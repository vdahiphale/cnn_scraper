And this is exactly what we've been seeing, not just here in the northeast but in other parts of the country. In fact FlightAware reporting some 25,000 delays, flight delays. That's today alone.Nearly 2400 flight cancellations according to FlightAware. You look at sort of the greater picture here throughout the country. Dallas Fort Worth being hit particularly hard. We know they have been dealing with some weather of their own as well. Here in New York City, JFK is really the only airport that is currently affected with a ground stop in place for at least another 15 minutes. The FAA reporting there's about a 30 percent to 60 percent chance that they may have to actually extend that. I could tell you, though, here in Manhattan nothing beyond a drizzle. So the conditions there, that storm that was setting its sights on the northeast with the potential for it to go out to sea then that is likely going to result at least an improvement in the situation there but obviously getting those flights off the ground, creating a backlog effect. So it's going to be some time before not only JFK, LaGuardia, Newark also reporting some travel trouble gets back online. So certainly for folks who are going to be spending today, on this Sunday, traveling, especially in and out of the northeast, important to check with your airline before you head to the airport -- Fred.",

A little bit into the Central Valley of California, may come down a couple of degrees but it's still going to remain above average, but what I'm really concerned about is Phoenix.We've talked a lot about this record so far of the number days above 110 degrees. And that's basically happening right now. You know, Sunday will be the 17th consecutive day. And tomorrow is going to tie the record, 18 days in a row where it's been 110 degrees or more. And the longevity of these heat waves is where we really get concerned. And I'm almost afraid to show you the seven-day forecast for Phoenix because it's only getting worse. Every day is not only above 110, it's over 115, 117, almost every single day. We're probably going to set records, daily records of heat in Phoenix today, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and probably even beyond. Look at these low temperatures. That's really where heat waves get dangerous. Low temperatures of 94 and 95 degrees. It hasn't dropped below 90 degrees in Phoenix since last Sunday. And we're going to go another entire week without doing so. That shatters records for the length of time. And again, the body can't cool off at night, buildings can't cool off at night. You start to get infrastructure problems. This is where heat waves really turn dangerous. I know you're used to heat in Arizona. Not this type of heat because it hasn't happened before. Las Vegas is also looking at a similar trend, breaking records for the number of days at these extreme levels of heat and low temperatures that just won't cool off -- Fredricka.",

But what I was told before I left is that the doctor may have nicked her bladder and they will go in and repair it. And at most it would take to 10 minutes, right?And so since we've been there for so long, with this little one, I left and I carried so much guilt for years after that, because I was like if I had known, if I had been able to rely on what they told me, but all of what they told me was not true, she was internally bleeding. And when Charles has said when they went in, Fred, there were three and a half liters of blood. She was excited to on a good day. I mean, and she was in great health.",

But I did not know, seven years ago that this was not just you need to Kira. I knew that something was wrong. They didn't respond to her. There was a basis for a lawsuit. You know, I'm a mom, I'm a grandma and also a lawyer. So I had all of these things kind of coming together. But what I will tell you is that this is outrageous. And the numbers that we're seeing, don't paint the full picture. Because every hospital is not required to report all of these statistics. I could not be happier now, that's not quite the right word that the federal government has stepped in. But the real question is, is why is it taken seven years?",
