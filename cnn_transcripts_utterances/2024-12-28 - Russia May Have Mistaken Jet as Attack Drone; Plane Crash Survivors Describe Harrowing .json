Some of them are saying that they heard a loud bang and felt an explosion moments before that plane crashed on Azerbaijani soil. In fact, that man that we just heard from, the man who was praying on that plane, also said that he saw part of the plane's fuselage shell. That's the plane's main body, partially damaged. In fact, Kim, if you take a look at this video, you can actually see there are visible holes in the plane's body. Now we don't actually know what caused these holes or what caused the actual crash. But according to one of our aviation experts, Miles O'Brien, the fact that the metal around these holes is bent inwards and not outwards shows that there could have been, quote, \"an explosion in proximity to the tail of that aircraft.\" And Kim, this could all lend further weight to a growing theory about Russia's potential involvement. We've heard from a U.S. official, an Azerbaijani lawmaker and several aviation and military experts, all suggesting that Russia could have misidentified that passenger jet as a Ukrainian drone and shot it down. In fact, on Friday, Russia, for the first time ever, said that the plane was directed to another destination because of Ukrainian drones in that area as well as fog. And as you mentioned, Azerbaijan Airlines also said as a result of their initial investigation, they believe the plane crashed after experiencing, quote, \"physical and technical external interference.\" So while this theory remains unconfirmed, Kim, it is gaining a lot more traction.",

Hanako Montgomery in Tokyo, thanks so much.Donald Trump is urging the U.S. Supreme Court to pause a controversial TikTok ban, set to take effect just one day before his inauguration. The president-elect now says he wants a negotiation. CNN's Alayna Treene has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ALAYNA TREENE, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, president-elect Donald Trump on Friday urged the Supreme Court to put a pause on a controversial ban on TikTok, arguing that a delay in implementation would allow his incoming administration to try and negotiate some sort of deal that would save the app. Now all of this relates back to a ban that Congress approved earlier this year and Biden signed into law, really arguing and requiring that the platform be sold to a new non-Chinese owner or be banned in the United States. That ban is currently slated to take effect on January 19th, just one day before Donald Trump is sworn in to office. Now what Donald Trump is urging the Supreme Court to do puts him at odds with the Biden administration, which filed its own briefing on Friday, urging the Supreme Court to move forward with the ban. And they warned of grave national security concerns if it is not implemented. Now one thing to be clear on is that Donald Trump, in his briefing, did not really address the underlying First Amendment questions. But he did urge the court to put this pause on the ban so that his administration can try to find some way to resolve the issue. This is what he said in the briefing, quote, \"President-elect Trump urges the court to stay the statute's effective date to allow his incoming administration to pursue a negotiated resolution that could prevent a nationwide shutdown of TikTok, thus preserving the First Amendment rights of tens of millions of Americans. \"While also addressing the government's national security concerns.\" Now one thing to be clear on is that TikTok is very popular in the United States. It has 170 million monthly users in the U.S. And Trump, for his part, has wavered on the issue. Back during his first administration, he actually signed an executive order that would have effectively put a ban on TikTok, also arguing of its national security concerns, given China's influence over the social media platform. However, throughout his time on the campaign trail in 2024, as well as just a couple of weeks ago, Donald Trump said that he is warming to TikTok. And he argued that part of his stance on that is because so many young voters who voted for him use the app. Now all to say it is very unclear what is going to happen. But Donald Trump's argument is that he wants a pause on this ban so that his administration can figure out how they want to resolve this -- Alayna Treene, CNN, West Palm Beach, Florida.

So just a fascinating article. With Trump's election, many on the Left have talked about sort of doom and gloom scenarios, where Trump essentially remakes America. You argue basically they should they should chill out, at least about that fear, specifically, because his style of authoritarianism is based on something you call gorilla channel governance, a term I love there. So briefly explain what you mean by that. SAMANTHA HANCOX-LI, WRITER AND ASSOCIATE EDITOR, \"LIBERAL CURRENTS\": Yes. So gorilla channel governance is a concept based on an old joke that Trump's staffers were distracting him with a fake TV channel that showed gorillas fighting all the time. And the concept of gorilla channel governance is basically that Trump is an old man. He is tired. He's distractible and he's clearly responding to what he sees on the television. His nomination for Secretary of Defense, Pete Hegseth, his primary qualification appears to being to be appearing on \"FOX and Friends.\" He's nominated Dr. Oz, a TV doctor for Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  administrator.

So the concept here coming out of political science is the concept of personalist authoritarian government. And in a personalist system, the big boss creates a lot of different lieutenants who have conflicting and overlapping mandates. And this inherently creates conflict within their own government effectively. And that's the point. The point is to be able to play Elon Musk off against someone else inside of his administration, because DOGE has this enormous mandate to cut government spending anywhere. And that conflict between Elon and whoever can only be resolved by Trump. And then, of course, DOGE itself is theoretically going to be headed by also Vivek Ramaswamy. So these two co-equal heads, which creates further ambiguity and unclarity  and conflict, which again leads back to Trump's personal ability to settle these disputes in his own administration.",

Netanyahu asked that his trial be postponed due to the wars with Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza but to no avail.
