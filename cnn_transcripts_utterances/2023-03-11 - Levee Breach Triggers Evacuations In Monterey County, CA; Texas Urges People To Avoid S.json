I'm Jim Acosta in New York.Much of California is under a state of emergency this afternoon, and mandatory evacuations are under way in parts of Monterey County on the central coast. A short time ago we received this drone video of a levee that failed this morning. As you can see, the waters rushed through the breach and into a nearby neighborhood. The floodwaters have washed away roads and bridges and cut off some communities in the area. This is new video we also have coming in from Springville where many have lost their homes and belongings in that area. California is reeling from its tenth atmospheric river of the winter in the central and northern parts of the state. It's dumping huge amounts of rain and snow on the ground that is already saturated. CNN's Mike Valerio joins us form Monterey County. Mike, you spoke to a county supervisor a short time ago there in Pajaro, what have you learned?",

And the people who are in those shelters have been taken from neighborhoods all around us, Jim, taken to higher ground.So we asked the supervisor how many people are we talking about. He said around 100 in a church in Salinas about a few miles south of us, John Steinbeck country we're talking about. And then multiple magnitudes of hundreds, he said, at the county fairgrounds here in Monterey County. And Jim, as you mentioned at the top of the show, this is all happening, this whole tableau, because of the failure of this levee -- those dramatic new drone pictures that we have into the NEWSROOM right here just showing you everything that is happening, the cause and effect here. Around midnight, water overtook the levee that had been redesigned for the Pajaro River about two decades ago, they had huge flooding and they needed to solve this problem for this kind of desperate region that had a history of flooding. And then today we fast forward and see all of the damage so far. Now, listen to the supervisor talk about the situation in his own words, just listen to what he told us. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LUIS A. ALEJO, MONTEREY COUNTY SUPERVISOR: Today is the worst case scenario for this community of Pajaro, a community that is heavily Latino, low-income families, farm workers. We worked so hard to try to prioritize this community and avoid flooding. The last time we had major flooding was 28 years ago in this community. And we know that these are the folks who could least afford this type of hardship on their jobs, on their businesses, on their homes. This is very costly. They know from the last time that recovering from flooding like this takes a long time. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Jim it's going to take two months for those fields to recover because if a flood happens in this part of California, those berry fields upon which people rely here have to remain fallow for two months. So that could mean people out of work. Then we fast forward to Tuesday and Wednesday, Jim, when we get the 11th atmospheric river of this system with more water likely headed all around us with that levee still in bad shape, Jim.",

Mexican authorities say 80 members of law enforcement agencies there are investigating, actively looking for these women. And back to the latest on the kidnapped Americans, Jim, CNN has obtained and geolocated new video showing all four of them just hours before they were attacked.

That's what Joseph Woodman, the company's founder, told us. He said that the reason has to do largely because there are no internationally accredited medical centers or specialty clinics there or in the immediate region, as was the case in larger Mexican cities like Cancun and Tijuana. How much can Americans save by traveling to Mexico? Woodman told us that on average anywhere from had 40 percent to 60 percent.

And joining me now to talk about this is Democratic Congresswoman from California and former member of the January 6th select committee, Zoe Lofgren. Congresswoman, great to see you again. Thanks so much for being with us. You know, this past week, I know you know this, Fox's Tucker Carlson began to air his own handpicked excerpts from the thousands of hours of footage that was given to him by the house speaker, Kevin McCarthy from January 6th. Have you had a chance to review what was aired on Fox or get a sense of what they aired? And what's your response? REP. ZOE LOFGREN (D-CA): Well, some of that, of course, I read the police chief's comments. Obviously they're trying to gaslight the American public. I mean, what happened was pretty obvious. The January 6th committee was able to show a lot of video of a mob attacking the police and breaking into the Capitol. And there's no way to say that didn't happen. The committee made, you know, hundreds of pages of information available, the transcripts of witness testimony, video of, you know, the disorder, and to take -- yes, we could have shown you empty hallways in the Rayburn Building, and you know, what would that have shown? People were sheltering in place. As the chief said, you know, officers were trying to dissuade some of the rioters and trying to talk them into leaving the building. The officers were vastly outnumbered by the mob. So you know, I don't know why Carlson is doing this, but what he's saying is not true. And I think it's really a shame that the speaker has allowed this narrative to go forward. It's a disservice to the country and to the truth.",

Here, these payments happened six and a half years ago.But the thing is, New York prosecutors are going to be OK on that count because there's a law in New York State that says, if somebody has been continuously residing outside of New York State, you put that clock on hold. So they're well within the statute of limitations. Jim, the amount of time that has passed here is going to make this prosecution more difficult for the prosecutors because it's harder to stand in front of a jury and argue about something that happened that long ago and make them believe that it's serious and urgent. To an extent, the amount of time that's passed is going to make this a tougher job for prosecutors.",

That said, I think it's important, I think, the Manhattan D.A. would be well advised to consider the fed's logic. Look, the feds, when they looked at the cases, the Southern District of New York, they believed that the evidence was sufficient to charge but not overwhelming. And the Southern District of New York was wary about the political factors. They were wary about the fact that this felt, A, old, and, B, fairly low on the list of Trump's misconduct.

On the other hand, the reality is, like it or not, Michael Cohen is going to be vulnerable to a searing cross-examination. He has been convicted of perjury. He has been convicted of tax fraud and financial fraud. He denies that he did it, but he pled guilty to those crimes. Michael Cohen also, as you said, Jim, the man has a white-hot hatred for Donald Trump. He cannot open his mouth without saying something negative about Donald Trump. That's his right. But on cross-examination, they're going to argue to a jury, this guy absolutely despises Donald Trump, he'd do anything to get him. And that's going to undermine his credibility.

And you see, when you cross the threshold from the towns outside and the reality, the brutal, bleak reality of the outside world, when you cross the threshold into these schools, you get to see that extraordinary and beautiful thing that happens when children get to be children. You get to see them laughing and running and playing, all the things that we associate with the incredible beauty of childhood. And to see them learning. And to hear a word repeated again and again and again, which is so rare when you are talking about active war zones, talking about active conflict, and that word is \"pride.\" And these kids talk about being proud to be able to be in school and being proud to learn, being proud of things they've learned and the knowledge that they're on-boarding. It's really incredible. And it just makes what's happening on the other side of the wall that much more sort of impossible to digest on - certainly, on an intellectual level, but on an emotional level and spiritual level.

So what do you do? How do you appeal to folks over there? I was very heartened to see a small, albeit loud bipartisan group get together and try to do some work around the War Powers Act with Syria. I would love nothing more than to see some follow through on that regarding what's happening in Yemen. But more importantly, what you have to understand is this is a situation that continues to degrade, right? It's not getting better. Children aren't turning a corner and - and then getting the help that they need. And at the same time, American aid is also degrading. Secretary Blinken announced a couple of weeks ago, you know, in this big press conference, oh, we're going to be giving $440 million-something to the United Nations fund for Yemen. That's a 25 percent reduction from what they gave last year. That wasn't mentioned in his press conference. I don't know how you can square that circle. You know, I don't understand a world in which we - we're saying we're going to help by doing less. That doesn't make sense to me. And it certainly doesn't make sense to the parents of these children, who are starving to death in this country, where, again, we have a moral, ethical responsibility because we have been involved in the conflict. And you know, I think that the reality is, as a - being blessed as a member of my society, living in the country that I live in, with all of the incredible gifts that it provides me, the responsibility that I have to pay back those gifts is - I don't get to use ignorance as an excuse.",
