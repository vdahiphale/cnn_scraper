He could be a partner to us right now in making sure that there are fewer rail disasters in the future. As I mentioned earlier, the rail -- the freight rail industry has wielded a lot of power here in Washington. I would love to see Leader McConnell join us in standing up to them. There are specific things that could be done right now. He is a Senate leader. He could work with us to do things like raise the cap on the fines. Right now, major safety violation that our department discovers, the most we can fine a multibillion-dollar railroad company is in the six figures. He could work with us right now to accelerate the timeline for bringing in tank cars, fortified tank cars that are less likely to spill when there's a derailment.

This is a government aircraft that is assigned to the FAA. Usually when we use it it's because for me to travel with staff turns out to be cheaper than buying all of those airline tickets. Occasionally it's because of a security or logistical issue. But the number one reason we would use that agency aircraft is that is actually works out to be less expensive for taxpayers than the commercial airline tickets would be.

He described cleaning up the morning after at the dog kennels, making a vow to his nephew Paul who had been killed, that he would find the killers. When asked if that happened, he said no, that he believed that they were still out there. But they also presented a pathologist and a crime scene expert on the stand, and that crime scene expert went into talking about the weapons that were used, what the lay of the land was like, and how the shooting had to have occurred to once again introduce what's kind of been known as now the defense's two-shooter theory.

That's next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [08:13:25] COLLINS:  New CNN reporting this morning on why the Department of Energy has shifted its assessment on the possible origins of the coronavirus pandemic as the department now believes with low confidence that the virus originated with a lab leak. Three sources tell CNN that was based in part on information about the research that was being conducted at the Wuhan lab, which was studying a coronavirus variant around the time of the outbreak. But this only deepens the divide among U.S. intelligence agencies over the virus' origins, with the Department of Energy and the FBI saying that it likely came from a lab, while the national intelligence council and four other unidentified agencies did not update their assessment that the virus was the result of a natural exposure. The CIA, we should note, is still undecided. The former director of the CDC, Dr. Bob Redfield, said that he believed that this was the case, that it was because of a lab leak, nearly two years ago.

And let's be realistic about this, we have learned a lot about this virus. And so, we know that in order to have high numbers of hospitalizations, the virus had to be circulating in the community for long periods of time, weeks. And we've seen that over and over again, in the United States, even that original outbreak. And that's because we didn't have tests and we need to get to the place where we're testing for all respiratory diseases.So, we know what's there and what's not there. Third, I think you referred to Bob Redfield, and I think molecular biologists and biologists that work in the lab, know that if you're working on a Coronavirus, or you're working towards a vaccine, you're growing that virus in tissue culture in cell lines and that virus to adapt that virus to those cell lines. And so, it makes sense that the research was working towards a vaccine against Coronavirus, maybe a whole killed are a live Attenuated Vaccine. And it's all about adapting that viruses and growing it in cell lines. And so, it's very possible these kinds of lab accidents do happen there unfortunate.

And I think, once we really understood how this virus circulated, and that there were laboratories working on this very, very similar virus.That a lab accident is very plausible because viruses have to adapt to their host. And we all know that this virus has infected domestic animals and zoo animals. But it doesn't cause outbreaks among those animals, because it's really adapted to humans in a way that this virus really took time to do. And it's very unusual for a zoonotic virus, as Dr. Redfield said to come out of the box, ready to dramatically infect humans and cause this level of devastation. We're still over 300 Americans dying every day, but across the world, we've lost over 7 million Americans. And to me, what's really important is we went through this after SARS. And the World Health Organization's develop treaties, we spent literally hundreds of millions of dollars on saying we were ready, and we would prevent the next pandemic. And it happened. So, let's be very clear that what we have done today has failed. And I worry that we haven't put the new things in place that will keep us and protect us from the next pandemic.",
