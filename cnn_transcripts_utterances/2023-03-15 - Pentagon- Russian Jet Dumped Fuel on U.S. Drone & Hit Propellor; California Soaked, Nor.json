But what it does is it's an intelligence collection platform. It can also be an armed platform. But in this particular case, I'm certain that it was intelligence collection platform. Supports strike missions but mainly it's done for surveillance purposes. And one of the big things about this is that it has a range of about 1,150 miles. It can stay up for about 24 hours. And it -- you know, it has a big wing span of 66 feet. So it's wider than a lot of aircraft. But it can do a lot of collection of different intelligence sources, specifically signals and imagery intelligence. So that's why it's a big deal to make sure that the Russians don't know exactly how good it is at collecting this kind of intelligence.",

But what the Russians did is they went to this area right here, dumped fuel on this part. And then they moved back as the craft was flying, and they hit the propeller right there. So that was the key thing. When it -- when they did that, that made it impossible for the drone to fly. And the Air Force, which was operating this remotely, had no choice but to basically let it sink into the ocean, and they -- into the Black Sea. And they made it that way because they needed to clear it from the sky so that it wasn't a risk to other aviation assets.",

But what Moody's investors services is warning is that we should be prepared for harder times ahead for so many of these -- of these banks. The banking industry could stay under pressure. Just because the Fed has raised interest rates so dramatically. And you've got so many banks with a lot of deposits that are above the insurance line. Right?

If you -- for example, if you look at the website of Washington Mutual from 2008, it just looks like this old- fashioned website. Now you've got online banking.
