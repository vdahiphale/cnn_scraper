The U.S. and Britain accusing Beijing of cyber espionage, hacking into the heart of Western democracy, targeting critical military and civilian infrastructure. CHARLES LI, CHIEF ANALYST, TEAM T5: The Chinese government, they have intentionally developed their cyber capability for the past decade. We are tracking like hundreds of three actors and some part of them, we can trace them back to a military unit belonging to PLA. RIPLEY (voice-over): The People's Liberation Army linked to ongoing Chinese cyber warfare, says the U.S. Director of National Intelligence. AVRIL HAINES, U.S. NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE DIRECTOR: We expect the PLA will field more advanced platforms, deploy new technologies and grow more competent in joint operations. RIPLEY (voice-over): The latest accusations from the U.S. and the U.K. claiming elite Chinese hacking units are infiltrating America's power grids, stealing voter registration lists for tens of millions of British citizens. Working on behalf of China's powerful security ministry, the accused hackers now facing sanctions in both countries. Just months ago at their summit in San Francisco, Chinese leader Xi Jinping told President Joe Biden, China won't interfere in the November elections. Two people familiar with the conversations tell CNN. But U.S. intelligence believes Beijing is improving its ability to spread disinformation and may try to use social media platforms like TikTok to sow doubts about U.S. leadership, undermine democracy and extend Beijing's influence. REP. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI (D-IL): Director Haines, you cannot rule out that the CCP could again, just like they did here, use TikTok as a platform to influence 2020 -- 2024 elections, right?",

During the campaign event, the U.S. president said Saudi Arabia and Arab countries are, quote, prepared to fully recognize Israel for the first time, but stressed that there has to be a post-Gaza plan. The fundraiser was billed as an armchair conversation with Democratic predecessors Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, all three presidents calling for a two-state solution. Pro-Palestinian protesters who interrupted the event several times were scolded at one point by Obama, who suggested they talk less and listen more. The fundraiser is believed to have raised more than $25 million for President Biden's battle against Donald Trump, who was referred on stage as the other guy. And the Trump campaign is trying to top that figure with its own fundraiser early next month. Sources say they hope to rake in at least $33 million. Donald Trump was also in New York on Thursday attending the wake of a police officer killed this week. During brief remarks, Trump called for a return to law and order.
