A man caught it on his cell phone, all as it was just starting to happen. In all, 28 of 200 cars derailed. State officials say that there was not a release of any hazardous materials, however, there were some materials such as propane and ethanol being carried on train, but those particular cars did not derail.

It also involves the concentrated slashing of employees from workforce.Do you believe that this issue -- this is quite a long train that went off the tracks in East Palestine.

But the overarching theme of the trip, according to defense officials, is trying to show the Middle East that the U.S. does stand in solidarity and support with them against that threat posed by Iran, especially given that new defense partnership between Russia and Iran that is so concerning to U.S. and its allies. Take a listen to what Secretary of Defense Austin told reporters this morning about the help that Russia might now be giving Iran in exchange for its help in Ukraine.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LLOYD AUSTIN, U.S. SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:  And we also expect that Russia will provide technology back to Iran in return for some of the help that they've gotten.

An investigation by Human Rights Watch finding that Russia did tend to use them more on civilian targets. This is, in many ways, this request, is not new. CNN has reporting from December that the administration was -- knew that it was out there. There is a lot of concern about it. And that concern likely stems from this convention on cluster munitions. More than 100 countries have signed on to that ban. Ukraine and the U.S. have not ratified that, although there have been pledges in this country to do so. Is this really an option at this point?",

They said, these cluster munitions are terrible weapons and using them is a terrible idea, but it's less terrible than having our cities plundered by Russian criminals and rapists and murderers, and therefore we have no choice. In other words, they are so desperate and so outgunned and outmanned that they're turning to these weapons as self-preservation, because they believe this is an existential fight for their lives and for their country. And for the United States and for Germany, that's not enough. I don't think that the Biden administration, frankly, is going to grant the weapons. I do think that Turkey has been doing it although not admitting to it. And I think Germany is in a similar position. But, yes, this is a war, and this terrible option using these indiscriminate weapons that sometimes kill civilians must be weighed against the alternative, which is that Russian criminals and murderers storm more Ukrainian towns.",
