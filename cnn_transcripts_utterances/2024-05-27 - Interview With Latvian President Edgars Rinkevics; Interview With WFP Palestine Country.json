Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. A brutal attack. That's how the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy described a deadly strike that killed at least 18 people in a busy shopping center in Kharkiv this weekend. Russian troops continue their advance in the east, stepping up their bombing campaign and leaving a trail of destruction. It is a critical time for Kyiv, facing the double threat of exhausted forces and bans on how it can use the weapons given by its western allies. Today, the Ukrainian president is in Madrid meeting his Spanish counterpart, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, and signing another security agreement worth a billion dollars. And NATO Chief Jens Stoltenberg gave his most pointed critique yet of the United States denying Ukraine the ability to strike inside Russia. My first guest tonight, Edgars Rinkevics, is the president of Latvia, which shares a border with Russia. He's here with me in London. Welcome to the program, Mr. President.",

The problem was that, again, we were not providing enough weapons. And then, everyone was kind of surprised that counteroffensive was not as efficient as one could expect. This year we see just the opposite. Russians are advancing, slowly. Brave Ukrainians are fighting, and they are fighting really hard. We see what happened in Kharkiv, that strike against one of supermarkets. Unfortunately, I think that there is probably fear, and I think it's groundless that Russia could use tactical nuclear weapons. I think this is blackmail by Russia, very well calculated, but some governments are buying in, and this is not something that I could advise. If our strategy, and that's another point, is Ukraine winning, we should help Ukraine in any way we can. The problem is that Ukraine winning is not a clear strategy by all of us.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LYNDA KINKADE, CNN HOST (voice-over): It's yet another beautiful day on the water in Chao Lao Beach, Thailand. But it's what lies beneath the surface that's been left unrecognizable where this fisherman used to make up to 10,000 baht or U.S. $276 a day. He says now he's lucky to earn a fifth of that. As the coral below him dies off, the marine animals who inhabit it and feed off it disappear. SOMMAY SINGSURA, LOCAL FISHERMAN (through translator): The coral reef is my heart and soul when it isn't bleached, healthy and abundant and you can go out fishing at night. You can easily catch a squid in a fishnet on the coral reef, earning a living was nice and easy. KINKADE (voice-over): The third-generation fisherman is among some 200 who live and fish on this beach. The fisherman here help provide seafood like blue swimming crabs and other small fish to Bangkok, Vietnam, and China. But with 50 percent of coral in the gulf of Thailand already bleaching according to Thai government scientists, they regular catch is dwindling. Without healthy coral typical marine life is forced to migrate. LALITA PUTCHIM, MARINE BIOLOGIST, THAILAND DEPARTMENT OF MARINE AND COASTAL RESOURCES (through translator): The factor causing the bleaching is the rising of the sea water's temperature. When I got into the water just now, I immediately felt that the water was warm, very warm. KINKADE (voice-over): To some scientists, the term global warming doesn't do the situation justice. Global boiling is a better fit. As atmospheric temperatures rise, so do ocean temperatures. The heat stresses the corals, causing them to lose their algae and pigment.
