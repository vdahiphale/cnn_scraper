      "sentences": "So today, at least two of President-elect Donald Trump's cabinet picks are facing some serious questions, serious concerns, and potentially serious roadblocks on their path for getting confirmed by the Senate. And we're clearly not even talking about Matt Gaetz anymore. Donald Trump announced ten more top level administration picks over the weekend, so if you blinked, you may have missed one.With his cabinet now filled out, the focus now shifts to the real work ahead and how to get all of them over the finish line as the Senate looks to a busy January of confirmation hearings. That process typically includes FBI background checks for basically all of them. But the Trump team has yet to file the necessary paperwork for the FBI to begin conducting those checks. Skipping them all together may be the newest Trump strategy and the latest example of how Trump has, always, and will continue to bust through as many norms as he pleases in the next term. CNN's Alayna Treene starts us off this morning. Alayna, what are you hearing from the Trump transition team on how they are now preparing for confirmation now that all of these administration level -- top administration picks have been announced?",

      "sentences": "Right. Well, we still have a couple left, Kate. We have about four left in the cabinet, but really he has filled out all of the most important cabinets in the core cabinet and moved at a very quick pace to do that, which is three weeks since Election Day. But you're right. I mean, right now, the focus is really shifting from his announcing his picks and filling out who he wants to serve in these top roles to how he is going to get them through the confirmation process.I know from my conversations with those working with the transition that they have been doing a lot of work behind the scenes. For some of these people, they had already recognized some of these concerns beforehand. That includes someone like RFK Jr. They know that as a former Democrat and someone who is now going to be in a top health role, if he can get confirmed. A lot of senators are worried about, you know, his past comments on supporting abortion access and trying to get some of those staunchly conservative people in the Senate to feel -- get assurance by some of what they're trying to do. So, we're hearing them reach out. I know a lot of people on Trump's team are reaching out to people on the Hill. They're going to be setting up meetings one-on-one with some of these different candidates to have them meet them behind closed doors before we start to really see these confirmation hearings play out in public. Now, two very controversial picks that they recognize they could have some issues with are Pete Hegseth, his pick to lead the Department of Defense, but also Tulsi Gabbard. And I want to focus on Gabbard here because her comments about, you know, her skepticism around surveillance and also really her deep distrust of a lot of the agencies that she is going to be overseeing is something we have heard many people in the Senate start to raise alarm bells on. I want you to take a listen to what we heard some senators say yesterday on this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. TAMMY DUCKWORTH (D-IL):  She is, in terms of the intelligence community, very unqualified, plus she is potentially compromised and could be and has -- is there questions about whether or not she is now a Russian asset? SEN. JAMES LANKFORD (R-OK):  Well, we'll have lots of questions. She met with Bashar Assad. We'll want to know what the purpose was and what the direction for that was, as a member of Congress. We'll want to get a chance to talk about past comments that she's made and get them into full context. So, sure, there's comments that are floating out there, but we want to be able to know the rest of the story. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

You better pack your patience, not only for the dinner table for Thanksgiving plans with family and friends, but also if you are going to be one of those 80 million Americans traveling this week because we have one storm lining up after another, the big one really indicating and kind of culminating really on Thursday and Friday, some of the busier travel days of this week.Here's a look at this forecast accumulation and we have, well, a lot of lake effect snow in the forecast for the downwind areas of Lake Ontario, Lake Superior, Lake Michigan as well, but another storm system impacting the intermountain west. First, let's talk today. Here's a look at your airport delays. No problems along the East Coast, but notice Detroit, Chicago, Minneapolis, minor weather related delays that could stretch southward into New Orleans as weak cold front presses through. And then along the west coast, the state of California, L.A. to San Francisco, that's where we have at least moderate delays at the airports being reported. And it's all thanks to a storm system that is entering the equation going forward. And a lot of that energy will move eastward. I'll show you that in just one second. But follow this today. This is the storm that will bring some rainfall early Tuesday morning. If you're hitting the roads along the I-95 corridor, be aware, but this storm is really going to pack a punch as we head into Thursday. Look how this strengthens and deepens, and then just in time for the Macy's Day, Thanksgiving Day parade in New York City. It looks to be a rather wet and breezy and blustery one as well. But you can see the snowfall for Northern New England that will impact places like Buffalo, Albany, into Killington, the Burlington area as well as northern sections of Maine. Omar?",

We are going to enjoy a couple of more days of above average temperatures. But notice the oranges and reds get quickly replaced by the shades of blue and purple below average temperatures. That's the story going forward from tomorrow into the second half of this week, and many locations will not be spared from this. Look at these daytime highs in Chicago, well below average, and, of course, the windy city living up to its name. It will be breezy. So, the wind chill values will be even colder than that. New York City on Thanksgiving Day, look at that 47 and rain, that's just cool and damp. And then Atlanta, wow, you're not spared from this cool weather as well, temperatures in the upper 40s.So we're running 15 to 20 degrees below where we should be this time of year. So, plan accordingly for your forecast and your Thanksgiving Day travel plans because it will be a messy one and a cold one come the second half of the week. Omar?",

And Trump ended up going with a safe pick, someone who's going to command respect from markets. He did not go with a radical extremist, a bomb thrower for this job, and that is a huge relief.And, listen, this hire of Scott Besson is already winning some early positive reviews. Yale Professor Jeff Sonnenfeld told me that there is huge relief in Corporate America. Jamie Dimon is a fan too, a person close to. The JPMorgan CEO told me that Dimon thinks very highly of Bessent, and he believes this is an excellent choice. A manufacturing CEO, Jay Timmons, who's been critical of Trump in the past, described this as an outstanding choice. And even Anthony Scaramucci, who fiercely opposed the reelection of Trump, called Bessent a great guy in a safe and stable pair of hands. It's worth noting market is reacting. We see U.S. Stock Futures moving significantly higher this morning, and it does seem as though at least part of that rally this morning is driven by this higher. Just a little bit more about Scott Bessent and his resume. He does have some of the qualities you would want in a treasury secretary. He's got deep experience in markets. He's a hedge fund manager. He's actually worked with some of the most famous investors in the world, including Stanley Druckenmiller and George Soros, who, of course, is looked at as a boogeyman on the right.",

And Sonnenfeld told me that Bessent knows that tariffs help make the great depression worse with the 1930 Smoot- Hawley Tariffs. And he said that Bessent doesn't want a second Smoot- Hawley. So, that's a relief.But, Kate, at the end of the day, even if Bessent is a voice of moderation here, we do know that this is going to ultimately be decided by Trump here.
