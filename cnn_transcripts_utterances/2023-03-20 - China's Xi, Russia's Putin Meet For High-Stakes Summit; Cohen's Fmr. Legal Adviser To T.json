      "sentences": "Plus, Donald Trump says that he expects to be indicted in New York. And though he's the only one saying that right now, he's already calling on his supporters to take to the streets. And mayhem in Miami Beach, two fatal shootings and unruly crowds, forcing the city to impose a spring break curfew. This is what we're watching AT THIS HOUR.Thank you for being here, everybody. I'm Kate Bolduan. The stakes are high today, no doubt. And so is a level of skepticism around the visit between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Xi arrived in Moscow this morning for a three day state visit, his first since Russia launched the invasion of Ukraine. And the timing is also noteworthy because just days ago, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin himself on war crimes charges. Adding to the skepticism around this whole trip, China's promoting it as a peacemaking mission to bring resolution in Ukraine, you'll be hard pressed to find any experts suggesting a major breakthrough on ending the war is going to come from this visit. But world leaders are watching it all very closely, nonetheless, for any clues of what moves Russia and China might make. We're covering all the angles of this visit for you. Let's start with Matthew Chance who is live in Moscow? Matthew, what are you hearing from Russian officials today?",

      "sentences": "Well, Russian officials are treating this as a diplomatic coup, the visit of Xi Jinping, the Chinese leader to Russia at a time like this is really exactly the kind of symbolic show of support that the Kremlin has been looking for. It's the first time that Xi Jinping has come to Russia, since Russia launched this invasion of Ukraine more than a year ago.But it's also just a couple of days after Vladimir Putin was indicted by the International Criminal Court for war crimes. And so this sends a strong message that Vladimir Putin is not isolated, not as isolated as some of the West would like him to be. And he's got this very powerful figure in Xi Jinping, literally standing side by side with him here at the Kremlin. There -- beyond the symbolism there a couple of concrete things we're watching for. The first is whether or not China will offer to provide military assistance to Russia in its war in Ukraine. It hasn't done that so far. But there's a possibility it may change its position on that. Certainly if it sees Russia, sort of on the back foot it may move to intervene and support Russia. The second thing is you just mentioned the diplomatic initiative that China has launched, it's a 12 planned point peace plan, which calls for negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, but crucially does not call on Russia to withdraw from the territory it's already conquered. And so it's got a pretty lukewarm response so far. Nevertheless, the Kremlin says that is what is going to be discussed, as well as a much closer relationship between Moscow and Beijing during the three day state visit.",

They're really rejecting this notion that this Putin and Xi meeting is a peacekeeping mission. Any deal that is brokered by China, they're basically saying would be bad for Ukraine. And they're really trying to set expectations ahead of this meeting to the American public about what they should and shouldn't take away from the meeting.One warning that we are hearing loud and clear from the White House is that if there is a call for a ceasefire, they're essentially saying that it would only be a ceasefire in name only, that this would be sort of a protect -- pretense ceasefire, where it would give the opportunity, essentially, to Vladimir Putin to regroup and come back with full force whenever he chose to do so. So again, this warning that if we do see coming out of this meeting, a call for a ceasefire, basically, that they would not take that seriously, and that the U.S. would reject those calls. The White House is, of course, also warning Beijing, again, to not provide any lethal aid to Russia. We know that this is something that White House officials have been monitoring very closely. They don't believe that Beijing has actually made a decision on this front. But it is something that they have been really concerned about. Of course, we heard the President saying a couple of days ago that he does plan on speaking directly with Xi, but that meeting has not been set yet. Kate.",

He's a former U.S. ambassador to China and CNN contributor and former CNN Moscow bureau chief, Jill Dougherty. Thank you both for being here. Ambassador, it's good to see you again. What do you -- what is your overall thought on this visit, the timing, the staging, the messaging around it for Xi? GARY LOCKE, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO CHINA: Well, I think this visit accomplishes several things. First of all, it burnishes and reinforces the image of Putin despite the World Court calling for his arrest for war crimes. It's showing solidarity by China with its longtime ally, Russia, and saying that it's not going to abandon Putin. At the same time, China is trying to reinforce its image around the world as a peacemaker. Just a few -- just last week, China help broker a reestablishment of relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia. And so China is trying to project that image of a facilitator of peace around the world. At the same time, I'm sure that the Russia will want to get more money and support from China that would enable it to continue the war against Ukraine. I wouldn't be surprised if there are some trade agreements, some sales that are announced where China commits to buying more oil and gas from Russia, providing income to the Russian government to continue the war against Ukraine.",

And they really bristle at the domination and the -- in some ways the heavy handedness as they feel of the West, and especially the United States.They don't like the sanctions that have been imposed, and the tariffs that have been imposed on Chinese goods, it's hurt their economy. They don't like using sanctions and tariffs in terms of accomplishing political objectives. So they are actually teaming up with many other countries around the world in trying to stand up to the United States. And quite frankly, it's to China's advantage for the war between Russia and Ukraine to continue, because in their view, in Beijing's view, it distracts the United States from the Asia Pacific.",

They've reached out to North Korea, for weaponry and especially ammunition, so they definitely needed. And those parts that we were talking about the high tech components are very important for their weapons, not only commercially but the weapons that they produce, the high tech weapons that they don't have a lot of.And because of sanctions, they are limited in the amount of high tech technology that they can get from the west. So they need China for that help, too. But it's very complicated for China's still at this point to do that because if they do supply lethal weaponry, they can begin, obviously, they will come into sanctions by the United States and probably other countries in the West. And that would be very bad for the Chinese economy, especially after a couple of years of COVID shutdown. China needs trade. And the question will be are they willing to jeopardize the trade that they have with the West to help out Russia?",

In New York Robert Costello, a former legal adviser to Trump's former fixer Michael Cohen, he is set to appear before the grand jury today. And he's expected to contradict Cohen's testimony about hush money payments made to Stormy Daniels years ago. The Manhattan D.A. could also be calling back Cohen as a possible rebuttal witness. Let's get to this. Paula Reid, she's back with us again today. It's good to see you, Paula.

And even though prosecutors didn't have to grant that request, as I understand it, it's an optics thing, right?If they were to decline this request to it would become a thing in an investigation that is already, you know, pretty big thing in the country. Yes. So the grand jury will have the option to hear from him. It's expected that they will like to hear what he has to say about the credibility of Michael Cohen. As you noted, he previously represented Cohen but Cohen has subsequently waived attorney-client privilege, which is how he's able to talk about things that happen when he was advising him. Cohen and his attorney, Lanny Davis, will also be at court today. And he may be called as a rebuttal witness, we'll see.",

So it appears to the former president is speculating as one of his attorneys, Alina Habba, she does not represent him in the Manhattan DA case. But she was sort of deputized to come out and talk about this case, you know, why is he speculating, and in the same sentence, he's speculating. He's also calling for protests as he tried to capitalize on speculating on an arrest to instigate political violence. And she had an opportunity there to tamp down the language, she doubled down on this and said, quote, if he is arrested, it will be mayhem.So we know from our colleagues that a lot of folks around Trump would rather that he just focus on this possibly being a politically motivated prosecution and not focus on calling people to protest in the wake of January 6th. And it's interesting today, Kate, his Truth Social posts, you don't see calls for protests in all of them. So it's possible that they're getting through. But as we know, law enforcement, they've been talking about these potential threats. And also just the logistics of getting the former leader of the free world through a courthouse that on a good day is a circus, it's very chaotic, and potentially dangerous.",

Why would Costello choose to speak up now? Why would the defense team want to bring him in now? And, you know, because of that, and answer me this, and then we'll talk about the D.A.'s motivation in this, next. MICHAEL MOORE, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY: Yes, no, I'm glad to be with you. I mean, Trump had the opportunity to speak and so this is a way to keep Trump off the stand, but get his side out before the grand jury. And, you know, they want to look like at least that they're given the appearance. And so I'm sure that Costello is sort of carrying the former president's water, right now as they go into the grand jury to throw some doubt there. And then you're going to see this played over and over again, as they talk about the validity of the grand jury of what they heard, what they didn't hear, why they wouldn't let somebody ask a question, those things. And it -- we really are not -- we're playing more now in the PR arena, and the press room, that we are necessarily in the courtroom.

Because basically, what you do is you go ahead and say, well, we're going to give you your day in court, you can send who you want to, tell us, you know, Mr. Trump, that he'd like to come testify, let him testify. And then you get to hear sort of what the anticipated defenses may be to a case. You get to get a witness under oath that you can then go after if they purge themselves in some way.You may be holding an ace up your sleeve about Mr. Costello and the testimony he may give. You get a chance to bring Cohen back in now, I wouldn't want to base my case just on Mr. Cohen's testimony. He's got his own problems that he's been through in the last few years, but at least it gives them a chance to hear things in advance or like a lawyer does discovery in a case so that you can find out what the other side is going to say. This lets him actually get testimony under oath in a criminal case, which is not that common. But it allows him to have that, the prosecutor that is, to have that in his back pocket as he moves forward. So it's a good move on his part, good gamesmanship, whether or not the end of the day, it really matters. What will be something else? Because I don't know that it's necessarily going to sway the grand jury one way or another. BOLDUAN: Yes. And also just your take on Donald Trump calling on his supporters and saying that he thinks that he's going to be, thinks he's going to be arrested, but also calling in a support as to protest in the way you put it is to take our nation back if it happens, what do you make of that, Michael?",

And let me say this, I don't agree with anything that he's saying. And I think it's not a witch hunt.But if you got somebody like him, and this is what he's going to do, you tell him to go ahead and just own it, get on the courthouse steps, make you big speech, talk about how you're being a martyr for the calls, and make America great again, and all this kind of stuff, and use that opportunity, every chance you get. And if you're trying to reach the general public, you're trying to reach donors more, you know, pragmatically. But you also might be going to read some potential jurors out there as they hear this and family members of jurors who are going to be talking about this in the months ahead.

And what it allows a prosecutor to do is sort of use the whole story as opposed to just the charge criminal conduct. But most of the viewers have probably heard about relevance objections in court without a judge, let something in because it's irrelevant and are irrelevant, keeps it out.The racketeering statute allows you talk about everything, things that aren't even listed in the indictment, or are part of they're not even talking about other people's conduct sort of one person to the criminal enterprise, does something wrong, then you can kind of use it to look at blame for the person charged in the indictment. And so that's what's happening with the racketeering statute. So I'm not surprised at all to see who are using it. She's had a lawyer that's been working on racketeering cases that has helped her before on this. And so you think of them usually, when you think about gangs, think about drug organizations, you think about the mafia. That's what she's talking about with a racketeering case. It's going to be interesting to see whether or not she can actually take this idea of is this a criminal organization so that all the tentacles moving can be followed back to the head of the thing? Is this something that's going to stick in the political arena? I think it could be problematic when we start talking about whether or not if she were to get a conviction, if it can survive an appeal, or if it could survive pretrial motions, you know, that's going to be taken all the way to the Supreme Court and whether or not they say that a former president can be indicted for RICO, for things that happen, especially with things that may have been alleged to have been happening while he was president of the United States.
