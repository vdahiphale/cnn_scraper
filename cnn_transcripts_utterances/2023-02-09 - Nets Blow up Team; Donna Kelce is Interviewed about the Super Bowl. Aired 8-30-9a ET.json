      "sentences": "OK, so -- let's get -- we're talking about NBA trade deadlines. There's a lot of trading going on. So, look, I want to get right to it. The Nets have traded Kevin Durant to the Phoenix Suns. That happened overnight. Comes right after Kyrie Irving says he's going away to the Dallas Mavericks. Official end to what they thought was a very promising super team over in Brooklyn.LZ Granderson is here. He is a columnist at \"The Los Angeles Times,\" host of the podcast \"Life Outloud.\" LZ, thank you. So, what do you make, the end of this - it was supposed to be a super team. What up? What happened? LZ GRANDERSON, OP-ED COLUMNIST, \"LOS ANGELES TIMES\": You know, this is the part of construction of NBA rosters that people forget about, that it takes more than just talent in order to build a championship. You've got to have cohesion. You've got to have some luck. You've got to have clarity from the ownership group all the way down to the 12th man on the team. And the Brooklyn Nets just never had that. You went through all the players that were traded. But, remember, before that, James Harden was traded the year before. And before James Harden was traded, remember, they also -- they also fired Steve Nash, their head coach. And so this is the franchise that has started to disintegrate almost as soon as it was put together.",

      "sentences": "Well, you know, that's a -- it's a fascinating question because all of that has to do with, what is Kyrie's ultimate goal, right? He is going to be a free agent this year, which means he has to kind of play the good soldier publicly if he wants to sign a long-term deal, either with the Mavericks or some other team. And so I think both the Dallas Mavericks, as well as Kyrie, have a lot invested in order to try to make this work. Kyrie is certainly wanting to secure his - his financial future and the Dallas Mavericks want to return as winners with Luka Doncic.So, I think you're going to see Kyrie on his best behavior. But then again, I said that when he was in Boston, and I said that when he was in Brooklyn, too, so what do I know?",

And, you know, the deleted post, we don't know when he deleted it, so I don't want to necessarily assume that the trade and the deletion of the posts are connected. But he had to know that there would be a response to deleting that post. So right there lets you know that even though he may be a good soldier, he's not going to not be Kyrie.
