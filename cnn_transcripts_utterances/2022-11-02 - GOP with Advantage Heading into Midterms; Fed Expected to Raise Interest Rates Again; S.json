In our brand-new poll, conducted by SSRS, you see the Republican advantage here among likely voters. Fifty-one percent say they're going to vote for the Republican; 47 percent the Democrats. This 4-percentage-point spread bodes well for Republicans to pick up seats in Congress. And remember, they're only five away from the majority in the House. Look at this over time. Republicans were at 47 percent, Dems were at 50 just at the beginning of last month. Now Republicans have grown, Democrats have lost some status here. And break it down by party, obviously Republicans, overwhelming, 96 percent of them, are voting for the Republican candidate. Ninety-eight percent of Democrats voting for tee Democrat. But those crucial independents in the middle, you see advantage Republican there, 48 to 45 percent. We also took a look at gender and the divide there. Female voters, advantage Democrat, 51 percent to 45 percent, a 6-point advantage among female likely voters for Democrats. But that gets wiped out by this overwhelming advantage among male voters, male likely voters that Republican have a 17-percentage-point edge, 58 percent to 41 percent. And when you look at the voters by race, white voters, 62 percent to 36 percent going Republican. Black likely voters, 85 percent to 8 percent Democrat over Republican. And Latino voters, 66 percent Democrat, 33 percent Republican. I'll just note, this is a 32-percentage-point advantage for Democrats. Four years ago in 2018, the exit polls showed Democrats had a 40-point advantage, so that is getting somewhat diminished there, as well.",

It's really big. M.J. Lee is at the White House. OK. People look at this, I think their eyes glaze over. Understandably so. Explain why what the Fed does today matters so much. And also, M.J., why you've got some really key Democrats writing a letter to Fed chair Jerome Powell, saying look, how much more pain is this going to inflict? How many more millions of job losses? M.J. LEE, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yes. Look, Poppy, we are about to see, actually, two things happen in Washington today that really show in such a vivid way this very complicated problem for the president. And the biggest problem for him, as David just showed, and that is, of course, inflation. We have on the one hand, the Federal Reserve expected to make another historic rate hike. Just shows in such a blaring way that this is such a big problem still for the economy. And then, literally, at around the same time here at the White House, the president is going to be holding this event, making a speech on the issue of workforce training. Now, what does that have to do with inflation? Well, officials would argue that, when you're training workers so that they can get into these specialized areas, you are, in part, creating a long-term solution to deal with the labor shortage, which is one of the many problems driving inflation. So we've almost got this White House counter-programming event to what we're going to see at the Fed. Again, just another reminder that this problem has been so intractable for this president.",

But right now at this moment, the central figure in doing sort of the most aggressive action when it comes to inflation, it's not President Biden. It can't come from Congress. It has to come from the Federal Reserve. So again, I think it is just one more reminder today, not that the president needs it. He knows this very well.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MIRACLE (voice-over): New, chilling details from the 911 call House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband made when an assailant broke into their San Francisco home. According to a motion to detain filed Tuesday, just after 2 a.m., the defendant, David DePape, startled Paul Pelosi awake, holding a large hammer in his right hand and several white plastic zip ties in his left. DePape allegedly asked, \"Are you Paul Pelosi,\" then repeated, \"Where's Nancy? Where's Nancy?\" According to the motion, Pelosi, still groggy, responded, \"She's not here.\" DePape then responded, \"OK. I'm going to tie you up.\" According to the document, at 2:23 a.m., Pelosi placed the 911 call after allowing the assailant to allow him to go to the bathroom, where his phone was charging. He spoke to the dispatcher for three minutes and stated words to the effect of, \"There is a male in the home and that the male is going to wait for Pelosi's wife.\" Pelosi further conveyed that he does not know who the male is.

There were even air-raid sirens at a South Korean island off the coast, Poppy. [06:2003] This is something that North Korea has been signaling for the last couple of days. And, frankly, they're saying that even stronger, more powerful follow-up measures, as they call it, could be coming soon, because they're angry about U.S./South Korea military drills that are happening right now.

So what U.S. and Western officials believe is going on here is that this long- time ally of Vladimir Putin's, the head of this mercenary group, a man named Prigozhin, is trying to use the kind of chaos and pretty clear mismanagement of Putin's war in Ukraine to try to grow his own influence inside Moscow.So what our sources tell us is that Prigozhin has gone in to speak to Putin directly, specifically criticizing the Ministry of Defense and its handling of the war, and encouraging Putin to take a more aggressive approach to the conflict. So as one analyst described it to us, this is Prigozhin trying to raise his own stature by embarrassing the minister of defense, who happens to be another long-time Putin ally, a man named Sergei Shoigu. So as -- again, as one of our sources described it, this is really a real-life \"House of Cards\" happening inside the Kremlin.

So they're hoping it's going to provide them a little bit of a window into not just how the power structures of the Kremlin might shake out as a result of this war but also, is Putin himself feeling under pressure to try to escalate the war, take more drastic measures in Ukraine to try to regain some momentum?",
