Almost two months ago, the Dali cargo ship collidedwith the Francis Scott Key Bridge, causing it to collapse, killing six construction workers. On Monday, the ship was finally dragged away from the crash site. Several tugboats pulled the massive 106,000-ton vessel, traveling only one mile per hour. Dali is now docked at Seagirt Marine Terminal in Baltimore. CNN`s Amy Kiley has more about Dali`s removal and what will happen now to the crew of workers who have remained on board the ship ever since it crashed. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) AMY KILEY, CNN NEWSOURCE &amp; REPORTER (voice-over): Recent demolition work is what gave the Dali cargo ship a path to freedom. It`s been stuck under the wreckage of Baltimore`s Francis Scott Key Bridge since it hit the structure and caused its collapse in March. COL. ESTEE PINCHASIN, U.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS: We`re very lucky that the hull was never damaged at all during the event.",

So far, it has scorched more than 12,000 acres of the Tonto National Forest. Tonto is Arizona`s biggest national forest at more than 2.9 million total acres. As fire officials try to get the wildfire under control, they`re pleading with drone operators to stop flying near the fire. They say the drones interfere with firefighting efforts and could cause mid-air collisions. Pop quiz, hot shots. Which of these sea critters is the most expensive seafood? Lobster, bluefin tuna, puffer fish or caviar? Bet you said caviar, didn`t you? Don`t go fishing for compliments if you did because bluefin tuna is your answer. Bluefin is so expensive because it`s on the endangered list. In 2019, a sushi restaurant tour paid more than 3 million bucks for a 612- pound bluefin tuna. Talk about expensive taste. Personally, I`m on a seafood diet. I eat whatever food I see. But for those of us that actually like seafood, there will be fewer Red Lobster restaurants to attack. The world`s largest seafood restaurant chain just filed for bankruptcy. The company has more than $1 billion in debt and less than $30 million in cash. Bankruptcy doesn`t mean Red Lobster is going out of business completely. Instead, it plans to sell the company to its lenders. But it will definitely be closing many of its restaurants in the meantime. For today`s story getting a 10 out of 10, we have liftoff. Finally, after a nearly two-year hiatus, Blue Origin, the tourism rocket company founded by billionaire Jeff Bezos, has once again launched passengers into the outer regions of our atmosphere to check out the incredible view from the edge of space. Among those folks torpedoing into the sky was Ed Dwight, a 90 years young, retired U.S. Air Force captain. Back in 1961, Mr. Dwight was selected by then President John F. Kennedy to be the first black astronaut candidate in U.S. history. Despite receiving all the astronaut training he needed and getting a recommendation from the Air Force, Mr. Dwight was not ultimately selected to actually become an astronaut, so he never made it to space, that is, until Blue Origin came knocking.
