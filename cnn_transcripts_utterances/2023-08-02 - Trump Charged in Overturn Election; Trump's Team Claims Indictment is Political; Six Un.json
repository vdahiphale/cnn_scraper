They lined up surrogates and influencers and allies to immediately respond once new charges were filed. And they had begun formulating a plan for how they would push back against this new indictment. And, of course, as we've seen, he's reviving the old playbook that he's used when talking about his legal troubles, which is to argue that these are purely political and argue that they amount to election interference.

He wants to argue to his voters that he did not commit any crime. And I can tell you, from speaking with Donald Trump supporters, I wasat his rally over the weekend in Erie, Pennsylvania, I spoke with many Trump supporters as they were heading into the venue, and they believe him. They believe that he did nothing wrong. And they also think that he's a victim of a two-tiered justice system. And you can see in the polls Donald Trump is still very much the Republican frontrunner.

And, look, if you read these -- this list of five names that we have identified, and you were following along with the January 6th committee hearings, they're probably not all that surprising. They include four attorneys, namely at the top of the first, co-conspirator number one, Rudy Giuliani, who was acting as the former president's personal attorney at the time. but also the head of his post-election legal team as they were trying to find evidence of voter fraud to back up, you know, his claims that he had won an election that he really did not.Now, Giuliani was notable in the indictment because it lays out how he led the way on pressuring state legislators during this post-election period. That was really something we know from our reporting that investigators were asking a lot of witnesses about before the indictment came. You know, the second co-conspirator that we've identified is John Eastman. Another attorney who was advising former President Trump, either directly or indirectly at the time. And Eastman is most known for his plan to pressure Vice President Mike Pence and to overturn the election on January 6th. He was one of the first people that pushed that idea into the high levels of the White House. The third is Sidney Powell, another Trump attorney who was really one of the biggest pushers of these conspiracy theories related to voting machines and fraud that came from that She, you know, floated things like Venezuela hacking voting machines or China using thermometers to change and flip votes. Jeffrey Clark, a former DOJ official, we've also identified as one of the co-conspirators. He was the one that wanted to use the Justice Department to help overturn the 2020 election. And we know from previous reporting, and from congressional reports, that Jeffrey Clark was almost named acting attorney general by former President Trump in the waning days of his time in office. And finally we've identified Kenneth Chesebro. He's probably the least known of the five individuals here. He's also a pro-Trump attorney who was really working to help overturn the election. But he was known -- or identified by the January 6th committee as the architect of the fake electors plot. And reading this indictment, the fake electors scheme is a cornerstone of what Jack Smith is laying out and what he says are crimes committed by Trump and potentially assisted by these five individuals and one other unidentified individual.",

Pence reacted to the indictment, though, this way, writing - writing in a statement saying, today's indictment serves as an important reminder, anyone who puts himself over the Constitution should never be president of the United States. Adding, on January 6th former President Trump demanded that I choose between him and the Constitution. And I chose the Constitution and I always will.It's hard to overstate the importance of Pence's role that day. According to the charging document, Trump was relentless in his efforts to get his VP to illegally reject the 2020 election results.
