      "sentences": "Welcome, everyone, you're in the \"CNN Newsroom.\" I'm Omar Jimenez in Washington. We're going to begin this hour with fierce fighting in eastern Ukraine as Ukrainian troops say they've successfully countered or they are successfully countering Russian advances around a town near Kharkiv right along the Russian border, which has turned the town itself into a front line in this war. You can see Vovchansk highlighted on the map there.Now, the extent of the damage is pretty staggering, as you can see there from this drone footage overhead. Much of the fighting in the last few weeks has reportedly centered around an aggregate plant, which usually produces materials for construction. Now it's a combat zone where Ukrainian troops have tried to isolate Russian units to cross the border as part of a recent offensive. One Ukrainian commander referred to Russian troops in the town as surrounded. And one of the biggest shifts on that eastern front is the U.S. permitting Ukraine to use some American weapons to strike targets across the Russian border in Russian territory. That's allowed Ukraine to counter some of Russia's gains as of late. Now, it's indicative of how this administration, the Biden White House, treats support for Ukraine, especially as compared to Biden's opponent in this year's election, Donald Trump. Both candidates striking very different tones this week when it comes to this war. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The fact is that Zelensky, I think, has emerged as one of the strongest leaders in the world today. Given the fact that he has been attacked by Russia, by Vladimir Putin, he's had thousands of people killed. You have Putin who has sent missiles into hospitals, into maternity wards, into schoolyards, in schools themselves.They've killed thousands of people and caused millions to become migrants. And so for Zelensky to stand up and say, I am fighting for freedom, I'm fighting for my freedom as an independent country, and I'm fighting for Europe's freedom. Because if Putin is allowed to take Ukraine, which former President Trump has said, do whatever the hell you want. You can take Ukraine. You can take anything else you want in Europe, as long as they don't pay up their bills. Well, for someone who has filed bankruptcy multiple times and not paying bills, that's pretty rich coming from the former president. But in any event, the Europeans stand strongly with Ukraine. And President -- our President Biden stands really strong with them, saying we're with you for years and years to come. That's provided that President Biden is still president. And that's the danger that we face, that former President Trump will take office again and sell out the Ukrainians in a nanosecond. That's what the Europeans are worried about.

That will help destabilize NATO, which he has also said he does not favor. So if NATO doesn't have the United States, we are the biggest contributor.[17:05:01] We are the backbone of the NATO alliance. If you pull us out, the NATO organization probably won't survive for any length of time. That will destabilize Europe and put Putin in a very good position to dominate the European theater as such. Secondly, it will undermine support by our Asian allies, because if we won't support Ukraine, which is in Europe, what are we going to do if China should ever move against Taiwan? All of those Asian allies will say, wait a minute, President Trump has threatened to pull support from South from South Korea. He's also pulled support from Japan. You pull our troops out of Japan, out of South Korea. What's the rest of our alliances in the Asia-Pacific or Indo-Pacific region? What do they say at that point? We live in the region, United States, you don't. We'll make the best deal we can, and that will be with China. So, this has global implications for us in terms of our European allies. And if we don't have our European allies, when it comes time to challenging China economically, diplomatically, who's going to be with us? The Europeans saying you dumped us. We're not with you in going after China. We're not with you should you ever have to go to a conflict in war with China over Taiwan. You'll be all alone. You won't have us with you. So, there are great implications for our security, for international stability. We believe in freedom. We believe in the rule of law. And Donald Trump doesn't. He doesn't believe in the rule of law. He believes in the rule of power, the power of rule. And so he wants to be more like Vladimir Putin. Inside a Trump doll is a Putin doll. He wants to be more like Xi Jinping. He wants to be more like Kim Jong Un. He wants to be more like them so he can have a military that that pays fealty to him, swears loyalty to him. When you and I pledge allegiance, it's not to a president, it's to the flag of the United States, the republic for which it stands, to the Constitution of the United States.

I don't support sovereignty for the Ukrainians. And we have to remember, Putin has invaded a sovereign, independent country. We can't allow him to get away with it, so to speak, because he never pays a penalty for violating international rules of law. And so if he's not -- he went after Georgia, got a piece of Georgia. He's gone after Crimea, taken Crimea. He's gone after the Donbass. He wants that.So he keeps taking a chunk at a time of an independent country. And we say it's okay, you can have whatever you want. I don't think the American people should want that. I don't believe they do want that. But you have supporters on Capitol Hill who support Putin, who support whatever he is doing, because they believe that he's a strong man and they want a strong man in the White House. A strong man in the White House means you lose rights. It means you don't have the freedom to speak your piece of mind. You don't have the freedom to challenge your power.

Last night, President Joe Biden and former President Barack Obama went to a fundraiser packed with Hollywood celebrities. The president's warned of the dangers of a second Trump presidency in a discussion moderated by Jimmy Kimmel. The Biden campaign says the event raised $30 million. That's the most successful single day event in the party's history. CNN correspondent Priscilla Alvarez joins us now. All right.

But his efforts clearly seem to be in the graphics that we're showing right now, is Biden still based on polls still has a clear advantage among black voters, but the margins sort of changing again, at least on what's been polled so far.

He needs it to be in at least the mid-40s.Once that happens, if it happens, I think you'll see the level of support for Biden among black voters, among maybe Hispanic voters and also among young people. I think you'll see it go up again. It may not get to the levels of 2020, but it may get enough to give Biden the energy he needs to get over the finish line. But it's all connected. It's not just the attempt by Trump to win some black votes. He's also playing the same game with Hispanics, and it seems to be succeeding more than it is with blacks.

And Juneteenth represents June 19th, 1865, when the final slaves were notified about the new law. But even then, that didn't end slavery in the United States. It wasn't until December 1865 that Georgia became the 27th and last state to ratify the 13th Amendment, meeting the necessary number of states for the U.S. to officially abolish slavery. I spoke to one man who says his father was born in Georgia before slavery was officially abolished as he journeyed back to where his dad was born. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILBUR B. BELL, SEARCHING FOR FAMILY HISTORY: This is my father. He represents memories. JIMENEZ (voice-over): In this northern Florida graveyard, Wilbur Bell is visiting his dad, Cornelius Bell. Etched in the gravestone, it says, born in May 1865, which would mean his father was born before slavery was outlawed in the United States. His father was 75 when Wilbur was born. Now, only he and his sister are still alive.",
