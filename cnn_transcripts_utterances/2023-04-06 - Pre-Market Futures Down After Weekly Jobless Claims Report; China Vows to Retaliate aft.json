We're going to bring you this vote live when it happens.So, this just in Lebanon says that Israel has responded to rockets fired into Northern Israel with artillery fire into Southern Lebanon. This after Israeli defense sources say that dozens of rockets were fired from Lebanon into Israel. Israel says some of those were intercepted. And we are just now hearing Israel's northern airspace has been closed. Much more on this as it develops throughout the morning. Kate.",

Apparently, FBI and U.S. Army Special Operations Command were conducting a training exercise in Downtown Boston at around 10Now, we did get a statement from the FBI and they told CNN that, \"It was meant, the training exercise, to stimulate -- or simulate,\" I should say, \"a situation that their personnel might encounter in a deployed environment.\" Based on inaccurate information, they were mistakenly sent to the wrong room and detained an individual rather than the intended role player here. Now, they do say, thankfully, no one was injured. But obviously going to raise a lot of questions about these training exercises moving forward. And we actually have the police call that was made at around 12:30 a.m. on Wednesday about this incident. Here's what they said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Speaking of something else that really freaks folks out who like to fly or have to for work, close calls on America's runways.This morning, there are demands for the Federal Aviation Administration, that's the FAA, to take action. There have been multiple runway close calls this year. Here's just a quick recap of just a few of those. In January at JFK, a Delta flight aborted its takeoff when an American Airlines -- you see the animation there -- crossed into its path. The two came within 1,000 feet of each other about the length of a cruise ship. Recording showed the American Airlines person or pilot misconstrued directions from air traffic controllers. Then, in February in Austin, a FedEx cargo plane was trying to land and nearly ended up -- and look at this, how close that came on top of a Southwest flight that was taking off from the same runway. Take a look at what it looked like from inside the cockpit. It was terrifying. And again, these are animations that you're looking at. And then, just a few weeks later in Boston, a Learjet took off without clearance and missed a JetBlue flight that was trying to land by less than 600 feet. That is dangerously close. Thankfully nobody was hurt in any of those incidents. So, how is the FAA planning to fix this? Well, staffing might be one of the big issues. Our Pete Muntean is here with us. You are also a pilot. Tell us what is the first order of business for the FAA at this point?",

      "sentences": "Well, right now, the FAA is simply trying to remind pilots and air traffic controllers to be more vigilant, and they are trying to hire more air traffic controllers. This is big admission by the FAA where it says, it simply does not have enough air traffic controllers in the New York area, And now, it is giving airlines an opportunity to scale back on the number of flights. They operate to Newark, JFK and LaGuardia this summer to try and avoid and stem off even worse, cancelations and delays.We're hearing from American Airlines, it says it's going to scale back the number of flights. Delta and JetBlue, they say they are considering it. But this problem is so acute in New York at New York Terminal Radar Approach Control, that's a facility that operates the airspace going into New York planes, descending and taking off, after they leave the area of the control tower. The staffing there is only about half staffing, 54 percent of what it should be, according to the National Air Traffic Controllers Association. Nationwide, this issue is getting really a big problem as well. We're talking about two in every 10 air traffic controller jobs nationwide are empty. The National Air Traffic Controllers Association, the union of air traffic controllers says this is a huge problem. It's also contributing to the safety issues. We've seen the number of controllers dropped by 10 percent over the last decade, Sara.",

      "sentences": "There's so many layers to air traffic control. It's hard to sum up pretty quickly, although the rules are really written in blood. And now, the FAA says they want to staff up at some air traffic control facilities by having some extra vigilance in towers, meaning supervisors looking over the shoulder of air traffic controllers, trying to alleviate some of that pressure. It is a really stressful job, like you mentioned, and it can be incredibly busy.The big thing here that Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg says is that there's a bit of a rust that is happening at multiple different levels of the aviation system. That means pilots and air traffic controllers, remember, with both pilots and air traffic controllers' retirements went up over the pandemic, new people are coming up and through much more quickly. So, there is a bit of a brain drain, and that's something that the FAA is trying to deal with, something that airlines are trying to deal with as well, Sara.

Yesterday, Kevin McCarthy, the speaker of the house, defiant, John, saying that he's going to meet with whoever he wants whenever he wants, and that neither friend nor foe is going to tell him or dictate the terms of his meetings.He met yesterday with Taiwan's president, and they shored up the U.S. relationship with Taiwan, discussing issues that were pertinent, including ensuring that Taiwan's economic growth with the United States continues on trade agreements, as well as discussing trade deals with transferring weapons to Taiwan and ensuring that that might happen in a speedier and quicker way. That is something that President Tsai made clear she wanted to see happen from the United States. I think the important thing to underscore here is the fact that this is a bipartisan position, that it wasn't just House Speaker Kevin McCarthy going out on a limb and having this meeting, but he was flanked at his press conference with Republican and Democratic lawmakers. You saw Peter Aguilar, who's a Democratic leader, also speaking yesterday, talking about the importance of making it clear that the U.S. China relationship is one that is important but that it is also important to continue the relationship with Taiwan. Here's what House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said about that relationship. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA):  The friendship between the people of Taiwan and America as a matter of profound importance to the free world.

This is what it looks like further back.Back here, John, they are still protesting relatively peacefully. But you can see how many people are out here. You can hear their anger, their determination, but it is hardcore of far more extremist elements that we've seen for the last couple of weeks really taking on the police at the front of the marches week after week. We've also been seeing examples of allegations of police brutality and exchange. There are some 45 internal police investigations underway just from the last few weeks accused -- looking into these allegations of some pretty heavy-handed tactics. And this is what we expected further up. They've deployed 11,500 policemen across streets of France to try and keep this protest come again. But it is a growingly noisy and violent black bloc group, as they call it here, that takes on the police at the front of his marches that's proven remarkably difficult to keep under control. Bear in mind, John, that the streets of Paris are still pretty littered, not as bad as they were, but there are still a lot of uncollected trash out there, that tends to get lit. And you get a lot of tear gas and a lot of anger expressed very physically between police forces and the most radical members of this march, John.",
