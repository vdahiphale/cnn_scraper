He argued that the top board at Harvard did not do its homework before hiring Claudine Gay. Let me read what Sam Lessin said to me. He said, \"I believe in Harvard, I love Harvard, but the university's clearly in a weak spot.\" Lessin is hoping to fix Harvard by getting elected to the university's board of overseers. He's scrambling to gather enough signatures to get on the ballot. Now to make his case that Harvard needed to be fixed, he pointed to a drop in early applications at Harvard. Those applications fell by 17 percent to four-year lows. That is early admission applications. Now we should note that the cutoff date for early admission at Harvard was November 1st. That was before Claudine Gay testified before Congress, and before these plagiarism allegations really emerged. But it is also after some of these anti-Semitism issues on campus. So, listen, clearly, it has been a tumultuous time at Harvard. The Harvard brand has taken nearly 400 years to build. But it has definitely taken a hit over just the last few months.",

Things starting to ease up and get a little better going into Sunday.But some of these images have been incredible. Some of these massive waves that the Weather Service is calling this event exceptional, something that we haven't seen in many years. And the rip currents we have seen are extreme. They are dangerous. They're warning people to stay out of the water! Here is the culprit. You can see this massive storm in the Pacific swirling towards the west coast. It is picking up winds of the ocean. That is what is picking up these waves. You can see that here. Look at these waves -- the wind, rather, over the ocean. That is what is kicking up the waves. You can see them starting to die down going into Sunday. That is when things will start to improve. But what's happening is you have strong winds pushing the ocean around. That is creating small waves. You also have an ocean current, as well. Some of these waves could start to collide and clash and then you get the rogue wave, which winds up being two times the size of everyone around it. And they can be very unpredictable. That is what happened yesterday. You can see the wave heights, again, up to 20 feet for most of the California coast. And then dying down going into Sunday. This is what is prompting the warnings, the high-surf warnings for these waves up to 25 feet from Santa Barbara down to San Diego. You can see about 20-foot waves possible near San Francisco. That could also cause the inland flooding. But you also have high tide happening on Saturday, and it's the highest tide of the month. Adding insult to injury, getting you some of that inland flooding. Here's a look at that storm. Bringing some heavy rain to California today. It doesn't really make it too far past the Rockies. It starts to die down. You might have some snow in the Great Lakes going into New Year's but, overall, we had this big dry area of high pressure that sits over most of the U.S. by the time we get to New Year's. So here is your New Year's evening forecast. If you are headed out for the holiday, temperatures in the 40s up in New York. If you are headed to the ball drop, you will have wind chills in the 30s. Pretty chilly as we ring in the new year.",

Ohio Governor Mike DeWine vetoing a bill banning gender affirming bills for minors. He said that signing the bill would be saying that the state knows whether it is medically better for a child than their parents. This bill sought to prohibit care for trans and non-binary use, including hormone therapies, surgical procedures and some mental health services. Ohio state lawmakers passed House Bill 68 just before the holiday break. The veto comes after about 20 states passed laws against gender-affirming care for minors. And a historic milestone. L'Oreal cosmetics heiress is now the first woman worth $100 billion. Francois Bettencourt Meyers was already the richest woman in the world. Bloomberg's Billionaire Index reports her fortune crossed the $100 billion mark thanks to a rise in L'Oreal stock, which hit a record high on Thursday.
