France has just banned all large-scale events, effective immediately amid fears that nightfall will bring more violent protests. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) The streets of Paris and many other French cities burned for a third straight night on Thursday as protests over the fatal shooting of a French teenager turned into riots and looting. At the root of it all, allegations of racism and strong-arm tactics by police in mostly working-class multiracial suburbs outside Paris. Nearly 900 people were arrested or detained, and close to 250 police officers were injured while clashing with protesters on Thursday. Authorities say some 200 government buildings were vandalized and a swimming venue being constructed for the 2024 Olympics was torched by flames. Well, transportation and other public services are being affected. A dozen buses were burned at one depot, and the U.K. has warned its citizens about travel to France at this time, while Germany expressed concern about the violence. Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron cut short a visit with other E.U. leaders on Friday, so he could return to Paris and hold this crisis meeting. EMMANUEL MACRON, FRENCH PRESIDENT (through translator): A third of those detained last night are young, some very young. It's the responsibility of their parents to keep them at home. It's important for the tranquility of all that parents exercise their responsibility. I call for the sense of responsibility of fathers and mothers. It is not the Republic's mission to stand in for them. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (on-camera): I think that's a big concern here. The bus station behind me here was targeted overnight last night. Buses were burned. And clearly, when, you know, the French presidency and that crisis cabinet of President Macron, they decide to shut down all bus and tram services in the country. It speaks to that concern, not just here in Paris, but elsewhere, that concern that public transport can be affected, that it will become the target again. If you compare the number of police here that were on duty last night, forty thousand compared to the number who were on duty at the peak of the pensions protests a short time ago, that was 13,000. So, it really speaks to that issue and concern of how big this can grow. Nineteen hundred cars set on fire in the past 24 hours and the flames circling this capital. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Bordeaux tires set afire. And above the Mediterranean port city Marseille, huge plumes of smoke rising. Its old historic library set on fire. France's president cutting short a trip to Belgium, calling in his ministers for a crisis cabinet meeting. His message? MACRON (through translator): We all condemn this pure and unjustifiable violence, which no longer has any legitimacy. A third of those detained are young, sometimes very young.

It comes amid charges of abuse of power and misuse of public resources. Four out of the seven judges voted to find Bolsonaro guilty. Two more judges are set to vote later in the day. CNN's Julia Vargas joins us from Sao Paulo, Brazil. And Julia, as I understand it, the charges stem from a meeting Bolsonaro held with ambassadors in July of 2022 in which he spread false information about Brazil's electoral system and brought its credibility into question.

So, that's 2022 in July, he called a meeting with over 40 ambassadors, the international community present, and he said things such as the results of the 2022 elections, which he lost, would not be reliable due to fraud, which he did not substantiate. He did not provide any proof of this to the ambassadors at the time. He said voting machines had changed the choices of voters in the previous election in 2018 to those of his opponents. He also said, insinuated that the electoral and judicial authorities, the ones that are actually judging him right now, had been protecting terrorists. Also, Christina, he said that the voting machines in Brazil were not audible. All of this was broadcast in Brazil's public television, EBC, and also on YouTube. There was so much fake information there, false information, fake news, that YouTube took down the streaming, the live stream of that meeting in 2022, because it did not comply with its fake news policies. All of that coming to a head today, but Bolsonaro did say that he will be appealing this decision, he maintains that he did not lie about anything, that he was only showing the system's possible flaws.

But this really does seem like it will upend public accommodation laws all across the country. And what do I mean by that? Well, this was a Colorado law that said business owners, you cannot discriminate against same sex couples, for example. Well, this website designer said that I am involved in creative, expressive speech as part of my business. I should not be then compelled to speak on issues that I don't believe in. In this case, same-sex marriage. And the court saying, yes, that this Colorado law violated her free speech rights by essentially compelling her to speak and creating potentially these wedding websites for same-sex couples. The liberal justices here, this was a 6-3 case. So, the three liberal justices, they once again wrote a biting dissent like we saw yesterday in the affirmative action case. They read part of their dissent from the bench, which is also something that is relatively rare and they warned, as they had in the arguments, that this case could lead to a form of discrimination. Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote, you know, for the first time in its history, this decision is granting a business open to the public a constitutional right to refuse to serve members of that public. So, that is the big concern here. We'll see how this actually plays out in the coming weeks and months. And then, of course, we had the big ruling about student loan debt forgiveness. The Supreme Court striking down a Biden program that had sought to relieve debt for more than 40 million Americans, up to $20,000 in debt for individuals. The Supreme Court saying that the Biden administration just did not have the power to remove this much debt, a program that would amount to $400 billion. So, a big strike to the Biden administration. We'll see if they try to come up with some other sort of plan. But for student loan borrowers who may have been banking on this decision, they will not be getting that relief that they were looking for and in this country student loan payments are set to resume. They've been on pause because of COVID. The payments are set to resume on October 1st. So, a lot of head, a lot of head, a lot of seismic changes from this court that has come down along essentially party lines in the past two days. The 6-3 court making major changes. Christina.",

Sweden allowed the Quran burning protest, citing the right to free expression. But Iraq's President says it violates the right to free thought and faith. The man was the only person apart from his translator at the Stockholm demonstration which coincided with the Muslim holiday of Eid al- Adha. And Nigerians are facing skyrocketing fuel costs after the government ended its fuel subsidies. That caused fuel prices to nearly triple earlier this month. Cheap gasoline has been a part of daily life for Nigerians for decades. And the last time the government tried to remove fuel subsidies in 2012, it sparked nationwide protests.

The petrol prices rose immediately and they're nearly triple. And that has had a knock on effect on transport costs. People -- we just had the Eid celebrations, the Muslim festivals, and transporters telling us that they did not make a single trip, whereas people would have been traveling back home to spend that holiday time with their families. The transport costs are just prohibitive for many Nigerians who are watching what they're spending right now. So, this specific transporter in the capital of Burja told us he did not make a single trip during the Eid festival, which is extremely rare. And other belt tightening measures are being taken. People are carpooling, that's also very rare here. And they're cycling, which as many people know in streets of Lagos can be somewhat perilous. And you're just seeing people generally losing their disposable income. Even the middle classes are complaining fiercely about the hardships ahead. And, well, it must be said that President Tinubu has succeeded where other presidents have failed in removing this subsidy. Many agree that it's not sustainable for the finances of the country to drain on public finance, but it has been an unpopular measure. In 2012, I remember the protest then led to what was called \"Occupy Nigeria\" when President Jonathan tried to remove that and the country was brought to a standstill for two weeks. But now, there's just a general acceptance that the subsidy must go, but some are criticizing the abrupt manner that it was taken away. Where are the cushions? Nothing has really been announced about the safety net for the poorest Nigerians. This is one of the poorest countries with some of the poorest people in the world. So, not much has been really announced as to how they will be helped to transition, to make this transition into the very tough times that lay ahead. Christina.",

And especially on the grass court, he's won seven titles there. He's playing his best tennis at the moment. It seems like the older he gets, the better he plays. So, yes, Carlos Alcaraz is seated number one. But I still think that Novak Djokovic goes in as the heavy favorite. Why? Because he won a couple of Grand Slam titles already this year. He's capable of playing on every surface and especially on grass court. He plays on grass court like it's clay court, it is hard court and it's so hard to move on that surface. And also, his experience comes into play.",

On the women's side, we know Iga Swiatek's fresh from her French Open win earlier this year, chasing her fifth title, but I believe she's never advanced past the quarterfinals at Wimbledon. So, how do you see her this fortnight and who else should we be keeping an eye out for?",

      "sentences": "I mean, if you look at the paper, of course, Iga Swiatek goes in as the favorite. She's played the most, the best tennis at the moment. She'swon so many Grand Slam titles, five in the short period of time, but she has her problems on the grass court, especially with the forehands. She's got a pretty extreme grip. That's why she's never went deep into the tournament, so far. So, she does face some challenges there. Also, we don't know how she's feeling. She had to pull out of the tournament of the semifinals in Germany just yesterday. So, she had some food poisoning, so, we'll have to see how she feels physically. But, of course, then you have Elena Rybakina, who won the title last year, and Aryna Sabalenka. I mean the two of them haven't probably played the best tennis on a grass court, but they certainly are capable because they have big serves and they have really powerful ground strokes, and they seem to be enjoying the grass court, as well. But let's not forget Schibahara (ph), a finalist last year. She has the finesse with the slice with the drop shot. So, you never know what's happening with her. So, you have to be aware and ready. And then one dark horse for me would be Petra Kvitova. She won the title two times already in Wimbledon. She just won a title in Berlin on the grass court not long ago. So, it's gonna be interesting I think on the women's side. There's no complete favorite to me, but all the girls who I've mentioned, I think they have a good, good chance.",

Obviously, this will be the first year that women will be allowed to wearcolored underpants or shorts beneath their skirts to alleviate the stress of playing while on their periods. I mean, I don't know about you, but it feels to me like this was long overdue. As a former player yourself, perhaps, I mean, how much would you have welcomed this option during your time at Wimbledon? Finally, the time has come and we all know traditions are traditions and don't like to be broken and changed, but that was definitely necessary. Yes, I've played in Wimbledon many times and I've played Wimbledon when I was on my period and it's very uncomfortable if you have to wear all white because that can always be a little accident. So, I think it's a relief for a lot of women because on any other events you can wear dark underpants, you can wear red ones if you want to. You can pretty much wear whatever you want, but not in Wimbledon. So, I think that was a step into the right direction. There was a lot of relief, I think, from female tennis players, as well. And now it's their choice if they still want to play in all white or if they want to throw in a little bit of color. So, I think it's a good thing.",

And then she was also entering a couple of Legends events. For example, at the French Open and also in Wimbledon she's going to play the Legends events I believe, so, when the statement came out, I was a little bit surprised and I was wondering, hmm, I wonder why she's doing that. But then I was thinking, why not? She's only 33 years old. Tennis is her big passion. She wants to tell the world pretty much it is possible to come back after having two kids to play professional tennis. I think she's actually gonna do really well. Of course, she's not match fit. She will need a little bit of time, you know, to get used to playing tournaments, playing matches. It's completely different than playing in practice, but she was number one in the world. She won a grand slam title. She was one of the fittest and fastest players out there. And I definitely think that she can do some damage also to the top players nowadays. The one thing I'm looking forward to see is how she will handle all the power from all these women we've been talking about, like Iga Swiatek, Sabalenka and Rybakina, for example. But it's exciting.
