Why? Well, Trump says so. Plus, make-or-break night for Nikki Haley. She's meeting with some of the richest people in America tonight. Will they keep giving her the cash to take on Trump? A GOP donor who just left that fund raiser is OUTFRONT next. And any takers? Elon Musk looking for the next volunteers to have a computer chip implanted into your brain. Let's go OUTFRONT And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, impeachment. House Republicans taking a major step tonight towards impeaching the sitting cabinet official, something that has not been done in 148 years in the United States. The target is the Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. And they are working right now and frankly expected to keep working well past midnight. They're making the claim that Mayorkas has committed high crimes and misdemeanors. That would, of course, justify impeachment. What they are not working on though, is stopping people from coming over the U.S. southern border. They could be meeting to discuss the bipartisan border security bill negotiated by GOP senators. A bill that Republicans and Democrats involved in drafting say will be the strictest border legislation in America in decades. So, why are GOP House members not meeting to stem the tide at the southern border? Well, the answer is because Trump said. Trump has said supporting a bill, the bill here that we're talking about would be a, quote, gift to the radical left Democrats. So, Trump's loyal lemmings are getting in line to kill the bill. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE (R-GA): I just heard Speaker Johnson saying it's absolutely dead, which is what I wanted to hear.",

The GOP led effort to impeach the Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, back in November, you voted to stall another Republican attempt to impeach him. At the time, you told me, Congressman, Secretary Mayorkas has not competed in -- committed, I'm sorry, an impeachable offense. Do you still believe that or do you support this effort to impeach him now? REP. KEN BUCK (R-CO): Let me just say I agree with Professor Turley that the impeachment clause is a narrow clause and it requires a high crime or misdemeanor or something akin to that. It isn't necessarily a convicted -- a conviction in court. But I do believe that there has to be some very, very egregious act that that is just like a crime.
