The Ukrainians once again continuing that counter offensive, that to them is so very important. Of course, the main goal that they have and still have is to reach the city of Kherson and that's exactly where the Russians have now started evacuating people from.And also you're absolutely right, Wolf, the top general of the Russian saying for them, the situation down is very tense. Here's what we're learning. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) PLEITGEN (voice-over): As Ukrainian forces press their counter offensive in the country south, Russia is resorting to what appear to be increasingly desperate measures in the areas they control in the Kherson region. Thousands of people waiting to be evacuated by boat. The puppet authorities installed by Moscow claiming they've already taken some 15,000 out of Kherson city. Why did you decide to evacuate the reporter asks. I have a small child to take care of you see, the woman answers. Russia says its fairing these people to safety. The Ukrainian say these are little more than deportations. Russia has imposed martial law in this and other areas of Ukraine controlled by its forces. The Russians say they are increasing the intensity of their mobilization effort. Russian President Vladimir Putin visiting soldiers outside Moscow and himself even firing a sniper rifle. And Putin's continued aerial assault on Ukraine's energy infrastructure is starting to take a toll. Ukraine's authorities announcing the need for partial blackouts in most of the country as intense strikes on power plants continue using cheap kamikaze drones which Kyiv says Iran has provided to the Russian army. The spokeswoman for Russia's Foreign Ministry rejecting the allegations. MARIA ZAKHAROVA, RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESWOMAN (through translator): This is nothing more than a collection of unsubstantiated inferences and farfetched assumptions that Britain and France are trying to build into a structure. And every time it all collapses in front of everyone. PLEITGEN (voice-over): But on Russian T.V., this military expert and Defense Ministry adviser seem to admit the origin of the drones not realizing as mic was hot, he tells the host -- RUSLAN PUKHOV, RUSSIAN MILITARY ANALYST (through translator): Let's not shake the boat too much. We all know that they are Iranian, but the authorities did not admit that. PLEITGEN (voice-over): But the Russians are now admitting things are not going well on the battlefield.

And it was, you know, very thorough, it had kind of a pad for sleeping, weapons, shoes, boots, they looked at the boots, etc. Why that's important is that if you listen, and you read Russian social media right now, a lot of families are saying those boys are going off to fight without adequate gear. And so there's a lot of concern about that. Families say that they have to buy their own gear for their guys.

CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), U.S. AIR FORCE: So I'm watching both of those areas, Wolf, and of course the northeast where Fred is right now because what we're looking at is the possibility of the Russians trying to mount a three sided offensive against the Ukrainians. So they'd be coming from the north -- the northeast and the south. If they do that, that, of course, puts a lot of pressure on the Ukrainian troops, a lot of pressure on their ability to defend this territory. Can they do it? I think they can.

They are seasoned battle hardened fighters who have been in Syria and other places, many of them and are now very effective on the battlefield here as well. The updates that we're getting from the Ukrainians is that they're hanging on to Bakhmut, but it is very difficult for them, and it's strategically very important for the Russians.

All of us have had the experience of taking a shower in some old hotel where there's a long lag between when you turn the faucet and when the temperature of the water changes. And when you're in that situation, you turn the faucet and you turn the faucet and nothing happens, and then all of a sudden you scalded yourself. And so it's hard to control any system when your steering wheel is operating with a lag. So certainly anything's possible with the Fed.I think the best chance that the Fed has of maximizing employment through time is being firm and resolute and realistic about inflation. I think it's taken them quite a long time to get there, but I think that's where they are right now. And Chairman Powell is making clear his commitment to do what's necessary to contain inflation. Most of that has already happened. Mortgage rates were 3 percent, now they're 7 percent. I don't think they may go a bit higher, I certainly not going to go up anything like anything, even remotely approaching another four percentage points. So we've seen most of the adjustment. And now what we're going to have to do is wait and watch and see how the economy plays out. And the Feds going to have to fine tune around the path that it has set. If the economy is stronger than the cars going faster, then you have to hit the brake a little harder. If the economy is softening and slowing, then you're going to go back the other -- then you can go back the other way. And that's a judgment the Feds going to have to make as the data come in. But I think it's pretty clear now in an economy where the latest core inflation measures were close to seven and the interest rate is still three, that the path the Fed is on, the path of raising interest rates were certainly going to need some more of that.",

I think the Biden administration could think about a range of measures to reduce costs, making it easier for business, for energy companies to start drilling or fracking for oil and natural gas. Reducing tariffs where that would mean lower prices and less inflationary pressure. Doing away with regulations, like the Jones Act, rules about shipping, that raise prices needlessly, for example, moving oil from Houston to Newark. We could get rid of all kinds of rules that require people who are going to manicure fingernails or cut hair, to have licenses, and that makes those kinds of tasks in short supply and makes them more expensive than they otherwise would be.So, you know, during the period when we had inflation in the 1970s, Jimmy Carter and Edward Kennedy and Justice Breyer worked together to deregulate airlines, and that's made travel a lot more affordable, and it made a bit of a contribution with respect to inflation during that time.

He's going to be subpoenaed, and that could come very soon. And there has to be somebody who's the point person.

There's going to be fundamental distrust here. There's a second problem, and that is, why does the Trump team get to decide the pace of the investigation? Why did they get to decide when and where the Department of Justice gets to go? And finally, the biggest problem I have with this, let's say there is an agreement, and the Department of Justice approves this, investigators go in and let's say two weeks, don't find anything. Two weeks after that, the Department of Justice and the FBI gets specific information about documents still at Mar-a-Lago. What does the FBI do then? Go back Mar-a-Lago and say we want to search another time? That is a big problem. If I'm the Department of Justice, I'm saying you didn't do your homework before?

CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta is joining us right now. Sanjay, RSV cases are on the rise right now potentially putting enormous pressure on hospitals all over the country. What exactly are hospitals experiencing right now?DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. Well, a lot of hospitals are seeing numbers unlike they've seen before. I can tell you in Atlanta here, for example, two to three times the number of patients with RSV that they would typically see this time a year. Let me give you a little bit of a snapshot here. Since sort of the beginning of August, over the last couple of months, if you look at sort of the number of daily RSV cases, you see that they've gone up significantly. This represents about 10 percent of the population of the country. So you can extrapolate that to the country, getting to some pretty large numbers of kids being diagnosed with RSV. Those are kids who actually get tested. The real numbers are probably higher than that. But as you mentioned, there's some hospitals then where they're getting a lot of kids who are sick enough to then need hospitalization, sometimes need intensive care, oxygen therapy and things like that. Connecticut Children's Hospital, for example. Give you a sort of an idea there. Over the last 10 days, they've seen 100 patients with this diagnosis. This is unlike any October, they typically have seen because typically these patients are seen later in the sort of season here, later in the year. So they're even talking about, Wolf, things that we've heard about over the last couple of years setting up mobile tents and things like that to possibly handle the surge. Hopefully, it doesn't come to that. But that's sort of the planning that's going on in hospitals, like Connecticut Children, and others around the country.",
