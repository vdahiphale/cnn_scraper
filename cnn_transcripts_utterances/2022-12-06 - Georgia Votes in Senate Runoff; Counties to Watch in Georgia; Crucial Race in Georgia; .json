And we're kind of seeing the reflection of what we saw in those days of early voting here this morning. According to Gabriel Sterling, the chief operating officer of the Georgia Secretary of State's Office, they estimate more than 100,000 Georgians have actually cast their ballots today, but the average wait time is around two minutes. They say processing, which is when you step up to actually go and sign in from the time they go and vote is under a minute. And so we're seeing a stark difference from those extremely long lines, especially on the first and second and last day of early voting. Remember, on Friday, more than 350,000 people voted on that day. So, it seems like, if you haven't voted yet, and you're a registered voter in Georgia, today is a good day to go out and you're not going to have to potentially wait so long.",

Joining us now to talk about all of this, Kevin Riley, editor in chief for \"The Atlanta Journal-Constitution,\" and David Swerdlick, CNN political commentator and senior staff editor for \"The New York Times\" Opinion. Good to see you both this morning. You know, it feels like, Kevin, we have dissected this race every single way we can. I think it's important to dive down on those counties, as John just showed us. But we've looked the ad spending. We've looked at early vote turnout. We've looked at polling. Is there anything you think, especially from this national perspective, Kevin, that we have missed leading into election day here for this runoff? KEVIN RILEY, EDITOR IN CHIEF, \"THE ATLANTA JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION\": Well, it's hard to think of anything that's been missed. This race has gotten so much attention and so much polling. But here, if you want to keep it simple today to try to figure out what's going to happen, think of it this way. If we went back to the election a month ago, Raphael Warnock would have won if we only counted early voting, and Herschel Walker would have won if we only counted election day voting. So, the real question today is, who can run up the score? Can Warnock run up the score enough with all of that early voting, or will enough people come out on election day for Walker so that he can run up the score? Who knows? I mean I -- everyone's guess - everyone's guessing. But I think it's very hard to tell because we've never had a runoff in Georgia with -- that just went four weeks after the election. So, things are very different this time than they've been in the past.",

Basically, what this bulletin said, and it's so chilling, is that domestic violent extremists who are racially motivated would see an attack as an opportunity to cause societal breakdown and thus prompt a race war.It is so chilling, it is so alarming, and it follows a pattern that we've seen from other federal officials. The Department of Homeland Security had warned earlier this year that the electrical grid could be a target for domestic violent extremists. A similar alarm was raised November 30th when DHS renewed a national threat assessment bulletin that basically said the same thing, that critical infrastructure among many targets are attractive ways for domestic violent extremists to mobilize to violence. So, all of these alarms. Now what is happening here in North Carolina now proving that those alarms are not without merit. It is -- it is a shocking event here and law enforcement now scrambling to try to figure out who did this and why. Officials releasing very little details, saying only that, yes, these two substations were fired upon. They sustained millions of dollars' worth of damage. At one of those substations, a gate that leads to the substation was taken off of its hinges. But other than that, we have very little detail about what happened. So, we are now turning to state officials, like Governor Roy Cooper, who is saying very plainly this was a targeted attack. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. ROY COOPER (D-NC): This was a specific act. The person or persons knew what they were doing and what it took to disable this substation. So, what we're going to have to do is to work with state and federal officials, and I think this needs to be a national conversation about the level of security that we have at these substations across the country.
