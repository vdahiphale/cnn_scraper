They also have a picture of a car, so they have another lead. Now, they don't seem to have that car because the instructions they give are if anyone sees this car.When you look at that photo of the car, and maybe we can bring it up while we're talking, it seems to be stopped with the headlights on, the engine running, the door open. So, there's some good possibility that this is captured from a surveillance video where he rolled up in the car, left the door open, ran in, opened fire, ran back out, got in the car. They don't give a license plate on the car, but it's not visible from the shot. And they say it may have a black bumper in the rear, which suggests they don't have that car in custody. If they did, they would at least know who the registered owner is. So, really, what they're relying on now is a couple of competing interests. One is they're telling everybody, stay inside, don't go outside. But if you are outside and you see the individual in this picture or you see this car, call us immediately.",

The first -- if you listen to Scanner Traffic, the first calls were coming in just after 7And then the second location that was reported is a bar, a bar and grill that's only about ten minutes away from that bowling alley. So, there's no lot of talk about -- you know, we now know the suspect's car that the police are looking for. Certainly, ten minutes away, it's relatively nearby. There was also a third location that a local newspaper reported, the Sun Journal, talking about a Walmart distribution center, where there may have been additional shootings, and that is only about three minutes away from the bar. So, clearly a very small area, and we're talking about not a huge population. Lewiston is only about 40 miles north of Portland. It's only has about 36,000 people. Authorities have called on the folks in Lewiston as well as Auburn, which is about two miles away, so a neighboring town to shelter in place as they look for this suspect in this mass casualty event, and, again, at least the third mass shooting this month.",

They obviously don't want innocent people out and about, A, in the way of law enforcement. But it appears if you just look at the locations where the suspect opened fire, these were both places where crowds would gather. You have a bar and you have a bowling alley.And so they certainly don't want any type of group that is congregating to continue doing so. If you are, they're asking for people to shelter in place, again, to not provide an additional possible point of fire for the suspect. But there's a lot of work going on behind the scenes right now that's being fed into those officers that are actually out there on the street that are looking. You know, after these incidents, authorities will go back and look for security camera footage around the incident. Again, they're trying to establish a pattern of travel of this individual, you know, going to businesses, if they're open at this hour, going into residences to figure out, you know, if you have a Ring doorbell camera, do they see this vehicle on that camera or the likeness of the suspect moving in a potential direction. That is a lot of work that happens behind the scenes. Of course, Abby, this is all happening while they're still in a tactical state. They don't know where this individual is. So, the very notion of approaching a particular place, they have to be on guard because they don't know if that individual could have secreted himself somewhere around that incident. One thing is clear, this person certainly had the intention to cause indiscriminate mass killing. You just look at the number of victims at these incidents. And so, certainly, they have a lot of work ahead of them. Beyond that, you have these other resources that are being brought to bear. John mentioned the ATF, for example. Every crime scene where you have a gun that is fired, that high-powered assault-style rifle that we saw in that photo will eject a shell casing that they then can use to analyze to figure out if they can find the identity of the gun owner. Now, having that vehicle, if that vehicle is indeed registered to that individual, that obviously accelerates identification. And then the last part is the public itself, trying to crowdsource, getting that image out there that we've been showing, for two reasons. First, if someone in and around that immediate area sees this individual, they certainly want you to call police. But, second, if you know this person, we've seen both the front vantage point of that individual, they also put out the side profile shot, every detail down to the facial hair is potentially important. Because if you know this person that has a beard like this individual, or this appears to be someone that you know or someone that you see, that is important for both a public safety standpoint and also an investigative standpoint. And then, lastly, just to state the obvious, but this is certainly on the minds of officers that are out there. This is happening at nighttime, under the cover of darkness, making the work of law enforcement that much more difficult as they fan out trying to find this mass shooter, Abby.",

So, they'll have all the resources they need to make up for the fact that they just don't have it internally like you would in New York or Chicago or what have you.The more time that passes -- obviously, he's mobile. The key is to see whether or not they've got a license tag on that vehicle. The photographs are good enough that if you know this person, you can identify him and you could give a name. That might be what's going on right now is that they may have an I.D., they may have an idea of who this individual is, and they're trying to track them down. But the person is mobile and they could be anywhere now. They could be out of the area. This looks like it's something that was planned to me. You asked earlier what makes it unusual.

You're going to have people getting injured that way as well.But the type of weapon that that person has that they're using, the wounds are absolutely devastating on the human body. And it's unfortunate, but many people just simply bleed out from their wounds, even if they're not struck initially in a vital organ. The damage done to the body is such that a person can very easily bleed out if not given immediate medical attention. And so the fact that they were, you know, medevacing people out, I don't know what the surge capacity is for that particular hospital, maybe not all that much. Again, we're talking about a small town, but the longer it takes people to get into a trauma center, the more likely it is that, you know, their lives are seriously at risk.",

Dr. Reiner, we have been here many times before with these incidents, shooting incidents with rifles, long guns. And in this case though, we have a large number of victims going to a small number of hospitals. Our previous guest just told us there are two medical facilities.

And techs is composed of surgeons and ER docs and critical care docs and anesthesiologists. All of whom are important in the management of a single patient. You know, at GW Hospital where I work, when there is a trauma that arrives in the ER, eight physicians, including residents and three nurses, converge on that patient. Now, in a mass trauma event like this, you have to pair the teams down into much smaller units. So, what will happen is there'll be a call out to the medical staff in the hospital and it will essentially be all hands-on deck. But for a hospital that already perhaps has a busy emergency room, the ER is going to have to clear space. You know, when I was a resident in New York in the early 1990s, an airliner crashed on Long Island and there were dozens of survivors and our hospital got 20 major trauma patients and to manage those patients, we had to move all the patients out of the ER and put them in the cafeteria along with people assigned to take care of them and then await this onslaught of patients with penetrating trauma, multiple broken bones, all kinds of unstable injuries. And that's what these hospitals in Maine are getting set to do. Maine only has, I think, three level one trauma centers. So, if there are indeed over 50 people with penetrating gunshot wounds, then that will quickly overwhelm the ability of the hospitals in Maine to take these patients, and they'll have to start to look at transporting patients who can be transported to nearby states.",

Well, that's a military style assault rifle. And from the looks of it, he's had some training with that weapon. He knows how to handle it. He's got his hands in the right place.

They've already put a picture of the car out.",

The shooter takes his own life or engages with police or tries to take their lives. In this case, the shooter made a definitive effort, a deliberate effort to get away, to get away from the first location, to commit the second part of the crime, to get away again.So, we have to ask ourselves, from a behavioral standpoint, is he getting away because he thinks he's not going to be identified, that he might get away with this crime? Or the worst scenario, is he getting away because he has another target, that he has another location? And when you consider the fact that he's already killed 22 people, he has a military-style assault weapon, he likely has additional ammunition because, as you pointed out, this isn't the kind of thing you thought of at 7 o'clock tonight. History shows us that these things are usually planned and prepared for, and pre-operational surveillance happens, and the obtaining of weapons and the stockpiling of ammunition, we've seen it again and again. So, what is the end game? As our chief from Boston said a few minutes ago, Ed Davis, this is a- a nightmare scenario for police because they know they're not just confronting a criminal, they know not just an armed criminal, but a criminal who is heavily armed and has very little to lose in terms of there's nothing he's going to do beyond killing 22 people that's going to get him in any more trouble. So, from a psychological standpoint, they're going to have to be extraordinarily dynamic and careful at the same time.",

I want to bring into the conversation retired NYPD Sergeant and Detective Felipe Rodriguez.Detective Rodriguez, look, we were just discussing, as our previous guest said, this is law enforcement's worst nightmare -- a potential suspect who appears to know how to use the weapon that he used to carry out this attack. And now he's on the loose, it's late at night, it's very dark. What kind of net is law enforcement casting right now to try to encircle him or capture him tonight?",

The other net that we have to cast as a physical net may be of establishing a perimeter to stop him from causing further damage. You know, as a firearms instructor, I can tell you the body language that he's using, the aggressiveness of holding the firearm. Let me tell you, he is one of the worst nightmares I've ever seen. His ability to shoot with such accuracy and cause such damage, one of the worst pieces I've seen.",

The suspect's picture -- you see there on the screen, is out. There is a manhunt underway right now.Police have also released a photo of his car. We are still right now awaiting a news conference in this incident, but we have also just learned that President Biden has spoken individually to a number of state officials in the state of Maine, including Maine's governor, Janet Mills, the senators, Angus King and Susan Collins, and congressmen in the Maine delegation. President Biden right now at the White House stepping out of a state dinner event right now to receive updates on this incident. I want to go now to Josh Campbell again. Josh, we continue to wait for more information, but as I can imagine, the scramble is on to identify the suspect, to get to people that know him, to get to potentially his home. Can you give us more insight into how police are trying to really dig into who this individual might be?",
