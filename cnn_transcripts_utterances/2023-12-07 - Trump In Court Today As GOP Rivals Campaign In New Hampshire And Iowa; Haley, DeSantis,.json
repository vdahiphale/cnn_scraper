Plus, Liz Cheney is here to talk about not just Trump, not just Kevin McCarthy, but House Speaker Mike Johnson and her fears for what the U.S. might look like in 2025. Plus, the one thing she agrees, with Donald Trump about. It has to do with his assessment of Kevin McCarthy. Meow. And a shocking new investigation, the threats to public officials, lawmakers, and election workers. Who is making them? And why? (MUSIC)",

Trump was just a spectator in court today. He was taking advantage of the presence of the cameras where he can make unchallenged accusations about how this is all a political witch hunt as he runs for president again.Trump also believes having this attention does more for his campaign does and does attending any debate. Hence why he skipped the fourth such gathering last night at a debate where he would have had to share the spotlight, where he might have been challenged, where he might have been criticized, where he might have had to defend his record, where he might have had to string together sentences and interact with other human beings for an entire hour. Heck, he would've had to be standing in one place for an entire hour. Let's bring in CNN's Kara Scannell, outside of the courthouse in Manhattan. Kara, so what actually happened in court today at this event Trump did not have to attend, and yet was complaining about having to attend. And what can we expect when Trump takes the stand on Monday?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Jake. So, this was Trump's ninth time attending his civil fraud trial, but to the first time he has shown up during the defense case. And today, he was here for the testimony of their final expert witness, Eli Bartov, a professor of accounting at New York University. And Bartov was unequivocal in his testimony, he said that the Trump financial statements were not material and stating, he said there is no evidence of accounting fraud, and asked about the attorney general's case. He said the case has absolutely no merit.He said that there were some mistakes on the case, you remember, Trump's triplex apartment at Trump Tower was stated three times larger in terms of square feet and value than it actually was. He said that that was a mistake, not fraud and repeatedly saying over the hours that he's been on the stand today that there was no fraud, and that the attorney general's allegations as he put, it are absurd. Now, the judge in this case has already found that these financial statements have been inflated, and that Trump has committed repeated and persistent fraud by issuing these financial statements to banks, but part of Trump's legal strategy as his lawyers have made clear is that they are laying the grounds for an appeal in this case, so that was the importance of this witnesses testimony. Now, outside of court, as you said, Trump was praising this witness, and also making a lot of other statements inside. His demeanor was very straightforward. Matter of fact, he appeared to be listening to the witnesses testimony, one time walking back into a court from the break, he'd stop to talk to the sketch artist to look at the sketches that they were making, and other times he called over one of the security detail for his legal team, shaking the man's hand. So he definitely had a more relaxed demeanor than we've seen in other times, and as you say Trump will be back on the stand on Monday, the last time he testified, his lawyer had told Trump's attorney that he had to control his client. This time, around Trump will have a lot more leeway in what he says. We expect that testimony to go all day -- Jake.",

The gunman 67-year- old Anthony Polito described himself online as a semi-retired university professor who taught in Georgia, and North Carolina, until 2017. He also taught classes at Rosemont University in Henderson Nevada, until June 30th of 2022.But his connection to Las Vegas and his online profile show an unorthodox approach to teaching, including interest in conspiracy theories, like the mystery of the Zodiac killer and multiple references to Las Vegas, including dozens of links and it's personal, websites. Making more than two dozen trips to Vegas over the last 15 years. Polito's Rate My Professor page for East Carolina University had mostly positive ratings before the shootings, but also multiple references to a, quote, unconventional teaching style, focusing largely on personal anecdotes. Posts dating back to 2014 and 2009 saying he's great, we spend over two months just talking about Vegas, and he loves to go to Las Vegas. Police have not yet released a motive, but a law enforcement source tells CNN the gunman may have been passed over for a job at UNLV, as Las Vegas deals with yet another tragedy, just six years after one of the deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history, more families and friends love to cope with loss and trauma. (END VIDEOTAPE) KAFANOV (on camera):  A law enforcement source tells CNN that the gunman legally purchased this weapon in Las Vegas about 18 months ago, a Taurus PT92 pistol. The school president issuing a statement moments ago writing words are still to hard to come by as we're only beginning to process the grief, loss, anger, and fear.

Now, the good thing a report here, no indication that anybody was hurt, but it certainly caused quite a bit of concern there in that community as the synagogue itself there, at the temple of Israel in Albany, there were several children inside a youth center at the time. So, certainly, having to go into lockdown there, in terms of what we can expect next, authorities say that they're certainly going to bolster law enforcement presence, is certainly it's been the first night of Hanukkah festivities. And as far as the suspect, only 28- year-old man as federal authorities are working to confirm that this was hate motivated -- Jake.",

This was like something happening a couple of years ago where a developer had zoning, and the zoning was done and completed, and this judge didn't like the zoning so he vetoed it and he said (INAUDIBLE) and then the court of appeals overturned him. But this is a case that should have never been brought. This is a witch hunt. This is election interference on a level that is never been seen before, it comes out of the DOJ, the White House in order to hurt a political opponent. Actually, it's driving up my polls because the people of our country get it. The poll numbers are the highest of ever had. The people of our country get it. This is a disgrace to America.
