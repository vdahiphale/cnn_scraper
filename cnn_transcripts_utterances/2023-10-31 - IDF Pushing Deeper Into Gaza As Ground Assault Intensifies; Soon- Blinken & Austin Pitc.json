The IDF is also detailing what it calls the active rescue of one of those hostages, an IDF soldier. Israeli officials say that Hamas was holding her inside a remote building, that's according to Axios. The IDF telling CNN that the soldier has shared information about her captivity with Israeli intelligence officers, which can be used for the future they say. What that means for the efforts today to get more hostages out, not entirely clear. But we do know air attacks are not letting up.

What is it that you see happening here?GEN. WESLEY CLARK (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, they're moving toward the center of gravity, as they see it, of Hamas. And they're moving very deliberately. They're moving with full security. They're drawing the resistance into them. They're forcing Hamas to maneuver they're picking up then intelligence from that maneuver and using it for targeting And we know from previous incursions that, John, that there is a big tunnel network under northern Gaza.

They don't have enough troops in there yet. But they will be putting more troops and they're going to have to clear the area. You're going to have to go into the buildings, clear the rooms, be on the rooftops, check the basements, go into the tunnels. So this is the beginning of a lot of hard dangerous work of the IDF.",

If they take the fifth, then that will count against them in the case.

You know, the real audience here is not just Judge Engoron, who clearly has profound doubts about the candor of the Trump family. He's made that clear already.Whatever happens is going to be reviewed on appeal. And in particular, John, the penalties, which are in effect already up on appeal and enough for the summary judgment and in effect, a corporate death penalty. So what's going to happen is building the record for appellate review. I think the bottom line is when you look at these papers, it certainly appears as the judge found on partial summary judgment, two sets of books, you just can't do that.
