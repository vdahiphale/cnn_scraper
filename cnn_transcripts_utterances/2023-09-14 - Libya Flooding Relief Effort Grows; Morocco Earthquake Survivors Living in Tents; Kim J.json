The death toll is now approaching 3,000 people, with more than 5,500 people injured. But the injuries are not all physical. After an aftershock Thursday, residents in city of Turandot (ph) told CNN that they have, quote, \"a lot of fear in their hearts.\" CNN's Nada Bashir joins us live from Imgdal, which is about 75 kilometers south of Marrakesh.

We visited some that have been almost entirely flattened by the earthquake. These families have absolutely nothing left. They're living in these temporary shelters, in these camps that have been set up. But the real concern for many of them is the long term solutions. What will their futures look like, will they ever have a home to return to? When will the rebuild effort begin? For now these aid organizations are focused on the immediate relief effort.

They had told us that typically in these situation, there is a concern around the coordination of many groups coming in at the same time. And often this can be a hindrance in some cases. But when you look at how remote some of these villages are in the mountains, some of these roads have only just been cleared and opened. You, can't imagine the difficulty that these teams are facing. For some of these villages it, took two, three days to get rescue teams in to pull people from the rubble. When we spoke to these rescuers, they haven't been able to locate survivors and many of them died within the first day or the first two days. So this is a huge moment of tragedy for Morocco but there is going to be months, if not years ahead, for the country to recover from the impact of this devastation.",

Volker Perthes told the United Nations' secretary (sic) council that the conflict, soon to enter its fifth month, has no resolution in sight. It could be evolving into a full scale civil war. Fierce fighting between the Sudanese armed forces and the Rapid Support Forces has killed at least 5,000 people since the start of the conflict. Perthes also said he will step down from his role. Kim Jong-un's visit to Russia isn't officially over yet but already he and Vladimir Putin are planning another get-together. The Kremlin says Putin has accepted Kim's invitation to visit North Korea. The pair held a rare summit in Russia's far east on Wednesday. With no documents signed and no news conferences, the growing concern in the West though is that the two regimes could seal some sort of arms deal. They have since parted ways, Moscow saying that Kim will stay in the country for a few more days. For more on this, Paula Hancocks is following the developments from Seoul and joins us live.

Vladimir Putin was asked as he was waiting for the North Korean leader, are you going to help Kim Jong-un with his satellite ambitions? He said, this is exactly why we're here. He was very clear as to what he was willing to give, although experts do question how much of this technological knowledge he will actually give to North Korea, given how closely Russia does hold its technological secrets like this. It has a very successful space program. We also heard about the gifts that were given. And one of the gifts that Vladimir Putin gave to Kim Jong-un was a spacesuit glove that had been in space. Keeping with that theme but the entire meeting had a military overtone. And the fact that over the next day or two, however long Kim Jong-un is in the country, his excursions are going to be military based and focused as well Vladimir Putin saying he's going to have a military demonstration by the Russian Pacific fleet. He's going to be going to a factory where they will be producing civilian and military goods. No more details on that. But certainly there is a military focus. It has been very clear from the beginning and it has been very open that they are willing to help each other. Of course the question is, how far will they go, what have they agreed, have they agreed anything.

And it was actually president Vladimir Putin at the time as well. He went in July of that year to meet with Kim Jong-il, the late father of Kim Jong-un.
