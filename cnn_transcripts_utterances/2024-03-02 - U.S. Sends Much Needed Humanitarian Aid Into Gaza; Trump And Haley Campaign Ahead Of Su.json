In a joint operation with Jordan, U.S. aircraft delivered some 38,000 meals. U.S. official saying they chose the drop zone based on need, believing a large number of people to be sheltering near that location. At the same time, a senior U.S. official now saying Israel has, quote, \"basically accepted\" the terms of a ceasefire deal to release more hostages and now the decision falls to Hamas to accept the deal. Priscilla Alvarez is joining us now live from Washington. Priscilla, the White House seems to believe this was a big success, this airdrop of aid today.",

Though, while they're touting it as a success, they are also cautioning that much more is needed as this dire humanitarian crisis continues to unfold in Gaza.Now, as you mentioned there, there were 38,000 meals that were dropped in this region of Gaza that was delivered in 66 bundles. Now it only included food. There was no water or medical supplies. But since that has happened they have noticed, they being officials, that civilians did approach the assistance and have begun distributing it, factoring into them deciding that this was a success. But this is certainly not enough. And that was the message from administration officials today. They're trying to flood the zone and they're doing that through these humanitarian aid drops, and also exploring other avenues, like a maritime corridor. But they're still saying that even with all of that, they need the land crossings to be available to continue to surge aid into Gaza. That's one of the hurdles that continues to remain as the situation unfolds in Gaza. The president himself saying in a tweet earlier today that this is not enough. Now, we expect that there will continue to be more humanitarian aid drops. But again, the big question is how much is -- the big question is how whether this can meet the needs of the people of Gaza. Senior administration official saying this is just one of many steps that needs to be taken.",

Senior administration officials saying that Israel has, quote, \"basically accepted\" the proposal that is on the table which includes a six-week ceasefire in Gaza. Now, what would happen over those six weeks would be that hostages that are deemed most vulnerable, being women, the elderly and the wounded, would be released, and aid into Gaza could be surged in.Then also officials could continue to talk about some of the stickier points like the release of hostages that are IDF members, while also talking about, quote, \"an enduring plan\" in the region. But of course all of this is very sensitive and has been for some time, so no deal is a done deal until it crosses the finish line. But of course, this also comes as Vice President Kamala Harris is set to meet with Israeli War Cabinet member Benny Gantz on Monday. Now, during that conversation, they're expected to touch on the hostage deal, the humanitarian aid going into Gaza, but also critically the day after planning for Gaza. That has been a priority for Vice President Kamala Harris since the attacks on October 7th. The War Cabinet member also expected to meet with National Security adviser Jake Sullivan while he's in town. So everything moving very quickly to try to meet that Ramadan deadline that U.S. officials say they want to see this hostage deal come together by then.

These have also been flashing statistics about immigration, the border and Joe Biden's agenda and trying to get this crowd amped and ready for November 5th election.

It's always good to have Ron on, and get your thoughts. Let's start first with what you write about today that Joe Biden still has an opportunity to change the narrative on the Biden economy but these poll numbers we're seeing from \"The New York Times\"-Sienna poll are pretty bleak. 51 percent of voters rating the economy as poor. So how does the president break through? How does he change the narrative?",

All of those have improved significantly since last -- last fall, you know, awareness that inflation is moderating is broader, and yet his approval is not going up.You know, in the past, we have seen particularly in the cases of Reagan, Clinton, and Obama, improvements in Consumer Confidence foreshadowed improvements in their own approval rating, which ultimately carry them to successful reelections. And so the question really becomes, is there a point at which Biden is going to benefit from a similar movement? And I think the view in both parties is that the cumulative weight of inflation, the fact that even though inflation is slowing, the key, you know, essentials of life, groceries and rent, are significantly more costly than they were when he took office. That is the biggest impediment to him benefitting from these other positive trends in the economy.",

It's what they remember from the first three years of Trump when they fell, you know, you hear in focus groups, pollsters in both parties will say people will say that they have more money in their pocket at the end of the week in 2017, 2018, 2019 than they do now.Having said that, Democrats think there is still a case to be made on the economy. Both a negative case that Trump's agenda is tilted too much for the people at the top, plus that his 10 percent tariffs as Nikki Haley has been talking about, that's not going to bring down the price of groceries. It has the potential to obviously increase costs for Americans, and Biden does have a lot of positive trends in the economy. You can point to including an absolute boom in manufacturing, construction of new plants tied to the big three bills he passed in his first two years. But that inflation is just as -- has been throughout his presidency a cloud eclipsing all of these other trends that he might want to point to.",

But this is a good pollster and the results are broadly consistent with what we are seeing in other state and national polling, which is that Biden is behind right now. I think the scariest thing for Biden in this poll is that only 36 percent of Americans say they approve of his performance as president, 47 percent say they strongly disapprove.As you note, only 18 percent, only about one in five roughly say his policies have helped him personally. Those are the kinds of numbers that have spelt defeat in the past for incumbent presidents. It's hard to dig out of a hole that deep. He needs to improve perceptions. He needs -- really there's two things to happen. He needs attitudes about the economy to continue improving. They're kind of stalled in one sideways in February in those big measures like University of Michigan. And then he needs more of satisfied voters to give him credit. So far -- you know, that really is the dynamic that could possibly get him into the 40s where the contrast with Trump could become more valuable for him.",

And those voters tend to turn out more in these kind of off-year elections. I would say that the part that is true and should give Democrats some comfort is what we saw in 2022 in unusually and really an unprecedentedly large number of voters who are dissatisfied with Biden, who thought the economy was moving in the wrong direction, voted for Democrats anyway, because they view the Republican alternative as too extreme a threat to their rights, to their values and to democracy itself.That dynamic is almost certainly going to be there again in 2024. It's there even in this poll, but it's not a get-out-of-free card. I mean, if you look at this poll, Biden is running further ahead of his approval rating than presidents usually get to do. You know, people, young voters, only 30 percent of them approve of Biden, but he's at 50 percent in the head-to-head with Trump. With independents he's 2-1 they have a negative view of his performance, but he's even with Trump's. So the contrast with Trump is helping him, but it's not an infinite ladder, right? I mean, if his approval rating is so low, there's a limit to how many people will say, I don't think he's doing a good job, but I'll vote for him anyway because I find the alternative unacceptable. Clearly, there are people who will say that. We saw it in 2022 but, you know, it's not infinite. And if you're at 36 percent, that's a big hole to climb out of.",

She has made that point. There is a portion of the Republican coalition, mostly college-educated suburban, that is still resistant to Trump.Not sure there's much point in making that point beyond Super Tuesday.

Prosecutor Jay Bratt told the court that when it comes to that policy, \"We are in full compliance.\" REID (on camera): Judge Cannon is expected to schedule at least one more hearing in this case, and then she will also likely put a date on the calendar. Now, she didn't seem open to placing this case in July, so it would likely be put on the calendar in August at the earliest, but that date is not a guarantee. The Trump lawyers or even the prosecutors could always come back and try to push it back further. So at this point, it is still unclear if former President Trump will face either one of the special counsel's federal cases before the November presidential election.

You know, the calendar you just showed had an immunity argument in the United States Supreme Court. Realistically, I am pessimistic that the January 6 case will go forward, that the trial will go forward before the election because as your calendar points out, it is literally the end of April when the Supreme Court hears argument. I don't think that the Supreme Court is going to release an opinion until June and at that point, there may be some work for the trial judge to do before trial would even get underway. And realistically, I would say that would be in maybe September, October, and I just -- it is hard for me imagine her starting a trial then.",

And I would say the momentum is really on the side of the defendants. A lot of the testimony has not been very helpful for DA Willis, so I do think the judge is concerned and the question is he concerned that there has been a lack of candor towards him, which is one issue, it might not mean that her entire office is off the case or is he concerned that there is a conflict of interest, if that's the case, Trump may never see trial.",
