Earlier today, he told reporters that he does believe he can still beat Donald Trump in November. But there have been these public and private expressions of frustration, as some would like to see the President step aside at this moment in the race. Now, the President is about to speak here at this event, bringing his message directly to voters. He will also sit down for that high-stakes interview with ABC News, an interview likely to be very different from the ones Biden has faced in the past, where he would prepare by focusing on domestic and foreign policy issues. This interview likely will focus on the viability of his own candidacy. Now, I spent some time this afternoon talking with voters here in attendance in Madison. And, really, there was a mixed reaction. There were some who are fervent supporters. They want President Biden to remain in this race and see this through. But there are others who do have concern about potentially keeping him at the top of the ticket. And they want to see how he performs today at this event and in an interview. Take a listen to one of those voters. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And so instead of being seen as literally sitting on this full interview for almost two days, ABC also didn't want to be, you know, unfairly accused of trying to sit on anything, hide anything and so when the executives at ABC found a primetime slot, because keep in mind, they had to move things around on all of the ABC affiliates to make this happen. When they could find a 30-minute primetime slot, that's when they decided to move it to tonight. So there will still be clips first airing at 6.30 PM on World News Tonight.
