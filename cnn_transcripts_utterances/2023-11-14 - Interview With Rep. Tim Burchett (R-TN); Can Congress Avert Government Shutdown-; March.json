He said he didn't know what was going to happen next because DePape had a hammer in his right-hand and also recognized that the police had just arrived. So, when that happened, he turned and tried to also put his hand on the hammer. You can see that in the body camera video that was released back in January. And that's when he said, Pelosi said that DePape pushed him aside and hit him on the head. He told the jury that the next thing he remembered was waking up in a pool of his own blood. We are expecting this federal trial to wrap up later this week, and then the next state trial will happen. He is facing, David DePape is facing decades in prison if convicted on all of the state and federal charges -- Fredricka.",

And then at the al-Quds Hospital, hundreds of people are still trapped inside as fighting rages just outside the doors. The Palestine Red Crescent Society says they haven't been able to reach their staff for six days now. And now they fear that they may be dead. And at the Rantisi -- Al-Rantisi Hospital children's hospital, CNN got access inside with IDF, where they claim they found Hamas tunnels and weapons. The Israeli military showed our team evidence of what they called an armory under the hospital and signs of where they think hostages may have been held.

As you mentioned there, one hospital left in Northern Gaza now able toprovide that urgent care needed for so many in the region. But this is a situation, a crisis which hospitals across the Gaza Strip are facing because of that ongoing siege on fuel getting into the Gaza Strip. Many hospitals are now without power or quickly running out of power, certainly those in Northern Gaza. And, of course, as we have seen, they are working without electricity. Doctors have been seen operating and providing care in total darkness with many around them carrying their phone torchlights in order to be able to see what they're doing. They are running out of medical supplies, of essential medicine, including not being able to use anesthesia while carrying out operations. And, of course, as we know, in addition to the hundreds of patients inside some of these hospital, thousands in total, there are also thousands of civilians now taking shelter on the complexes of these hospitals, particularly concern over the Al Shifa Hospital, Gaza's largest hospital, where, as we know, there are hundreds of patients, hundreds of medical staff, but also thousands taking shelter outside of that hospital. We have been hearing from medical teams on the ground who have described their morgues as being completely full, bodies piling up on the outside of the hospital, one doctor saying that civilians are taking it into their own hands now trying to bury their dead wherever they can as quickly as possible. So you could imagine how desperate the situation is now in Northern Gaza. And, of course, it's not just the situation inside the hospital that is a point of concern, but it is the ongoing, relentless bombardment around these hospitals. As we know, on-the-ground fighting is edging closer, encircling many of these hospitals, but also those airstrikes are edging closer. As you mentioned, the IDF says that they are targeting Hamas positions. They claim that there is a Hamas command-and-control center beneath Al Shifa. This has been echoed by a U.S. official, but Hamas has itself rejected those allegations. Doctors on the ground have denied those allegations as well. And there is continued concern that civilians, patients in these hospitals could become a target as this war intensifies -- Fredricka.",
