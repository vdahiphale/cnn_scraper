And while he is expected to sign that just passed $1.7 trillion government spending bill at some point this week, he's also bracing for a reshaped Washington in the new year. It's going to be buzzing with questions about 2024 and his potential candidacy. And it is also going to be a Washington where Republicans have control of the House. Just a little bit, but still, control.CNN's Phil Mattingly is joining us live from the White House.

And I think that race itself kind of gives you a window into some of the preparations that have been going on behind the scenes here at the White House and the fact that they don't actually know who's going to be the next speaker. The expectation long been Kevin McCarthy, the current Republican leader, would win that race. As he has continued to be short of votes, White House officials have been watching. Not getting involved, not trying to put their thumb on the scale in any way, shape or form, but using it as kind of an illustration moment for what a House Republican majority may look like and how they will interact with that majority.Kaitlan, you know this building as well as anybody right now. They are planning for how they will operate in a new legislative environment, how they will operate in a new political environment. And, of course, hanging over everything is President Biden's decision about whether or not to run for re-election. But they're doing so with a very clear momentum in their view behind them in the wake of a string of legislative victories, including that $1.7 trillion spending bill and a very real sense that President Biden's theory of the case that he laid out during the campaign and into the first couple months of his time in office has essentially come to pass and that should kind of define how things operate in the next two years.",

The biggest one is that from January 8th, the country is dropping quarantine for all international arrivals. Authorities are also promising to gradually restart outbound tourism for Chinese citizens. Inbound travelers, they still need to get a 48- hour negative Covid test before boarding but they dropped all of the other super cumbersome requirements.Now these changes, they are not only a big move towards ending China's nearly three years of isolation, but it also points to a formal end to zero Covid. And to really understand why this is such a big deal, we've got to look at the reality of what China has been. This country has been severely limiting, throughout the pandemic, who can go in and out of the country. Flights have been extremely limited and expensive. All arrivals had to go through quarantines in government facilities. I went through multiple quarantines myself, including 21 days earlier this year. And we're talking about harsh quarantines. No choice in what facility you go to, no opening your door except for food pick-ups and Covid tests. So, all of that is now gone. And this is an emotional moment for so many people who have been waiting for three years or more to finally go home, to reunite for family -- with family and finally so many people I'm talking to say they are seeing that light at the end of the tunnel.",

It takes one thing, one flight, one, you know, storm and then you sort of see a domino, cascading effect across the country.So, a few things to think about if you're a flier. I mean I've talked to Brian Kelly, who most people at home would know as the points guy who runs the point system and he says, look, if you have a really important destination that you need to get to, it's unfortunately that it takes this, but you should probably have a plan b, right?

CHRIS NOWINSKI, CO-FOUNDER AND CEO, CONCUSSION LEGACY FOUNDATION: Well, unfortunately, it's not a surprise because each concussion will make you more likely to suffer another concussion. And his concussions were so badly mishandled earlier in the season that I suggested when he got injured in October -- September 29th that he not return this season to give his brain enough time to recover. This hit like -- it does look like that hit to the ground changed the way he played. His performance before that hit and after that hit were very different. He had three interceptions in the fourth quarter. I -- it looks like that third concussion now has happened. And we have to worry about his future, not just, you know, as an athlete, but as a person. And we have to worry now that people are going to consider him concussion-prone when, frankly, I think the Dolphins mishandled his concussion and left him open to this very likely possibility that now happened.",

So, 19 years ago I suffered multiple concussions that weren't diagnosed when I was a WWE pro wrestling, and that's left me with permanent symptoms. And that is a possibility, the more concussions you get, the closer they are together. I was forced to retire from those.These days, most doctors will say, when your symptoms have cleared and you return - you go through the concussion protocol, you're safe to return. But Tua needs a doctor who's going to say, look, I could clear you, but for your, you know, your life, your profession, I shouldn't clear you. The season should be over for him if you are looking out for his long-term health. I mean God forbid if they clear him for some reason, if he comes back and gets another concussion, when we should already be worried about potential novel (ph) mental health disorders. The studies are very clear, the more concussions you get, the more likely you are to have anxiety, depression, self-harm. These things are very real.
