      "sentences": "Today on Inside Politics, jury selection hits a bump in the road. As of last night, seven jurors were seated in the people of the state of New York versus Donald J. Trump. Now there are only six. CNN is inside the courtroom with all the breaking details and difficulties of finding a jury to decide the fate of the most famous and polarizing person in the world.Plus, the speaker's gamble. Mike Johnson's plan is to, quote, do the right thing and let the chips fall. What is unclear now is whether a rightwing revolt over his decision to push a Ukraine aid bill will cost him his gavel. And a Kennedy family reunion with a notable no show. This hour more than a dozen Kennedys will endorse Joe Biden on the campaign trail. It's a major show of force against one of their own, whose candidacy could ultimately tank President Biden's reelection. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. We do start in Manhattan where Donald Trump is inside a courtroom. Right now, as his legal team and prosecutors question dozens of potential jurors. Our colleagues in the room say that so far, the former president appears in gross, listening to the people in the jury box, give their answers. 96 people were sworn in this morning. 48 were dismissed right away because they said they couldn't be fair and impartial to Donald Trump. Nine others were let go because of conflicts. And it is unclear now how many others will make it through the next hour. There is even issues with seated jurors. Today juror number two was excused after saying this to the judge. Quote, aspects of my identity already have been out there in the public yesterday alone. I had friends, colleagues and family push things to my phone, questioning my identity as a juror. CNN's Laura Coates is near the Manhattan courthouse along with our colleagues Kristen Holmes, and Kara Scannell. Laura? LAURA COATES, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CHIEF LEGAL ANALYST: This is really an important day. We're technically on day three now of jury selection. We began the day ladies having seven jurors. Do you think that would be that much closer to the coveted 18, including the 12, and then of course, six alternates. Then you have the step backwards from one person being dismissed, excused because of the compromising of anonymity. There's a lot happening in the courtroom about the questions and the questionnaire once again, a very key role here.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. So, we are now in the throes of this after the pool was whittled down by those who felt they couldn't be fair and impartial. They've got nine jurors currently in the jury box. And that means that nine of them have gone through those 42 questions, learning a little bit about them. There's a number of people who work in finance. There's an attorney, a stay-at-home mom, and they're just given the biographical information at this point.Now, once they fill up to another -- once they fill the box, which has 18 seeds, then they will begin the questions by the attorneys. And that's when the prosecutors and Trump's lawyers each get 30 minutes to ask questions to try to understand a little bit more about these jurors, a little bit more about their viewpoints -- their views on both how they would interpret evidence whether they could separate credibility from likability, and whether they could -- from Trump's perspective, whether they have any sort of an obvious views about the former president. So that process we saw yesterday take place, which helped get down to the seven at the time. And then this will now begin again as they try to build up this box against to the full jury.",

And every time you do that, there's the risk that you lose a lot of people who say they can't be fair and impartial, and then you have even fewer people to pull from.",

Jury selection can take a very long time. I was astonished at the number of jurors that were already selected. And I was not surprised when some came back the next day -- today when they were issues.And I think you can expect to see that really going forward until the whole entire jury selection is completed. And don't forget that also includes six alternate and each alternate under the New York criminal corporate law, each alternate also you get two strikes to peremptory challenges. So, I am now of the opinion, this is not going to be completed by Monday. And profiling jurors -- profiling jurors can be both -- can be of great value, but it can also be dangerous. And I would probably say that the most opinionated the kind of juror is not going to be a juror who survives. But someone who is somewhat in the middle of the road, as I understand the cases now.",

And having a juror that knowingly, apparently might have been untruthful on his questionnaire -- his questions, right? They're sort of the kiss of death in this juror. That's point one.Point two, as the juror was asked to come in early this morning and was apparently reluctant to come into court. Any chance they had of rehabilitating this juror and asking him questions and getting him to say he's honest, we're sort of out the door. So, I think the judge is going through it right now.

And I'm speaking from a defense perspective because of course, lawyers are going to be asked in the deliberating room by other jurors, well, what do you think of the law? What do you think of this element of the jury instruction. And so, they become kind of a power broker.But here, I think that both sides might be -- this might be to their advantage because here, there are some nuances. There are some issues, technical and legal issues regarding some of the elements like intent. And perhaps, both sides would benefit from some clear thinking on those issues. And it just always done it, it depends on the case. That's why profiling, as I said, it's both advantageous but dangerous as well. It's always about the specifics of the case.",

And there's -- it's not to say that this is so remarkable. The simple fact is you can't just throw him in jail. Number one, the judge has to have a hearing regardless of what the judge chooses to do. You have to bring the defendant in for a hearing.Now, the question is, is it a civil proceeding where you're seeking to compel him to behave better in the future? Or is it a criminal proceeding where you're going to lock him up in jail for things he's already done? And there's pitfalls to both of those approaches. What's telling is that the judge has waited five days is not having a hearing, I think until the 23rd, which is quite significant. He's letting us all stay out there. Now that again, getting back to what we were talking about before is a way of perhaps trying to be more fair to Donald Trump than the judge needs to be, just in the interest of caution. But the idea that the judge is going to wave a wand and throw him in jail, which I think many people think is simply not how it works, particularly in New York.",
