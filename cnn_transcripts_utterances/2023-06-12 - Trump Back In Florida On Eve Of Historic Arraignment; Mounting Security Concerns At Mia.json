The mayor says the city is prepared but are federal and local law enforcement officials doing enough to keep everyone safe? Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. All right, let's get right to all the new developments tonight just ahead of a federal criminal arraignment unlike any other. The lead defendant, Donald Trump, is holed up right now at his golf club outside of Miami with his high stakes court appearance less than 24 hours away. CNN's Senior Legal Affairs Correspondent Paula Reid is on the ground for us in Miami, just outside the federal courthouse there.

And this is a playbook he has run since the beginning of his presidency. If you think about the way he talked around the impeachments, sort of talked his way out of getting impeached. But, listen, that was a different audience. That was a jury of peers, of like-minded or Republicans. This is something very different. But still he is doing the same sort of playbook, of saying that he's the victim, that this is a witch hunt, that it's a hoax, that there's a double standard. He's calling the Department of Justice the Department of Injustice. And he's really, in that way, I think, been able to hold on to his base, rally fellow Republicans as well. But, listen, at some point, this will be before -- this will be in a courtroom. We'll see on Tuesday, of course, the beginning of these proceedings.

It's been made very, very clear in this circumstance that he's outside of the White House, outside of protected areas where information was held secret and protected by many layers of defense.Instead, this is a circumstance where he took these boxes, he packed them himself knowingly, if this indictment is correct, and put them in ballroom, in a bathroom, in a storage closet, in a place where we know foreign intelligence has and President Trump knew that foreign intelligence had tried to penetrate on multiple occasions.

So, it's a far more Republican-leaning jury pool than you would have in the District of Columbia, which I think voted 5 percent for Donald Trump.Now, that doesn't mean any jury would necessarily vote for or against a defendant, but the simple fact is you have a politician on trial and 45 or 50 percent of the people from which the jury pool will be drawn may well have voted for him. So, the complexities here extend far beyond the makeup of the jury pool. There are some very thorny legal questions about, number one, how you get classified information in front of a jury in a way that doesn't damage the national security. Number two, again, even venue, whether it's proper to even try in Florida, it is, but that's something the defendant has a right to raise.

So, as you start looking at the calendar, you get later and later into next year. It's also unlikely that they try to put this trial on I think during the last few months of the election.So, when you add all those things together, plus all the many motions that Trump's team is likely to raise, many of which could appeal if they don't go the former president's way, that slows things down even further.

I don't think they -- the citizens, the voters, I don't think they've heard enough about it. I'm more worried about Republican leaders who are afraid to tell the voters what's in the indictment. So, it just falls to other people to try and do it. But, ultimately, I think people will see this behavior by Trump was a serious threat to national security.",

He then appeared for his arraignment in that Moscow court on Saturday. The court said that Russian authorities had taken a preventive measure, they called, because Leake was engaging in the narcotics business through attracting young people. Now, we do believe that Leake has lived in Russia for quite some time as a music producer and music manager, a musician himself. He appeared on an episode of the Anthony Bourdain, Pars Unknown, back in 2014. He talked then about freedom of speech, the lack thereof in Russia. The impression that he gave to a producer on that episode was that he was a showman and that he was very much in love with Russia. But the State Department watching this very carefully, obviously a huge amount of concern, lots more to learn about this. But, remember, Wolf, the U.S. State Department has been learning for quite some time, especially since the war in Ukraine started, that U.S. citizens should leave Russia immediately because of the tension between the two countries because the relationship between the two countries is deteriorating so quickly.",

That truck then tried to take the off ramp right here, it then lost control, crashed-landed on its side, and eventually ruptured. And that tanker caused the fire that ultimately caused the northbound lanes to collapse.We also learned today that the southbound lanes behind me, they have to be demolished as well because they are no longer structurally safe. And I'll say that while there were initially no reported injuries, we did learn today from the Pennsylvania state police that one body was pulled from the wreckage, although the Philadelphia medical examiner has not confirmed the identity of that person at this time. But again, to your big question, how long will repairs now take? Well, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, he said it will not be overnight.
