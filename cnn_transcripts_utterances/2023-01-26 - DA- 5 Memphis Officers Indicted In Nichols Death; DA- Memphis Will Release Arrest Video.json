      "sentences": "Thank you, DA Mulroy.Good afternoon. I'm David Rausch, Director of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation. First and foremost and most importantly, on behalf of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, I want to extend my deepest condolences to the family and friends of Tyre Nichols. My prayer is that God will wrap His comforting arms around you and keep you during this very difficult time. We can't imagine the pain you're experiencing. But let me reaffirm, we are here to pursue truth and justice. Realizing that we should not be here. Simply put, this shouldn't have happened. I've been policing for more than 30 years. I've devoted my life to this profession. And I'm grieved - frankly, I'm shocked. I'm sickened by what I saw. And what we've learned through our extensive and thorough investigation. I've seen the video. And as DA Mulroy stated, you will too. In a word, it's absolutely appalling. Let me be clear, what happened here does not at all reflect proper policing. This was wrong. This was criminal. The depth and breadth of the charges announced today speaks to the deliberate and thorough investigation that this case has received and our work is not finished. We continue to pursue every lead, justice demands it. And our agency exist, so that guilt shall not escape, nor innocence suffer. To that end, I want to publicly thank our agents, our forensic scientists, our support staff, and our entire team around the state. They work diligently to expedite this case. We've worked as hard as we could and as quickly as we could to provide a thorough, independent, unbiased investigative record to allow DA Mulroy and his team to make the most informed decision they could regarding these charges. I also want to thank the Memphis Police Department and the city leaders for their cooperation in this case, which I want to stress, is ongoing at this time. Thank you.",

The District Attorney then coming on talking about Tyre Nichols, who he was, someone who liked to watch sunsets in the park and who loved his mom and was a skateboarder. And then they said they worked quickly to expedite this case, because of the nature they work swiftly, but they worked fairly.

This young man lost his life in a particularly disgusting manner that points to the desperate need for change and reform to ensure this violence stops occurring during low-threat procedures, like in this case, a traffic stop.

And it seems that they're just completely relying on the release of the video for us to see for ourselves exactly how everything took place and that's fine.But I do still think that we need an accounting from officials about how everything unfolded that day. Noticeably, I mean, I thought it was noticeable, the fact that the Memphis Police Department Chief was not present here. I asked the DA about that. He didn't seem to know why she wasn't here, but look, the investigators were here. One of the things I think that's very interesting, we did get - I did ask the DA a little bit about what happened that day, and he was willing to give us a little bit. And he said there was this traffic stop. He wouldn't talk about whether it was legal or not. Then he said there was an encounter there at that traffic stop and that pepper spray was used, other methods were used. And then Tyre Nichols ran and there was a pursuit, and then it was at that second location when they find him and encounter him, when the officers encounter him again, that is where this all takes place where they allege he was beaten. And what is significant in that moment, the DA indicates is that there was a time that went by it seems before medical care, before EMTs treated him. It seems that the DA indicating that there was some delay in getting him that care. Now, I don't know exactly how that went and obviously the DA wouldn't talk about it. But I think those few facts are some of the new things we've learned. We also learned that the unit, the unit that stopped, Tyre Nichols is this - what's called a Scorpion Unit. They are an anti-crime unit. They are some plain clothes. They are in an unmarked car usually and I believe that was in this case. They have stuff that they wear that tells people that they are the police. But this is this anti-crime unit. We've heard about anti-crime units in other cities and their goal is really to fight crime, right? It's to do these car stops, to get guns off the street. So we'd be curious to hear more about that. So we have some more information, certainly about the actions of the officers that day, and what transpired. And then lastly, I think it was really interesting to listen to the head of the investigation, the man who has been running this investigation, the TBI director, who really made it very clear that in all his years of law enforcement, I think he said some 30 years, that this was wrong, that this was criminal and that justice demanded these charges. And that I thought was very significant to hear from someone, an individual who certainly is running this investigation, but has been in law enforcement for some 30 years. And I think if you go across the country right now, based on what everybody knows, law enforcement all the - across the country, much like what we saw after George Floyd is pretty upset over what we're about to see tomorrow in this video.

So the Scorpion Unit was started on December 12th 2021 in response to a spate of shootings, and violence, gunfire, carjackings, car thefts in Memphis. They put together 50 police officers, put them in plain clothes with bulletproof vests that said police on them, unmarked cars that did not look like unmarked cars necessarily, a pickup truck, a Dodge Challenger or Charger and sent them out to crime hotspots to engage.Within their first three weeks, they were lauded for picking up 338 arrests. That's a very aggressive posture in three weeks for 50 police officers, 195 of those were felonies, 95 of those involve weapons and they were being touted as this is an elite crime fighting unit that's part of the organized crime section. And then you have this which raises the question, why were officers who had two and three years of experience the most, six years was the most with - the most time on for those officers, not that experienced when you consider that those might be 10 or 12 or 15 year veterans that go into the specialized units in a unit that was out there in this mission and without a supervisor.",

And I'm curious what you think about hearing the dispatch audio where you just mentioned they said, let's check the plates, see where he lives. If you think a car is stolen, if you think someone has done something that's potentially dangerous for the officers, would you not have already run the tags when you pulled up in the first place? Would you not have time to just run the tags? Is it - that's usually what they do when - I've been pulled over before.",

When he comes back on the radio and we're not certain that that actually happened that they ran it in the stop, but when he comes - he specifically asked for what's the address that that car comes back to.So Sara, to your point, at that point, he's operating on the information that it's not stolen, that it's the driver's car, and they're going to go to that address and start looking for him, which is exactly what they did. They found him 80 yards from home and that's the second confrontation where they ended up beating him to the extent that it causes his death days later.",
