They say Trump has appealed to 30 different insurance underwriters to help him post a bond, essentially paying them to guarantee that his money will be paid as it should be if he loses his appeal. And all of the underwriters have turned him down.Now, why would they do that? Trump's team says it's more money than some of them will ever agree to underwrite, so that's one problem. But even those who might consider it want cash to back up the deal. And Trump's money is not in cash, not most of it. Most of it is tied up in real estate, in places like Mar-a-Lago in Florida, Trump Tower and more than a half dozen other properties in New York. He's invested in buildings in Chicago, Las Vegas, San Francisco. He has golf courses and resorts, money in companies such as True Social and even in his airplane. For the underwriters, all of that could turn into a massive headache of property management, complicated deals with partners and wildly swinging values. So they just don't want it. So the question is, what happens at this point? Well, he doesn't go to jail. This is not a criminal case. But unless something changes, legal analysts say next week, the New York attorney general could start seizing some of those properties. Those in New York would likely make the most sense to make sure if Donald Trump loses his appeal again, he will pay the judgment, which is growing by more than $100,000 every day. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Yes, and look, it's no coincidence, I think, that the celebrations of the Crimean annexation, what Russia calls reunification, were all folded in. This is the second presidential election that's happened since the annexation in 2014, the second time that they have managed to get the election to coincide with this anniversary.It's a huge source of national pride in Russia, but this display that we saw, this celebration on Red Square, presents a complete alternate reality to what's actually happening on this peninsula, and it's really important to look at Crimea now because we're seeing it happen again. There are now four other territories within Ukraine, four other regions that Russia has claimed to illegally annex, and some of the tools of control of the population that we've seen over the past ten years in Crimea are being applied to those new regions as well. So this is why we wanted to really take a look at what's happening inside Crimea. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SEBASTIAN (voice-over): Ten years ago, the woman in blue dreamed of being a teacher. Life under Russian occupation brought to Lutfiye Zudiyeva a new calling, journalist and human rights activist. LUTFIYE ZUDIYEVA, JOURNALIST AND HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVIST (voice-over): This was the first time I was searched, but I had been preparing for this for many years. I was expecting them.",

That changes the demographic composition of the peninsula.SEBASTIAN (voice-over): When unmarked Russian soldiers, the little green men, began surrounding Crimea's military bases in March 2014, ethnic Russians were already a majority here. But the referendum, which delivered a 97 percent yes vote to join Russia, was illegal in the eyes of much of the world. And at one polling station, our CNN camera filmed a man dropping two ballots into the box. Ten years on, Russia's propaganda machine is celebrating. This news report showing off shiny new highways. EMIL KURBEDINOV, CRIMEAN LAWYER (through translator): If you drive along the roads, walk around the shops, it would probably seem like everything is wonderful. But there is another side, all right? I just came back from the pre-trial detention center, visiting my defendants. This is young people being accused of terrorism. SEBASTIAN (voice-over): Some don't even get a trial. The U.N. has documented more than 100 cases of forced disappearance in Crimea since 2014. KURBEDINOV (through translator): This is how we live. Today you drive along nice roads, arrive home, and then tomorrow you simply disappear. SEBASTIAN (voice-over): As Russia tightens its grip on Crimea's people, Ukraine has stepped up attacks on the peninsula, on land and sea in recent months. In the place this war originally started, military tensions are rising again. (END VIDEOTAPE) SEBASTIAN (on camera): And I think that's linked to the reason why we've seen the crackdown on Crimea's people intensify. We know that Russia, for example, has also been digging fortifications in some parts of Crimea. Obviously you need stable support by any means from the population just in case, and we don't see any sign of this at the moment, but just in case the war, in terms of the ground war, does actually return and they have to defend it.",

We hear a lot of this in the speeches that he made around the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the historical mistakes. And I think the second thing is a quest for that sort of elusive superpower status that Russia feels that it lost after the Cold War period. It's about spheres of influence. It's about consolidating Russian power. He said in his speech on Red Square yesterday that, you know, he's been told about the restoration of a railway linking Rostov with Donetsk, and then Mariupol and Berdyansk. These -- this is literally a sort of visual reminder of what he's trying to do, to add to the territory of Russia. To make it -- to make what Ukraine sees as a temporary occupation look and feel permanent by bringing in infrastructure, by bringing in Russian institutions, by forcing people to get Russian passports, by holding the recent elections in these territories. All of that is part of that consolidation of power, which Putin feels gives Russia relevance and status on the global stage.",
