The Jacksonville Sheriff will be here on the racist attack there, as well as the hero security guard who chased down the shooter. Plus, the family of the fallen soldier who Fox News just apologized to over a false story. And Ibram X. Kendi will respond to Vivek Ramaswamy, who called him the grand wizard of the modern KKK. But, first, Mark Meadows, he took a big risk today by taking the stand. Donald Trump's former chief of staff is charged in efforts to overturn election results in Georgia, and now he's arguing that his case should go over to federal court instead. And today, there was a mini trial of sorts, one that many legal experts have said may have put him in deeper trouble. CNN's Jessica Schneider is here to tell us what happened in that hearing today.

He talked about that infamous phone call to Georgia's secretary of state, where Trump, of course, asked Raffensperger to find him more votes.Meadows excused the call, saying that Trump believed that there was fraud in Georgia and he was trying to come up with a way to resolve the issues without going to court. Now, Raffensperger himself also testified and he called this kind of outreach from a president's chief of staff setting up the call extraordinary, in his words.

Now, what we do know, and we already are seeing the beginning of that, is that the trial is very much going to become the heart of his re- election campaign, his grievances, this idea that he is being politically persecuted despite all of the evidence detailing his activities and his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. I mean, the Trump campaign has already been fundraising off of these indictments, off of every development. And, look, he has not suffered in any capacity with respect to Republican primary voters. If anything, he has such a commandable lead. That's the primary.

KENDI, AUTHOR, \"HOW TO BE AN ANTIRACIST\": I just think it's incredibly dangerous. The Ku Klux Klan is the oldest and quite possibly most violent white terrorist group, really a terrorist, domestic terrorist group in American history. They have engaged in generations of violence against black people, against Jews, against all sorts of groups they don't agree with. And they have also expressed ideas of racial hierarchy and white supremacy, ideas that I and Congresswoman Pressley have repeatedly and constantly challenged. So, it's incredibly dangerous, especially in this moment, where, you know, all sorts of reports point to white supremacists as the greatest domestic terrorist throughout our time to be comparing people to them that have spent their lives challenging them and actually who the Klan hates, because the Klan really doesn't like me.",
