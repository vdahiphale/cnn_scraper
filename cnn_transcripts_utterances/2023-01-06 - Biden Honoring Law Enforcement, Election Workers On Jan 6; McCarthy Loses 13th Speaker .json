No one got enough votes. Right now, they are all voting on a motion to adjourn. That is - it's the motion right now being voted on. [15:25:02] Let's get right to CNN's Manu Raju. Manu, we've been doing the math and it seems like the task will be much easier for Kevin McCarthy to become the speaker if these two House Republicans, Buck and Hans who are absent right now, for personal reasons if they return, tell us what's going on.",

I'm told Ken Buck in particular has a flight arriving back into Washington around 9 pm, so they plan to come back at 10 pm. That would give Kevin McCarthy two additional votes.Now, that doesn't mean he will get there. There needs to be - there's already a furious effort underway right now to get the other remaining holdouts, a few - two most viewed as gettable: Matt Rosendale of Montana and Elijah Crane. He's an incoming Republican member as well. Both of them are under - being lobbied by the membership, by the top leaders to break ranks and their - I'm told that the concerns that they have raised our political. Crane in particular is concerned that if he backs McCarthy, this could hurt him in a potential primary bid in the next cycle. Also, I'm told about Rosendale - Mr. McCarthy, do you have the votes to be elected speaker tonight? REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): Yes.",

In fact, for some time, Kevin McCarthy has been saying that it's unclear when he would be elected speaker. There's no timeframe. That's what he said last night. That's what he said this morning, but now you have Kevin McCarthy saying that tonight, he will have the votes to be elected Speaker of the House. And that would mean that he had to flip some members somehow some way, those remaining holdouts as we're talking about, Elijah Crane as well as - he's an incoming freshmen - Matt Rosendale of Montana, both of them had expressed concerns about the politics of supporting Kevin McCarthy. Crane concerned about the potential primary impacts he could have in the next election cycle. Rosendale is eyeing a potential Senate run in Montana. He wants to stay to the right of any potential opponent there, one of the Montana potential opponent that Ryan Zinke, also an incoming member is supporting McCarthy, so there you get some of the sense of the politics there.But McCarthy doesn't seem too concerned. I just asked him about Rosendale and Crane, as you heard. He didn't really quite say how he's going to get those members. But there's a possible - there lots of different scenarios in which you can get there, some may vote present to lower the voting threshold and then getting these two members back who support McCarthy are essential. But right there, Kevin McCarthy believes that after all these failed ballots, one after the other, this historic speaker's race more than 100 years here that he will finally get the votes to be elected speaker after we've seen - it's been a hundred years since we have multiple ballots in an election. Kevin McCarthy feels he's there tonight.",
