      "sentences": "Well, here we are, everyone, deep in the 2024 campaign, but the thing that may change everything, 2020, tonight on \"Laura Coates Live.\"So, any one of the hearings today could actually be a break glass in case of emergency kind of moment. You got immunity, the Georgia election subversion case, the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case. They could all change the course of this election. And Donald Trump's strategy is right there in his team's argument to the Supreme Court today on the case of immunity. He's claiming that a months-long criminal trial will make it harder for him to campaign. Translation: Delay, delay, delay. And the fight over Trump's immunity or, frankly, lack thereof, has already prompted district judge Tanya Chutkan to postpone a trial date that was previously set for March 4th, coincidentally or perhaps not, the day before Super Tuesday. And then there's the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case. You remember this one. Now, we haven't heard about it as much lately, but take a complex case, add some defendants, multiple at that, and classified records that are part of the evidence, and what do you get when you mix it all together? That's right, you get delays. Interestingly, while the former president was in attendance for today's closed-door hearing, there was no press conference, no outbursts. And let's not forget the Georgia election subversion case in the hearing. The judge saying today that district attorney Fani Willis could -- and I emphasize could -- be disqualified if there is evidence that she financially benefited from a personal relationship with her lead prosecutor on the case. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SCOTT MCAFEE, JUDGE, SUPERIOR COURT OF FULTON COUNTY (voice-over): I think it's clear that disqualification can occur if evidence is produced demonstrating an actual conflict or the appearance of one.

One, it's on defense. It's not, you know, on the United States. You don't have to give NATO money. You don't have to give the U.S. money. It's defense spending. And number two, again, this is a non-binding guideline. If you look at the language that existed until it got a little firmer last year, it was pretty soft. It said that if you're not at the 2% guideline, you should aim to hit it within a decade. And so, it did not create any delinquency. There's no debt. There's no arrear. There's nothing like Donald Trump says. Now, none of that is to say that this is not a real issue. Now, for decades, American presidents tried to get European allies and Canada often to spend more on defense. Bush tried, Obama tried. And Trump claimed he had great success, he had some success, but most members are still not hitting it.

He was found by Robert Mueller in the special counsel's report to have welcomed Russian interference, to have used it for his campaign. Then you fast forward 2018 and he chooses Vladimir Putin over our intelligence agencies to this when he says, oh, no, no, no, of course, I didn't interfere.

It's not the issue of age. It's not the issue of acuity. It's the issue of policy distinctions as well, which I'm sure he would like to discuss more than his age and going on. But there's also this huge election in New York, I'm sure you've been hearing about it, involving the former colleague, your former congressman, George Santos. This would make a huge difference for Democrats if you were able to secure that seat. How do you think it's going to turn out? GOLDMAN: Well, I think Tom Suozzi, who was a three-term congressman from that district, is a Democrat, a moderate, a bipartisan legislator who gets stuff done, going up against a complete neophyte rookie who has not -- is unable to enunciate what her positions are on abortion, on assault weapons, and seems to just be a rubber stamp for Donald Trump and Mike Johnson and the MAGA movement, which is very dangerous for a district that is not a MAGA district. And so, when a national abortion ban comes on the floor and she has just catered to Donald Trump and opposed this border security bill, that bipartisan bill, because Donald Trump doesn't want it, whereas Tom Suozzi has made it very clear, he supports bipartisan legislation that will address the problems, she doesn't seem to have her own views of anything that mean anything, and she'll just follow along. When you add in, in this district with George Santos, some real shady financial disclosures, it's bewildering to me that anyone who just voted for George Santos or just had George Santos as their elected representative would vote for anyone with shady financial disclosures like the Republican candidate has. It's going to be snowy tomorrow, so it's going to take some energy, but I think the Democrats are motivated and will get out to the polls.",

A unanimous opinion. So, if the Supreme Court doesn't take it up, then that's a victory. If they do, which I expect they will because it's such a significant novel issue, I still cannot imagine that this Supreme Court, even with three Trump justices, could ever bring itself to say that a president is completely immune from any crimes that he may commit just because he claims they are official acts which as the district court, as the appeals court as you know all too well, really debunked because he could order SEAL Team 6 to kill someone, and that's technically an official act but, obviously, that would also be a crime.",
