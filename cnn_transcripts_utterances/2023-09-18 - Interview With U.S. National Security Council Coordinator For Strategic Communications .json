It's all part U.S.-Iran agreement which also includes the release of 6 billion in Iranian funds for humanitarian use. This marks the end of a year's long nightmare for these detainees.

Now, the parameters of these negotiations always sort of morph and change as you get closer to the end, but as it came out, we think that this -- this was a tough decision by President Biden.

So, it's difficult to say that this particular deal, this particular negotiation is somehow going to change the calculous in that regard. And that is why the State Department has made it very, very clear that Americans, dual nationals in particular, should not be in Iran, should not travel to Iran, should not be there. And if they can make their way out, they certainly should because it is a particularly dangerous place to go. And then, number three, Christiane, it is also not like we're turning a blind eye to Iran's destabilizing behavior. The support for Russia and their war in Ukraine, the attacks on maritime shipping, the support for terrorists' networks. I can go on and on and on.

STEVEN THRASHER, HIV/AIDS SCHOLAR: PEPFAR, the -- as you said, was a bipartisan effort that has been pass many times and House Republicans are holding it hostage right now. They're threatening to not renew the funding. They're trying to use it as a way to shake down the federal government and make them put abortion restrictions on countries that are receiving this aid, which would be a disaster on many fronts. But it's also important to remember that even though some very powerful people have weighed into this conversation, including George W. Bush himself writing in \"The Washington Post\" this week, they're not only trying to get rid of PEPFAR funding which deals with U.S. funding for AIDS abroad. They're also trying to get rid of several hundred million dollars-worth of AIDS funding domestically within the United States as well.

But nobody else had access to it in much of the world outside of Europe for another seven years. And so, even as AIDS deaths went down starting in '96 in the United States, they kept going up until 2003, 2004, up to about 2.5 million deaths a year. And that was because the drugs were simply too expensive for very poor countries and many modern income countries to afford. And so, PEPFAR both made the drugs available in -- for free in some places, for much less money in some places. Worked with the drug companies to bring the cost down. But at a very -- and there are all kinds of structural issues around AIDS that need to still be addressed, but at a very cellar level it got drugs into bodies, and that saved tens of millions of lives. So, nobody should be against that in any way. The only, sort of, bad thing about it was that as the U.S. was looking abroad during those years, they really neglected HIV and AIDS here in the United States, and that could happen again if a deal is cut around PEPFAR and not cut around the reinstating the domestic funding they're trying to pull.",

There are 400 anti-trans bills and anti-LGBTQ bills here in the United States. And they're looking ways -- for ways to punish LGBTQ people around the world, and this is one way. Of course, HIV and AIDS does not only affect gay and trans people. There are many countries in the world, including some of those who receive money from PEPFAR where the majority of cases either happen through injection drug use or through vertical transmission from parent to child during pregnancy. But it is a virus and a disease that affects LGBTQ people disproportionately. And the United States has been successful, unfortunately, in exporting many anti-LGBTQ laws and attitudes in terms of anti-gay laws through U.S. missionary work, through various different policies.

So, in Scott County, Indianain 2014, 2015, as you said when Mike Pence was then the governor of Indiana had the fastest HIV outbreak that's ever been recorded in the United States. Cases -- they found the first case and then they went very, very quickly up. And scholars, including my friend, the Yale epidemiologist Gregg Gonsalves, initially looked at something that sort of darkly humorous. The question of, did those cases move quickly because Pence famously said he needed a few days to pray about whether or not to do a sterile syringe exchange. And what they found was that the cases didn't increase that much in that moment. The major transmissions had already happened quite quickly. But why those cases moved so quickly was because there was no surveillance in the southern half of Indiana. And the reason there wasn't surveillance is because Pence had been successful in running out of his state everybody who provided abortion. And it's the people who provide abortion, the Planned Parenthood clinics, the private, the public clinics that help people get abortion that are also doing sexually transmitted infection prevention. They're doing STI education. They're doing LGBTQ sexual education. And they're doing HIV prevention and HIV treatment. And so, when -- if PEPFAR were to be repealed and to stop abortions from happening in other countries, and here in the United States, as Dobbs came in and Roe was repealed, we've seen 70, 80 clinics that provided abortions closed around in the United States, those places are also prime to be out - - places where HIV will break out because the people who dealt with compassionately, professionally, and medically sound ways. People needing stigmatized healthcare, including abortion and HIV prevention, they're no longer there. And if they're not there, nobody is seeing the cases.
