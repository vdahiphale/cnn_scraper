But now the Republican whip from South Dakota is hoping to take center stage. Thune is officially announcing his bid to replace McConnell as the party's leader.CNN's Lauren Fox is joining us right now. Lauren, as the number two Republican, Thune is considered by some as McConnell's successor. But with the conference getting more and more fractured. could that actually hurt his chances?",

Republican senators still have a long way to go before many of them will make up their minds about who they think should succeed Mitch McConnell as the Republican leader.And so far, you have two men who are jumping into this race. John Cornyn, who previously served as the Republican whip. And John Thune, who currently serves as the Republican whip. As you noted, Thune has worked really closely with McConnell over the course of the last several years, but before that, Senator John Cornyn worked very closely with Mitch McConnell when he was in the number two slot. We did get some news this morning, though. John Barrasso, a member of Republican leadership has decided he will not run for Republican leader. Instead, he will run for that number two slot as the Republican whip as Thune and Cornyn are now facing off in that leadership race. So, a lot of moving parts happening right now. As people are moving up, as people are ascending within the conference, you're starting to see those lower-tier races also take shape. In this case, Barrasso announcing he's going to run for that number two slot, Wolf.",

Trump could end up winning more primaries and caucuses than any previous Republican presidential candidate who wasn't an incumbent. It's an indication that he is successfully transforming the GOP.CNN's Senior Political Analyst and Atlantic Senior Editor Ron Brownstein is joining us right now. Ron, you just wrote an excellent article for cnn.com. As we watch voters head to the polls today, how do you see Trump's grip fundamentally changing the GOP?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Wolf. You know, I think the primary so far has sent us an important dual message about the state of the Republican coalition. As you say, the clearest message is that this is Donald Trump's party. His coalition is the largest faction in the GOP.And if you look at the way elected officials are behaving, especially the younger ones elected since Trump's emergence, it's likely that he is going to be the dominant figure in this party for a while. For example, virtually all of the Republican senators elected since 2018 voted against the aid to Ukraine, a rejection of kind of the Reagan- era view about America's role in the world symbolized by Mitch McConnell who is stepping aside. But having said that, what the primaries are also showing us is that there is a meaningful slice of the GOP coalition that remains resistant to this vision. A quarter, a third, maybe higher in some states, where Nikki Haley has had the time and money to campaign. But there is a portion of Republicans who are uneasy about this, who feel disconnected from it. And the question remains whether Biden can harvest any of that and just support himself in November given their doubts about him as well.",

      "sentences": "Yes. He's more ideologically defined in the primaries than he was last time. In 2016, there really wasn't much difference in his support between moderates, somewhat conservative, and very conservative voters. That wasn't much difference between voters who are not evangelicals and those who were.Now, those gaps are much bigger. Trump is much more reliant on evangelical voters, much stronger among very conservative voters, and the biggest divide that we saw in 2016, which was education is even bigger this time. Trump's support among non-college Republicans is overwhelming. I mean, around 70 percent so far in most of these states. But among college-educated voters, he is still facing much more resistance. And that really is, as I say, Nikki Haley is leaving a trail of breadcrumbs for Joe Biden about where he can go. It's the same kind of voters that we saw in 2018, 2020, and 2022 reject Republicans and move toward the Democrats, why Biden became the first Democrat since Harry Truman 1948 to win Maricopa County and Phoenix, suburban white-collar voters. The difference, of course, is now these voters have had a four-year exposure to Biden and his record, and they are very negative on him. So, how these double negative voters, these Republican-leaning voters, in many cases, white-collar voters are down on Trump but also down on Biden, how they sort out is obviously going to be critical in November.",

      "sentences": "Well, it will differ because the emphasis is going to be different. James Crumbley is the one that purchased that gun for his son. And there was no secret it was an early Christmas present, a nine-millimeter SIG SAUER gun.And his name is the registered owner. He's on the receipt. So, he is in control of the care, the custody, and the safekeeping of that gun. That's going to be really I think, Exhibit A for the prosecution. Also, that text that Ethan wrote to his friend in his bedroom one night as they were texting back and forth -- he and his friend, he said, you know, I really asked my dad for mental health treatment. I need help. But he laughed at me. Told me to suck it up and take a pill. Well, the defense fought hard to not get that into this trial. Because they say look, you have a right to confront your witnesses. We can't confront a text. They did not win. That is coming in. And so, the only way I think the defense can really work around that is to put James Crumbley on the stand. Alternatively, it could be an argument. But I think another issue that has come up is that the prosecution wanted, and they are getting two more witnesses in this trial. Number one, one of the students that was shot but not killed. And from sitting in that courtroom during Ethan Crumbley's hearings, that is emotional testimony to see a minor -- a child talk about getting shot. Secondly, the previous gun owner of that nine-millimeter is going to take the stand. That was a used gun that James Crumbley purchased. And he's going to testify that he got a cable lock with it. We already know a cable lock came with the gun that James Crumbley purchased. We don't ever see it being used in any picture. So, prosecution is going to have that. But I think one big thing I just have to leave you with this. The defense really wanted to change the venue because, Wolf, you just said, it was about a month ago that Jennifer Crumbley was convicted in that same courthouse -- in that same courtroom, community is infused with his guilty verdict. And they said Your Honor, we need to go to another city in Michigan. Got -- the judge refused. So, jury selection today to get that jury is right in the same community.",
