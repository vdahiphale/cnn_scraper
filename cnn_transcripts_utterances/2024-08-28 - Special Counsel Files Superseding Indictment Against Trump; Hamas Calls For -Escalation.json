Tomorrow night right here on CNN, Kamala Harris and Tim Walz sit for their first joint interview. It's an opportunity for the campaign to address policy stances critics say they haven't taken. And the demographics that may sway the election. We'll speak with a mayor of a pivotal swing states city where the Latino population is the town's majority. (MUSIC)",

      "sentences": "All right, 5Good morning, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt. It's wonderful to have you with us. Donald Trump indicted once again, the special counsel Jack Smith forging ahead with a superseding indictment in the 2020 Trump election interference case. Despite last March -- last month's landmark Supreme Court ruling granting Trump partial immunity for official acts, the new indictment is a slimmed-down version of the original but prosecutors have not dropped any of the four charges that were initially brought against the former president. It's extremely unlikely this case goes to trial before November, but it does put Trump's alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election back in the spotlight as the race for the White House enters its final months. Trump naturally calling the new indictment a witch hunt and accusing the special counsel of election interference in a post on social media. Trump's running mate, J.D. Vance, also underscored Trump's message. This is what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. J.D. VANCE (R-OH), VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Yeah, I haven't read the whole thing. But it looks like Jack Smith doing more what he does, which is filing these lawsuits in an effort to influence the election. I think it's clearly an effort to try to do more election interference from Jack Smith. He should be ashamed of himself and it's one of the reasons why we have to win, because he should not be anywhere near power. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "So, Joey, I want to ask you about one of the lines of criticism Republicans are leveling at this, which they're insisting that it violates what is -- what is the so-called 60-day rule?Now this surfaced in a DOJ inspector general report. This is not a written down policy, but it is the way that they follow the rules here, it says that prosecutors avoid public disclosure of investigative steps related to electoral matters or the return of indictments against a candidate for office within 60 days of a primary or a general election. The inspector general's report says that high-ranking department FBI officials acknowledged the existence of this general practice that informs department decisions. Obviously, this was really on display in 2016 when Jim Comey was investigating Hillary Clinton and since use of private email. We are more than 60 days, barely, but we are more than 60 days from election day. Still, the Trump folks are out there arguing that early voting is set to start in much less than 60 days, and that, that should impact the decision making here. There's also the wrinkle that this is not an original indictments, a superseding one. How do you view this potential conflict?",

      "timeStamp": "05:05:09",
      "speaker": "JACKSON",
      "sentences": "So a few ways. In terms of a superseding indictment, first of all, an indictment is merely an accusation. Members of a grand jury get together, grand juries of body of individuals, right, and those individuals do not decide guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. They decide there's reason to believe that a crime was committed and Donald Trump, are at this and since committed it, the mere accusation.It doesn't take them, it doesn't take a unanimous grand jury. It takes, of course, a majority of the grand jury. And so, in terms of that, I'd say the Jack Smith has an absolute obligation as a special prosecutor to do his job. That's number one. Number two, the election, of course, itself, even though there's early voting is more than 60 days away. So they want to comport with that. Number three, they would directed to engage in this activity because of the Supreme Courts finding. This is not something that they decided were going to just two against the president. They attempted to do at former president, they attempted to do it before the Supreme Court and its immunity ruling on July 1st, said they were deficiencies and so they came back in an effort to comply with those deficiencies. And finally, Kasie, they did so because Judge Chutkan has an obligation. She's the judge presiding over this to make decisions. And so, this is not something that was done out of the blue. It comports with legal process and again, the indictment being not you're guilty, but an accusation he had to respond to and it would be a complete abdication of the special counsel had they done nothing. So I think its certainly legally proper and appropriate.",

But they're not giving much detail. I think was really interesting is what were seeing in parts of the Israeli media just saying that he was on his own, that he somehow managed to evade his captors within the tunnel and then he was discovered by the Israeli forces. Did he manage to escape his captors because of the operation or did he just manage to escape the captors? So, a pretty remarkable story there and a really hopeful one, but obviously, you know, he's making the point as everyone else is that there are still many more hostages there. So this is, of course, central sort of peace deal as well. Be a priority for Netanyahu throughout has been to not just destroy, Hamas, but it's get the hostages out and it's a good sign for him that he's managed to get one out, but there are still many left and others, of course, have very sadly died since.",
