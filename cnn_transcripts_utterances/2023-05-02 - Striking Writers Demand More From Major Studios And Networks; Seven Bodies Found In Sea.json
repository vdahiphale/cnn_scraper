Seth Myers and Jimmy Fallon have said that they will honor the strikes and not air new episodes of their shows as well.More than 11,000 members of the Writers Guild of America have walked. And analysts are expecting a long fight here. The writers are demanding better compensation, especially in this age of streaming. And they're going up against powerhouse names in entertainment. Names like Netflix, Paramount, and Warner Brothers Discovery, which is CNN's parent company. CNN's Vanessa Yurkevich is with some picketers in New York.

Second, we're hearing that the writers want longer employment contracts with television shows and films. It's also about regulation around artificial intelligence. Something that has been up ending jobs. And also, it's key to know about residuals around streaming. That is a key issue that we are hearing on the picket line. You're probably seeing a little bit of that messaging on the signs here. I want to bring in Judy Tate. She was on the picket line in 2007 during the last writer's strike.

So, this isn't really surprising.But I will say based on what we know about Cogliano's injury, it could have been much more severe. That's because we know, according to his team, that he fractured his C-5 vertebra. And we spoke with an orthopedic surgeon who said fractures to the C-5 vertebra in some cases can cause paralysis. And we also know that with spinal fracture, symptoms include pain in the neck or back, tingling, numbness, weakness, paralysis, uncontrolled muscle spasms.
