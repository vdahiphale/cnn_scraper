Is there anything we could attack with respect to a motion to dismiss?And that takes a village. It takes an effort, right, by all attorneys on board. It takes the evaluation of it and it takes the experience, of course, of really seasoned minds to evaluate and determine what the proper defenses are at last point. Again, there's one thing from a public relations perspective to give the narrative. It's another thing when you're in a courtroom to give a narrative that attacks the evidence, and today we're going to be all about the evidence when we get that indictment.",
