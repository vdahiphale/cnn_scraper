We are just over one week until Election Day when the polls close and both Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump are fighting for every last vote in the key battleground states.Moments ago, we just saw Donald Trump speaking at a religious event in Powder Springs, Georgia outside Atlanta. He got another event in the Peach State tonight. You'll remember Trump barely lost Georgia in 2020 and of course was later captured on a recording pressuring state officials to illegally overturn Biden's victory. Across the country, we expect to see Vice President Harris in just a few minutes in Saginaw, Michigan, about 90 minutes northwest of Detroit. This is one of three events the Vice President is holding in Michigan today, one of the blue wall states that sent Biden to the White House and may be crucial for Harris' victory as the Harris campaign tries to turn out the vote in the Great Lake State. There have already been more than 1.7 million pre-election ballots cast there so far. CNN's Eva McKend is in Ann Arbor, Michigan where Vice President Harris is moments away from holding her second of three campaign events in the state. And Eva, today Harris is focusing on what voters say is their number one issue, the economy.",

She was in Saginaw at a semiconductor facility visiting with workers on the assembly line talking about what she characterizes as wins of the Biden-Harris administration as it relates to the CHIPS Act, which they argued fortified those types of manufacturing jobs. And this is also included in her policy vision.The opportunity economy includes strengthening American apprenticeship programs as well as tax credits for American manufacturers. Now she's in Macomb County and in Macomb she will visit a labor union training facility. And listen, this is what Democrats in some corners say they want to see. They want her to close in on this type of argument, an affirmative case for why she wants to be president. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

That's because for many states it takes time for them to tabulate all the ballots and this has been historically at least according to polls a close race.It is also possible that former president Donald Trump will declare victory early before many crucial battleground state ballots have been even counted. We believe that that's possible because he did it four years ago. That was in fact a plan. It wasn't off the cuff.

It wasn't until Saturday, November 7th, four days after Election Day at 11:24 in the morning East Coast time, that Pennsylvania was finally called for Biden and that delivered him the 270 electoral votes needed to be president. And there were still five more projections to be made in several swing states, at least one of which Trump won. Hours after the presidency was called on November 7th, Nevada was called for Biden by a very narrow margin, more than a week after Election Day, Alaska was called on November 11th. Arizona was called for Biden on November 12th. On November 13th, Georgia was called for Biden. North Carolina was called for Trump during this same time frame. The Stop the Steal Movement that had been pushed by Trump's allies such as Roger Stone and Steve Bannon really took off among many of Trump's supporters. They protested at state capitals and had voting centers demanding that there be a recount. They believed a lot of lies that the election had been stolen from Trump. And as we know, the Stop the Steal Movement led to one of the darkest days in American history, the U.S. Capitol insurrection on January 6th, 2021. Fast forward to this election cycle.

Turning now to one of the people involved in many of Trump's plans in 2020. Will disgraced former Trump attorney, Rudy Giuliani, have to part with his Palm Beach condo and World Series rings? That's what a New York judge is considering today in a hearing over how two Georgia election workers that Giuliani defamed, according to a court, will be compensated. Giuliani repeatedly accused Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss of election fraud in 2020. They had not committed election fraud. It was all a lie. The two women say they received death threats as a result of those lies. Giuliani has already been ordered to hand over by tomorrow his $6 million New York City apartment, about $2 million allegedly owed to him by the campaign of Donald Trump, a signed Joe DiMaggio jersey and 26 watches, among other items. CNN's Katelyn Polantz joins us right now with CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig. So, Katelyn, you were in court for today's hearing. What happened?",

They're already getting quite a chunk of it. But that Palm Beach condo is at issue. That was primarily what was discussed in court. It's worth about $3.5 million.Giuliani is currently living there. He says it's his primary residence. They say it may be a vacation home. It certainly looks like he didn't stay there very much. And even when he was just in bankruptcy a couple months ago, he was claiming New York was his primary residence. And so there is a question of whether he's going to be able to keep control of that Palm Beach condo as his sole home. Even if he's staying in other places right now, he can't do a lot with it except stay there. The judge is going to work that out in the next couple of weeks. And then the other question, Jake, what about those World Series rings? Giuliani has four, three from the 90s, these are Yankees championship rings, and then one from 2000. He kept wearing the 2000 ring that was from the Subway Series. The other three he gave to his son, Andrew Giuliani, or so they say in court. That is all going to be determined by the judge as well. What was discussed, though, in court was the answers that Giuliani needs to give, where his tax returns showing he gave this as a gift, the rings.

He said, I do not contest the fact that my words were defamatory. And then the verdict came down for the amount of $148 million. So he doesn't have much to appeal there in terms of the verdict itself. Now, separately, his lawyers have said he's going to try to stop the district court judge from doing exactly what he was doing in court that Katelyn just described, which is seizing certain assets and turning them over to the plaintiffs in this case. The problem, though, is the district court already rejected that motion.This kind of thing, how you pay off a debt, is uniquely within the province and the discretion of a trial court judge.

A new report released just moments ago from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service says the beef is not the probable source of the E. coli outbreak. Joining us now, CNN's Meg Tirrell. So, Meg, what was the cause of the outbreak?",

But they're really seeming to home in on these fresh slivered onions that McDonald's uses on the quarter pounder. And that statement just out from the Department of Agriculture echoes what we heard from McDonald's late yesterday where it said it had ruled out the beef patties. Essentially, they had looked at testing from the Colorado Department of Agriculture, which said it found no traces of E. coli in beef patties.And so it's asking their suppliers to provide new supplies of beef patties. And they're going to be bringing the quarter pounder back into all of those affected restaurants over the course of this week. But they will not have the fresh slivered onions on them as this investigation continues into those. McDonald's says, quote, the issue appears to be contained to a particular ingredient and geography. And they say they're very confident that any contaminated product related to this outbreak has been removed from the supply chain and is out of all McDonald's restaurants. Jake, this has stretched to about 75 cases now, 22 hospitalizations and one death. So McDonald's is trying to reassure folks that their food is now safe to eat, including the returning quarter pounders. Jake?",

In the three days since the first wrote about the decision by owner, Jeff Bezos, to block a planned endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris by the \"Post's\" editorial board. You've seen a series of resignations, two columnists resign, two editorial writers resign.But -- and you've also seen this sort of revulsion or outcry on social media. Well, it turns out to be real that over 200,000 people have canceled subscriptions to the \"Washington Post\" in just three days. And that figure is rising, I'm told. You know, that reflects about 8 percent of the posts call it 2.5 million subscribers if you combine digital and print subscriptions. And it's an astonishing reaction. You know, usually you see a protest like this rise to the level of a few hundred or at times in a moment of great outcry to a few thousand. This is, of course, you know, 100 times greater. And it's something that really will batter that newsroom and its morale after a series of deflating moves, not least of which because that newsroom has been involved in cov -- covering so many instances of wrongdoing and alleged illegalities by former President Trump and his circle of associates. But also that editorial page, which is run separately, has made such a clarion call of the idea that Trump is himself a threat to the American democratic experiment. And yet here they are just days before this razor's edge election, saying we're not going to make an endorsement at all.",
