A big breakthrough in Hollywood, rioters reached a tentative deal with studios to end their strike.We're live in Los Angeles and a new deal between the U.S. and Mexico, the aim easing the migrant crisis that's overwhelming American border towns. We'll have a special report. Ukraine is reporting significant damage after Russia launched a major offensive on the port city of Odessa overnight. Officials in Southern Ukraine say the missile and drone attack targeted port infrastructure. Grain storage facilities were destroyed and this hotel was heavily damaged. The two people were reported killed and one has been injured. Ukraine's grain facilities have been a constant target for Russia, since Moscow pulled out of the U.N. brokered deal allowing safe grain exports. Fred Pleitgen joins us from Eastern Ukraine with the very latest, Fred?",

      "sentences": "Hi, there Max, what seems to be, a pretty complex attack with the Russians conducted there and the overnight hours on the town of Odessa. And the Ukrainians are calling it pathetic retaliation, as they say for Ukrainian strike on the Russian Black Sea Fleet headquarters in Sevastopol.That, of course happened on Friday in which the Ukrainian say caused significant damage to that headquarters that they're on Friday. Now the Ukrainian says that in total, they had 19 drones that were involved in this from the Russian side then also 14 cruise missiles and a pretty complex configuration. They say 12 of those cruise missiles were caliber cruise missiles. Those are cruise missiles that travel at subsonic speeds but they can certainly maneuver and they seem to have maneuvered in various directions before making course for Odessa. The Ukrainians say that of those 12 caliber cruise missiles that were fired. They were able to take out 11 of those, but one of them obviously hit a target in Odessa. The other two cruise missiles that were used were very modern ones by the Russians. They're called Oniks cruise missiles. They're actually usually used to destroy warships. And Russians used to have those they travel at supersonic speeds. And it appears as though those may have hit their targets. Now you're absolutely right. The Ukrainians are seeing that grain facilities were hits in Odessa. Of course, that's something that we have been seeing quite a lot over the past couple of weeks from the Russians and something that's been condemned not just by the Ukrainians, but by the international community as well. But one of the big targets that seemed to have been hit is a hotel in Odessa that is also very close to the seafront there. The Ukrainians are saying that hotel has not been in use for years. However, there was some pretty dramatic footage that came out overnight of that hotel complex on fire. With flames shooting through there in the early morning hours, you could see that there was substantial damage to that complex. The Russians had been hinting that they believed that there was possibly Ukrainian military in there so far. There's nothing to suggest that that could be correct. Again, the Ukrainians are saying that facility has not been in use for years now. And certainly they say that there was no one inside that facility. Nevertheless, the damage very extensive on the ground in Odessa, the Ukrainians are saying that in total, two people were killed. They also say that as a result of them taking down some of those cruise missiles that some of those missile parts then landed on private houses as well causing damage certainly very difficult night once again for the folks there in Odessa. All of this been condemned by the Ukrainian government again calling this pathetic retaliation after the Ukrainian say they conducted a very successful strike on the Black Sea Fleet headquarters of the Russians in occupied Crimea in the town of Sevastopol, Max.",

Niger's ruling military junta is welcoming France's decision to pull its troops from the country by the end of the year some 1500 French troops are stationed in Niger to assist in counter terror missions. This comes months after Niger's military overthrew the democratically elected President and a coup.French President Emmanuel Macron says he's also withdrawing the French Ambassador from Niger. The U.S. Defense Secretary is in Africa for the first time in that role to discuss regional security. Here you can see Lloyd Austin arriving in Nairobi, Kenya a short while ago. There he'll talk about shared security interests in counterterrorism efforts. He began his trip with a stop in Djibouti, where he met with U.S. military troops and spoke with the Presidents of Djibouti and Somalia about their fight against extremist groups like al-Shabaab. CNN's Larry Madowo joins us now live from Nairobi, Kenya, a huge amount for the defense secretary to take in considering the current dynamics in that region.",

You'll recall that the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau linked the death to the Indian government that goes around between the two countries.Now, the U.S. Ambassador to Canada, David Cohen tells CTV News, the information came through the so called Five Eyes, that's the Intel sharing packs between the U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Cohen as the U.S. is deeply concerned about the allegations. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DAVID COHEN, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO CANADA: The United States takes very seriously these allegations. And you know, if they prove to be true, it is a potentially very serious breach of the rules based international order in which we like to function or this is something we're treating we take very seriously. And we think it's very important to get to the bottom of it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And of course, we encourage India to co-operate.This is generally a spat between India and Canada quite a serious one. Now Max, that people it whether it's in the Five Eyes, in the G 7, or in the G 20 want to keep contained. I will note you heard Ambassador Cohen there I asked the State Department to repeat that comment to CNN and they refused, saying they refuse to comment on intelligence matters. I will say that the Ambassador went out on a limb there because normally that kind of intelligence is not divulged whatsoever, even though sources in both Canada and the United States have indicated that some of that came from Five Eyes. What's so controversial here, Max is the implication. That perhaps one of the countries whether it was the United States, Canada, or someone else was eavesdropping on Indian diplomats here in Canada, and that's something that would be frowned upon. Again, all of this caught up, as you say in the murder of a controversial Sikh leader. What Canadian authorities tell us now, Max, is that they're leaning on the investigation, the criminal investigation that's going on in just outside of Vancouver. What they hope is that they have more information soon so that they can have some arrests in that case, that is actually what is at the heart of this. Can you imagine having a person like that murdered in cold blood in Canadian streets and still no suspects arrested, Max?",

So the boss of bosses is now dead now. And only now will they be able to really anoint a new leader.Even though he's been in prison, people have been watching very closely, he didn't cooperate. In fact, he, you know, dug his heels in saying he wasn't part of any organized crime syndicate, despite the obvious proof that he was, you know, this is a man who once bragged that he killed enough people to fill a cemetery. And now of course, he's going to be joining them. But it won't be public. He will not be allowed to have a public funeral, which is in line with other mafia and organized crime bosses here they are prohibited from being celebrated in depth. You know, this is a man who we expected would die. And in fact, a lot of people think that his arrest was orchestrated because he needed more health care. He was arrested in a private clinic in Palermo in January after 30 years on the run, you know, his legacy is one of blood and death and, you know, really, really at the heart of organized crime here in this country, which is still very, very much a problem, Max.",

Right now, there's no deal in sight. How Speaker Kevin McCarthy is trying to defuse the demands of hardline Republican lawmakers who are holding funding hostage by demanding steep spending cuts.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, meanwhile, is taking steps to advance a short term bill that will have bipartisan support.

You have a number of conservatives who are vowing that they will not support a short term Republican spending bill that would avert the shutdown.But they are also warning that they could hold up individual spending bills expected to go to the floor this week. So this is ultimately going to be a decision by House Speaker Kevin McCarthy whether or not he is going to accept that bipartisan deal the Senate is working on which would be negotiated with Democrats and could face really a lot of frustration from those on his right flank if he puts it on the floor. Or ultimately McCarthy may decide that he finds a shutdown to be more politically palatable to his future as Speaker. So that is the big question looming right now. But as I said, House Republicans expected to put a series of individual spending bills on the floor of the House of Representatives. And none of the bills that they are working on would avert a government shutdown for a few reasons, in part because it would only fun part of the government, and it would be dead on arrival in the United States Senate. So again, the choice for McCarthy come Friday or Saturday is likely going to be accepting that Senate negotiated deal assuming it can get out of that chamber or shutting the government down, Max.",
