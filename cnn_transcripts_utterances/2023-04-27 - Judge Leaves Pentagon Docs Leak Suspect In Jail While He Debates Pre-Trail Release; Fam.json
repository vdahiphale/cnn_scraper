She consulted with a team of physicians and specialists, both at the hospital where I was denied and then eventually received treatment, as well as her colleagues outside of Austin but still in the state of Texas, and there is a lot of confusion about what the law means, and the way that it's written is so vague that doctors don't know what they can and can't do and what health care they can and cannot provide.And if they make the wrong decision, they can face up to 99 years in prison and/or lose their license. And so, they're afraid to act. And the reason why there is so much confusion, that's the way the law was written. As a matter of fact, when the Dobbs decision came down, the administration put out language to clarify when women should be able to receive an abortion, and Ken Paxton, the attorney general in the state of Texas, sued over it, so that guidance would be revoked.

And during this cross-examination, he sought to poke holes in Carroll's credibility and tried to suggest that she was motivated by politics and money.But the real tense moment came when he focused on the specific allegation when Carroll said Trump raped her in a department store dressing room in 1996. He asked her to go through the sequence of events that took place that day, how they ended up from meeting in the lobby going up to the escalator to the 6th floor where the lingerie is, and ending up in the dressing room where Carroll said pushed her against the wall and raped her. You know, Tacopina was going hard at Carroll, asking her why she didn't scream? They spent a lot of time on this question, if this was happening to her, if she was fighting for her life, why she didn't scream. And there was a bit of an exchange her, couple of exchanges. In one of them, he's asking her again and again why she didn't scream, and Carroll testified, you can't beat me up for screaming. Tacopina said, I'm not beating you up, I'm asking questions, Ms. Carroll. This continued then for a while and Carroll said with her voice cracking, I'm telling you, he raped me, whether I screamed or not. Then later on in the series of questioning, Tacopina said, so you didn't scream while you were being violently raped because you didn't want to make a scene? Carroll said that's right. That's probably why I didn't scream. He also then was asking her specifics about this encounter, saying she was wearing four-inch heels, how could she fight off Trump in four- inch heels? Carroll said she could dance backwards and forwards in four-inch heels. He also asked her why her tights weren't ripped if she was being attacked, she said they were flexible tights. And he asked about her handbag. She said she had it in her hand the entire time and he questioned how that was possible if she was pushing off the former president, who was more than twice her weight. You know, they also were going back and forth over why she never reported this attack, and her friend -- one of her friends she talked to advised her not to saying -- remember, this is back in the '90s when Trump is the real estate tycoon, a tabloid figure. And her friend advised her that he would bury her. So, Tacopina asking Carroll, now, he's the most powerful man in the world as the former president, now is when you bring this case. And Carroll said she was inspired by all the women that came forward in the Harvey Weinstein matter and that is why she spoke up now -- Bianna.",
