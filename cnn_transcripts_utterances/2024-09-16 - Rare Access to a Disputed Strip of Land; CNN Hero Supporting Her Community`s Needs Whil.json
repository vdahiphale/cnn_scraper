      "sentences": "Well, we`re being taken by the Israeli military into the Gaza Strip, and they`ve loaded usall, as you can see, into this metal sided truck. We`re going into the south bit of the Gaza Strip, which the Israeli military say they have under full operational control, but it`s not entirely secure. They brought us to this place called the Philadelphi Corridor. It`s emerged as a sticking point in the negotiations to get a ceasefire and to get the hostages released. As you can see, it`s right up against the Egyptian border. And it`s important, because the Israelis say this is an area which has been used over the years as a way of smuggling weapons into the Gaza Strip. Some of the smuggling has taken place over land, through, presumably, holes in the fence and through other border crossings. But a lot of it has been taking place right under our feet. OK. Well, this is one of those tunnels. It`s right on the border with Egypt. And you can see it is absolutely huge, wide enough to drive a car right, right the way through it. The Israeli military say that this tunnel, because it`s so close to the Egyptian frontier, has been used by Hamas and other militants to store weapons in and to fire rockets from. You see here the -- the back of the wall, it`s completely collapsed down. Apparently it was closed for some time now. We`re driving now through the neighborhood of Tal as Sultan. Every one of the buildings here has been totally destroyed. You know, this was obviously a residential area with many people living in it. And the Israeli military say those people have moved, for the most part, to safe zones, humanitarian areas not far from here, but look what they have left behind. Look what has happened to Gaza. Thank you. Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari is the Chief Spokesperson for the Israeli military. How can you justify causing so much, you know, damage, devastation, destruction in -- in -- in pursuit of your objectives?",

If you don`t demolish it, then Hamas will go back and have a stronghold, a military stronghold. He is using the population, embedding in the population. He is creating this destruction and also the death of the population.",

They`ve showed us what they have. It`s definitely a -- a narrow view. But it is also the only view right now that we can get first hand. Matthew Chance, CNN in the southern Gaza Strip.

Her experience as a foster parent and adoptive mother inspired her to fill in the gaps and provide resources for Native American youth and their families, while also keeping them connected to their cultural and historical roots.

We became licensed foster parents over 11 years ago. When I tell people I was abundantly blessed within six months, I became a mom to four children that were all under the age of two years old. When the case manager said, you have 48 hours and we need this car seat back, I`m like, what? So that`s where I kind of knew where the gap was and we needed to make a change and needed to figure out resources.",

I would tell my family, like, don`t throw away your stuff. There`s people that need it. Let`s wash it and clean it. This is my mad chaos is what I call it. This is our space to put all of our goodies. Usually we get a request for like clothing or diapers. And if we have the stuff, we`ll give it to you. There`s such a huge need. Arizona has over 10,000 children in foster care. Reports show that about 10% of that population is Native American. Those numbers don`t reflect the massive amount that we have. There`s thousands of Native children that are in care and could be connected to culture. And I thought we really should be doing more.",

When I was adopted to my mom`s house, she made the extra step to make sure that I was connected back to my roots. It`s a surreal experience. It`s just like that feeling like deja vu at like a powwow. There`s a lot of kids that are kind of in my similar situation. I don`t know if they`re like foster or adopted, but I know they`re struggling to find themselves. It helps them. That inspires me to find out as much as I can about who I am as a person, what I can do for my community. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
