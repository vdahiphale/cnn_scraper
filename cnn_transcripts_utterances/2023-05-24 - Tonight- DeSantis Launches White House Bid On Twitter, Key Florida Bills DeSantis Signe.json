Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is set to launch his presidential campaign today. And he's going to do it in a somewhat surprising way. Not holding a big rally like we saw from Tim Scott just this week. Not putting out a big video like we saw from President Joe Biden announcing his reelection bid. Instead opting for a Twitter chat with Twitter owner Elon Musk. The event is being billed as a live unscripted Q&amp;A.But make no mistake, team DeSantis has been fine tuning his 2024 script for months. And despite a dip in recent polling, DeSantis is still seen as posing the greatest primary threat to the current Republican front runner Donald Trump. And that has become evident as in Trump's recent attacks against the governor who he once endorsed, those attacks have been sharpening. One fun fact. If elected President Ron DeSantis, at 44 years old would be the youngest -- one of the youngest presidents ever behind JFK and Teddy Roosevelt. A striking contrast with both Donald Trump and Joe Biden, of course. Let's get started. CNN's Steve Contorno. He's in Florida. He's standing by. Steve, what more are you learning about the rollout, the campaign rollout plans for Ron DeSantis today?",

And DeSantis from there will host a fundraiser here in Florida, where his campaign will begin dialing for dollars to get as many resources as possible to take this challenge directly to Donald Trump. They already have more than $100 million -- $100 million dollars behind them. And that number is expected to grow by the end of the week.Now DeSantis has been teasing this announcement for months now. He has had this long roll out of the campaign. It's included a book tour. National travels, stops in early States even an inter -- international trip, but this will become official later today. His -- his wife, First Lady Kate -- Casey DeSantis, teased the announcement yesterday with a video showing her husband walking out onto the stage.

However, his Super PAC's supporting him has been spending a considerable amount of resources in recent weeks defending DeSantis on the air and going after Donald Trump.So while he is publicly avoiding confrontations with Donald Trump so far, he has a Super PAC who is sort of doing the dirty work for him.

When this video was shot just a couple of hours ago, they were under what is called an extreme wind warning, the National Weather Service reserves that for only the most extreme wind cases, it's like getting hit with a tornado for several hours. That is what they are experiencing, especially across the northern and western sections of the island of Guam.Here's the latest satellite imagery. And we've been analyzing this and keeping a very close eye on it because we thought a direct landfall was imminent. But what it did is gone -- it went through what is called an eyewall replacement. So actually curve the storm just north of the island and it's now basically hugging the coastline on the western shoreline. And that has major implication on who gets the storm surge, who gets the heaviest rain, and also the strongest winds. 140 mile per hour winds at the moment near the center of the circulation. It's a slow mover. So it's dumping a lot of rain. But here's the impacts on the storm surge, four to six feet. If you recall yesterday, we had up to 20 feet here along the east coast. That was with the anticipated landfall for that section. But that didn't happen. So that's the good news. But nonetheless, they're still getting walloped by heavy rainfall and flash flood warnings in place for this area, of flood warning I should say with some of the rain gauges already picking up over a foot with yet another five to 10 inches of additional rainfall. You can imagine what that means in terms of landslides, and mudslides. Here's a look at the winds. They're going to be in tropical storm force winds for the next 24 hours, Sara.",

But one thing remains clear, both sides are very far apart when it comes to agreeing on how much money they think the federal government should be spending over the next several years.At the cornerstone of this negotiation, has been the question of not just raising the country's borrowing limit but what the negotiators would agree to when it comes to spending caps and that remains the key sticking point. I talked repeatedly yesterday to Garret Graves and Patrick McHenry, two of the leading Republican negotiators and they said both sides remain very far apart. Kevin McCarthy echoed that once again this morning saying these talks have been productive, but there still is not the kind of significant progress that you would expect to see given the fact that we are now eight days. I will repeat that, eight days away from that June 1 deadline. That is the date. [09:10:00] Of course, the Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has laid out as potentially the very first moment where the U.S. could default on its debt. And, John, I will just underscore to you that there are some conservatives who are now arguing that that June 1 date might be in question saying that Janet Yellen may not be being forthcoming about that date. We should just note that one of the lead Republican negotiators Patrick McHenry said yesterday, he trusts Yellen, he believes her that the Treasury Department is full of bureaucrats who do not pull punches, and that June 1 is the date that the Republican negotiators are operating off of.

Now there could be more charges added onto that because he was arrested on several charges on Monday night when he -- when he was arrested. So we'll see if more federal charges are added to that.We do expect that he will be advised of his rights as a federal defendant that he will fight we will find out if he has an attorney. And if so, what his attorney may be saying about all of this. If the government decides to ask to keep him behind bars until his trial, then we do expect the judge to set a date for a detention hearing. We do expect that this that the judge presiding over this hearing when it happens and we don't know exactly the time that it will happen today. That this judge will be Magistrate Judge Robin Merriweather, who will preside over this. So we'll learn a little bit more incrementally about where he stands legally, whether he has an attorney and what the attorney will be saying. Now we do have some detail from charging documents that were filed yesterday of some disturbing comments that he made about white supremacism, about Nazism. As we know, as we've been reporting, when he emerged from that truck, went after it rammed into that security barrier on Monday night. He had on him a Nazi flag; it have had a swastika on it. Now according to the Secret Service agents who interrogated him, who interviewed him and who filled out these charging documents. He made some comments about admiring the Nazi culture, about admiring their authoritarian nature is what he called it their eugenics and their quote \"one world order\", that he admired Adolf Hitler because, quote, \"he was a strong leader\". So some very disturbing things coming out in his charging documents there. We're going to learn a little bit more about that maybe later on today. Also, you know, we did speak to two former high school classmates of this young man and they described him, Sai Varshith Kandula. As a very quiet young man who never gotten in any trouble in high school.
