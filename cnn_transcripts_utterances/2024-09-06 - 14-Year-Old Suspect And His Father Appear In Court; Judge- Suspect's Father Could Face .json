I'm Jake Tapper.This hour, with just four days until their very first debate, the first time they're actually meeting ever, a key Harris ally has a warning for the vice president. The warning is do not underestimate Donald Trump. What we're learning about both candidates last minute's preparations for the big debate. Plus, former Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney confirms that her father, the former vice president of the United States, two terms, very conservative, is going to join her in voting for Vice President Kamala Harris this November. And Cheney just revealed her plans for campaigning against Donald Trump. And leading this hour, an emotional day in the courtroom for heartbroken Georgia families as the suspect in this week's school shooting and his father made their first appearances before a judge. The 14-year-old suspect learned he will not face the death penalty because he is a minor, although he will be tried as an adult. As for his father, the father now faces a maximum sentence of 180 years behind bars for giving his son a gun knowing that his son was, quote, \"a threat to himself and others,\" according to the affidavit. Let's bring in CNN Senior Legal Analyst Elie Honig. Elie, the father allegedly gave the gun to his son despite knowing that his son was a threat to others. What other evidence could play a major role for prosecutors here?",

And so to that end, I think prosecutors are going to be drawn to the fact that last year, in May of 2023, Georgia police visited the home because of complaints about the son posting online, fantasizing about a school shooting. So, I would be looking to prove, A, that the father knew about that visit, and B, that the father knew about those postings. I think if you combine that with the fact that the father then gave the 14-year-old an AR-15 as a gift, think you have a strong case there.",

However, I think this is a wakeup call, and I do applaud, you know, what happened in Michigan, and I applaud that this is being prosecuted here in Georgia as well. And I think that this is a wakeup call to any parent that has guns in the home. That's not to say you are a bad parent. It is to say, are you being as safe as you need to be?Are you recognizing signs of crisis in your child? Are you taking action and getting them the support that they need? And are you ensuring that they don't have access to things like AR-15s, especially if they're troubled? These are simple responsibilities that good firearm owners practice. So I think this is a wakeup call to say you're not immune to this just because of some other laws that are on the books at the moment, like PLCAA.

It's almost twelve years since Dylan was killed, and I still grieve for him every single day, and I will until the day I die, and as will my surviving son. You know, I reached out to him afterwards and I said, how are you doing?And he said, this is heartbreaking. He said, even the social media, the texts that are going out on social media as children in that school were reaching out to their parents. So I think there's -- we're holding that community in our hearts, and we're going to help them through this in the same way so many communities have helped so many other people through this, and it's going to take time. So I would just say, hold on to the ones that you love, but also, when you're ready, use your voice if you want to, and if you're able to, demand better legislation, demand more accountability, demand people recognize the signs and even demand things like understanding, getting access to social media records. We know that firearms are marketed to kids. This father gave his son an AR-15 as a holiday gift. I don't know if the child put that on his wish list for Santa because he'd been marketed from all the things that he saw on social media or not.

He endorsed that Israel has a right to self-defense. But then he also said this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. TIM WALZ (D-MI), VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: We can't allow what's happened in Gaza to happen. The Palestinian people have every right to life and liberty themselves. We need to continue, I think, to -- to put the leverage on to make sure we move towards a two-state solution.

This was done -- this would have been done, rather, the -- the DOJ is saying in support of ISIS. We have a quote from the attorney general, Merrick Garland. He said that this man had the stated goal of slaughtering in the name of ISIS as many Jewish people as possible. Now, Khan also spoke with undercover federal U.S. officials. And in -- during those conversations, on an encrypted app, he admitted to the plot. He had initially planned to go somewhere else and then changed his plans to target a Jewish center in Brooklyn. And during these conversations, he said that New York is the perfect place to target Jews because it has the largest Jewish population in America. Going on to say, if we succeed with our plan, this would be the largest attack on U.S. soil since 9/11. He planned to coordinate this attack with another ISIS supporter here in the United States using AR style semiautomatic and automatic weapons. He was arrested two days ago, on September 4th as he went towards the border, the Canadian side of the border with the United States. Obviously an -- an extremely troubling plot, the kind of thing that certainly authorities are going to be very afraid, the kind of thing that could happen as we get closer to that anniversary on October 7th, Jake.",

NASA decided it was just too risky to put the two astronauts on this troubled craft. We're joined now by CNN space and defense correspondent Kristin Fisher, who's live at the Johnson Space Center in Houston.

This is the exact place where Butch and Suni and likely Commander Hadfield would have trained for their missions to the International Space Station. And this right here is the Harmony module. It basically serves as the bedroom for the NASA astronauts while they're up there. And the docking port that is attached to the Harmony module, that is where Starliner is currently docked. And so what you're going to see soon on your screens is Starliner pushing away from the docking port that is attached to the Harmony module of the International Space Station. And Jake, you know, obviously the biggest concern with the undocking and return to Earth for Starliner was, of course, to those two astronauts, Starliner's crew, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams. But there was at least some discussion that because of these faulty thrusters that the spacecraft could somehow jeopardize the space station itself, NASA says they're not worried about that, though, because there are springs attached to both this docking port and the Starliner spacecraft itself. So even if those thrusters malfunction again, Jake, those springs, good old fashioned springs, should be able to push Starliner a safe distance away from the Space Station. Jake?",
