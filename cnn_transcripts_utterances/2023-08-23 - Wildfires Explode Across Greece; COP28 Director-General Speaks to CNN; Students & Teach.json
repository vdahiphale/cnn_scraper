In the last few hours India's Chandrayaan 3 Spacecraft made a successful soft landing on the moon, making it the fourth nation ever to achieve that feat. And the first ever to touch down near the rough terrain of the unexplored Lunar South Pole. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the landing a success for all humanity.

You had the Chandrayaan team clapping it static and just before those nerves of steel quite literally before the landing could happen those 15 minutes Becky, the last 15 minutes extremely crucial. That's where it went wrong back in 2019, with Chandrayaan 2, the second lunar mission for India to the moon. That's where it lost contact with the lander. But this time four years later, it was a total success. From the very moment it entered the trajectory that it was supposed to the landing, it was seamless, according to the Indian Space Agency known as ISRO here in India, the Chief of ISRO that's what he had to say that the spacecraft has landed on the moon. If you look at social media feeds right now and responses, everyone is saying that a part of India is now on the moon. There are celebrations across social media on the streets of India. We were at a government research center here in New Delhi, covering that very moment, Becky. You had young children coming in with the national flag waving it after the spacecraft landed on the lunar surface. You had young people old people clapping standing up a standing ovation the moment this happened. You had Narendra Modi India's Prime Minister at the BRICS Summit in South Africa tuning in just minutes before the landing, hoping that it'll be successful. The last time in 2019 he was at the Mission Center, which was a heartbreaking moment for the ISRO Chief and for the Indian Prime Minister. But that was the moment he asked them to move on to work hard and four years down the line in 2023 today, it's a historic moment for India. And it marks like you said India being the first country in the world to make its imprint on the south polar region of the lunar surface. Becky.",

Zero methane by 2030, we've set out very clear standards, which by the way, are based on actions that we're taking at home. And then we need to decarbonize the energy system that we have today.

We know today that we are not on track to achieve the goals that were set out in Paris. Our global stock take is telling us that we're not on track. So we need to start to think about what should we be doing differently that will get us there. But we can't do this with an exclusive kind of conversation. We need to have an inclusive conversation, one that includes NGOs, civil society, indigenous people activist, but one that also includes industry, CEOs, leaders those who have the resources, the technology, the engineers, the ability to make the changes, and to help us to solve these quite frankly, hard conversations. We're as a COP Presidency, our COP Presidency of the UAE. And yes, our oil and gas company is part of a group of companies who are working with us to try to find solutions. But we as a COP Presidency are holding this industry to task. We're saying everybody is welcome to come to the UAE, who when they come, we want to make sure that they are bringing their solutions. They're bringing their ideas, and we're setting a very high bar for how they can participate in COP28. Because we're a COP that is about practical solutions, that is going to get us to that 1.5 degree target that was promised in Paris and Becky that seven years away 2030 is seven years away.

Ukraine's elite sniper unit from the security services the SBU are usually invisible, like the U.S. Delta Force, chosen for fitness and intelligence, unlike Delta, fighting for their homeland survival for nearly 18 months. They gave CNN a rare interview as they honed their sniper scopes to broadcast the damage they say they've been doing to Russian frontlines. Its sniper terror, he says that's when we hit every target we spot. It demoralizes them and kills their will to do anything against us. But it's not always one sided. Five weeks ago, they stumbled at night into a Russian recon group. We were in the gray zone between our lines that commander says using a guide from another unit. But we ran into a Russian assault group doing pretty much the same thing as us moving towards our front position. We opened fire, our guide was wounded. We suppress them, pulled him out, pulled in artillery and then watch them fall back with their wounded. They do not always escape. Sasha knows that too well. I've lost many people, he says, the best ones leave us first. His upper lip folds in slightly from an injury when a large shell hit his chest, legs and face last March. It was unpleasant he says. But I had 16 operations to rebuild my bones and teeth and I got back into the fight. Western help has kept them afloat, they say, this anti-armor Barrett sniper rifle or donation used so often that its suppressor has come loose and detaches.
