Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign is hoping that that scandal helps her eke out a win in North Carolina, which Democrats have only done on the presidential level once in the last 44 years.

General Assembly this week, with the Secret Service already on high alert after that second assassination attempt on former President Trump just one week ago. That's all as the simmering crisis in the Middle East begins to flare up even more and the terrorist group Hezbollah in Lebanon retaliates against Israel after the surprise attacks. Joining us now, top Trump ally Republican Senator Tom Cotton, a member of the Senate Intelligence and Armed Services Committee who also served in the military himself. Thanks so much for joining us. Really appreciate it. So, for almost a year now, Israel has been fighting on five different fronts, Hamas to its west, Hezbollah to the north, the Houthis to the south, Iran and its proxies in Iraq and Syria in the east and northeast. And just this morning, there was a new round of rocket fire and airstrikes between Israel and Hezbollah. How concerned are you about a bigger, larger regional war and the United States being pulled in or voluntarily going into the war? SEN. TOM COTTON (R-AR):  Well, if there is a larger war, it's not going to be by accident. Wars don't happen by accident. They happen because -- in this case because Iran and its terrorist network all around Israel, as you just laid out, Jake, are intent on destroying Israel. A lot of attention has been focused over the last 11 months, rightly so, on Hamas to the south. But I think many Americans probably don't appreciate just how much Hezbollah from Lebanon has been striking into Israel. You still have 80,000 Israelis who have had to flee their homes in the north and be evacuated into friends or families' homes or hotels. Just to put that in perspective, it would be as if the entire populations of Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont had to flee to Boston or New York or Philadelphia because we're having cross-border strikes from Canada. No civilized nations can tolerate that, can allow their people to live under those conditions. Israel has every right to defend itself and to go on offense against a terrorist organization in Lebanon. And we need to give them the tools to defeat both Hamas in the south and Hezbollah in the north and defend their own people.",

Earlier this year, there was a de facto partial arms embargo on Israel, not just the 2,000-pound bombs, which they do need to hit Hamas in its deep and buried tunnels, but mortar rounds and artillery shells and small-arms ammunition. Now they even have a tractor embargo in Israel.

One can only imagine that.But if you look at what's happened over the last 11 months, the only time Hamas has released hostages or hostages have been rescued is when Israel's putting maximum military pressure on Hamas. If the Biden/Harris administration had backed Israel from the beginning, not only would this war likely have already ended with fewer civilian casualties, but we would have gotten more hostages out earlier and alive. What Hamas is doing, though, is continually moving the goalposts on any kind of hostage exchange for duly convicted terrorists that Hamas wants back. And the Biden/Harris administration keeps allowing them to move the goalposts. I mean, remember, the current leader of Hamas, Yahya Sinwar, a bloodthirsty genocidal maniac, used to be in an Israeli prison. He was released in a previous swap. So while my heart breaks for any parent who has to live through this, I think the Israeli government understands that the only way these hostages might come back alive is to put maximum military pressure on Hamas, not to try to trust a terrorist organization to honor their word or to make any kind of deal.",

But now Democrats in that state are feeling optimistic, especially after CNN revealed a host of truly disturbing posts on the pornographic site Nude Africa, posts made by the Republican candidate for governor, the current lieutenant governor, Mark Robinson, who's a Republican. Joining us now for his first major interview, the Democrat running against Robinson, North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein. Attorney General Stein, so, obviously, on this online pornography message board, Robinson posted profane, racist, sexually explicit content. He called himself a black Nazi. He expressed support for slavery. He talked about peeping on women in the showers when he was a teenager. It goes on. That's just the stuff, by the way, I can say on TV. Robinson has denied the posts, saying -- quote -- \"These are not our words and this is not anything that is characteristic of me\" -- unquote. Do you believe his denial? JOSH STEIN (D), NORTH CAROLINA GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE:  I don't. I don't. If you look at what he said on the posts, it was in keeping on what he has said publicly on Facebook that are still on his Facebook page. Mark Robinson is absolutely unfit to be the governor of North Carolina. And that was true before your story broke last Thursday. The story has only served to underline and put an exclamation point on that fact. I mean, he embraced Hitler. He compliments Hitler. He says he's a Nazi. He buys little toy S.S. soldiers. I mean, he says, slavery, he wants to bring it back, things that defy comprehension. But those only are in keeping with what he has said throughout his entire public life. He says women are not called to lead and they have abortions because they cannot keep their skirts down. He says that gay people are filth and even more vile insults than that, teachers are wicked people. From a church pulpit this summer, he yelled: \"Some folks need killing.\" This man is utterly unqualified, unfit to be the governor of North Carolina, and we're going to do everything in our power to keep that from happening.",

I do broadly agree that there are probably not a lot of Trump voters who are going to say, Robinson's conduct impacts my decision to vote for Trump. I do think there are voters who are going to say, Trump's chaos, plus this completely unacceptable, vile language from the gubernatorial candidate, I'm staying home.

But Republicans need to be looking at a couple of things now in the state. One, is there going to be depressed turnout for Republicans because they're just not excited about the fact that they might pull the lever for Mark Robinson? And they need to be looking at what strategy -- Trump's going to tell you how he feels about North Carolina in the coming days. Are they going to be changing out their ads? Are they going to be going more negative on Kamala to try to drive up her negatives to keep her voters out of this? That ad was cut very quickly, but didn't include any of the new reporting from CNN, which tells me they had that in the can ready to go and jumped at the news to be able to try to tie them together. So, this isn't necessarily a strategy shift for them, as it is accelerating putting that ad out because they saw the time. So, the question is, can Donald Trump hold the Republican coalition together and bring in a few more voters, like he's been able to do in North Carolina, to keep the state to Republicans? Or is Kamala Harris going to be able to depress Republican turnout to be able to turn that state?",

So it's a huge change in the electorate. So now the question is, are a bunch of people who don't have a lot of history there, they are going to be the first time encountering this, and do they really want to sign up with a party with Mark Robinson and Donald Trump at the head of it?",
