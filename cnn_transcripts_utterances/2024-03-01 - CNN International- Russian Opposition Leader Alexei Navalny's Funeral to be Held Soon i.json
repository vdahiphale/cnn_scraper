Navalny's widow is concerned that people who show up to honor him could be arrested, like hundreds of others who have been detained at makeshift memorials in recent days.Let's bring in former CNN Moscow bureau chief Nathan Hodge. He's with me in London. And Nathan, just into CNN, I want to let our viewers know that we've had reports that Alexei Navalny's body has not yet been released, according to a family spokesperson. That spokesperson has tweeted that the body hadn't been released. This is as of 10 minutes ago. He wrote on Twitter that the relatives arrived at the morgue for 10 a.m. local time. So that would be roughly two hours ago, I think. And then the spokesperson added that there could be delays to some of today's events as a result of the fact that his body hasn't been released. Give us some context to that and why officials would be making this difficult.",

      "sentences": "Well, I mean, first of all, this is a continuation, it seems, of the saga that we've seen over just unfolding over the past two weeks following on the news of Navalny's death and the refusal initially of the authorities at the prison in Russia's far north to hand over the body to his mother.There was what, you know, one could only describe as an incredible bureaucratic song and dance with a mother and a lawyer for Navalny going up to the prison -- this is in north of the Arctic Circle -- trying to get the body of her son turned over. And this, you know, quite shocking discussion about the fact that, no, that the authorities were applying pressure, according to the opposition, to either have a secret burial, to not hand over the body. You know, so there was an incredible behind the scenes tussle about this. And Navalny's supporters really called out Russian President Putin over this, basically pointing out the fact that he's always cast himself as a defender of traditional values, as sort of a religiously observant and devout person. He makes great public show of going to church. He's got the full-throated support of the Russian Orthodox Church. He's forged an important alliance, in fact, with the church. And, you know, this is basically, in their view, they said, well, this is hypocrisy. How can one, you know, be a sort of a proponent of traditional values of defending the family? You know, this is the theme that Putin loves to bang on about, when you're basically standing in the way of allowing people to have their last farewell with Navalny.",

But we can go back to Nathan, who's still with us here.So, Nathan, we were just discussing how bizarre, really, this look is for the Russian government and government officials to be making it difficult for Navalny's family to have access to his body at this time. The fact that they've still done that, does that just mean that they don't feel, as it's not being reported widely in the Russian press, that that's an issue for them?",

      "sentences": "Well, I mean, first of all, we're in an information bind here. You know, as Alexander Baunov said earlier, there are sort of two official Russian media. There are -- you know, there's state television, then there are sort of the pro-Kremlin, you know, Telegram and social media channels.You know, obviously, they've got their own agenda that they're trying to push. You know, but there's not a complete information blockade in Russia. You know, people can -- you know there are ways. There are emigre and exiled media. You know, there is opposition media, however small and embattled and however much they've been exiled. So this narrative that's being pushed forward, basically, that, you know, that government officials are essentially standing in the way of people who want to pay their respects to someone two weeks after their death, you know, this can penetrate. It does put the authorities in a bind. How much longer can they put off handing over the body? How can they stand in the way reasonably, of a funeral? Obviously, the concern, you know, as we've sort of -- if we take a broader picture of what's unfolding here, clearly there is a concern, just given the police presence there. That what would be a funeral can morph into a political funeral, that it could, you know, turn into a larger confrontation. [04:35:00] I'm certain that, of course, the authorities are prepared to make arrests. You know, they've shown, you know, absolute willingness to crack down ruthlessly on anything that they see as unauthorized protest.",

We don't have Matthew. We're having a little bit of an issue with our feeds there. Nathan let's focus on what the future of Russia's political opposition looks like without Alexei Navalny. We've obviously been hearing a lot, justifiably and appropriately, from his widow over the last few weeks. Tell us what you expect to see next.",

      "sentences": "Well, I mean, it is a bleak picture if one expects to see political competition return to Russia. You know, the space for the opposition to exist in has become ever, ever smaller over more than, well now, 24 years of Putin being in power.And you know, independent media have, you know, gradually been shuttered. And then there was sort of a final curtain coming down in a lot of ways with the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, with more repressive laws being introduced that cracked down on the independence of the media and created ever less space for there to be any kind of ideas that compete with the official line. So in a lot of ways, what we're seeing here, I mean, one could sort of metaphorically say this is kind of a funeral for the Russian opposition inside of Russia, you know, if you're trying to tease out a bit of symbolism here. But, you know, Navalny and, you know, Navalny's supporters, his wife, have made clear that, you know, their fight is going to continue. It's going to continue inside of Russia, not just being marginalized and exiled. And that's why we've seen this sort of remarkable emergence just over the past two weeks of Yulia Navalnaya, his widow, basically assuming the mantle of the opposition and stepping in. You know, one of the things about Navalny was, you know, he was seen as a -- he was a charismatic leader and was this sort of single unifying figurehead. You know, in a country where basically, you know, political competition is just not allowed, you know, President Putin is going to be standing in what we're calling an election two weeks from now. But it's more or less a re-anointment. And, you know, they're not allowing anyone who is, let's say, opposed to the, you know, the full scale -- opposed to the invasion of Ukraine, who is not essentially, you know, a supporter of the Kremlin. I think for the for the Kremlin, really, the important thing is, is turnout, you know, basically showing that you have this plebiscite that says, you know, that Putin has the mandate, he has the people behind him. You know, and a great deal of the population does get its information from, from state media. And, you know, therefore, opposition voices just generally are not heard. Genuine opposition, opposition voices. I'm not talking about the sort of essentially loyal pro-Kremlin kind of pocket opposition parties that are in the parliament. You know, I think that, you know, this is -- this is a moment where it shows, you know, how fractured and how embattled Russia's opposition has long been. And, you know, but the fact that they are able to muster people on the streets, I mean, thousands of Russians were arrested, you know, just following the full-scale invasion, you know, risking arrest and often being arrested, you know, despite the fact that there is an enormous apparatus of state that is repressive.",

You know, and does the opposition need to have a sort of a single charismatic leader in order to be effective? You know, that's that that is, in many ways, kind of the big question here.You know, but I mean, part of the problem has been that, you know, Putin has created this system of vertical power, which doesn't allow for political competition. So, you know, it does -- it does create a system where, you know, there is, you know, it's very difficult for somebody to step forward because of the risk of, you know, arrest or imprisonment. But there's also no clear successor to Putin, it's also worth pointing out. I mean, he's going to be in office potentially until, you know, another six year term until 2030. After, you know, what's inevitably seen as his reelection in two weeks, what's widely seen as the outcome is a foregone conclusion. But has he begun the process himself of, you know, anointing a successor? That's also, you know, an important political question for the future of Russia.",

The funeral services for Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny were supposed to take place there in less than 90 minutes. A short time after that, he was expected to be buried at a nearbycemetery. But now we are getting word from Navalny's spokesperson that Navalny's body has not yet been released to his relatives. It's not clear why, and the spokesperson says that some of today's events could naturally be delayed as a consequence. Navalny was the most vocal critic of President Vladimir Putin. He died mysteriously two weeks ago in Siberia, where he was serving a 19-year sentence for various crimes. Officials say he died of natural causes. The Kremlin has denied any involvement in Navalny's sudden death. Let's bring back in former CNN Moscow bureau chief Nathan Hodge with me here in London. Nathan, before we get on to the broader picture, I think it's probably important to address today, on the day of the funeral, the circumstances around Navalny's death. I mean, even if they were of natural causes, of course this is all speculation, we don't know. What he was subjected to, the long- standing concerns about his health, do mean that there is culpability here, regardless.",
