It's high intensity ordering. We can do this physically. We can do this virtually. The challenge is around teacher shortages. We can work with college students.We can work with retirees We can work with folks in other professions who want to help out. We can do this after school. We can do this on Saturdays. I know students will be mad when I say this, but we don't need the summers off for a while now. We can use this summer to help students catch up. And again, our goal, our finish line has to be returning back to school next fall in 2023, closing this gap as much as we can. And I've seen studies that show that the bottom 10 percent of students fell behind a four times faster rate than the top 10 percent of students. We cannot have these divides getting in larger. It's too much at stake for us. I apologize, we should probably end this because I can't hear your question, but just, you know, districts and schools should work on a child by child basis with their families, come up with a plan and execute that plan to help kids catch up.",

I'm sorry we're having some communications issues, but just to give our voters a sense of the disconnect and the increase in disparity across racial and socioeconomic lines, black and Hispanic students were well behind -- they were well before the pandemic and they've dropped even further.To give you one example in Detroit, nearly 1 in 2 school children live in poverty. Only 6 percent of 4th graders they were proficient in math in 2019, this year that fell to 3 percent. That is unacceptable in the richest country in the world.

But if you write your story based on a narrative that you are going to look at the worst of those six crimes and put it on the front pages of your paper every day, people are going to start to feel what David Patterson just stated. So, I have to deal with those six crimes a day, felony crimes, and the perception of fear.",

And when you see a video like the one, we just saw, that has a very powerful effect on people.So, if you look at subway crime right now -- you know, the mayor said 3.5 million riders, that's up to 3.8 million today. Your chances of being the victim of one of those serious crimes is about 1 in 600,000. Your chances of being hit by a car is about 1 in 4,000. And so, technically it's safer on the subway than it is on the street, but what we're seeing is these particularly jarring crimes. The man pushed on the tracks or back in last January, Michelle Go, a financial services person who was shoved in front of a train and killed, or the analyst who was on the train and an individual walked up and shot him who didn't know him. So, we're seeing these crimes connected to people with mental health issues who are acting out in the system and that's getting a lot of attention.",

They're saying that Russia's allegations are transparently false allegations and saying that the world will see if Russia tries to use these act accusations, these false accusations as a pretext for escalation.There's a great deal of concern about why Russia is saying this right now. We know that they're losing on the battlefield. We know that they have been targeting Ukraine's electricity supplies recently. But this seems to be a new narrative that's sustaining traction in Russia. They're not backing down. They're saying that the NATO leaders who are hearing this from the Ukrainians are mistaken or misunderstood. And over the past four days we have had a remarkable amount of military diplomacy. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin speaking with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Shoigu, three days ago. Then just yesterday Lloyd Austin speaking with Shoigu again. Ben Wallace, the British Defense Secretary doing the same. The French defense secretary, the Turkish defense secretary all doing the same . Ad then today General Mark Milley speaking with his Russian counterpart as well, and the British military chief of staff also speaking with that same Russian counterpart. It is absolutely out with the context to of this war so far that Russia's military top brass have had so many conversations. It's impossible to know what it means. It certainly shows the determination of Ukraine's Western partners to make sure Russia understands not to escalate at the moment. But the real concern here is in Ukraine that Russia has cried wolf before, and when Russia has cried wolf as President Zelenskyy has said, when Russia says Ukraine is going to do this, President Zelenskyy says, that generally means that Russia has already prepared for such an act.",

It doesn't mean that he walks out front the door. He would go to a hospital that is supervised. That is a mental hospital. Now pleading guilty, he will go to the department of corrections, the general prison system. But in that courtroom, it was packed. Victims' families, they were just in those seats, in those pews. There were law enforcement on both sides and in the back of the courtroom. When he walked out, he was completely shackled. They actually undid one of his handcuffs so he could plea, so he could swear. Because he had to affirm what he was telling was the truth. And the judge really wanted to assess that this was a tree and voluntary plea because it is extensive. And the judge went question by question. He said yes. You could tell he was processing the thought and then answered the question. At one point, the prosecution started asking him very directed questions. I want you to listen to a little bit of that.
