For weeks, for as long as he's been campaigning for this office, I have asked him, Mr. Scalise and Mr. Hern, who were also campaigning for this office, to show me a plan - to show me a plan to keep the government open, while securing the border, while cutting spending, while at the same time, for my constituents, funding the World Trade Center health program, to fund the flood insurance program, to do other things vital for our country. And so far nobody has the notes, nor has assuaged mine and my constituents' concerns. That's why my vote wont' change today.",

And those relationships are not quite mature just yet.I have been speaking for those couple of weeks about what it would take to get me to yes. I am in discussions with Mr. Jordan and his team about it. But, no, I haven't been assuaged yet. And I'm not just going to settle for a promise. Oh, yes, hey, Nick, that sounds good, I'll work on that. I want to see people co-sponsor bills, sign letters, and maybe make social media posts making a firm commitment to keeping the government open while we make progress on the budget and border and to do things important for my constituents. I'm not just going to take somebody's word for it and be disappointed a couple of weeks or a couple months later after they take the gavel.

It was contemplated post 9/11 for the continuity of our government. If there was a vacancy in the office of speaker, all business should not stop. That's purely illogical and counter to the very title itself. Don't get confused because there's a couple of Latin terms in there called pro-tempore. It's a temporary speaker.

It is a dark turn. Even for a group seen here parading before the attacks that's come to symbolize the uncompromising face of Palestinian resistance and violence against Israel. Israeli officials say a document referencing ISIS and al Qaeda, which CNN has not been able to authenticate, was found on one Hamas gunman killed during this attack on kibbutz Be'eri. The document, given to CNN by a senior Israeli government official, praises jihad against Jews and crusaders.

He led them to an area in Aruba and said, there's her body right there, later emailing them saying, ha, ha, once again, it's a lie. Boom, extortion charges. We have been working with the Peruvian government for a long time under the extradition treaty, because he's serving a prison sentence in Peru, to have him temporarily come to the U.S., and they gave him a deal.

This is the state level case against her and 18 other defendants, including Donald Trump, including Mark Meadows, including Rudy Giuliani. And in that case she is not only pleading guilty to some charges there, she's in court currently at this very moment entering that plea before a judge. She also is agreeing, as part of this deal, to testify at future trials. So, Sidney Powell is lined up essentially to go to trial at the end of this week, along one other defendant in that case, another lawyer, Ken Chesebro. She's not going to be going to trial now. So, she's taking this plea deal. She will not have that trial. She will also be in a situation where prosecutors will be recommending her to avoid jail time as part of this deal. But it's significant that not only is she avoiding the trial, not only is she putting in this guilty plea, that she is very likely to become a witness against Donald Trump and the others as they go to trial in Georgia. And there's a lot here at stake, not only in Georgia, but also in the federal court in D.C., where another criminal case against the former president exists, and where Sidney Powell has been identified as a top co-conspirator there. And so what this means for Donald Trump going forward is, it's not good for him to have people pleading and agreeing to cooperate with prosecutors, whether it's at the federal level or state level. So, having Sidney Powell agreeing to testify is quite a significant step forward for the prosecutors in Georgia, as well as potentially any other prosecutors who are bringing and trying to prosecute cases against Donald Trump at trial.",
