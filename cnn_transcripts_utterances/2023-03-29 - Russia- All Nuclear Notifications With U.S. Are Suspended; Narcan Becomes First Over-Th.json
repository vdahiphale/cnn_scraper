      "sentences": "Well, Bianna, the Pentagon has not issued an official statement about this comment from Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister announcing essentially that Russia is going to halt its participation, its notification to the U.S. under its New START Treaty obligations.Of course, that treaty was really the only remaining treaty between two nuclear superpowers regarding nuclear force posture and the level of nuclear warheads and missiles that each country actually has. This was really a check on each country's kind of nuclear force posture there. But the U.S. wall, you know, anticipating this, they're still saying that they're condemning it. They anticipated it because just last month, Russia pulled out of this treaty, they said that they were going to suspend their participation in it. And so the U.S. had been anticipating perhaps that the Russians would also suspend the notification part of this treaty as well. But, you know, it is not coming as a major surprise to the U.S. And in fact, it was a senior Pentagon official, during a hearing just yesterday, who disclosed that during a regular kind of communication with the Russians about their treaty obligations, kind of trying to get them to disclose how many nuclear warheads they have, as part of this treaty, which happens roughly twice a year. The Russians then responded that they were actually not going to provide that information anymore. And this was disclosed yesterday by that Pentagon official who later said, well, if the Russians are not going to provide this information to us, then we are not going to give it to the Russians, either. Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And just last month, Russia carried out an intercontinental ballistic missile test that they did notify the U.S. of as part of that New START Treaty. Unclear now, whether those kinds of notifications are going to continue either.",

But obviously, a lot has changed since then.And what's also notable is Putin's decision to suspend the participation and not withdrawal completely. And that's leading many to believe that he's using this as leverage and perhaps blackmail in an attempt to lift sanctions that have been imposed on Russia since the start of the war. How dangerous of a precedent would that set, if in fact, and I don't believe the U.S. would do so, but if in fact, the sanctions were lifted because of these types of threats?",

I mean, if he thinks this is going to provide leverage in easing the United States support for Ukraine's defense, or the sanctions on Russia, because of its war of aggression, that's clearly not going to happen.There are many inside the Russian defense establishment who disagree with this decision. It's unclear what his game plan is. But I think it is very interesting that Russia has -- Putin has said that they're not going to exceed the limits set by this treaty, at least for now, that suggests to me and many others that Russia does want to maintain limits on these most deadly Arsenal's. We don't want a nuclear arms race. The Russians don't want a nuclear arms race. But if these limits are lifted, or the treaty expires without a replacement, we will, for the first time, in 50 years, not have any constraints on the U.S. and the Russian arsenals, the world's two largest, and that could open the door for an increase of the arsenals and arms race that could not just involve U.S. and Russia, but possibly China, which is also starting to build up its currently smaller, but it could be much bigger arsenal in the years ahead.",

It's China and our own European allies.The Chinese actually have come out and said that they would like the United States, they urge the United States and Russia to work together, to implement New START and to continue efforts to constrain their arsenals. It's not in China's interest for Russia and the United States to increase their stockpiles. Remember, China has about 400 nuclear weapons today, the United States and Russia each have about 4,000. So China does not want to see that scenario. Our allies in Europe also do not want to see Russia building up its arsenal for whatever reason. They already have enough security concerns with the war in Ukraine, with Russia's aggressive behavior. So it's very much in the interest of the United States, our allies to continue to press Putin to reengage with the diplomatic table, or at the very least, to continue to pledge to constrain the Russian arsenal, keep below these limits until such time as we can negotiate with a partner, Russia, that's not possible right now.",

      "sentences": "I think it's a big step. It's something that I and other advocates have been calling for, for many years, mainly because it helps to normalize naloxone use. Naloxone, as Bianna mentioned, is something that is a complete antidote to opioids.If somebody is overdosing from, let's say, fentanyl, which is a very potent opioid, they could be dead within minutes, because they'll stop breathing, they'll be unresponsive. But if naloxone is given, it'll save their life, they could be walking and talking within just a couple of minutes. And so this really needs to be made widely available. Removing the prescription requirements is one major barrier. That's -- that has stood in the way, but another is still in the way, which is that of cost. We still don't know how this over-the-counter prescription -- or how this over-the-counter as opposed to prescription is going to be prized? And if it's too expensive, and people cannot pay for it that it's not going to do much good either.",

Given that there are reports that that if in fact it is too costly, that it can be prohibitive for the people specifically who need it the most.Now, some optimistic news is, I believe, some insurance carriers will be covering Narcan. But how important is it to get this at a price that's affordable for those that need it the most?",

      "sentences": "Well, right now, the nasal Narcan version can be very expensive, it can cost as much as $75 per dose. And usually it's given at a two dose pack. So $150. Most people are not going to be paying that amount to buy a just-in-case treatment that they might use to save somebody else's life.Right now, insurance companies already cover Narcan if it's purchased through the standing order prescription. The problem though is when a medication is made over the counter, and a lot of insurance companies may not cover the over-the-counter version. So we're awaiting word from the company about how they're going to price it, and that we really need private insurance companies as well as Medicaid and Medicare to cover this as much as possible.",

You think the United States should follow the lead of the United Kingdom and Canada and allow boosters for people who are at high risk of severe infection because of their age or their immune systems. WENWe know that immunity does wane, especially against symptomatic infection. It also begins to wane for severe illness. Now for somebody who is generally healthy and young, who has had COVID, not a big deal, and they can probably wait to get their booster after a year. They could wait a year between getting boosters or even longer. But somebody who's older with chronic medical conditions, I think it's reasonable to say these bivalent boosters are going to waste anyway. Why don't we let them -- let people who want to get that booster to get it six months after their initial shot? I think that's something that the FDA and CDC should really take up quite urgently. And again, I really don't see any downside to letting people who want to get that booster to access it sooner.",

And so I'm certain that when he went to go to his physician in the hospital, they would have monitor his status. So they would have looked at his cardio respiratory status, what are his vital signs, what is his oxygen saturation at room air? Does he need oxygen? And then they would have done X-rays and perhaps CT scans or other tests to find out what exactly is this condition? Does he have a bacterial pneumonia? Does he have a virus?And in this case, we don't know. We would wait for the Vatican to tell us more. But I think it's really important to mention that people who are older, and the Pope is 86 years old, that they are at high risk for complications from any of these respiratory illnesses. So something that's pretty minor and mild for a younger person could send someone who's older with chronic medical conditions into the hospital. And so I know that they'll be monitoring much more closely and also trying to prevent other complications that could occur. When somebody has a respiratory infection, they could get a superimposed infection, they could get a second infection, or there could be complications based on their existing medical illnesses. So all of those things are what we have to monitor in the days to come.",
