SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENTThere was that moment, you guys will remember, last week with Yahya Sinwar's assassination, where the White House seemed to hope that that could be the impetus that would allow Prime Minister Netanyahu to come back to the negotiating table. That simply has not transpired. Right now, you have a Hamas with no clear leader, of course, after the death of Yahya Sinwar and a Prime Minister Netanyahu, who is only doubling down on what he says are his goals, which is not just to defeat but to destroy Hezbollah and Hamas. So very, very little hope of any major breakthrough. He also has a couple of other items on his agenda. Lebanon, of course, just as he landed, or just before he landed. You mentioned those rockets being fired at military bases in Tel Aviv, at a naval base near Haifa. How can Secretary of State Antony Blinken turn down the temperature there, diffuse that situation in Lebanon somehow, when, again, the Secretary of Defense for Israel, Yoav Gallant, was just on the border the other day saying, we're not -- we're going to continue. We want to clear parts of southern Lebanon. How do you bring down the temperature there? And then, of course, Iran. You have to remember, Israel is right now weighing its response to Iran's ballistic missile barrage. There's fears that that could trigger an oil crisis, an economic crisis, right before the November election. Can Blinken get any guarantees from Prime Minister Netanyahu? What do those guarantees look like? And you have to remember that just a few days ago, or about a week ago, I think it is now, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin wrote a letter to Israeli politicians saying, you need to allow more aid into Gaza, or you could potentially face restrictions from the U.S., including when it comes to arms sales. Will he see through on that promise? He'd given a 30-day time limit on that. Will he see through on that promise? A lot at play here. His 11th visit, not just to Israel. He will also be visiting Jordan and Doha. But very little optimism. And those signs of hope, if any at all, are absolutely fleeting.

But it's people like far right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir who are keeping Netanyahu in power. As I ask him what will become of Gaza's Palestinians, his response is stark.
