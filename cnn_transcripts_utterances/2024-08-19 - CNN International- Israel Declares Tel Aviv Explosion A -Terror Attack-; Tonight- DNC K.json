We are just hours away from the Democratic National Convention kicking off in Chicago where President Joe Biden will speak, passing the torch to his vice president, and now Democratic presidential nominee, Kamala Harris. Outside the hall, pro-Palestinian protesters have been gathering, calling not just for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza, but also an arms embargo to Israel. The U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in Israel amid what he described as a decisive moment that is the best, perhaps the last opportunity to get a ceasefire and hostage deal, he says. Earlier today, Blinken held an hours-long meeting with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and with defense minister, Yoav Gallant. He said the next step in the talks is for Hamas to say yes after he announced that Israel had accepted the bridging proposal presented by the U.S., Egypt and Qatar just last week.

And as I said, Hamas is now claiming responsibility. CNN international diplomatic editor Nic Robertson joins me now here in Tel Aviv. So, Nic, we have a bridging proposal. The U.S. secretary of state says that Israel has accepted the bridging proposal, and now it's up to Hamas to do the same.

Now, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, just a little while ago, re-emphasize the urgency of getting a deal and he specifically said that there could be, quote/unquote, intervening in events that could take place, that could completely derail the talks.

Now he's accepted American ideas in the past and then loaded the Christmas tree up with any number of ornaments that are deal breakers. But now I think the administration has focused on Hamas response. I think the best outcome, frankly, the most realistic outcome right now would be Hamas comes back, not with an abject total rejection but essentially accept some elements, and we're back at the negotiating table. I think the idea that Hamas is simply going to buy on to a proposal which they know has been to some degree precooked between the U.S. and Israel at least elements of it has it's probably slim to none.

And I'm not sure the United States could apply it in, in a symmetrical way.I mean, the administration has been reluctant to impose a single cost or consequence on Israel that normal humans would regard a significant or serious pressure, conditioning military assistance know introducing your own security council resolution critical of the Israelis are signing up for somebody else's know, recognizing unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state know for any number of reasons. And we could spend the next hour discussing why they haven't done that. I think the pressure on Hamas comes from funders, Qataris, and Egyptians who by reason of their geography, it's a pretty important player in Hamas's calculations. But whether or not, Jim, they can effect the calculations of one Yahya Sinwar ensconced below ground somewhere in Rafah, in Khan Younis, probably surrounded by hostages, who believes he actually may be winning. I'm not sure that's going to be possible. So again, I think there's a chance negotiations will continue. Hard to imagine an agreement and even if we could get one, it's probably going to be one that won't go beyond phase one, limited exchange of hostages for a six-week ceasefire. You could get that.

And, of course, President Biden will be the first out of the gate tonight.He has spent the weekend drafting his speech up at Camp David, and it gives you a sense of just how seriously he is taking this address. And I do think he feels the weight of this moment. You know, he first came to a Democratic national convention back in 1972. He was back then a candidate to be the youngest person in the Senate. Now he is the oldest sitting president in history at the very end of that long political arc. You know, there's no question this is not the speech he wanted to give. It's not the speech that he was hoping to give. And when you talk to people around him, certainly, they say he is still processing that prolonged effort to remove him from the top of the Democratic ticket, but he does want to look ahead when we hear from him tonight, he will really try and frame the Vice President Kamala Harris as the best possible person to carry on what he started while he was in office in the best possible inheritor of his legacy. He will also, of course, frame the stakes of this election and try and remind Americans of the threat that he views president Trump posing to democracy and to that end, we will hear from, for example, members of Congress who sat on the January 6 investigative committee will hear from a police officer who was injured in the Capitol riot, all sort of making the point that Donald Trump poses a grave threat to democracy. Kamala Harris herself will also be in the arena this evening to listen to President Biden's speech. After that, the Biden's are heading off on vacation in California and essentially giving the keys of this convention over to Kamala Harris. And organizers, I think have a couple of objectives when you look at the roster of speakers that they have laid out. One is to kind of introduce the vice president to an American public that may just be tuning in and may not have been paying attention. And they will have a lot of help on that. You know, two former presidents, President Obama, President Clinton, two former first ladies, including Hillary Clinton, who will be speaking this evening. The other objective I think they have is trying to remind people of what Donald Trump is planning to do if you were to come in an office and you'll hear from that from lawmakers, from cabinet secretaries, from this roster of high-wattage Democrats and it will all culminate in Kamala Harris's speech on Thursday evening. And as you mentioned, polls do show her entering this convention on a swell of momentum. She has taken a slight lead in national polls.

She's the vice president, but the vice presidency is a little like entering the witness protection program. People and, you know, strategists in both parties say voters have very little idea about who she is or what she's been doing. And the initial reaction is clearly been positive. She has a stronger favorable rating than either Donald Trump or Joe Biden. But a lot of that is skin-deep.

And really what I think is going to be the fulcrum of this race. Can she convince enough, you know, white working class and older white voters in those Rust Belt states that we always need to get back to? Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, that she's strong enough to keep them safe, and showing that she can take on big companies on behalf of average Americans as part of the way she can do that. I think that kind of very uneven reaction to that is going to reinforce their instinct that they're not going to be putting out a lot of policy white papers. Now, I wrote last week, we have a very good idea of what the Harris presidency would be about because over 90 percent of what she might plausibly do as president is already clear in the agenda, of the Democratic Party. I mean, there is an agenda out there on things like health care and childcare and gun control and voting rights and abortion rights. Almost all of which passed the House in '21 and '22 before being blocked by Manchin and Sinema. We have a pretty good idea of what she's going to do.

They're trying to find new ways to define Donald Trump.I think the coward thing is going to be a thing that we hear a few more times throughout the next few weeks but throughout this presidential campaign, I think it's clear that the Harris campaign is going to try to define Donald Trump by his record and his history in a way that's different than how Joe Biden was trying to define him because they saw that that necessarily -- not necessarily stick with voters that wasn't, you know, when I'm out on the ground and talking to the swing state voters who are not sure who they're going to vote for.

I mean, major fall from grace, right, Jim,You know what, I'm keeping my eye on the door behind me because I do think the hearing might be wrapping up, but yet we haven't heard from our colleague, Mark Morales, who is inside the actual hearing. But, listen, this is what we are expected to happen in the last half hour since court started. We expect Santos to plead guilty to at least some of those charges that he faced from U.S. attorneys last year, 23 in total. But look, Jim, he has been adamant that he would never ever take a plea deal in this case. He said that moment multiple times, even last week when he appeared in court for a pretrial hearing, that trial expected to start in just a couple of weeks where U.S. attorney said, listen, we've got dozens of witnesses. We're going to come out in, speak out, and take the stand against you. He still maintained his innocence. So something has changed. Now, what he pled guilty to, that's a big question. What you just asked, Jim, what sort of sentencing could he face? That's also another one of the questions that we are waiting to hear what we do understand is he is going to plead guilty to some and will likely get a full explanation of what he's pleading guilty to, right, in an allocution. So, we're waiting to get some information from our colleague about all that. But like you said, Jim, a major fall from grace for this, a former Republican Congress this man of the third district here in New York, who of course, was accused of lying about so many things, having to do with his personal life, his resume and also just lying on campaign fine. Finance reports, taking money from donors and sealing their identities allegedly, and using the money to really just by a lavish lifestyle for himself. Again, we're waiting to see he actually has pled guilty to, though, and we're also waiting to see if he talks. He has never been shy from the camera even after he was expelled from Congress for all these alleged crimes. He's always said something, so we're waiting to see if he talks and we do possibly expect to hear from the U.S. attorneys office as well, Jim.",

And called out former president Donald Trump by name, something he has often not done. This is, of course, not the speech President Biden hoped to deliver just a month ago. But now, since he has withdrawn from the presidential race, he's going to pass the torch to his vice president. Joining me now to help preview this moment for Joe Biden is Evan Osnos, CNN contributor. He is author of \"Joe Biden: The Life, The Run, And What Matters Now\".

And he said no, I think by the time he got there, having been through January, having COVID still defining the country in so many ways, he really felt like this was an a here project. And, of course, it hasn't been. And what you've seen over the course of the last month is him coming to terms with that bit by bit. And it's not easy.
