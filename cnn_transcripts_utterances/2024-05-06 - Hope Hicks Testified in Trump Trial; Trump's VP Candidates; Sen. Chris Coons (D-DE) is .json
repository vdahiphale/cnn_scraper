On Friday, with Trumps 2016 campaign press secretary and White House communications director Hope Hicks took the stand and through her testimony prosecutors showed jurors the transcript of the infamous \"Access Hollywood\" tape that almost up ended - you would have thought it would have upended Trump's run for the White House. It did not, of course. Before cross- examination, Hicks began crying and appeared to become overwhelmed. She finished her testimony after a brief break.After court on Friday, Trump tried to clear up a lie he had told the day before that his gag order prohibited him from testifying in the trial.

Matt Gorman, let me start with you because Hope Hicks, of course, this sort of fascinating figure, what did she make of how - her crying on Friday seemed to really be related to something she had said under prosecution questioning. She started to cry under cross, but that it seemed at least related to her mind of giving up Trump a little bit to what - what they wanted. I mean she's really - it's kind of hard to overstate how striking a figure she cut during this period of time with the campaign, and how close she was to Trump. MATT GORMAN, FORMER SENIOR ADVISER TO TIM SCOTT'S PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN: She's a unique figure in Trump world (ph) in many ways. She predated him coming on the campaigns. She worked for Ivanka Trump previously. And she's someone who has not sold out. She didn't write a book. She's not - has - doesn't have a cable contract. She, after the White House, after all that stuff happened, she just kind of went back and is kind of working in the private sector now. And, you know, she has a lot of kind of inside knowledge, especially those early days on the campaign. So, no matter what she was going to say, it was going to be a very compelling testimony and very unique than someone say like a Michael Cohen. Now that the testimony is very compelling.",

But what I am more optimistic about and also more concerned about frankly, Kasie, is whether or not this hostage deal will come to fruition. It's been more than 200 days that families from countries around the world have prayed and hoped for their loved ones to be released by Hamas. I've met with Rachel and Jon Goldberg-Polin repeatedly. Their son, Hersh was just revealed by Hamas to still be alive beneath Gaza. And as you've said in your opening, Bill Burns, our CIA director, continues to be in the region, trying to close this deal between Hamas and Israel, a deal that was complicated by Hamas directly attacking the Kerem Shalom gate through which humanitarian aid has been flowing into Gaza.",

They don't want to release the hostages. They don't want frankly, make progress towards peace.So you've got combatants on both sides who have some elements who don't want to see this deal. The United States has applied significant pressure on Qatar to expel the Hamas leadership if they don't come forward and we've applied significant pressure to the Netanyahu government to be respectful, responsive, and to come forward. And there's been tens of thousands of Israelis protesting in the streets for a hostage release deal. So what would be most positive about this is that there'll be a more than 40-day ceasefire.
