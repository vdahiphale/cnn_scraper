      "sentences": "Good morning, everyone. I'm Amara Walker at CNN headquarters in Atlanta. THE CHRIS WALLACE SHOW starts in just a few minutes, but we want to begin with some breaking news. Just moments ago, Russian President Vladimir Putin addressed the country, calling Friday's concert hall attack a barbaric terrorist attack and expressing his condolences. Fires are still burning at the complex outside Moscow. And a warning, the video we're about to show you is quite disturbing. Witnesses captured the attack as gunmen fired shots, and then set the venue on fire. The death toll is now at 133, and authorities say it's likely to keep rising.Now, Russian authorities say all four of the people directly involved in the attack are now under arrest, along with other suspects. ISIS took responsibility for the attack, which is the deadliest terror incident in Moscow -- in the Moscow region in decades. This comes just days after the U.S. embassy warned it's citizens to stay away from large gatherings like concerts, saying he was monitoring reports that extremists were planning attacks. CNN's Fred Pleitgen is falling the story now from Berlin. Hi there, Fred. Tell us more of what you learned. And of course, the headline here is that we're finally hearing from Putin.",

      "sentences": "Yes, we heard from Putin earlier this morning. He came out with essentially an address to the Russian people where, as you mentioned, he called all this a barbaric attack. He offered his condolences. I think one of the most important things, though, are Vladimir Putin did say is he said, look, the authorities there were working obviously overtime all night to try and apprehended the suspects, as the Russians put it. And he said that they were apprehended. And he also made a link, which now many Russian officials are also making as well, and people in Russian state media, to Ukraine. I want to listen to some of what Vladimir Putin had to say.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): All four direct perpetrators of the terrorist attack, all those who shot and killed People, were found detained. They tried to hide and move towards Ukraine, where according to preliminary data, a window was prepared for them on the Ukrainian side to cross the state border. A total of 11 people were detained.

      "sentences": "So we have to digest that a little bit and sort of see what Vladimir Putin is saying there, because they are some pretty strong allegations that he was making. He was claiming that the perpetrators and their accomplices, which is 11 people in total, four gunmen and seven people that the Russians said that they also apprehended who allegedly were helping them, were trying to make their way to the Ukrainian border.Now, of course, Amara, what we know is that there is a war going on on that border. There's a lot of fighting going on. There's obviously minefields and the like. That is not an open border. And he's then saying that he believes or the Russians believe that a window was prepared for them, which could mean some sort of opening on the Ukrainian side and from the Ukrainian side. So it's certainly seems as though the allegation there is, is that they had help from the Ukrainian side. And the Russian authorities came out earlier and said that the people behind this had relevant contacts, as they put it, towards the Ukrainian side, which obviously could mean official Ukrainian contact, for instance, from Ukrainian intelligence services. What we've heard today, and I think it's very important to point out, is that Ukrainians continue to say that they had absolutely nothing to do with all of this. In fact, a spokesman for Ukraine's military intelligence service came out and said that it's absolutely not true. They are, in turn, blaming Russia special services for allegedly having this to be a false flag operation. But again, the Ukrainians completely denying that they had anything to do with this attack.",

Frederik Pleitgen, appreciate you live for us there in Berlin.We're also following new developments in the U.K. Catherine, Princess of Wales, says she is now in the early stages of treatment following a cancer diagnosis. In a video message to the public Friday, Kate revealed that doctors found the cancer when she underwent abdominal surgery in January, but she did not say what type of cancer she had or its severity. Kate has been out of the public eye since Christmas. Despite the palace initially announcing she wouldn't return to her royal duties until after Easter, of course conspiracies about her condition were going wild, especially on social media. And attempts to quiet those rumors only added to the frenzy. CNN's Max Foster is joining us now from Buckingham Palace. Obviously now, those rumors have quieted quite a bit. What are people saying? I mean, what's the atmosphere like there in the U.K.?",

So I think that was part of the shock yesterday when we had that news about her diagnosis combined with a really powerful video, a situation that Kate is never comfortable with in front of the cameras, particularly talking about something personal. And I think there's been a massive rollback, frankly, here, a realization of actually what was happening, why the family wasn't speaking, and a huge amount of sympathy, because a lot of that video was really focused on the children.So I think by the time this was filmed, she had come to terms with it as much as you can herself, and so has William and what it means for their marriage. But now the focus is very much on the children and supporting them and giving them as much normality as possible. So I think all the conversation now is about respecting that call for privacy, allowing them to rebuild as a family as they go into the school holidays. And I think, frankly, a bit of guilt about not just the conspiracy theories and buying into them, but also the memes that people were laughing at when we now know how deeply serious this was. No one saw cancer coming. Of course, it was different for the king with his age, but no one saw such a vibrant young person even vaguely likely to get cancer. There's no indication of it at all.",

They're worried. We wanted to get them answers, and we weren't getting responses to that. Always at the back of my mind was that there must be a big reason for that, to put up with this massive backlash whilst not responding to it. And now we know why, because the couple didn't want that story about cancer in the news whilst their kids were at school. They wanted to wait until term broke up, which was yesterday. Once they were back home after school, the issue, video was released, and the kids were completely aware about what was coming, but they were in a position to protect them from all of the media speculation out there and the rumor and the gossip.",

Then out of control, the new nickel and diming we're all seeing, and it might never go away. And saddle up. Beyonce's new country album could lead to a costly face-off. The panel is here and ready to go. So sit back and relax. Let's talk. Up first, Donald Trump has until Monday to pay his bond. He owes nearly half-a-billion in penalties in the New York fraud case, and if he doesn't pay up, the state of New York could seize some of his most prized assets. And while Trump may soon get $3 billion in a merger deal involving his Truth Social platform. The money won't come in time to solve his current cash crunch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
