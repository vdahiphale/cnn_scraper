Here's CNN's Camila Bernal. CAMILA BERNAL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENTThey responded to his home at 4:10 p.m. local time on Saturday. The Los Angeles Fire Department also telling CNN that the 911 call came in at 4:07 p.m. and this was for a water rescue emergency. Now, \"The Los Angeles Times\" is reporting that he died in an apparent drowning accident at his home here in L.A. and they cited a law enforcement source and said no foul play is suspected. Now, we are, of course, waiting for more details on exactly what happened. We know Perry developed a love for acting in his teenage years. He started with smaller roles and eventually landed higher profile roles, but it was being cast as the funny and very sarcastic Chandler on \"Friends\" that truly made him famous. Off screen the actors became as close as the characters on the show and they famously negotiated together to become some of the highest paid actors on a television series at the time. And despite the joy he brought to audiences, he also shared his struggles with addiction. He eventually was able to share many of those details with his fans and said that he wanted to share this in his book because he wanted to help people. Amara, Victor.",

It's not completely shocking because, obviously, his life became precarious for many, many years because of his addictions.But, you know, what was striking to me was I saw him first when the show was just becoming a phenomenon and it was clearly impacting the young people playing those characters. And I went to California and I did a piece about the show and I spoke to the creators, Marta Kauffman and David Crane, and also to several of the cast members. Matthew was a little -- I judged him to be aloof. I think he was a little overwhelmed by what was happening to him on the show. But I could see how he was a center of that group. He was very charming and just had this charismatic character and was very funny. He was a naturally funny person. Many years later I was doing a radio show for Sirius radio and he came on as a guest. And he was playing Ted Kennedy in a TV movie. And he identified with Kennedy's own struggles with addiction. But the difference in how he presented himself, he was -- he was sad or he was carrying around like a sadness, like a burden, you know, because of what he had been through. And yet he could be very funny and charming because that's who he was. So that's what really struck me, is that he had that capacity, and it then became sort of a defining thing for him to tell people what his struggle was, which he did in his book.",

And, you know, it's just an unimaginable thing for a regular person to think. Then he survived. It was really amazing. But one interesting thing he said in the book really struck me because he said he wanted fame. He was -- he really was pressing to find that role that would get him fame. And he said he actually said a prayer once and it was something like, God, I don't care what you do to me, but please make me famous.

Because as the people try to move to the south, they are also being impacted by airstrikes. So, some of them end up staying in the north, that they don't have as many go down to areas which are presumably safer. The problem that you have is that Hamas has interspersed itself throughout the civilian community and it's very hard for people to move out of that area, almost impossible given the state of affairs right now, and that is creating a real problem for the IDF as it moves forward. They are going to have civilian casualties unless they declare certain areas that are no-go zones. They don't want to do that because they know that Hamas terrorists are going to join the civilians as they move into the safer areas. So that's the dilemma that Israel is facing.

And in some cases, one tunnel can be used for all of those things.So, this creates a real problem for the IDF and the ability to surgically strike areas where the hostages are being held and then remove those hostages to safety. That is a very, very, very difficult task. Not completely impossible, but it's getting into that realm. And that becomes a real problem for the IDF.

Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari told reporters that nothing was on the table, and that Hamas's goal is to pressure and horrify Israeli citizens and families of hostages.Now, Hamas says that. It's ready to release hostages, but that in return it wants the more than 6600 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons to be released. We're joined now by Joel Rubin. He's a former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State under the Obama administration. He also is running for Congress in Maryland. Sir, good to have you on this morning. Let me add to this conversation before I get your thoughts on this. A statement from a mother of one of the hostages, they -- a group of them met with the prime minister there, Benjamin Netanyahu yesterday. And they said of that meeting, we spoke bluntly and made it clear to the Prime Minister in no uncertain terms that a comprehensive deal based on the every one for every one principle is a deal that the families would consider and has the support of all of Israel. So, all 230 hostages, that's the latest number, for the estimated 6630 Palestinians in Israeli prisons, do you think that that has -- there's -- that's a plausible deal that could happen in this environment?",

      "sentences": "Victor, it's great to be with you and certainly what the families are calling for is something that the Prime Minister should be considering. Remember about a decade ago, he traded over 1000 Palestinians for one Israeli soldier who was captured inside of Gaza, Gilad Shalit.These families are suffering. An incalculable horror to have their loved ones stolen by Hamas, diabolically stolen by Hamas, and now being used as barter. But all that said, they're in the middle of a fight, a war that could cost them their lives. And I think for the families, this kind of pressure is beyond reasonable. And the Prime Minister, he has a couple of goals in mind that he's communicated. One is getting these hostages, and of course, then the second is debilitating and decapitating Hamas. And so, I hope he's considering it. One doesn't know how it will be executed in the middle of this offensive right now, but certainly it's within the realm of possibility based upon past trades.",

They're the central ingredient in getting any deal, but they're not going to do anything without checking with the United States, in particular, in order to ensure that that we are, the United States, on board with the deal.And we have a coordinator overseeing hostage affairs. President Biden has made it the priority for his entirety of his term to get Americans out of harm's way, so a deal would be consistent. These deals are never pain free as we know. From Viktor Bout trading him for Brittney Griner in Russia, to multiple arrangements made, but they do get loved ones home. And so, the US is going to clearly have a major seat at the table of any final agreement if there is one. BLACKWELL: On the humanitarian crisis there in Gaza, the International Committee of the Red Cross, their latest statement calling it unacceptable that civilians have no safe place to go in Gaza. This is a catastrophic failing that the world must not tolerate. A few trucks have trickled in over a week now, far fewer than are needed. Do you believe that Israel should allow fuel specifically into Gaza?",

Remember, they were chanting hang Mike Pence, and it was -- at the January 6th rally, and they're -- Trump was saying, well, he -- they actually -- you know, that was a good line.
