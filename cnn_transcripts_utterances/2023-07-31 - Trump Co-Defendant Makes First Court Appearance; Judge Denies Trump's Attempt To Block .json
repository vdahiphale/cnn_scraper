In Florida, Mar-a-Lago property manager is the newest co-defendant in the classified documents case. Carlos de Oliveira had his first court appearance today in Miami. He was indicted on four counts including conspiracy to obstruct justice and making false statements to the FBI. Prosecutors say de Oliveira told another Mar-a-Lago employee that, quote, the boss wanted security camera footage deleted after it was subpoenaed by a federal grand jury. And in Georgia, the Fulton County district attorney says the investigation into Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election is done, and quote, we're ready to go. Today, a judge rejected president Trump's attempt to disqualify the attorney and block any indictments stemming from her investigation.

So that will happen next week.He was also released on $100,000 bond. He cannot discuss the case with any of the potential government witnesses. His attorney was given a list of those witnesses. And his travel is also restricted. He told the judge that he had a U.S. passport that was expired but judge still told him that he had turn over that passport within 48 hours. He entered the courtroom with John Irving, his lawyer from D.C. Now, Carlos de Oliveira didn't speak but his attorney did make a short statement. Listen to this.

He said he knew essentially nothing about anything.So as of this moment, zero indication that he has flipped. Now things do change. Sometimes actually finding yourself on the other end of an indictment could be a wake-up call. And people can flip really at any point in the process as long as prosecutors are still interested in that person. I do think prosecutors will remain interested if Mr. De Oliveira has a change of heart primarily because he is the individual who according to the indictment had a 24-minute phone conversation with Donald Trump about the surveillance system. They don't know exactly what was said there. But if Mr. De Oliveira flipped, I guarantee you, they would want to go into depth on that topic.",

Now, the reason DOJ would send a target letter to somebody like that, first of all, is just to warn them as with any defendant, but also to give them a chance to come in and cooperate. And if you look at the DOJ indictment, there are pieces of that indictment that appear to relate solely to testimony that they got from Mr. Tavares, from employee four. For example, he gives an account of a conversation that he had with de Oliveira, where de Oliveira asked him to delete the surveillance footage. That only could make its way into the indictment if DOJ prosecutors knew that they had that piece of testimony from employee four locked in.

But I want to talk about the underlying elements of poll because they get at the heart of the problems that DeSantis is having with his central argument. He has said that he would be a more effective executive than Trump. He is someone who could come in and get his agenda accomplished. Well, Republican voters right now disagree. Sixty-seven percent said Trump would actually be the better nominee to get stuff done. DeSantis trails at 22. What about electability? That's been a big part of his argument as well. Well, Republican voters again think that Donald Trump is better suited to take on Joe Biden, 58 percent think he would be able to beat Joe Biden to 28 percent for Ron DeSantis. Now, it's early. We're still in July here. And that is something that the DeSantis campaign has stressed. They said that he is just started to speak to voters one-on-one.

Going after Trump is saying, you know, he tried to compromise our whole democracy. He tried to overthrow the election. He also isn't focusing on the other candidates that are in the race. Now, in order for DeSantis to close the gap with Donald Trump, he has to be able to shrink that field. If you're with Donald Trump now, you're most likely not going to jump ship, but there are a still of host candidates that have a few percentage points that are actually taking away from Ron DeSantis being able to close that gap. So he needs to focus on the people he's actually running against and get off of these culture wars and tell people what he's really going to do. And then Republican voters can decide if he's the one. The final thing I will say is that the one thing about politics, particularly in a primary, is you have to be charismatic. You have to be doing that retail politics and it seems like every time Ron DeSantis goes out and tries to shake hands with voters, it's not really landing with the folks in Iowa. So even if he can't break through nationally, he's still not able to break through at the state level which really requires ground game grassroots organizing, people being in all of the counties in Iowa and New Hampshire and those early states to be able to connect and understand who this candidate is, who this campaign is.

And so, it is really anybody's game at that opportunity to come out as the front-runner who can beat Donald Trump.

So, it isn't straightforward negotiation between two warring sides, but it does appear to be aimed at trying to create an environment in which African nations, who may have had sympathies with Russia in the past understand where Ukraine fails about this. It's quite clear and frankly from here if we did suddenly see a cease-fire emerging. It's been muted that that would simply computation -- Russia's invasion over the past 17 to 18 months. And so, while Ukraine's counteroffensive moves forward to retake that land, Vladimir Putin suggesting they couldn't possibly agree for a cease-fire. Important also to point out, too, that Russia doesn't normally engage in diplomacy and good faith. They're used it in the past as chance in order to try and refits, to buy time to achieve their military goals. And, of course, Ukrainians here today not only hearing of the six dead, including a ten-year-old girl in Kryvyi Rih. Also learning about shelling against more civilian targets in Kherson, that's left four dead and 20 injured.

House Republicans keep promising bombshell evidence to support the ridiculous attacks against the president. But time after time, they keep failing to produce any. The official line from the White House had been from the White House press secretary that President Biden had never been in business with his son.

The White House has also talked about Hunter Biden's legal battles, and business dealings as personal matters.

He wants all the justices to sign on. And when they left town in June, after they finish their recent session. They were at an impasse. And these comments from Samuel Alito suggest what kind of resistance the chief is facing as they try to have some sort of unanimity here. You made that great quote up on the screen about what Justice Alito said about Congress's interference. But Justice Alito also said, hey, we already follow what the rules that lower court judges follow. We're not sure if they do, because it's hard to find out exactly what they're abiding by because they have no written code. And then Justice Alito also attributed the current problems over the complaints about legitimacy over the courts not to the justices themselves, but to outside critics. Now this interview that he did with \"The Wall Street Journal\", Bianna, actually raised its own questions about conflicts of interest. One of the writers of the piece that ran in the opinion section of \"The Wall Street Journal\" is David Rivkin, who has a current case before the justices. In June, the justices accepted his petition to hear this tax case. And David Rivkin also has represented his defendant, Justice Alito, Senate Democrats who have inquired about Justice Alito's travel with the hedge fund billionaire that was not disclose. So, as Justice Alito brushed aside concerns about conflicts of interest and tried to defend the court saying that no one else will defend as if I don't speak to \"The Wall Street Journal\".
