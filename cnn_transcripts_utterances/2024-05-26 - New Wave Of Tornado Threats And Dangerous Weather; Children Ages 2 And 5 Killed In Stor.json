I'm Jessica Dean in Washington, and we have breaking news this Memorial Day weekend as powerful and dangerous storms are threatening millions of Americans.It's as many communities in Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Kentucky have spent the weekend digging out from under debris. At least 15 people have been confirmed dead as a result of these storms as rescues continue. In Valley View, Texas, at least seven people have died. Here's Texas Governor Greg Abbott.

A tornado watch, including Southwest Missouri from Springfield into the boot heel and then it includes Carbondale, Paducah, going into parts of Illinois and Kentucky. Part of this is a PDS tornado watch where that particularly dangerous situation. That's saying that we're not only expecting some tornadoes, but these tornadoes can be strong, intense, violent at EF2 strength or greater. This goes into 11:00 at night. Again, remember, as it gets dark, it's hard to, you know, see these tornadoes coming so please make sure you have your emergency alerts on loud. Right now we have a cluster of tornado warnings, including the city of St. Louis, where they had to delay the St. Louis Cardinals game. We've got a couple of tornadoes a little bit farther south in the state, just north there of West Plains where we've got these discrete cells that are rotating and they're capable of creating these tornadoes. Again, that can be very strong and intense. Again, a close up of that warning there in St. Louis, more than 600,000 people in that warning right now. Plus, we still have this line of storms that's been kicking all day through parts of Virginia from Roanoke and about to get into North Carolina. Charlotte now included in the latest severe thunderstorm watch. Here's the risk, you see that red bull's eye, that's that moderate risk, that level four and a five where we can find those intense tornadoes, golf ball-sized hail, maybe even up to baseball in some areas. And those wind gusts up to 75 miles per hour. Again, the threat not just for tornadoes, but those long-lived strong and intense ones especially there in the red and the orange areas as we go into the night. Then tomorrow the threat shifts to the East Coast. We have that level two out of five so the threat for the intense tornadoes comes down, but we can still find damaging wind gusts from D.C. to Richmond, Charlotte, even down to Atlanta and Montgomery. So here's a look at those storms continuing to blow up this evening. These are the incredibly dangerous and discrete cells that could produce those strong and violent tornadoes. They're organized into a line. When you see the storms organized into a line like that, that's the push of damaging winds. So we'll continue with that damaging wind threat overnight. It dives south as we go into tomorrow morning, places like Atlanta waking up to some thunder. And then the storms could reignite in the afternoon. It's been an incredibly active year, more than 900 reports so far this year, well above average -- Jessica.",

All the things, regardless of what the outcome is.So I just think that we would have done is really just show the kind of person he is and the kind of character he has, which is a great for President Biden because those are the exact opposite things that he provides as the president.

So, you know, it is interesting but not surprising. It's -- you know, his reaction to it being booed to me was, you know, a little glimmer inside of here's how Donald Trump views himself. That he is the only choice going into 2024. He said no, don't vote for me if you don't want to win again.

People are unmotivated to really even choose any of those three because, you know, I think competency has any question about across the three of them. And so speaking to women and trying to convince them to vote for you really that's what the candidates need to be doing because we also have this other option. It's a write-in. And many people may choose that route. They also may choose not to show up. And so I don't know that an unmotivated electorate bodes well for us as a nation but that may be what happens in November.

Police in Massachusetts releasing limited information at this point, but at least enough to help us paint a timeline about the events from yesterday, albeit a disturbing timeline.It starts at 6:00 PM yesterday when police say that a man walked into a movie theater in Braintree, Massachusetts, which is about 13 miles south of Boston. This man, without a ticket made his way into that movie theater and then police say stabbed for young females, their ages ranging from nine to 17 years old, all of their injuries, fortunately, non-life- threatening. At that point though or at this point, investigators believed that this was a non-provoked attack. The way police described it, that this man without saying anything and without any warning, he suddenly attacked and stabbed those females. Police believed that that same man then made his way south to Plymouth, Massachusetts to a McDonald's fast-food restaurant where he allegedly stabbed two people, a man and a woman in their 20s, that those two people also suffered non-life-threatening injuries and it wasn't until a short time later that police then caught up with the suspect, engaged him in a pursuit that then ended with a crash. Investigators were able to detain that man. Still though no exact word on a motive and no information on that suspect. We should mention now however, the police in Deep River, Connecticut investigating a homicide. A body that they located while responding to a call of a disturbance, they will only say that that suspect in that case was apprehended in Massachusetts, but they stopped short of directly linking it to those two unprovoked stabbing.

Thanks for having me back on your show. What we have seen tonight and for the last several nights, really just emphasizes again the barbarity of Hamas. Hamas, which of course started this war on October 7th by butchering more than a thousand Israelis; Hamas, which still has a hundred hostages including eight Americans, and which is hiding those hostages and its own senior military commanders within civilian infrastructure. It is creating a terrible set of conundrums for the Israeli Defense Forces, which are trying to operate to the highest standards, but still take on their military imperative of defeating Hamas that we can have a permanent ceasefire in Gaza.
