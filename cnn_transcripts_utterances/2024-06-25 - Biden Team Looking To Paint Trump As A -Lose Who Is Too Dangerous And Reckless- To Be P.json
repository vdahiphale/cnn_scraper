That and what the former president acknowledges he did too much of the last time they debated.Also tonight, polls closing shortly in New York, Congressman Jamaal Bowman's attempt to keep his seat in a contest hitting the Democratic Party's left and center over Israel and Gaza. And from Gaza tonight, CNN's Jeremy Diamond with an up-close look at the pier, which American forces built to bring in humanitarian supplies, but has been plagued with troubles. Good evening. Thanks for joining us. It is crunch time times two ahead of Thursday's CNN presidential debate. We begin tonight with new reporting for the second night running of a tougher attack the Biden campaign appears to be preparing their candidate to follow when the two men meet. Also, new word on how differently they're practicing or not for the big night. And a hint from the former president that he wants to dial back one aspect, at least, of his demeanor from 2020. Reporting on that and more tonight from CNN's MJ Lee at the White House, Kristen Holmes at the Trump campaign and CNN Political Director David Chalian at the debate site in Atlanta. MJ Lee starts us off. So what have you learned about this contrast the Biden team is hoping to make against the former president?",

And as one campaign official put it to me, they said that when it comes to foreign policy, the contrast that the President is going to try to draw on Thursday night really could not be more stark. They said, \"President Biden stands up to dictators and defends freedom - Trump is a loser who is too dangerous and reckless to ever be anywhere close to the Oval Office again.\" One famous line from Donald Trump that a source had said is likely to come up Thursday night is his recent claim that he would be a dictator on day one. But I do think it's worth noting a challenge for the Biden team potentially as they're preparing for these foreign policy issues is that some of Donald Trump's positions on foreign policy issues are really murky and ambiguous. You know, on Gaza, he actually hasn't said much publicly on Ukraine. He has said that he would have resolved the conflict in one day, but he's never elaborated on how exactly he would have done that. And certainly the other side of that coin is the President is going to try to make an affirmative case for his leadership on the world stage as well.",

And what they chose was the right podium position. That means that he is going to be on the right side of the state - of the TV screen for the audience that is watching. President Trump is going to be on the left side.

A lot of that because his team is trying to fit what Donald Trump does, who doesn't really like to sit down and focus. Instead, it has been shorter conversations, policy sessions and, as Donald Trump often does, calls with allies, advisors seeking their advice.Now, when it comes to what exactly they want him to focus on, they want him to focus on three things in particular, the economy, especially inflation. They want him to focus on immigration as well as crime. These are things that they have seen the data on. They believe that voters think that Donald Trump is better on these issues than President Joe Biden. They also are trying to talk to him about how to pivot away from questions on democracy or abortion. Yes, they are coming up with answers, but how to get back to those three topics that they believe are key that will help president - former President Trump, quote, unquote, \"win that debate on Thursday.\" Now, Donald Trump himself actually got rather candid in an interview with The Washington Examiner talking about his debate prep. Two things of note here, one is what he said about how it's difficult. He said it's very hard to prepare for the debate. You've got to know this stuff from years of doing it. And I know all the leaders, and I know what I know. I think debating is an attitude more than anything else.\" But not just attitude, Donald Trump clearly also reflecting on his previous attitude, particularly in those 2020 debates with Joe Biden. He specifically mentioned how he interrupted Joe Biden too many times during that debate, clearly going back through those debates and trying to hone his strategy heading into Thursday. Again, his team believes he can do well if he stays on message, particularly focused on those three issues, Anderson.",

But they have said that it doesn't benefit Donald Trump, that having an audience doesn't work for him, having muted mics. But it has really been a shift behind closed doors and in private conversations I've had with these allies and advisors.One, they originally said that they thought the lack of audience would hurt Donald Trump, that they thought he couldn't be energized without it, that he really builds and feeds off of that audience. Now there has been a shift in this mentality that that might actually be good, that we've seen Donald Trump go on these kind of rants when he's in a big rally with a lot of his supporters where he's off topic and completely unfocused. Perhaps, and this is the hope again of his allies and advisors, that without an audience he can actually stay on message. The other part of this is those muted mics. You heard Donald Trump himself saying that he interrupted Joe Biden too many times in that first debate in 2020. This really takes that element out of it. He's not going to have the capability to continue to go after Biden while Biden is speaking. And some of his closest advisors actually believe that that could help him. But obviously, Anderson, we are in kind of uncharted territory here, particularly because it is former President Donald Trump and who knows how these elements are going to play out until Thursday when they're on that stage.",

DAVID CHALIAN, CNN POLITICAL DIRECTOR: Well, Anderson, one of the biggest changes I think the viewer at home will see is no audience will be a part of this debate. It will be the two candidates and the two moderators in the room there. Kristen you heard mentioned that the microphones will be turned on for the designated speaker at the time they are designated to speak in the debate. His opponent's microphone will be turned off at that time. Timing lights are visible to the candidates throughout the debate, so they'll know when their time is running out.

Just moments ago, he reacted to Judge Juan Merchan's lifting portions of the gag order, restricting what he can say about former trial witnesses. He'll remain barred from talking about prosecutors and the court staff here in New York, at least until his sentencing on July 11th.Speaking on Newsmax, he said, quote, \"I think partial is very unfair and now they lift just a piece of the gag order, not all of it. The gag order has to be lifted in its entirety.\" Also today, Judge Aileen Cannon concluded three days of oral arguments in the classified documents case, and she didn't make any rulings from the bench. She appeared skeptical, though, of arguments by the Trump defense team that the 2022 Mar-a-Lago search warrant was overly broad. The former president's attorneys sought to suppress boxes of evidence seized by the FBI because they said that investigators should have been more specific about where in the 50 plus room property they intended to search. Judge Cannon stood by the original warrant saying, quote, \"I have a hard time seeing what more needed to be included.\" Joining me now, former Trump attorney and CNN Legal Commentator Tim Parlatore, former Federal Judge Nancy Gertner, and former Federal Prosecutor and Bestselling Author, Jeffrey Toobin. Tim, you once represented the former president in the Mar-a-Lago case. You looked through the boxes with those classified documents. Do you think the search warrant violated the former president's rights? And I'm wondering what you make of the special counsel's accusation that the former president kept boxes in a -- what he called a haphazard manner?",

So he uses the first one where it went to his house. So the fact that the boxes are kept like that, honestly, that's more of an indictment of the White House document handling procedures than the Trump administration itself, because every single administration has had classified documents mixed in with unclassified documents with personal effects, things like that. So, you know, that one's not really, you know, something that's going to move the ball. However, on the flip side of it, this warrant is not something that I ever thought was overbroad in the where to search because, you know, warrants are supposed to say, you know, what to look for, where to look for it. You're supposed to have some probable cause as to that, but somewhere in the building for pieces of paper, that makes sense to me. The part of the warrant that I always thought was a little bit overbroad was allowing them to seize other documents, things that were, you know, presidential records that were not, you know, criminal in and of themselves. But since none of those documents are charged, it's not really something you could suppress anyway, so it's kind of irrelevant to the hearing.

So yesterday's hearing about the, you know, the motion to dismiss on the grounds that, you know, that the special counsel was wrongly appointed, the precedent was overwhelming. And what a typically inexperienced judge would do and say would follow that. But one of the first things that you learn in baby judge school, and yes, that's what it's called, is case management, and that is set a trial date, and she has not set a trial date. And what is hanging fire out there, what has not been resolved, for example, there's a motion to dismiss on the grounds of presidential immunity. Well, these acts took place after he was president. So, there are issues out there which he has not resolved which should have been easily resolved. And yesterday's hearing felt like an audition for Judge Cannon to seek higher office, inviting essentially the right legal scholars to challenge the special counsel when those challenges have failed over and over again for years and years and years.

You got to remember. So, I was there at that hearing. It was behind closed doors. And the way it worked, you know, the government filed the motion. We weren't allowed to read it, but we had to respond to it. We went into the courthouse. Jim Trusty gave an argument when it turned over to the special counsel and make their argument. They said two things, one of which is a lie. And then they said, before we continue, we'd like the defense to leave the room. So we had to go sit in the hallway for 45 minutes to an hour, come back and then the judge looked at Jim Trusty and said, Mr. Trusty, would you like to respond? So, I think that it is something that's certainly ripe to go through again.
