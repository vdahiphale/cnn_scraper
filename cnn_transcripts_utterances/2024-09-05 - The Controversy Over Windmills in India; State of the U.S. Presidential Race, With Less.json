But the benefits of the windmills are not being felt by many living near them. They say the windmills are mostly benefiting the bigger cities, while they continue to see power cuts. SUMER SINGH BHATI, LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVIST (through translator): Even a small child in our home suffers in the heat without a fan because we only have electricity for two hours. The power is unreliable, and none of the windmills are supplying electricity to the western region of Rajasthan. We are desperate for light.",

Put your hands up if you said Puget Sound. Located in the Pacific Northwest, it was explored and named by British navigator George Vancouver in 1792. Next up, let`s take a field trip. Tacoma, Washington, here we come. We could snowshoe, hike an island, blow glass, and shuck oysters all in the same day. Because it`s so far north, it has some of the longest days in the continental U.S. Derek Van Dam shows us just how much we can pack in to those long daylight hours. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DEREK VAN DAM, CNN METEOROLOGIST AND EXTREME WEATHER FIELD REPORTER (voice- over): There`s no shortage of things to do and see in Tacoma, Washington. And because it`s so far north, there are nearly 16 hours of daylight in the summer to help you pack it all in. My day begins on Mount Rainier. On this misty morning, I hike across a fresh dusting of snow. There are 26 glaciers on Rainier and over 35 square miles of the mountain is covered in snow and ice year-round. But I can`t stay long because I need to make the two-hour journey back down to the Puget Sound. VAN DAM (on camera): There`ll be oysters in there. VAN DAM (voice-over): From snowshoeing to shucking. That`s right. Oysters. VAN DAM (On camera): Look at that, it`s the size of my head. VAN DAM (voice-over): Mollusks thrive in these waters and the Minterbrook Oyster Company harvests thousands of oysters here every day.",

So what you have is real rich growth of algae for the oysters. It`s the algae. It`s what the oysters eat that makes it so awesome. VAN DAM (voice-over): The Puget Sound also has an abundance of islands, including Vashon. After a short ferry trip, you can be transported to what feels like another world. VAN DAM (On camera): Berries are going to start popping here pretty soon. VAN DAM (voice-over): Hike along wooded trails, rocky beaches, but it`s also home to nearly 11,000 full time residents.

It was first introduced at the Athens Paralympics in 2004 and has been featured in every game since. Outfielders have to be completely blind to play, and they even wear eye shades to make it an equal playing field for all. So how exactly does it work? CNN`s Patrick Sung breaks it down.

As a result, of the 22 sports featured at the Games, nine include competitors with visual impairments. And this is one of the most exciting ones, blind soccer. All four outfield players must wear an eye shade to keep it fair. However, goalkeepers must be fully or partially sighted. And there are a few other differences from the sport`s able-bodied counterpart as well. Walls along the sidelines keep the ball in play, while guides behind each goal direct the attack. Usually, crowds of soccer matches are boisterous, but in the blind version of the beautiful game, they`re asked to keep it down. This is so that players can hear the ball, which contains tiny bells that rattle when kicked. And when players do go for the ball, to avoid collisions, they yell, voy! Or, I`m going, in Spanish, a nod to the game`s Iberian roots. Despite originating in Spain, Brazil has won gold at every edition of the Paralympics since the game was introduced into the program. But can the Selecao do it yet again? (END VIDEOTAPE)",
