We're seeing changes in the Earth's atmosphere. It's a mystical, mysterious experience.

We'll have aircraft, kites, balloons, sounding rockets all flying up into the atmosphere to observe. But in addition, we have trained regular citizens, not professional scientists, to use solar telescopes. And we have an app on your phone.

They are on a record streak of 11 straight tournament wins by double digits, and this team lost five of its top eight scorers from last season.Now, Purdue, they've never won a title. And listen to this. they're playing, for one, on solar eclipse day. And home state Indiana is in the Path of Totality. The only other time they played for a title was 1969 when Purdue alum, Neil Armstrong, walked on the moon. Basketball is like religion in Indiana, apparently, astronomy too.

Clark breaking another record. Her 18 points in the first were the most in a quarter in NCAA tournament history. She finished with 30, but the Gamecocks were just too much. Their bench alone scored 37 points while Iowa scored zero. Dawn Staley, South Carolina finished their perfect season 38 and zero, winning a third title in seven years. Incredible stuff, Jim.
