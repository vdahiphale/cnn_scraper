Also, because there are people legitimately saying there could be a constitutional crisis, I think maybe small c, maybe big c on crisis over this. Why? Well, in the Constitution, Article 2, Section 2, Clause 2, says that in order for a president to get appointments, \"he shall nominate and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate shall appoint ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, judges of the supreme court and all other officers of the United States.\" Elliot, an attorney general is an \"all other officer of the United States.\" What has that meant for the last, oh, 200 plus years of America being a country, the advice and consent?",

And in his remarks fired a shot at former - President Trump saying how important the advice and consent process is. Now, look, John, there is a process whereby if the Senate goes into recess, if it leaves, then the president can just put his people in without getting them Senate confirmation. I think that's what President Trump is baiting the Senate to do here. This was a shot across the bow to - to the incoming senators, and particularly to John Thune, who was just elected majority leader.

And, Jacqueline, what are you learning? JACQUELINE HOWARD, CNN HEALTH REPORTER: Yes, Kate. Well, we know for sure that the numbers are high. About one in 10 babies born here in the United States are born too early. According to March of Dimes, when you look at data from last year, the preterm birth rate was 10.4 percent. So, 10.4 percent of births were preterm last year. And we know that preterm birth is a leading cause of infant death. So, this is heartbreaking data. We also know, when you look city by city, there are regional differences. The top 100 U.S. cities with the highest numbers of babies born, among them, these three cities had the highest preterm birthrate, Detroit, Cleveland and Mobile, Alabama. And then the three cities with the lowest preterm birth rate were Ramapo, New York, Irvine, California, and Gilbert, Arizona.

And by that I mean you can't afford to lose I believe around four or five votes, if this were to make it out of committee. And so if he really wants Gaetz, then I expect, you know, he'll begin the process of making calls to Republicans on the Judiciary Committee so that it can obviously go before the entire Senate. And he'll probably continue to do the work there.But I think, Sara, a more bigger and fascinating component of this from my perspective as a conservative is, what exactly is Donald Trump's ethos as it pertains to the DOJ and prosecutors writ large. And I think what this signals is that the former president - or the president-elect believes that prosecutors have too much power, too much influence and too much prosecutorial discretion. And he's attempting to send a signal to prosecutors at the federal level and maybe even down that he wants someone who's going to be a complete disruptor, a bring a wrecking ball to the DOJ, to radically change and transform the place based on his experiences. And so that within itself to me is fascinating for a whole litany of reasons.",

The Justice Department - the Biden Justice Department, which is always accused of bias by the right, said there wasn't enough evidence to pursue. And again I don't want to defend Matt Gaetz. He seems to e a lovely guy. But this is - Trump doesn't want - I wish Shermichael were right. I wish he was just concerned about prosecutorial overreach. He's not. He doesn't want a Department of Justice. He was a department of vengeance. And he is going to install Matt Gaetz there.Either he will force the Republican Senate to confirm him, and they will, they always bend to his will. If you do an MRI of the Republican Party today, you would never find a spine. They need to drop the elephant as their logo and pick the jellyfish because it's utterly spineless. If I'm wrong, if Shermichael is right, and he probably is, he's smarter than I am, he'll put a recess appointment in. And that will - that will subvert the Senate. By the way, he's also - you want a prediction? He's going to subvert the FBI background process, right, because people say Mr. Gaetz has sketchy things in his background.",
