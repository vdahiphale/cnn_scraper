You look at places that Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are going to be going today, like Oakland County. This is an area where Biden really outperformed Hillary Clinton. He won by 14 points. She only won that county by eight in 2016. Obviously went on to lose Michigan as a result of many things, but that being one of them.And I think you see such a disdain right now within the Arab American community against Kamala Harris. I think many people were hoping for a big shift within that community. They weren't happy with the Biden administration policies. They thought having Kamala in there might change things. That she might take a different approach. And when they realized that she didn't, they were very, very unhappy. And so you look at Oakland County and Macomb County, that's home to almost half of the Arab American population in Michigan. These people don't plan on coming out to support Kamala. And this could potentially lose Michigan for her. And even for the sake of argument, you say she takes Arizona, she takes Nevada, Trump takes Georgia and North Carolina, she still can't win without winning at least two of those states within the blue wall. So, I think these are critically important states for her. I understand her logic not going last night to the dinner. Instead, going to Wisconsin. But I do think that there's also a catholic population that's in play in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.

But if you look at what happened since then, the so-called axis of resistance that's led by Iran took a hit after hit after hit. And when you look at the region today, a lot of those proxies that Iran has built for years have been dramatically weakened. You know, Hezbollah's leader, Nasrallah, is not with us anymore. The entire, you know, from 30 top Hezbollah leaders, only five are still alive. This militia lost two-thirds of its arsenal. Same goes with Hamas, which has been decimated. Same goes with pro-Iranian militias in Syria. So, the Iranians are in a big problem.And, you know, we sort of forgot that this thing is still looming over us, the Israeli retaliation for this massive missile attack by Iran on October 1st. And this is going to happen in the next few days. We are days away from an Israeli retaliation that will give Iran another blow. So, I think we are still, you know, in - in - in the - in the incident. We're still - this is a live thing. And we only - we only know where this thing is going after the Israeli retaliation against Iran.",

It's drone footage of a tank firing on the building where Sinwar was inside. That was it right there. And we've seen other drone footage from inside the building of Sinwar apparently sitting down afterward there. But that was a tank firing at the building, which again was some kind of almost routine patrol, Barak.",

And one of the snipers who shot at Sinwar, a 19-year-old soldier who killed him, didn't know that he was firing at Yahya Sinwar. And only more than 12 hours later, when the forces entered the building and saw the body, they realized, wait, maybe we got something here. And only hours after it was confirmed that it was really Yahya Sinwar.So, when you think about the amount of intelligence efforts and operational efforts to catch Yahya Sinwar, at the end it was sort of like, you know, Al Capone getting caught for tax fraud.",
