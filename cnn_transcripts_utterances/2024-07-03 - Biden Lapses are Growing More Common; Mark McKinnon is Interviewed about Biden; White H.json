The president's age and mental fitness does seem to, in fact, be a hindrance in his campaign against Donald Trump. A significant one.And now new reporting from \"The New York Times\" indicates these moments are not just one-offs, as so many people are trying to insist, but are, quote, \"growing more frequent, more pronounced and more worrisome,\" generating \"concerns among advisers and allies.\" Joining me now is one of the reporters on that story, \"New York Times\" White House correspondent Zolan Kanno-Youngs.

Several current and former officials and others who encountered him behind closed doors noticed he is increasingly appeared confused or listless or would lose the thread of conversations.\"This does seem to be part of certainly Democrats I'm talking to are angry that this is not something that people were willing to acknowledge to them until now. What else have you learned and are - what are you reporting here? KANNO-YOUNGS: Sure. And thanks for having me on. You know, you opened by describing the debate performance. And I think for many of us who cover the White House and really for Americans and voters across the country, the question became, how much of this is unique, a one-off or has something like this been happening more frequently? And while we don't know if it's to the extent of what we saw on the debate stage, our reporting does show that these sort of lapses, this - these moments where the president can appear listless or confused, that that is happening more frequently according to those that see him behind closed doors, both advisers domestically, but also we wanted to know, for the officials that are working with President Biden, are they noticing this? So, look, he - he is blaming this on the circus, the (ph) travel that he had. We could start there. We could go to the trip in Europe, where we talked to European officials who said that they were - that they were - that they were struck by sort of the decline, particularly physically, by the president. At one point we also reported that the Italian leader, Giorgia Meloni, as well as other European leaders, when entering a space with the president, would sort of slow down in case he needed time to crowd around him. We talked to a U.S. official, a former U.S. official, who said that the President Biden now, compared to the person that they were working for, that - that they are not sure if - that they would put him in a room with a foreign adversary like Vladimir Putin. We talked to a European official who just said flattening, no, at that point. And we did see, through talking to officials, that, again, these - these little blips, you know, fumbling over a - a leader's name, or your own cabinet secretary's name, or stumbling over the wording of the correct amount of Ukraine funding, that that is catching people by alarm. We do know that after one of his first trips after traveling across the Atlantic, he came back to Camp David. And based off of our reporting, was - cut his planned debate days by two. So two fewer days. Started working after 11:00 a.m. and - and included a nap as well, indicating that some of that exhaustion was taking effect. So, you're seeing the president, at this time, blame this, you know, on travel. And, you know, I think the reporting also shows that just throughout the officials that we talked to, sort of two Bidens emerged here. You know, the White House brought out many officials that said that he's still sharp and that in cases of national emergencies, national security emergencies, that he can still talk directly to a leader. We include an example with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. But at the same time, this other Biden is also emerging. One that seems to fumble over his words and have more frequent sort of occurrences where he does appear confused. And it's starting to have a ripple effect and catch the attention, not only of European allies, but also Democrats within the United States.",
