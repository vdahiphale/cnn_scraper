They've started out by laying out the part of the story that Karen McDougal would have featured in. Her alongside another story that we've broken the New Yorker about a doorman who was paid off to conceal a rumor about a love child, those figure in this scheme that prosecutors say was undertaken with AMI, the publisher of the \"National Enquirer\", to cover up unflattering during stories during the election. And that step in the story is necessary for providing contexts so that by the time you get to the testimony we've seen this week, where they're talking about what exactly happened with Stormy and the transactions between Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniel, and their allegation that those were disguised, those were concealed. You need to know the preceding information.
