New York Police arresting two men accused of making threats against a synagogue. What they had on them when they were arrested and what police are saying about the case.

The pace of the investigations will not pause or flag under my watch.\"So timing is clearly something that's top of mind within the special counsel office and also within the Justice Department, as they walk into this. And we are watching what is happening here. It's mature investigations that Smith is becoming the head of. These are investigations that have grand juries already impaneled, bringing in top political advisers around Trump in the White House, outside of the White House, being compelled to testify. There are phone seizures and searches. There was the search and seizure at Mar-a-Lago. I mean there is already a lot of evidence that has been gathered here that smith will then take under his wing, looking at all of those facts and then having to make recommendations, policy decisions and charging decisions.",

He is clearly at least under investigation at this point related to Mar-a- Lago. We know that retention of classified records is one of the things the Justice Department is looking at.

So when Robert Mueller was appointed, for example, and you had Donald Trump's own Justice Department, you can't really ask the president's Justice Department to investigate him, so that's an obvious conflict.Here that wasn't the case. There really was no reason why the Justice Department under President Biden couldn't investigate a former president, who after all, is just a private citizen at the time. It really only is when as Merrick Garland explained yesterday that you had the former president now a candidate for president, and the current president indicating he's going to run again, so that they're going to be running against each other. So can Merrick Garland's boss, you know, can't he oversee a case involving his political opponent? That's where it got a little bit messy, and you know, having thought it through, I think he's right. It's still not technically legally required, but I think it's probably the prudent thing to do, and we know from all these months and years of watching Merrick Garland operate, he's nothing if not prudent and thoughtful.",

But here is the one thing that may not be finished in terms of the investigation.Merrick Garland was so deliberate in talking about part of the special counsels agreement being obstruction related to the documents case, and so that means I think that they are looking at charging obstruction not only for the year and a half or so of the back and forth and the potential lying about having the documents and what they were turning over but also remember that evidence that came out relatively recently about what happened at Mar-a-Lago, surveillance camera footage, people moving things in and out of the storage room, where everything was supposed to be kept. So getting to the bottom of that and getting all of that evidence together, including possibly putting witnesses into the grand jury, may still be going on and may take a little bit more time.

The Biden administration says that it has started sending out e-mails today to those whose applications have been approved.Now, there is a hitch though, because the e-mail also points out the debt is not being discharged, at least not yet because of recent legal challenges. CNN White House correspondent Arlette Saenz is following all of this for us. Okay, Arlette, what's in this e-mail? What do people need to know?   ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:   Well, Brianna, even as the Student Debt Relief Program is on hold, the Biden administration is trying to offer updates to people who did apply to receive this relief. And today, they started to send out those first e-mails to applicants, about 26 million people have applied for this relief with 16 million of those applications approved. And so people in their inboxes started to receive an e-mail that was from the Education Secretary, Miguel Cardona who noted that they have been approved, but also warns that they can't discharge that debt due to those Court rulings and those lawsuits that have been brought challenging the program. Cardona specifically writes in that e-mail: \"Unfortunately, a number of lawsuits have been filed challenging the program, which have blocked our ability to discharge your debt at present. We believe strongly that the lawsuits are meritless and the Department of Justice has appealed on our behalf. Your application is complete and approved,\" he said, \"And we will discharge your approved debt if and when we prevail in Court.\" But this program has been on hold for weeks as Lower Courts have ruled a blocking the program from being implemented nationwide. Now, the Biden administration has gone to the Supreme Court and asked them to allow this program to proceed while these Court challenges are still being considered. But so many people remain in limbo at this moment, and there is another question about whether the Biden administration might consider extending the pause on student debt payments that are set to go into effect on January 1st or to end on January 1st. The White House says they're considering all options -- Brianna.",

Doctor, thank you so much for taking the time to be with us at this really critical point, and I know your hospital is in what you're describing as crisis mode. The ER is at 100 percent capacity, pretty much 24/7. But in the evenings, it's at 300 percent capacity. Tell us how these children are presenting when they show up. DR. TONY WOODWARD, MEDICAL DIRECTOR FOR EMERGENCY MEDICINE, SEATTLE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL:   Thank you for having me. And you're right, this is really a crisis for our patients. These kids present anywhere from extremely ill to mildly ill, but most of them have not been ill in the last two years, so it is a first time experience for many of these. So, they're getting sicker, their families are not used to little kids getting sick and they are getting emergency care when they need it, but there is now long delays and as you mentioned, sometimes over 300 percent capacity in our Emergency Department.",

I think we had a reprieve because the virus load wasn't as bad and we had social distancing and people wore masks and we weren't in fact congregating in areas. So the first thing is don't be around anybody who is sick. If you can avoid going to a party or celebration with sick people, do it.If your child is sick, don't put them in school. When they go in school, they're going to come back sick. That's just part of the process. If you can wear a mask, that always helps both preventing someone from getting it and preventing someone from getting it from you. And then really taking just close -- paying attention to what you're doing at home. A lot of hand washing and a lot of hand sanitizers and remembering that these viruses don't only live in the cough or secretions, but they live on our desktops and our doorknobs and our phones and our toys and our utensils. So, try not to share those among little kids.   KEILAR:   Yes. No, it is -- I have a four and a six-year-old and let me tell you, it feels like once we recover from one thing, we're on to the next thing. And I know everyone's feeling that right now. There is no RSV vaccine right now. Amazing that could actually change in the not too distant future.

And I have to say, you know, looking at the kids who get sick now, most of the kids in our hospital have COVID -- who have COVID are sick, but they're not -- their primary element is not COVID. They have something else and COVID is making them sicker.So I think the vaccines that people have had both for the adults, the siblings, and some for the kids have really made a big difference.",
