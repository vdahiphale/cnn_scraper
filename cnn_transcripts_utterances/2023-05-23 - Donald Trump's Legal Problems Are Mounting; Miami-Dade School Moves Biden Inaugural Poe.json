But in addition to that, Trump was also restrained from looking at a lot of materials without his lawyers there. And certain materials, including like a forensic copy of Michael Cohen's cellphone, if he looks and said he can't copy, he can't transcribe notes, they're really trying to minimize how much of this can leak into the public ahead of the trial.",

I think that June 1st, you know, we wake up. If there is no deal, that will be a very stressful day for Janet Yellen, obviously. I think that what is tough about it, we have heard it before, that she, of course, has to decide who to pay first. Do you pay the international bond holders or do you people who are expecting social security checks and need that money to buy food and to pay the rent? And, of course, even if those payments are late, it can have a really devastating ripple effect because people don't receive their checks and they're late to sending out other checks. And those people who don't get those checks and late to sending out other checks that they owe, that does have a ripple effect. I think what is really interesting is this idea of just how sort of hazy of a deadline June 1st actually is. The U.S. government is receiving money every day. They are also sending out money every single day. And on top of that, the June 1st, early June deadline is when some big bills are due when it comes to paying the military, veterans, sending out social security checks, et cetera. On June 15th, I think this is the silver lining, on June 15th, the U.S. government is expecting billions of dollars incoming in revenue from corporate tax receipts that come every quarter. So --",

I do anticipate -- I don't know how much of a value that will be once there is a deal, but I do anticipate some kind of value. And also, markets just -- listen, we stared down the barrel before. We know how this game goes. You know, we know the ending to this movie. That is, of course, going to be a deal. And when you think about all the different sort of, as you call it, tricks that Janet Yellen might have up her sleeve, some people say, look, if she can go through McCarthy, they can't go through McCarthy. Biden can't go through McCarthy, rather. Maybe there's a way to go around him, for example. That's tricky.

Who does he introduce himself as to American voters?",
