Joan, not only is this the first time in nearly three years of their reading opinions from the bench, but you've also noted it's taking them longer than ever to even get to it to deliver this ruling, what's going on?",

All 10 of those killed were over the age of 50, making them the latest victims of America's gun violence epidemic.In the first three weeks of this New Year, there have already been 36 mass shootings, just in January. According to the gun violence archive, as you see here on this graph, mass shootings in the United States have risen dramatically since the pandemic began. Joining me now for some more perspective on this is CNN contributor Jennifer Mascia. She's a senior news writer for The Trace which focuses on gun violence in America. Thanks for coming in. California -- just folks starting there from what we know from this mass shooting. California is known to be a state with some of the strongest gun laws in the country, mandatory waiting periods, mandatory background checks, a ban on so-called military assault weapons. It was also one of the first states to pass a Red Flag Law. This shooting is proof that gun laws aren't stopping all gun violence, of course, but what do you see here? JENNIFER MASCIA, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I see a country with 400 million guns and I see people who can go out of state to get guns. Now, there's a number of things we don't know about this particular shooting but these are the things that I'm looking at, where he got this gun and when he got this gun, several mass shooters recently like the Laguna Woods shooter and the Gilroy garlic festival shooter, they went to Nevada to get their guns because Nevada does not have the universal background checks and registration scheme that California does next door. So, that's one possibility. That's the way he could have evaded California's strong gun laws. The other one is that this is a very old gun. This gun was -- the same model was used in a few mass shootings 30 years ago, but we haven't really heard much about it since then. And the gunman may have been sitting on it for years. California's assault weapon ban was passed in 1989. You know, California had strong gun laws, but not always so he could have kept his gun off the radar for decades. And then the only way to disarm him would have been California's red flag law as you mentioned. That was passed in 2014, though. And that would require him to come into contact with the police or a family member would have had to alert the police. And if those people weren't in his life, that shows the shortcomings of those particular laws.",

What is the research and conversation around that now? I mean, what has happened in this time period?",

There are shootings where someone will target a partner or former partner and bystanders get killed as well. There are domestic mass shootings that target only family members and take place at home. And those are the ones that we tend to not see on the news very often, but those are some of the mass shootings that are happening day in and day out, the ones that don't make the news.",

Obviously, the Russians are saying that there would be massive retaliation on their part. This is, of course, something that we've heard from the Russians in the past.If you recall, when the U.S. started sending those HIMARS, multiple rocket launching systems to Ukraine, the Russians were then threatening to hit decision-making centers in Kyiv and in other cities as well. So far, that really hasn't happened to the extent that Russia said that it would. Nevertheless, these main battle tanks are a huge topic here in Kyiv among the Ukrainians that we've been hearing from Ukrainian officials. We've spoken to some who said that they absolutely need them because they're actually running out of spare parts for the Soviet main battle tanks that they have also running out of ammo as well, very difficult to source that internationally also. The Ukrainians say they need about 300 to 400 modern western battle tanks to really be able to turn the tide. And as you correctly said, right now it's still difficult internationally, especially for those German-made ones, the Leopard 2. The Poles are saying they want those to be sent. They own them, but they have to ask Germany for permission to send them. The Germans are saying they'll allow those tanks to be sent if the U.S. sends Abrams tanks. Now, we know the U.S. is not there yet. They think that the Abrams are not suited for the battlefields here in Ukraine, the maintenance is also difficult. The Germans say something's been worked out at the moment, they're simply not there yet but certainly, a lot of these countries do see the necessities of these western battle tanks to come here to the battlefields in Ukraine, Kate.",

Congresswoman, thank you for being here. When you hear the Russian government say Ukraine will pay if anyone sends in tanks, what do you make of that threat? REP. CHRISSY HOULAHAN, (D-PA): As what the person who was previous to me said, it feels as though we've heard this threat before, and frankly, the actions of the Russians are inexplicably aggressive. And I think that they should totally expect that we would answer with these kinds of weapons systems. I have actually been not only on the Armed Services Committee but also on the foreign affairs committee advocating for us as Americans, as the United States to make sure that we are equipping the Ukrainians with everything that they are asking for and that includes at this point tanks. I don't think the saber-rattling from Russia should be something that should stop us or our allies from being able to be supportive of Ukraine as they fight for democracies around the world.",
