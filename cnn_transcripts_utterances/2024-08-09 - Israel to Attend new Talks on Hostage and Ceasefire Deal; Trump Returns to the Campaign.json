It's 09.00 a.m. in New York, and it's 02:00 p.m. here in London. I'm Becky Anderson, you're watching \"Connect the World\". Also, over the next two hours, Israel has agreed to attend talks on a hostage and cease fire deal amid fears of a wider war in the region. Another suspect has been detained in connection with the alleged foiled terror plot targeting Taylor Swift concerts. And presidential hopefuls Kamala Harris and Donald Trump have now officially agreed to a debate hosted by ABC on September, the 10th. Well, the stock market in New York will open at 09:30 about 30 minutes from now. Futures indicating a lower open this Friday, as traders close out what has been a somewhat roller coaster week, isn't it? The route Monday in the back mirror for many but still a keen sense of this volatility may not be at an end until the Fed moves on interest rates. It's the when, not the if, on that these days more on that, bottom of the hour. With fears of a wider war growing by the day, Israel says it will attend talks next Thursday on ending the fighting in Gaza and getting the remaining hostages free. No word on whether Hamas will show all mediators U.S., Qatar and Egypt pushed for these talks, saying there is no time to waste. The conflict is, of course, at the heart of soaring tensions in the region you can see here. Palestinians evacuated Khan Yunis in Southern Gaza ahead of new Israeli strikes. I'm joined now, I'm pleased to say by journalist Elliott Gotkine. Let's start with these talks, because this at the crux of so much of what we discuss. How did these talks, or at least a date for new talks come about? And how involved do we believe the U.S. Administration, the Biden Administration is, on forcing these parties back to the table? I mean, they've got leverage on one side of course.",

      "sentences": "The Biden Administration seems to be central to this. Indeed, there was an unusual joint statement put out by PresidentBiden and his counterparts from Egypt and Qatar, in which they said that, you know, they wanted these talks to take place. And they were calling on both sides to accept this cease fire hostage deal, saying to bring immediate relief to the long-suffering people of Gaza, as well as the long-suffering hostages and their families. And on top of that, a senior Biden Administration official telling CNN, it's time to close this. That's the president's view, that there do remain gaps between Israel and Hamas, but that the bulk of the work has been done. That said, of course, we have, I think, three wrinkles, perhaps. First one is that we've had nine months of these talks since the last and the one and only cease fire that took place and that came to an end, what at the end of November, and we haven't gotten over the line despite high hopes. And I'm constantly reminded, and I don't want to sound like a broken record of President Biden munching on that ice cream in Michigan saying he hoped for a deal to be done by that weekend, and that was clearly premature. And again, we don't be too optimistic, but there is always this kind of cautious optimism that this time could be different. The other wrinkle, Yahya Sinwar, of course, the mastermind, the architect of the Hamas terrorist attacks of October the 7th. He's now the overall Head of Hamas' political arm as well. So, he's got more power. He seemed to be as closer to Iran, and also to be more of a hard liner, more of a maximalist approach. And that could also toughen these negotiations further, of course, replacing Ismail Haniyeh, who was assassinated. Israel not taking responsibility for that. And the final one is Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition partners, again they've been mouthing off again today and threatening to effectively bolt the coalition if a cease fire deal goes ahead.",

      "sentences": "Well, that's what they've been promising. And I'll just cast our minds back to April after Israel was blamed for taking out a top commanderin the Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard Corps in an Iranian consulate compound in Damascus. It was almost two weeks after that, that Iran launched that unprecedented barrage of what, 300 missiles and drones and the like, towards Israel. So now we're about 10 days after Israel did claim responsibility for taking out a top Hezbollah commander in Southern Beirut, and hasn't taken responsibility for the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, the Head of Hamas' political arm. And Iran has been promising a response. In fact, we've been, you know, collecting a number of because, although the actual fighting hasn't been escalating, the war of words certainly has been. So, for example, we had from Yoav Gallant, the Israeli Defense Minister, August the 8th, saying, he who plays with fire may expect destruction. That was in Arabic on X address to the Lebanese people. Then we had Hassan Nasrallah, the Head of Hezbollah, saying, maybe tonight, maybe tomorrow, maybe in a week, prompting some gallows humor from Israeli saying, that's the kind of thing I'd expect the cable guy to tell me, or what I tell me, or what I tell myself when I'm about to go on a diet. We also had from Prime Minister Netanyahu, we will respond an exact, a heavy price for any act of aggression against us from any arena. So, kind of anticipating an Iranian or Hezbollah response, and saying what Israel will do in the event that that happens. And then finally, from Ali Khamenei, Iran's Supreme Leader. This was just in the immediate aftermath of the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, you have paved the way for your harsh punishment. So, he's kind of boxed Iran into a kind of a corner, in the sense that in order to save face for the attack and also to make good on his threats, Iran or Hezbollah has to do something. The hope is that some kind of cease fire deal could provide some kind of off ramp for this, and as Nic Robertson was writing on the CNN website, talking about the potential for Iran to be able to show the Palestinians, the Arab world that it cares more about the lives of the Palestinians than it does about saving face or revenge against Israel.",

Well, investigators in Austria have detained an Iraqi teenager in connection with the alleged thwarted terror attack, the force cancelation of three Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna. Now Iraq's Interior Ministry says the 18-year-old pledged allegiance to ISIS, same as the 19-year-old main suspect in the foiled attack. Police detained four teens in this investigation, though, Reuters reports the youngest, a 15-year-old is being treated as a witness and has been released. Well Salma Abdelaziz is in Vienna, and she is with a group of Swifties who of course, incredibly disappointed about the fact that these concerts were cancelled.

Now, Trump is looking at a situation where the polls have shifted, and he is looking at a tighter race, and in some cases, in some polls, with Harris ahead, he is now looking at wanting to change the dynamics of this race. And the evidence of that is that just Friday night last week, he said he would only do a debate on Fox in an arena full of supporters. It's the only debate he would do.
