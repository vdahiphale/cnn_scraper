Whereas with former President Trump, he has refused to explicitly condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine. He, of course, has a very favorable view of Russian President Vladimir Putin. And he talks about how he would bring an end to the war. But when you get within -- when you get behind the curtain a little bit and go into the details, Trump's version of ending this war, oftentimes what he and his advisers say is it would entail Russia essentially holding onto a fair amount of Ukrainian territory, which is, of course, a non- starter for President Zelenskyy and Ukrainians.

The fluorescent power illuminates what was previously invisible to the naked eye. Anna Stewart explains how it works. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANNA STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Young Ph.D. student Nick Ross is examining a breakthrough in forensic science, one that could solve some of the oldest crimes and bring what was once visible to the surface. NICK ROSS, CHEMISTRY PH.D. STUDENT: So, what we've done, what we've aimed to do is create a new powder for developing fingerprints. Powders are the most widely used, most successful method for developing fingerprints, but they have lots of issues already in there. There's always room for improvement. STEWART (voice-over): The powder dusting method to identify fingerprints has been utilized since the 19th Century. But even as the most widely used method of developing prints, there's only so much this earlier technique can detect.",

We should be able to get fingerprints that maybe someone's washed their hands more recently, they've touched something, but they've left residue behind. But we're going to be able to get that using a more sensitive powder.STEWART (voice-over): Ross, along with other experts, created this luminous substance made from tiny particles of matter and a sugar found on the exterior of shellfish. Made of natural oils and sweat, fingerprints can sometimes evaporate, but the smaller particles and fluorescence in this new powder can light up much smaller details. It can stick to remnants on many surfaces, like glass, metals and even more intricate surfaces like bank notes, which can resemble fingerprint details themselves.",

There's even, as you can see, a fluorescent detail in the background, but that fluorescent detail is not strong enough to contrast with the fingerprint that's been enhanced.

Governor Gavin Newsom signed a new law Sunday banning all plastic shopping bags, starting in 2026.California had already banned thin shopping bags, but customers could buy thicker ones that were billed as recyclable. When the law takes effect, shoppers will only be asked if they want a paper bag. A state study found the average person threw away five kilograms, or 11 pounds, of plastic shopping bags in 2021. Well, in Minnesota a coal-fired power plant will soon shut down and reopen using solar and wind energy. Experts say the plan to repurpose the plant's existing infrastructure could supercharge the push for renewable energy. CNN chief climate correspondent Bill Weir reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Behold, a fire-breathing dinosaur named Sherco. For decades, it has been devouring mountains of coal in Minnesota and belching out gigatons of planet-cooking gases, making this power plant the state's biggest climate polluter. But in a vivid example of energy transition, Sherco's owners are changing its diet, swapping out coal for renewables, until the last fire goes out in 2030. And after that, 125,000 homes will be powered by sun, wind, and iron batteries with four days backup.",
