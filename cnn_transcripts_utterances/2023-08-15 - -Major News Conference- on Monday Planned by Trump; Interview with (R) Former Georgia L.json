      "sentences": "They will argue that, but they are going to be arguing and disputing, really, the facts of the case. And one thing that I know I'm going to be watching for is how Donald Trump's allies react to this. We did see many his Republican defenders on Capitol Hill immediately rally around him last night after the indictment dropped. They issued statements of support. People like Jim Jordan and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy.But it's one thing, I think, to defend him and claim that this is a witch hunt and this is, you know, Donald Trump is a victim of these investigations. But another to stand by him and defend the continued false claims that the election was stolen or that the results in Georgia, you know, were rife with fraud, exactly what the district attorney and others are laying out in that indictment, John. JOHN BERMAN, CNN NEWS CENTRAL CO-ANCHOR:  Really good point. The, no, I really won defense, it will be interesting if he takes it in the courtroom and it will be very interesting to see what some of those political allies say about it as well as you said. Alayna Treene, great to have you. Kate, I know you got some special guests. KATE BOLDUAN, CNN NEWS CENTRAL CO-ANCHOR:  Some very special guests. How big the table is, it looked very small. Just so you -- let me talk first please. Ponder this, the Fulton County -- no, stay focused on me. The Fulton County D.A. finalist says she wants a trial date in the next six months. If that would happen, a trial would in -- if that would happen with this trial in Georgia, it would take place just as the Republicans start heading to the polls to vote in the presidential primary. As you ponder that, let me bring in my guests now, Republican Strategist and Former RNC Communications Director Doug Heye and CNN Political Commentator and Former Democratic South Carolina State Representative Bakari Sellers. Bakari, unique perspective all the way up there on this, not only as a lawyer but as, I would say, a recovering politician. BAKARI SELLERS, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR AND (D) FORMER SOUTH CAROLINA STATE REPRESENTATIVE:  Amen to that.",

I mentioned that a few times over on the network. You know, he's had trouble with Yamiche, he's had trouble with our own Abby Phillip. And now, he's going up against Fani. And I think that the way that she has postured herself and shown that she is not going to back down from him and shown this isn't a partisan battle.

Two examples I want to run by you. Asa Hutchinson, he said this this morning in reaction to the indictment. This is another day of challenge for our democracy. I expect voters will make the ultimate decision on the future of our democracy. Over a year ago, I said that Donald Trump's actions disqualified him from ever serving as president again. Those words are more true today than ever before.Chris christie, also running, he was on \"Fox News\" this morning, he actually said that he's uncomfortable with what he called the unnecessary indictment in Georgia, which I thought was an interesting take on that.

Chris Christie is a more than noble and nimble prosecutor.The reason I disagree with him about the necessity of this indictment is that in Georgia unlike Florida, unlike Washington, D.C. and the Jack Smith case, is you have individual victims that were harmed by the actions of the president of the United States.",

Who was a part of this RICO conspiracy, went out of her way to harm Ruby Freeman. You have the president of the United States on a phone call, calling her everything but a child of God.And this is somebody who is the backbone of our democracy. I think Doug would even agree that the poll workers that we have, the people who watch polls, the people who do this work every election, election in and election out, they are the fabric of our democracy. And he went out there to individually harm those people. And so, that makes this case a little bit different. I wanted to just talk about the courage or the lack thereof. I mean, if this is what Republicans have to display, then the bar is extremely low. And I'm not asking them to come out and be something they're not. But what I am asking of Tim Scott, what I am asking of all of these other individuals who are running for president of the United States, is tell the truth. Like, if you want to be a law and order candidate, then there has to be accountability on the other side, even for people on your team. The best example I can give you is if Hunter Biden committed a crime, lock him up. That's -- it's quite simple. If Donald Trump committed a crime, lock him.

You have one, say, one defendant and you just put on a very simple, straight forward story. The simple story is always more compelling to a jury. That's -- more or less, what Jack Smith was trying to do in D.C.This is a different approach. She's throwing the book at him and she's also going after everyone. And that's a valid approach. What -- it does mean is there's more opportunities for flippers. For example, cooperators who could help her side. But just to put a finer point on it, can you imagine a courtroom with 19 different tables of defendants, all of them with their own lawyers trying to get a word in edge wise? Can you imagine all the different counts, all the different crimes that are being put forward in this trial? Well, yes. It's a lot to throw at Trump and his team and he has to defend himself on multiple different fronts, so to speak. It also makes the job much more difficult for prosecutors as well.",

Before he became America's mayor and on the cover of \"Time\" magazine and all of that, you know, he was the United States attorney, you know, presidentially appointed United States attorney for the southern district of New York, and was leading the SDNY office for all sorts of federal prosecutions.So, the idea that now he's a criminal defendant facing, as you point out, RICOs charge as well, what a change. I actually think it makes things harder for him, Sara. Because ultimately at the end of the day, it's going to be a lot harder for jurors to find that he has no idea or to presume that he has no idea whatsoever about what's going on here. They usually hold attorneys to a higher standard and that, I think, is going to make life difficult for him. SIDNER:  OK. I do want to ask you lastly because this is a real interest to the public. In the federal cases for decades, cameras have not been allowed in those courts. But the state courts are different. And in Georgia, there's a possibility that this could be the one case of all four of the cases that has a camera in court from gavel to gavel.

I've had the gallery full of the press, but never have had cameras. If you have cameras there, you have to take into account the fact that this is going to become not just a circus, but it's going to be an online phenomenon.Think about the Johnny Depp trial and how clips of that ended up on social media. How, you know, each attorney and witness were turned into, sort of, mini celebrities and people in the public were talking about them. A trial like this of Donald Trump over a long period of time, you can imagine that Trump and his team are going to be trying to influence public opinion, for example, via what they are doing in court, playing to the viewers at home, so to speak. I think it's going to really have an impact that, in many ways, is going to be very profound, not only in that trial but on our entire society.",
