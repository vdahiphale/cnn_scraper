      "sentences": "Well, look, I came from a family where nobody in my family had ever gone to law school. I was -- I grew up in a poor family. The fact that Tim Walz wants to turn it into a bad thing, that I actually worked myself through college, through law school, and made something myself, to me that's the American dream. And if Tim Walz wants to insult it, I think that's frankly, pretty bizarre.Now, look, what I, what really bothers me about Tim Walz, it's not even the positions that he's taken, though, certainly he has been a far-left radical. You know what really bothers me about Tim Walz as a Marine who served his country in uniform? When the United States Marine Corps, when the United States of America asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country, I did it. I did what they asked me to do and I did it honorably and I'm very proud of that service. When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did? He dropped out of the army and allowed his unit to go without him, a fact that he's been criticized for aggressively by a lot of the people that he served with. I think it's shameful to prepare your unit to go to Iraq, to make a promise that you're going to follow through, and then to drop out right before you actually have to go. I also think it's dishonest. Something -- again, if you guys ever get an opportunity to ask Tim Walz or Kamala Harris some questions, he made this interesting comment that the Kamala Harris campaign put out there, and I bet they were great at -- regretting they put it out there now, because he said that we -- and he was making a point about gun control, he said we shouldn't allow weapons that I used in war to be on America's streets. Well, I wonder, Tim Walz, when were you ever in war? When was this -- what was this weapon that you carried into war given that you abandoned your unit right before they went to Iraq and he has not spent a day in a combat zone? What bothers me about Tim Walz is the stolen valor garbage. Do not pretend to be something that you're not. And if he wants to criticize me for getting an Ivy League education, I'm proud of the fact that my mamaw supported me, that I was able to make something of myself. I'd be ashamed if I was him and I lied about my military service like he did. Sir. Could you speak a little louder? Sorry.",

And look, I was not bothered at all by what President Trump said. And I didn't take it as an attack on Kamala Harris' biracial background at all.What I took it as was an attack on Kamala Harris being a chameleon. She pretends to be one thing when she's in front of one audience. She pretends to be something else when she's in front of another audience. And I think he was observing the basic foundational reality that Kamala Harris pretends to be something different, depending on which audience she's speaking to. Now, she has been able to hide this a little bit because for the past couple of weeks she only speaks in front of a teleprompter. She never gives unscripted remarks and she's hidden from the American media and from the American people. But we know she's a chameleon. We know she's a person who promised to defund the police and now wants to pretend she's a tough prosecutor. She said that she would be our border czar, and yet, for three and a half years, we have an open border. She said that she would bring some common sense and lower inflation to our economic policies, and yet, she cast the deciding vote that raised interest rates, raised home prices, and raised food prices. Donald Trump said something very simple, totally inoffensive, but frankly, obviously true to me, which is that Kamala Harris is a chameleon. She's a fake, and the American people have to look at her record if we actually want to know what -- how she stands on the issues, because her words simply can't be trusted. Sir.",

He calls Kamala Harris a chameleon. That's despite the fact that J. D. Vance once described Donald Trump as America's Hitler and now is on his ticket. So, I mean, he's also gone through some evolutions over the years. But walk us through some of this, because one of the things that is going to stand out and that the American people are going to be hearing about for the first time are these attacks on Tim Walz's military record. He served in the National Guard for 24 years. He was in the military for 24 years.",

He ended up being the National Guard's, I want to get this right, command sergeant major. I'm not as good with some of the military terms. But look, I've dug into this a little bit. And Walz has -- and Walz himself has responded to a lot of this. So, essentially, he served up until 2005, right before he decided to leave the National Guard, which he says was to pursue a political career and try to run in Congress. He was deployed to Italy. Now, there are some people we have seen online and we've seen the Trump campaign actually really seize on this, they've had some people who previously served with him who said that they felt like he abandoned him. When he resigned is when, later -- a couple months later, they ended up deploying his unit to Iraq.But others who also worked with Walz and were in the National Guard with him said, look, he always talked about wanting to run for Congress. It was very clear when he was deployed to Italy that he had political ambitions. He began talking about it and that decision had nothing to do with the assignment. And so, you'll hear Walz talk about this more. He's already kind of hit back on some of this. But it's a key thing that they're going to be trying to use because, you know, Vance himself was also a veteran and he's trying to act like I did real military service and Walz didn't.",

I mean, that isn't a really effective line of comparison or argument for him.Look, I think more what I heard here is I felt more echoes of people's 1988 than of 2004, you know, kind of, a campaign to redefine Harris as an out of touch coastal liberal who is not strong enough to protect you either at the border or on crime. And that is going to be an important line of argument for her to find a way to rebut. I mean, you know, Republicans made that case devastatingly against Mike Dukakis in 1988. As you'll recall -- people will recall with the Willie Horton ads, about a prisoner who was furloughed and committed another crime. The difference of course is that Harris was a prosecutor and she sent people to jail. You know, in 2020 in the race, when she was in the Democratic race, it was a negative. People use the phrase Kamala is a cop to attack her. I think the question is going to be whether at the convention, as she fills in what is still largely a blank, if somewhat positive canvas for voters, can she establish the toughness she needs, which is really what all of these attacks are about. They all kind of boil down to she's not tough enough to keep you safe in a dangerous world, which obviously plays on gender stereotypes as well. She has, you know, some responses in her resume that were not available to other Democrats. She hasn't really talked about that much in the context of intra democratic politics. It may now be a weapon in the same way that it was sort of an anvil in 2020.",

The reality is that Trump candidate bone spurs who escaped his own service, and then described avoiding sexually transmitted diseases as his personal Vietnam, this is someone who is in a glass house trying to throw stones through the wall.At the same time, Tim Walz served for 24 years. And then he was elected to Congress in 2006, and has been a champion for veterans and for the armed services. Vice President Harris worked with President Biden to pass the PACT Act, the biggest increase in support for veterans benefits in decades in our country. And we know Vice President Harris, when she was a prosecutor and the and then attorney general and district attorney, she put transnational criminals, gangs, human traffickers in jail. She's been a dynamite champion of safety, the same way Governor Walz funded law enforcement. He funded public safety and first responders and did that work even after Trump during his administration led to a huge spike in crime rates that has finally started to come down under Biden and Harris. So, there's really a strong argument for safety for the Harris-Walz ticket and against Trump-Vance, that I think Trump and Vance are hoping to try to avoid by throwing these kinds of attacks.",

I mean, he -- you know, he came across very well last night.And you had Donald Trump on Truth Social, imagining that Joe Biden might somehow come out of left field and get back into this race somehow.

That was the core dynamic of the campaign. And, you know, Biden's performance of the debate certainly confirmed that narrative. And now, they are casting around trying to figure out how to run against Harris. It's clear.I mean, Trump's attack on her racial identity was a really -- was a good symbol of that, that they don't really know exactly what to do. I think you can kind of see in Wayne Gretzky-like where the puck is going in the sense of them trying to make this ideological slash strength argument that she is a radical coastal liberal who won't keep you safe. You know, we'll see how that works relative, as I said, to kind of a Dukakis era type attempt at that because she does have assets to rebut it with. You know, the other question is Walz. And look, he is a perfectly reasonable vice presidential pick. He is a good campaigner. He has a good personal story. People like him. He has a record of accomplishment. But you may get to a point in October where Democrats are wondering if there was an opportunity cost in going with someone who really, in some ways, is a do no harm pick rather than maybe the higher risk, but potentially higher reward of the governor of a state that you absolutely cannot afford to lose if you're a Democrat. I think most models have if Harris cannot win Pennsylvania, her chances are somewhere between 5 and 10 percent of winning the race overall and leaving on the table the popular governor of that state. I think a lot of Republicans were breathing a sigh of relief. So, Walz brings assets but there may be an opportunity cost as well, separate issue from where the Republicans find a line of argument against Harris. You can see where they're going, though. I think, by the way, tactical advantage for the Democrats that Biden did not drop out until after the Republican convention. They spent a lot of time attacking him with arguments that are now irrelevant and not trying to imprint -- and imprint of the vice president.",

But he was making, you know, lots of assertions and engaging lots of attacks on both Kamala Harris and her new running mate, Tim Walz.And one of the things that J. D.

And I think what we're seeing are Trump and Vance and their people just scrambling to figure out what to do, because you have in this ticket Vice President Harris and now Governor Tim Walz, a really strong ticket. One that is ready to govern. One that is ready to take it to the American people.
