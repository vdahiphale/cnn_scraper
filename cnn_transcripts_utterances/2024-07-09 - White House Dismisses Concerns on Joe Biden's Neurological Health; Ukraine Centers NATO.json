One, to make sure my instinct was right about the party still wanting me to be the nominee. And all the data, all the data shows that the average Democrat out there who voted, 14 million of them that voted for me, still want me to be the nominee, number one. Number two, the idea that Donald Trump is, has gained in any substantial way, has his argument to why he should be president is anywhere convincing than it was two weeks or three weeks ago.

I think we know he's a little stiff. He's allowed to be stiffer at his age, at 81, and that's fine. And so whether it's a physical therapist or someone else, that's fine. But as your colleague and our colleague, Sanjay Gupta, did an amazing job when he did his special on cognitive function that he performed on himself to see if he had delays. The science on the brain and cognitive decline, whether it's Alzheimer's or just general cognitive decline, has really, really expanded over the last five years. We can find out so much information, but it entails things like specialized MRI scans, spinal taps, looking for beta amyloid plaque or tau plaque, as well as other tests. And then the cognitive tests now, instead of just doing the standard, what we call mini mental status exam, which has been the standard for a long time, where you just take a test and draw a clock and things, is now computerized. And it is so accurate. And it is so much more useful to really determine where people stand cognitively. So I really think that that would be something everyone would be interested in.",

The White House, though, is eager to shut down any suggestion that President Biden will have to reassure NATO allies over his fitness to lead.

Don't forget, this wasn't just about the hospital. Multiple other locations were affected. You can see live pictures of those operations happening right now.In terms of the hospital, we understand that 600 patients were evacuated, according to the health minister of Ukraine. We don't know exactly where they were evacuated to. And of the two people killed at the hospital, one was a doctor, the other a relative of a patient there. Children were said to be among the injured there. In addition, the death toll did climb. In the early hours of the morning, we heard of an additional death. A boy was found under the rubble in a location in the same district as the hospital. We understand a residential building in that district was also hit. There was also another medical facility that was hit in Kyiv, a maternity clinic, where nine people were reported dead. So, 27 reportedly killed in the capital alone, and another 10 in Kryvyi Rih, which is in sort of central-southern Ukraine, which happens to be the hometown of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. They have declared a day of mourning in that town. Now, President Zelenskyy had promised a powerful response to this on Monday. And we don't know if the two are connected, but certainly Russia says that it has dealt with a very large-scale drone attack overnight, some 38 drones attacking five different regions, an electrical substation, an oil depot said to be on fire in one region. So, that is something to note there. In terms of Zelenskyy and what he will be hoping for from the NATO summit today, I think he is looking very seriously for an increase in ambition, an increase in age from his allies, and not just when it comes to air defense. He wants to see restrictions lifted when it comes to Ukraine using Western-donated weapons to hit inside Russia, more restrictions that would allow them to hit weapons, storages, missile sites, things like that, to help avoid attacks like this happening again. John Kirby, the White House national security spokesperson, was asked about this yesterday in a briefing on Monday, and he said at this point the policy hasn't changed, but the White House is trailing several major announcements at this NATO summit.",

And this is an intensification, Rosemary, of what was already happening on the ground.For nearly the last couple of weeks, there's been a ground offensive, a push by Israeli troops in Gaza City in the neighborhood of Shuja'iyya, that is ongoing. But what we're also hearing, Rosemary, is as these bombs continue to rain down, as drones fly overhead, as Israeli troops push through the city, Palestinian officials say people are on the move. Families are fleeing their homes because hundreds of thousands, just in the last few days, have been ordered to evacuate by the Israeli military. And this has disastrous humanitarian consequences. Aid agencies already describing people who simply had nowhere to go sleeping in the open as bombs rained down, with no access to food, to medical care, to sanitation. I want to reiterate that number that you mentioned earlier, Rosemary. 1.9 million people displaced, nine out of every 10 Gazans forced out of their homes, many of them more than once. Again, aid agencies describing this dire situation on the ground with very little medical help. One of the evacuation orders was for Al-Ahli Hospital. That's one of the main hospitals in Gaza City. It is now shut down. It is added to that very long list of hospitals that are no longer functional. So really, these evacuation orders, yet again, adding to that humanitarian disaster on the ground, making it more difficult to bring aid into the Gaza Strip. The U.N. says only a fraction of the aid that has been agreed upon has actually been allowed into the enclave in recent days, again, because of these evacuation orders. And the impact is not just on the ground in the Gaza Strip, where again, these humanitarian consequences are disastrous. It could also be an impact on the talks that are taking place in Doha.

But you have said that President Joe Biden should remain at the top of the Democratic ticket despite his poor debate performance. Now he is facing mounting pressure from within his own party to step aside and new questions about his health. So do you still think it would be a mistake to replace him?",

      "sentences": "Well, my message to Democrats is shut up. Why are you airing your dirty laundry out in public and creating an image of Democrats in disarray? You should have kept that to yourself behind closed doors.You know, my analysis of American politics boils down to one sense. Republicans have no principles. Democrats have no spine. Republicans are united behind an avowed authoritarian, a convicted felon, a civilly convicted sexual assaulter, colloquially rapist, a civilly convicted, a massive fraudster. And Democrats at the first sign of trouble are trying to throw their own incumbent under the bus. So what I would say to the voters, don't judge the president by one debate. It is governance that counts. See, look at his record of governance. Look at how he governs over the next few months and look at how he campaigns and presents himself to the public. I also have a plan B. If the foolish Democrats succeed in pushing Biden out against his will, what Biden should do is resign the presidency for the good of the country, contrast himself with Donald Trump, who only cares about himself. Harris becomes president. You win the incumbency key. She'll be the consensus nominee. You win the contest key and you will replicate a positive situation for the Democrats. Otherwise, if they push Biden out and have a party fight, they'll be replicating the very situation in 2016 of an open seat and a contested nomination that elected Donald Trump in the first place. So, you know, you foolish Democrats look to history, look to the keys and don't panic at the first sign of trouble and air all your dirty laundry out in the public. CHURCH: A powerful message from Allan Lichtman. Many thanks for joining us. I Appreciate it.",
