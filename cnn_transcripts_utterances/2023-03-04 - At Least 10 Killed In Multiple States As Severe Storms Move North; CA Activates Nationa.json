Areas of New York and Maine already at least half of a foot. And we're going to add on top of that. Notice here most of these areas, you're talking widespread 4 to 6 inches of additional snow. But there's going to be some spots that could pick up an additional 8, 9 if not even 10 inches of snow again on top of what they've already had. Now in addition to snow, wind is still going to be a very big component too. So it's still possible to have trees come down, additional power lines causing more power outages.

And so it's an interesting dynamic. In order for the judge to have imposed it, of course, and the jury to have considered it, it would have been -- notice would have had to been filed and provided by the prosecutors that never happened. And so it'd be an interesting question, and of use moving forward to ask them, you know, look, if people have been convicted and certainly sentenced to death for far less, why in this instance, based upon who this defendant was, was it not pursued in this particular case? WALKER: Yes, I don't think a lot of people can think of more heinous crimes than that, you know, shooting and killing your own family members that might deserve death, if you do believe in the death penalty.

And so ultimately, they did reach that in the timeframe they reached it but they've been there all of that time. The third thing and final very brief to your point, he had to testify, Amara. There were too many lies that he told. He said he wasn't there. They filed what's called alibi notice which is giving the court notice that you're going to be saying and arguing that you had nothing to do with it because you weren't not even at the scene. Then out comes a video, cell phone data, everything connecting him. He had to explain it. Obviously, the jury felt that he was conning them just was deceitful. It was only -- it was too much.

It causes rare infections by entering the body through the nose.
