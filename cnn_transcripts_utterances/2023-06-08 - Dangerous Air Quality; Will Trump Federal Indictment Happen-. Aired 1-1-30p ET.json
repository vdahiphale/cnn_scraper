And it's coming just a few days after Donald Trump was notified from the Justice Department through his attorneys that he was a target of this investigation.Now, that's the sort of thing that happens at the very end of an investigation where a lot of evidence has been gathered, a lot of witness testimony has been secured, and the prosecution is clearly looking at what they might do to determine whether or not to charge a case. And so we may -- being in the possible final days here of the special counsel investigation into the handling of classified records at Mar- a-Lago. Now we are seeing activity in not just one, but two days this week. Yesterday, there was a witness in Trump spokesperson Taylor Budowich who spoke to the grand jury secretly here in Miami. And then again today, we are seeing some of the prosecutors from the special counsel's office inside the courthouse around the grand jury area. And so, as they continue their work here secretly, behind closed doors, waiting for a possible decision or an indictment to emerge, there are many people on Trump's legal team who are out there -- or at least one, Tim Parlatore, a former attorney who was working on this case for Donald Trump. He was on MSNBC last night speaking about an audiotape that we first reported on here at CNN as a very crucial piece of evidence that prosecutors had gathered, where Trump was caught or captured waving a document and referring to it as a classified document of some sort. Here's what Tim had to say about that last night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

That's why they're going after the special counsel as well.But, Zach, on the note of the legal fight, you have some reporting about a potential key witness, this former White House staffer, who told prosecutors that Trump not only knew about the declassification process, but also he followed it as president. ZACHARY COHEN, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY REPORTER:  This is a former career official. It's somebody who advise both the Obama and Trump administrations on the declassification process. And we're learning for the first time that this witness was interviewed by both prosecutors in the Trump documents case and the Biden documents case. And so what they laid out for us was a starkly different tone in both investigations. And, one, he told the prosecutors in the Trump case it was very clear Trump knew the process to declassify material, followed it correctly at times when it suited him, and effectively laid a road map out for the kind of testimony, additional witness testimony and additional evidence that they needed to secure and we have seen them go after since that interview took place. Now we have seen them interview senior former Trump officials like Ric Grenell, like Robert O'Brien, who has testified before the grand jury that he had conversations with Trump about the declassification process and made clear multiple times during his stint in the White House that there was a process that had to be followed. So, it really undercuts this claim by Trump that he could just will or wish documents be classified -- declassified. And it also shows why Jack Smith's this team has really prioritized trying to find and build evidence around this idea that Trump knew there was a process and willfully ignored it.",

It means that the investigation has revealed conduct that provides information that he may have committed crimes, he himself, not people around him, not he's wrapped up in a broader investigation, but he himself is potentially culpable and could be charged with federal crimes. That's different than a subject, which there would be more subjects in an investigation, individuals who are involved in some way, who are under scrutiny, but they're not being informed that they are on the path to being indicted. It doesn't mean they absolutely will be indicted, but a target is on that path.",

They have to bring as many people before the grand jury under oath to be able to gather that information. He was the president. He operated with classified information throughout his presidency. So it's hard for me to imagine a scenario where he didn't actually know what the process was. That's different, though, than him actually following those rules.

We talked about when it's -- when it improves for someone, it's going to be bad for someone else. So we are improving across the New York City area. But we're getting worse across the mid-Atlantic. D.C. you're now down to two miles' visibility. New York City, you're up to four. This time yesterday you were less than a mile for visibility. But you can see that smoke just traveling down to the south and really just swallowing up the city. This is the smoke from yesterday, and you can clearly see it from that satellite picture. That was it entering into the New York City area. Now we take a live look at our EarthCam in Washington, D.C., and you can see just that thick, hazy, smoky sky is there. We still have very unhealthy air quality. You can see those dots in red and even purple. The purple is very unhealthy. So, sensitive groups need to stay inside, Boris. It's all about that wind direction. And I do believe we will start to see an improvement over the weekend for places like New York City.

They were hazardous overnight and through this morning. Now they're just at that four or five level that we were just hearing about from a moment ago in the D.C. area. So now we're just that unhealthy and very unhealthy, still a concern certainly for residents here. But the other thing, Brianna, is that the prediction right here from the National Weather Service in our area is that we're still going to see more smoke settle in a little later into the evening. So, let me tell you exactly where we are, because Philadelphia officials, they're in the middle of giving a press conference right now on the situation. They are still asking residents to stay vigilant, still reschedule outdoor events, if you can, still wear masks if you have some sort of acute issues or if you're staying outside for a prolonged period of time, like we are today. And, of course, close your doors and windows, so that smoke doesn't get in the house. But I just want to show you kind of this area where we are right here. We're in Camden, New Jersey, across from the Delaware River from Philadelphia. And, normally, you can see the skyline pretty clearly. It's better now, but, still, the Comcast building, City Hall not as defined as it normally is on a clear day. I also want to mention that schools, the school district today, they were encouraging students to wear masks to and from school. That's still in place for the moment. And, of course, the Phillies game is the big sign that we're looking for tonight. Supposed to go on from 6 -- the 6:05. It was the late last night.
