      "sentences": "Hello, welcome to CNN Newsroom. I'm Max Foster in London.Just ahead, Russia launches a fresh wave of drone attacks on Kyiv, but Ukraine says their air defenses anymore damage to the power grid. Then, international outrage is mounting over Iran's execution of two men. And human rights groups warn more death sentences are to come. Plus, just a few hours to go until Morocco takes on France in the Football World Cup. We'll take a current look at why team Morocco has electrified the region and, indeed, the world. Ukraine's power grid operator reports no energy facilities were damaged during the latest wave of Russian air strikes on Kyiv. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says all 13 drones were shot down in Wednesday's attack. One of those drone fragments contained the words, For Risan (ph), suggesting payback for a strike on an airbase deep inside Russia earlier this month. Now, it comes as U.S. officials tell CNN the Biden administration is preparing to send the Patriot Missile Defense System to Ukraine. The Kremlin responded by saying, if that happens it will be a legitimate target for Russia. CNN's Will Ripley joins us live from Kyiv. It would be seen as a major escalation, wouldn't it, by Russia, arguably? WILL RIPLEY, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  And that may be one of the reasons, although, of course, it's never been explicitly stated publicly that the United States and NATO have been so hesitant to provide the Patriot Air Defense System because in the eyes of Russia it would make them complicit in terms of escalating this war, which is dragging on closer and closer towards the dreaded year mark. But nonetheless, the Ukrainians insist that they need these Patriot Missile Defense Systems to defend against this onslaught of Russian missiles. And then, of course, we also have the issue of these attack drones, these explosive drones that are made in Iran and perform what some here in Kyiv describe as Kamikaze-style attacks where they detonate after hitting their target here in the central district of Kyiv in the early morning hours as a lot of people were getting ready for work, there were explosions a very short distance from where I'm standing now. And there were the - also the sound that some residents reported hearing of the worrying (ph) sound of the engines of these drones. But as you mentioned, Max, all 13 of them were shot down by a Ukrainian air defense system. And really when I say systems, I mean, it's these teams of people who are often holding, you know, on their shoulders aiming and firing and shooting these down. It's pretty extraordinary if you think about it. And it just goes to show how in-depth the Ukrainians have become at responding quickly to this kind of threat when it is detected. These drones, as you know, fly at a very low altitude. This is the first strike on Central Kyiv, where I am now, in a number of weeks. And it did cause some damage. There was a hole in a building. Some apartments had their windows smashed. You could actually see remnants of the drone in some of the video that has emerged from the scene a couple of kilometers from here. And yet, remarkably, no damage to the power grid, even though there have been continuous rolling blackouts here throughout Ukraine and certainly here in the capital, there's no exception, power interruptions are a regular part of everyday life. The power grid is far from stable. They're trying to do the best they can to give people as much electricity as possible. But this constant bombardment has created really problems. Problems that expected to escalate during the winter months if Ukraine is not able to deflect even more of these Russian attacks because all it takes is one drone to get through to cause significant damage and potentially plunge an entire area or even an entire region to darkness. That's certainly what we saw happen in Southern Ukraine in the Odesa region over the weekend, when Russia launched 15 of these drones, 5 of them hit their targets and 1.5 million people were plunged into the dark and cold. Thirteen drones used to attack the capital Kyiv. They shot them all down. That is a victory today. But, of course, the Ukrainians know tomorrow could bring a whole new set of challenges and likely more attacks from Russia, Max.",

And what's also exacerbating this situation is a tense relationship with France, which on its side has to also prevent some of these boats from leaving in the dead at night, often overcrowded, across treacherous conditions.Now, the Home Secretary is also coming under pressure, as well, and indeed the government in the form of Rishi Sunak to try to ameliorate that relationship with France to prevent these boats from setting off in the first place. But as you heard there, yet another tragic reminder of the difficult situations that people find themselves in trying desperately to get to the U.K. often with parallels conditions that they have to face and also the loss of life. Sue-Ellen Braverman, there was just reminding the House of Commons that 27 people lost their lives almost 12 months ago, back in November 2021, in almost exactly the same circumstances trying to get to the U.K. in an overcrowded boat that ended up sinking in the middle of the night.

Eva Kaili was stripped of her title as a vice president of the European Parliament after Belgium police arrested her and three others last week. The Greek politician is part of a growing case where Qatar allegedly bribed European Parliament members with money or gifts to gain favor. Kaili spoke in glowing terms about the World Cup host nation just a few weeks ago. She and Qatari government officials deny any wrongdoing. International outrage mounting of Iran's execution of two men who it says were involved in violence at recent anti-government protests. State media report the two men were hanged over the past week. And Amnesty International says nine others are at risk of receiving the death penalty adding to the 11 people already sentenced to death. Possibly facing execution is Iranian football, footballer Amir Nasr- Azadani, who state media is accused of being involved in the death of three security officers during the unrest. CNN Salma Abdelaziz, monitoring the situation, joining us with more from London. It's so difficult to know what happened in these specific cases because we weren't there.

When it is busy trying to impose hijad laws and other issues that, of course, protesters on the ground want to see overturned. So yes, there is that happening in the United Nations.And on your point about the support that protesters are receiving, it's really important to remember that when we're talking about Amir Nas-Azadani, for example, that this crackdown has become so broad, so wide in its reach that soccer is in its crosshairs. That football is in its crosshairs. You'll remember that very critical moment during the World Cup, Max, when Iran's football team came out and they did not sing the national anthem. They refused to sing their own national anthem at their first game in the World Cup. And then later activists said that their families were actually threatened by Iran's authorities. I think that was a moment in which the world became exposed to the struggle that these protesters are facing. Max?",
