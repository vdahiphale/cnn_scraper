For the first time since Hamas attacked Israel and Israel began striking in Gaza, civilians in Gaza are being allowed to get through the Rafah crossing. Who and how many still remains somewhat unclear, but we are told injured Palestinians are now entering Egypt one by one is how it's described.And the Jordanian foreign ministry just announced that the start of an evacuation of its citizens from Gaza is now underway. The latest estimate is that an agreement has been reached that the injured and up to 500 foreign nationals are to be allowed through the crossing, with some Americans, expected to cross as soon as tomorrow. Now, crowds of people and ambulances have been seen lining up at that crossing, even moving through the crossing throughout the morning, throughout the previous - the last few hours. The key in all of this seems to be Qatar. They, in coordination with U.S. officials, mediated the deal with Egypt, Israel and Hamas to ultimately allow for all foreign nationals, is the goal, and critically wounded Gazans to get out. One man -- we want to show you some new images coming in. One man, as you see here in this image, is seen lying inside an ambulance as he awaits to receive medical care in Egypt.

That's down here at the Rafah crossing.Meanwhile, there are new questions about what happened to the Jabalya refugee camp. Israel says that an air strike there targeted Hamas Commander Ibrahim Biari, and a few minutes ago said that they saw it as a clear military necessity. But you can see the scale of the destruction here, including this crater which Israel says could be the result of the fact that there were tunnels underneath that were destroyed. Now, hospital officials do say there are dozens and dozens of casualties. These pictures reportedly of people taken from the refugee camp to a local Indonesian hospital. There could still be people trapped in the rubble there. There has been harsh international reaction with some countries recalling their ambassadors as a result of this. Let's begin, though, with the very latest from the Rafah crossing because this is the first time we have seen anything like this, people getting out of Gaza into Egypt.

They called the civilian casualties a tragedy of war. But I want to explain to you what that tragedy looks like.First of all, coms were severed shortly after those bombs dropped on the Jabalya refugee camp, so we're only starting to get images now. I was watching one clip of a man, Kate, just before I got on air with you, and he was holding up the names of 15 people, 15 relatives. He says his mother - his sister's family, his brother's family, everyone he knows was killed. He described it as a massacre, saying his entire residential building, 20 stories, is now wiped out in that tragedy. Of course, tearing apart communities that had already been bombed and besieged for three weeks now. We still don't know the extent, the number of people killed, because families continue to dig with bare hands into that rubble to try to find anyone, find the bodies of survivors. As I said, entire families wiped out. Parents burying their children today. The image in the hospitals nearby is also terrifying. The hospitals were already on the brink. Now they're receiving countless more casualties. One doctor saying it's simply too overwhelming for them to bear. The funerals outside those hospitals also continue to echo through the north of the strip. Now, the Israeli military will say this is northern Gaza. People should have evacuated. But over and over again we have heard from rights groups that that evacuation order is, as the U.N. described it, inhumane and impossible to do under bombardment and under siege. And what is so terrifying when you look at those images, and we still don't understand the full extent, the full death toll, is to know that this is only the beginning of the conflict. Prime Minister Netanyahu vowing this will be a long war. Kate.",

And those concerns have prompted them to ratchet up pressure on Israel to, again, contain -- contain casualties and protect those innocent civilians. And it goes all the way up to President Biden, who relayed concerns in his call with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the weekend. Again, telling him he has the right to defend Israel, but that the rules of war need to be followed and that they need to protect innocent civilians at all costs. But, again, when we hear from U.S. Officials publicly oftentimes there is that expression of empathy, but there is also an underscoring of allowing Israel to defend itself.

I'm not predicting that any -- on any given day they aren't going to fail to meet their own expectations about killing civilians.

And we already agreed then to the exit of all the foreign passport holders, American passport holders, other passport holders. We've got no reason to keep any civilians in the Gaza Strip. It was Hamas that up until now has said no to that. It was Hamas that sort of kept them there, not as -- like the Israeli hostages who are in dungeons but refused to allow these people to leave.I think if Hamas has allowed them to leave today, and only some of them I understand, it's because they're under pressure.

But he is someone that they say was intimately involved in this alleged fraud. They say that he signed the financial statements that the judge has already found to be fraudulent and that he signed certifications to banks every year indicating that his father, former President Donald Trump's net worth was at least $2.5 billion. The attorney general's office say that that also was not accurate.So, Donald Trump Jr. has already sat for a deposition. He did that last year. So, we have a sense of what he may testify to today. And then he said that he had no role in the financial statements. Here's exactly what he said, \"I had no real involvement in the preparation of the statement of financial condition and don't really remember ever working on it with anyone.\" He also testified that he never reviewed it, he never approved it. And he said if there's an allegation that someone had taken from a conversation he had with them, something that went toward a valuation of one of the properties, he said that was inadvertent and he was not aware that it was used that way. And he also testified that when he signed those bank certifications he did so after they were reviewed by accountants and lawyers. So, Donald Trump Jr. here expected to distance himself from any involvement in the financial statements. His testimony is expected to last a couple of hours. He will then be followed by his brother, Eric Trump, who has come up a lot more in the testimony so far now in the fifth week of this trial.
