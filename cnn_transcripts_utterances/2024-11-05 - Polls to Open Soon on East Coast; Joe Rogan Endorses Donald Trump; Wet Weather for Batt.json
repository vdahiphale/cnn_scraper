The events of this year, let's put it simply, they've been stunning. Donald Trump facing a felony conviction and then an assassination attempt. Kamala Harris at the top of the ticket for just 107 days after President Joe Biden stepped aside.

I am in Fulton County, the most populous county in the state, home to Atlanta. And this is what we're looking at, one of 177 polling locations at this library. About 30 minutes out to polls opening. Six, seven people in line so far, starting to trickle in. At 7 on the dot, Kasie, all 159 counties here in the Peach State can start tabulating all absentee mail-in ballots and early voting. And then, 12 hours later, by 7 p.m., polls close. Now, we are anticipating here in Georgia to get an early indicator, early on in the evening, of which way this battleground state possibly could be swinging, depending on how close those margins are. Because they count the votes so quickly. There's, in fact, a new state law that aimed to speed up the counting. Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger saying that by 8 p.m., Kasie, we should have 70 to 75 percent of all votes cast in Georgia tabulated.
