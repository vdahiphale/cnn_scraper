A Lebanese security source tells CNN that hundreds of people have been injured after an attack targeting the pagers of Hezbollah members across the country. An Iranian news agency says that Iran's Ambassador to Lebanon is among the wounded. We just got a first footage of one of the attacks. We do want to warn you, though, it is disturbing. This is one of the videos circulating on social media. The Lebanese Health Ministry is urging anyone who has a pager to throw it away, and it is warning hospitals to be on high alert as casualties come in. Let's bring in our Chief International Security Correspondent, Nick Paton Walsh, who is joining us live from London. Nick, give us a sense of what's the latest right now.",

It represents a real sort of also symbolic blow to Hezbollah that Israel, presumably, Israel, is able to get into a critical communications network and caused so many injuries. It really is just the latest in a series of blows to the organization.Now, you will recall that in response to the assassination of Fuad Shukr, about four weeks later, Hezbollah launched more than 300 rockets and drones at Israel in retaliation for that assassination, but that had very little impact, little effect on the Israelis. The question is, how is Hezbollah going to respond to today's incident, which in many respects, is an even more significant and heavy blow to Hezbollah than the assassination of its military leader.

We're still learning the scope of the attack, how many people were injured, the extent of those injuries. In terms of the Iranian Ambassador in Lebanon being injured, we do have these new -- this new reporting into CNN that according to the state media, who cites his wife, his injury is a superficial injury, and he is currently under observation in the hospital. Talk to me a little bit, Ben, about what you make of just the fact that he himself was injured in this attack. How does that factor in, and how does that impact things here? WEDEMANNow, as Nick was rightly pointing out, clearly, Hezbollah is reeling at the moment because so many of its operatives have been injured, and its systems of communications have been compromised. So, it's questionable how it can react at this point. But, there is the danger that it feels that it has been shoved into a corner, because until now, by and large, not completely, but the hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel have been restricted to the border area. Hezbollah has other weapons it hasn't used so far, which have a much farther range than what they have used, and higher accuracy. So, there is a danger of escalation at this point, and the fact that an Iranian Ambassador has been injured, perhaps only superficially, but the symbolism is enough to add, as I said, another layer of tensions onto an already huge pile of concerns at the moment.

He is a Senior Advisor to the International Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Good to have you, Seth. Your top line reaction to this news. SETH JONES, SR. ADVISOR, INTL. SECURITY PROGRAM, CSIS: Well, I think what this really highlights, whoever was involved, and there is certainly a lot of questions about the Israelis, is that tensions can continue to escalate. When I was recently in Israel and visited the border areas, the Israeli perspective right now is the situation with the north is untenable. They are deeply concerned about Hezbollah actions in what's generally called the Blue Line and Litani River, that area in between those areas. When the 2006 war ended, both sides agreed to UN Security Council's 1701 which created a buffer zone between the Litani River and Israel, also included part of Syria. The Israeli concerns right now are that Hezbollah has repeatedly violated UN Security Council Resolution 1701, fired against Israel from territory that they agreed not to fire from. Israel has, after October 7th, has removed a number of its civilians from areas in northern Israel. And I think now that we're seeing Israel sort of start to wrap up the war in Gaza, they are starting to turn north. I'm not saying that any of this is justified. I'm just trying to pull us back into the strategic situation that's going on right now where Israel is really trying to change the situation on the ground and create some sense of security on its northern border. That may have been rational for actions right now. We still don't know exactly what happened, but certainly very concerning to see.",

They had a relatively muted response recently to the assassination of a senior Hezbollah figure. I think now they're going to have to respond. I mean, there are a couple of ways of doing it. They can respond horizontally. So, we can see activity by the Houthis or other allies of the Iranians, or we could see Hezbollah, which I suspect is going to happen, shoot off a range of rockets.I mean, the real big concern for me is that Hezbollah has a range of standoff weapons, rockets, missiles, upwards of 200,000.

Diddy's lawyer saying that they want to move quickly. They want to fight. He believes that that Diddy will be found innocent at the end of all of this. They could move fairly quickly for a trial but quickly, meaning somewhere between several months from now, maybe a year.But, this will be something that his lawyers appear to wanting to push forward and get this through the court's system.

At this point, the Ministry of Health have, as you said, told peopleto throw their pagers away, to discard them, suggesting that this is not an attack that is just affecting Hezbollah members at this point, hundreds believed to be injured. They've also not only put hospitals on high alert, but the Ministry of Health has been calling people back to their jobs at hospitals. Health workers have been told to report back to work because of the sheer number of injured that are traveling to hospitals and that are needing to be treated at this point. We also know that there has been a public call for the public to donate blood, which would suggest that some of these injuries are significant. Now, we are waiting for that press conference. We should get an updated idea of just how significant this event was, but it certainly does seem to have encompassed an awful lot of the country. We know that the southern suburbs of Beirut, for example, the Hezbollah stronghold, we hear from Lebanese security forces, have been affected, also the Beqaa Valley, which is further northeast, and also parts of southern Lebanon as well. So, this is not just one isolated area. It's not just one -- or number of isolated cases. It really does appear to be very significant. We have heard also that Iran's Ambassador to Lebanon was injured in this attack. We're hearing, though, from, Fars, from the Iranian state media, that they are super -- it's a superficial injury, and he is currently under observation in hospital. We understand that two embassy officials were also injured at that point. Now, of course, the questions are being asked, who is responsible, certainly across Lebanon. There would be no question about who is responsible and elsewhere here in the region. Israel's military is not commenting at this point. But, we have certainly seen tensions rising between Hezbollah and Israel. Just in the last 24 hours, we saw that the security cabinet's meeting in Israel agreed that there was an extra objective to the current war in Gaza, the war against Hamas, and that, according to the cabinet, was going to be to allow tens of thousands of Israelis that had been moved from northern Israel, because of that tension with Hezbollah, to be allowed to go back to that border area. So, certainly, this has been front and center for the Israeli politicians in the last 24 hours.",

      "sentences": "Well, the charges that have been brought are all encompassing of a number of violations of California penal law as well as federal law. It's all in the indictment. The reason why I think some of the California charges, which could have been more elucidated and made overt acts, as opposed to just alluding to them, is really an issue that I think the SDNY is going to have with venue. I think they have jurisdiction because of the events in a New York hotel room with Cassie (ph), but most of the things they're describing, all took place in California.This is a typical thought process of the Southern District of New York. That's why they call them the sovereign district of New York. They believe that they can cast their wide net all over the world and all over the country without concerns as to whether the case really belongs in another district. So, I think that if I were the defense attorney, I'm not only going to move to dismiss this indictment, which will be denied, but I will move for a change of the venue to the Southern District of California, where most of the events took place, and where the forfeiture count that is taking away Diddy's home in Southern California and probably all of his money, which is deposited all over the place. To take that away from him in a forfeiture count would probably sit. So, it'll be interesting to see how they go about doing this. I'd want to move it to Southern California, because celebrity cases have a different flavor than they do in New York. So, I'm kind of looking at that.

The truth of the matter is that this is what's going to happen, and he has to recognize that. That's another reason why they want jurisdiction in the SDNY, because in the Southern District of California, there is a real possibility he would have been able to post a bond.",
