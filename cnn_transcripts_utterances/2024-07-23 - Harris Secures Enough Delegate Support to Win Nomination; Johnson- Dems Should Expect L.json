Could she get to enough delegates to effectively secure this nomination?The Democrats quickly lined up behind her. You saw, just as you mentioned, that any of her potential rivals decided to bow out. They wouldn't create more confusion, wouldn't create chaos within the Democratic Party. Once Biden pulled out, you know, there could have been a vacuum. He very naturally gave his support to his vice president. And you know, at that point, really, the Democrats had two possibilities, this hypothesis of an open convention where there would be some internal party sort of litigation as to who would emerge ultimately as the nominee or line up behind, you know, the candidate of continuity, the candidate of experience. And that's clearly the case that they, you know, the path that they chose. They really had, you know, essentially, you know, didn't have much of a choice. I mean, they could have prolonged the process and it could have been a more open field. But effectively, they had to look where the money is, where the infrastructure is, and where the legitimacy is. You know, Kamala Harris, as vice president, does carry the legitimacy of the functions in which she occupies today. And so really what this does is it allows the Democrats to start not necessarily thinking about who could be the ideal person, but focusing on how to line up behind that person and organize themselves and do everything they possibly can to deliver her victory this November.",

You know, the choice of vice president at this point is really a political tool.So any of the people that you mentioned, you know, your Josh Shapiro, your Mark Kelly, your Beshear, those are all people that really will bring something to the ticket. You know, Kamala Harris from California, from the Senate, you know, we see that she won't necessarily automatically appeal to all voters. And so she really needs someone to come and complete that. You know, there's been talk about Mark Kelly, a senator, obviously an American hero that many people are familiar with. He would bring, obviously, a battleground state with him. But there's also really something to be said for the governor hypothesis. Why? We've seen a lot of America's very successful presidents come from, you know, a governorship. It's really a sort of CEO position of a state, right?

That's if she didn't know.If she knew and didn't want to reveal techniques and practices that the Secret Service uses, which I would understand, that should have been her answer. She should have said that would reveal tactics and procedures that the Secret Service uses and we don't want to make those public. I get both things. But I mean, just simply right now before that event, there had to be an operational plan, an ops plan, as we used to call it. And it's going to detail everything from who's on the detail, what their responsibilities are, maps of the location to where the nearest trauma hospital is. That existed before the event. That has most of the answers that they were asking. So she either needs to come clean and say, I'm not willing to provide it or explain why she doesn't have something that they knew before the event. MACFARLANE: Steve, just to draw on your experience for a moment, I think one of the more stunning revelations of this hearing was the fact that the Secret Service had been informed of an individual on the roof somewhere between two to five times before the gunman opened fire. I mean, why in that instance was Trump even allowed to go up on the stage? Why was there no Secret Service agent on that roof?",

If a person climbs on that roof and they are a suspicious person, that is still not authorization to shoot them.I mean, that's not a crime punishable by immediate death. If a person all of a sudden produces a weapon, then maybe. But they have to actually see that. What really bothers me is that they had a person who was obviously suspicious. He had ranging devices which are used by long-distance shooters and they didn't aggressively pursue this person. I mean, at that point, you don't say, oh, let's keep an eye on him. That's like somebody kicking your door in at three in the morning and you tell your spouse, I'll keep an eye on him. No, it is time for action. It is time to get that person separated and find out what's going on. The lack of a response beforehand, forget the snipers, forget bringing him out on stage. Why weren't they addressing that very suspicious individual who is a potential threat?",
