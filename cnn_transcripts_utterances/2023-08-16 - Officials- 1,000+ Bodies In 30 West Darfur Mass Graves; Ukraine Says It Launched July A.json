      "sentences": "Danny, another disturbing discovery where community leaders in West Darfur are saying that they've discovered 30 mass graves with more than 1,000 bodies in them. And these leaders are from the mainly Masalit ethnic tribe, which is a non-Arab community and it kind of gives you a sense of the ethnic undertones involved in this conflict.Now, you'll remember that West Darfur was the site of a genocide 20 years ago with a similar -- with similar people involved. So the community leaders are accusing the Rapid Support Forces -- the RSF -- of hiding bodies and dumping them. They also accuse them of threatening aid workers to prepare the bodies for burial and then taking them away to hide in secret locations for burial. Now, we also reported in July of 87 bodies found in a mass grave but the community leaders are saying that this is just a small percentage of the bodies hidden out there. And CNN has not been able to independently verify these reports or, indeed, how many mass graves there are in West Darfur, but it is a very worrying development. And the Southern -- Sudanese Sovereignty Council chairman has called for a caretaker government to take over. Listen to what he has to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MALIK AGAR, DEPUTY CHAIRMAN, SUDAN'S SOVEREIGN COUNCIL:  (through translator):  The situation necessitates us to form a government to run the will of the state to carry out a couple of basic tasks. To provide services and rebuild what was destroyed by the war. To work with the political forces to structure and establish the state. And to prepare the environment for a constituent and constitutional conference that will lead us to elections and the peaceful exchange of power. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

MARIANA ALFARO, POLITICS BREAKING NEWS REPORTERS, THE WASHINGTON POST (via Skype):  I think there's no reason to believe that. In fact, I think that this time around he's probably going to use all of the media attention around him, potentially showing up in jail, having a mugshot taken in his benefit. So I think that's just going to rile his base a little more.",

I think it's Asa Hutchinson, Will Hurd -- two candidates that are really pulling very behind the former president who are saying that the indictment could hurt him. Other than that, the other ones are really playing to the base. I mean, Ron DeSantis is running second -- a very far second -- and hasreally stood through Trump and said that if he is elected president, he's going to make it so that these things -- this criminalization of government institutions doesn't happen.

You know, there is some concern -- I mean, there's an idea that he could turn himself in that day because he's already said he's not going to participate in the debate. And you can just imagine how the split screen of the debate and then Trump showing up to turn himself in could draw all the attention away from the debates. So I think that -- you know, all of these other players are going to have to really continue making all of these statements saying they either support the president or they really think that this should take him out of the race. But at this point, Trump's platform and all of the attention he has is really commanding the waves and it's going to take a very \"out there\" statement, maybe, for a Republican candidate to break through that ground.",
