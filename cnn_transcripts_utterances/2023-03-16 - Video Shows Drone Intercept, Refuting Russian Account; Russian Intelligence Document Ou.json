      "sentences": "Images that would have terrified us during the Cold War, bringing a similar chill tonight.John Berman here, in for Anderson. By now, you might have already watched this video of a Russian fighter harassing an American drone in international airspace over the Black Sea. Tonight, we're going to look at what it signifies in today's confrontation between Russia and the West, one in which Moscow is already fighting a Hot War in Europe, and just as during the Cold War, it's also actively trying to subvert pro-Western governments. We have a 360 exclusive on a Russian document laying out one such plan to effectively topple a country besides Ukraine, and indications that the scheme has already started. First, though, what that video tells us and new details on the intercept itself. CNN's Oren Liebermann has that. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT (voice over): High over the Black Sea, a US spy drone points its camera backwards towards its own tail, a Russian fighter jet closing fast on a much slower MQ-9 Reaper. The Russian jet then begins dumping fuel as it passes by the drone. The cloud of fuel vapor and crucially, the spinning propeller clearly visible in the video after the pass. The Russian Sukhoi SU-27 fighter then flies by on another pass dumping fuel once again, the jet comes even closer, and the video pixelate when the Russian fighter collides with the US drone. When it comes back online, you can see the propeller with a bent blade damaged in the impact. In these side by side images, you can see the propeller before and after operating and damaged. GEN. MARK MILLEY, UNITED STATES CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF: We know that the intercept was intentional. We know that the aggressive behavior was intentional. We also know it was very unprofessional and very unsafe. The actual contact of the fixed wing Russian fighter with our UAV, the physical contact of those two, not sure yet, that remains to be seen. LIEBERMANN (voice over): The video undercuts the Russian narrative of what happened during the encounter.",

Russia has already reached the crash site, some 80 miles southwest of Crimea, two US officials tell CNN. They have been able to recover some debris from the wreckage, but the US downplayed the significance of the drone remnants saying there is probably nothing left of real value. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Number one, the Russians can't be trusted to tell the truth and they can't be trusted in terms of international law, so can't be trusted, can't be believed.And this has been demonstrated over and over again, from the time they pledged not to invade Ukraine, they pledged not to attack civilian targets.

What we know is that the highest levels that we think we know is the highest levels of the military have ordered this, them to bully the United States. The Russians feel that the Black Sea is kind of their backyard pool, and no one including the United States should be playing in their pool, and we have to show by putting more Reapers out there, putting more drones up there that they're not going to tell the United States or anyone else where we can go what we can do in international airspace and waters.",

I think what we're assessing, what European Command, EUCOM is assessing, is how to better safely fly the zone knowing that you're going to get these kinds of intercepts by the Russians. When you look at the map again, too, I mean, that drone was downed closer to Romanian and Bulgarian territory than it was to Russian territory. So it confirms what Secretary Cohen just said, Russia considers this, the Black Sea, a Russian lake, and they can't have it that way. This is international waters.So what I think the assessment is going to really look at is how do we better protect our drones? Because these drones can loiter over the area anywhere from 14 to 34 hours. It gives a distinct advantage in terms of Intelligence collection. How do we protect them? And how do we scramble jets when we see Russian aircraft going after the kind of harassing actions that they've done in this case?",

I don't think that's a big issue as far as we know. I think the bigger issue for me is whether or not we should start replacing the MiG-29s.

I mean, remember, Mar-a-Lago is a private club, but it's kind of open to anyone who has the money to pay for a membership, who's a guest of someone who is a member. It is not a particularly private place. It's not like a private home in the same way that other, you know, former Presidents have private homes. And so I think that the Federal government in this case is particularly interested in the goings on in Mar-a-Lago. How did people get from place to place? Who might have had access to some of the rooms where some of these documents were found? That seems to me a really critical part of the picture as they're trying to establish whether the documents were recklessly handled, and perhaps put in places where people who shouldn't have had access to them had access to them.",

I can't think of anyone in this case. Now, when it comes time for a jury, that is technically an improper argument, but a lot of good defense lawyers will still try to get into not just the prosecutor's motives, but what is relevant is the witness's motives and if you can show these witnesses have an axe to grind, these witnesses have a personal agenda, that's fair game. But I do think it's worth sort of stressing the point Abby made, Donald Trump attacks everyone who investigates him, going back to Robert Mueller on prosecutors, FBI agents, Judges who've ruled against him, jurors, grand jurors, so this is completely expected.

Would that have prevented this? We don't know. But what we know is there's probably additional regulation coming down the pike. But also, I think it comes down to trying to demonstrate to younger leaders that there's a need -- a different Gestalt that's needed among our leaders. And that is, who do you want in your foxhole? Do you want someone who's deliberate and see themselves as a citizen and as calm and purposeful? Or do you want someone who sees gotcha points or some, you know, see some sort of currency in creating alarm and unnecessary panic? So I think it's a cultural issue.

Fallout from a law championed by a Republican Governor Ron DeSantis that requires approval of all books in public schools that has led to a lot of books being removed.Picoult said that included one book she wrote about the Holocaust. She also said that the law is so egregious and vague that, quote, books are being pulled off shelves without a lot of understanding why. Today, a top official for the Biden administration published an editorial on this controversy. It does not name Governor DeSantis but it is rather conspicuously published in a Florida newspaper, the Tampa Bay Times. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona writes, quote, \"Ironically, some of the very politicians who claim to promote freedom are banning books and censoring what students can learn.\" He also writes, \"Parents don't want politicians dictating what their children can learn, think and believe. That's not how publication is supposed to public education is supposed to work in a free country.\" I spoke with Secretary Cardona shortly before air. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
