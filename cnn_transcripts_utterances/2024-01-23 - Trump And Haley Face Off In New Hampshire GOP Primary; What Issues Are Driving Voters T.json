      "sentences": "Yes, Anderson. I just want to give a shout out really fast to our embed, Alley Main (ph). That's the reason that we had a camera at the location. The Trump team did not give us or any national media access to that location, but the embeds are the backbone of our political operation. So, I want to make sure that we give her credit for finding that location and getting him on camera.Now, the most important thing that he was talking about and which I thought was quite surprising is that he said he didn't care if Nikki Haley stayed in the race. Well, we know that that's not true. And he said he would never call for anyone to get out of the race. Also, not entirely true. Last night, we heard him say essentially everything but that. He said that the entire Republican Party was backing him. The only thing that was stopping him from unifying the country was Nikki Haley. And gave every single allusion or alluded to that she should drop out of the race. The other part of this is that we know that it has annoyed him that he -- she has maintained her position in the race. But I will tell you that talking to his senior advisers who I talked to you just this morning, they are feeling much more confident now than they felt just a week ago. They implemented a two-pronged strategy. They hit Nikki Haley over immigration and Social Security. And the immigration point is something I want to mention because you heard Donald Trump talking about it there. That is his number one talking point in New Hampshire. They believe that Republicans care about immigration more than anything else in this state. And that is why you have seen him not only hammer at home. Obviously, it's a national talking point for him, but particularly with advertisements here, Nikki -- hitting Nikki Haley on that topic. It's something that they hope will bring out Republican voters because they had been watching her polling very closely. They saw at one point had gotten significantly closer that had them very concerned. But today, in recent internal polling, they do believe that they are going into this confidently.",

Hopefully, you can see it, but there's actually absentee ballots that are being processed right now as we speak. There's a big stack of them and they're going through them one by one, verifying names. People that want -- perhaps want to challenge one of the absentee ballots can do that during this process. And then they go through and are added to the larger stack of votes who are -- folks who are voting in person today. As we zoom out, this is where folks come in, they give their name, they check their IDs. And eventually, they go back to the voting booths. Obviously, if they're a registered Republican or Democrat, they get a ballot designated to that party. If they're unregistered or independent, they can ask for one or the other. And then when they get in the booth, Kaitlan, that is where the magic happens. They fill out a bubble -- of President Joe Biden. They write in his name. Remember, he's not on the ballot here in New Hampshire today. The importance of Belmont. Why is it significant? Why are we watching it closely? I've been texting with folks close to the Trump campaign who said that they are watching how the former president is going to do here because it could be an indication of how well he performs against Nikki Haley and whether this primary potentially could end today. This is a working-class area. Historically Republican. In 2016, Donald Trump won the primary here by tripling, tripling the number of votes that the second-place candidate at that time, John Kasich got. Earlier, I spoke with a woman outside who says that she's actually here as an undeclared independent voter against Donald Trump, seeing him as a threat to democracy. Here's some of what she shared with me. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He is still the center of why people talk about her. I don't like Trump because X. I don't like the way he talks. I am pro democracy.There is very little that I've seen of people saying, this is why I really like Nikki Haley. This is what she represents to me. This is what I want in a president of the United States. And that, I think, speaks to the fact that this is, as it's being called, the last stand for the anti-Trump vote. We are just seeing people saying, I don't want Trump, so I'm going to go for Nikki Haley. But they're not saying, I want Nikki Haley.",

It has now been whittled down to two Republicans. It is a pretty clear choice. I mean, you can see the differences. Even if Nikki Haley doesn't always -- she's only started laying out her real criticism of Trump himself in recent days. But what does it say if Republicans do overwhelmingly choose Donald Trump?",

      "sentences": "So, I think it says a couple of things. The first part is we have to remember that at the beginning of all of this, there were a whole lot of candidates who were running like Trump light.So, they weren't actually rejecting Trump. They were trying to be Trump. You know, Ron DeSantis immediately comes to mind. Refusing to criticize him, essentially having the exact same platform, even the same talking points and mannerisms. It's not until the very end that somebody like Ron DeSantis starts lightly criticizing Trump. But one of the things that we do know as these candidates have dropped out is about the strength, the continuing strength of Trumpism in the Republican Party that exists even without Donald Trump, right? So, when Donald Trump wasn't even on the radar two years ago, when it seemed like he was just completely gone from the political realm, Trumpism was still the ideological choice for the majority of Republican voters, not for everyone else. And I think this is actually a critical point because Trumpism has overtaken the Republican Party, it still remains true that there is a large segment of the Republican Party and a very large segment of the general population that rejects Trumpism altogether. And so, what happens during the general election when it comes down to essentially Trumpism versus everyone else. That's where the real race happens.",

She's not -- she's pulling distant from Trump right now.I think the argument that Governor Sununu and Nikki Haley are making about electability in the general election is spot on. But unfortunately for them, that's different than the argument they need to make in a primary election. And that's where Nikki Haley is struggling, even going into her home state, even in ideal situations in New Hampshire, where there's a big independent cachet of votes that she's banking on. Even then, she's still polling distant from Donald Trump. Even when you focus just on Republican primary voters, it is his party. It is shaped in his image. It just doesn't look like there are pathways for Nikki Haley to really compete with Donald Trump, particularly in states that have a more traditional primary. So, yes, they're talking about -- I mean, Governor Sununu made key points about the fact that Republicans haven't been very successful in tight general elections since Trump, particularly in 2022, particularly after the downfall of Roe v. Wade. But that's just not messaging that we see has been impactful in these primaries.",
