Donald Trump is leading President Biden in both in Georgia, Trump has a five point lead in Michigan in this hypothetical matchup, Trump is now a 10 point edge. Biden won both states in 2020. Yes, still a hypothetical matchup, still need to get through the primaries.As for the more immediate focus then and more immediate concern for Trump's Republican rivals, new numbers are just coming in from Iowa as well. Now 35 days to the Iowa caucuses, Donald Trump is holding a 32 point lead. So important perspective on that. In the history of Des Moines Register polling, that is the largest lead that any Republican has held this close to the caucuses. So how does this current state of the race impact the campaigns? We will see. Donald Trump for his part off the trail today and also not going to be in a courtroom as previously scheduled.

Interestingly enough, Reagan lost the Iowa caucuses back in '80, so it's not quite over yet.But there's another reason to believe that Trump's lead is solid. Mind made up. Look at this 70 percent of Trump backers say their mind is made up. Compare that to just 34 percent of Haley backers in Iowa, and just 30 percent of DeSantis backers in Iowa.

Look at now, look at 2023 just 35 percent of Independents backing him in Georgia, just 30 percent in the state of Michigan. You can't win with those types of numbers if you're Joe Biden. Losing that support in the center of the electorate, it's not just on his far left, which I think a lot of people are focusing on, it's really in the center of the electorate where Joe Biden is losing a lot of support.Let me just put this some more historical context. Michigan polls where Trump led Biden, the entire 2020 cycle, there were zero, Kate, zero, not a single one. In the 2024 cycle, so far, we're already at two polls. So this gives you an indication that these polls are very different than they were back in 2020. This is a much stronger Trump candidacy at this point.

Let's just start with that what they're asking for from this jury. So because Rudy Giuliani said many things about them that the judge has already found he is liable for, he did defame them, he was claiming that they were switching votes as they counted ballots, it just wasn't true. And they faced a significant harassment because of how far those messages were sent from Rudy Giuliani.The amounts are asking for reputational damage alone, they're asking this jury to find -- to award them between 15.5 and $43 million. On top of that, they want the jury to award them payment for the emotional distress that they -- that he had caused them after the election, not just him, either Donald Trump as well, the Trump campaign, everyone who was putting forward what Giuliani was saying and repeating those things. And then on top of that, they're asking for what's called punitive damages, that is punishment. The punishment for his outrageous conduct, and an amount of money that would deter Rudy Giuliani and others from doing something like this in the future to them or other people. And so, all of that put together could be an enormous amount of money that Giuliani already is saying he doesn't even have a few $100,000 to pay them for attorney's fees that they've been awarded. And so, that alone is significant. On top of that, this is going to be an episode in court where we see in this federal court in Washington the real harm that took place after the election to these two women. Giuliani is expected to testify for himself if Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss's attorneys don't call him first to the stand. They also are going to be taking the stand to testify and we're going to be hearing clips of testimony, recorded video testimony of others who were working with Donald Trump at the Trump campaign and Rudy Giuliani after the 2020 elections. So, an episode, a mini trial of all that is very likely to be tried again in criminal cases against Donald Trump and others.
