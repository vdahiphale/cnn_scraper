You're watching \"CNN Newsroom.\" And I'm Rosemary Church.Just ahead, extreme weather in the U.S., there's no relief in sight for the sweltering heat, for tens of millions of people from coast to coast. While in the northeast, floods have turned deadly. That's why much of Europe is also suffering under record heat. Italy could see hottest record of temperatures. We will go live to Rome. And the Kerch Bridge linking Crimea to Russia sits quiet after reportedly being hit by some sort of strike, we have a live report from London. UNKNOWN (voice-over): Live from CNN Center, this is \"CNN Newsroom\" with Rosemary Church. Good to have you with us. And we begin with extreme weather that is bringing excessive heat and deadly flooding across the U.S. More than 80 million people are under heat alerts in it least 14 states, stretching from Washington State all the way to Florida. And the relentless blistering temperatures are breaking records by the day. Parts of California, Nevada and Arizona are seeing the mercury shoot well past 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Meanwhile, it's not excessive heat but too much water that's causing the distress in the northeast. In the past month, parts of New England and other northeastern states has seen 200 to 300 percent of their average monthly rainfall. The dome of extremely hot air is what's behind the seemingly never- ending heat wave gripping the Southern and Western U.S. Here is CNN Meteorologist, Brandon Miller, to tell us if there is any relief in sight.

These above average temperatures, we put this into motion going through the work week, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday into Thursday. They really just expand.The high pressure that has been here over the four corners region, near Nevada just sort of drifts a little bit. But that heat dome stays massive and it blocks any of these winds and rain that can cool things off and things are going to stay 10, 15 degrees above average. That is Fahrenheit above average for the next at least week. And we're talking the hottest times of the year. So, it's -- take your hottest time of the year and at 10 to 15 degrees Fahrenheit, and that is where we are. Nearly every day this week in Phoenix will be a record high. That's scary. And what's even scarier are the lows, 94, 95, 94. Those would be in the top five to 10 hottest nights Phoenix has ever had, any one of them. And you've got seven in a row. It's been since the last Sunday with the low, dropped below 90. So that's a record stretch for them. We're setting records everywhere, Las Vegas, more of the same looking at setting a record and then staying above 110 all week long, again, lows, not dropping down where they should be. That is where heat turns deadly, the next several days here going through actually next weekend. Here in the northern plains and even the northeast we've been dealing with a lot of rain. You're dealing with smoke from the Canadian wildfire but we're at least staying out of this record heat wave that shows no signs of breaking in the U.S. Back to you. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

They are saying we could head over that today, almost certainly tomorrow where temperatures are actually predicted for the city of Rome to maybe hit 43. It's far worse in southern Italy. In Sicily, they may break a 48.7 record that was up last year. Now, that was extremely hot. And as you said, this is a height of tourist season and you've just got so many people waiting in line under the sun to get into places like the Roman Colloseum behind me. You know, there's free water available to the tourist but it's very, very hot.

So, what you've got is you know, shopping malls and markets and things like that that are air conditioned. So people are trying to take shelter in that, the Italians.But one of the big differences here, Rosemary, is that people who are from the Mediterranean, people who lived in Southern Europe, know how to handle the heat. It is always hot here in the summer. So you've got people, Italians, Greeks, Spanish, people are often but much more prepared. They don't go out during the middle of the day. They eat less, they cut down on alcohol. These are the sorts of things that tourists don't necessarily do. They're on a holiday. They maybe planned years in advance. You know, they don't want to miss out on any of it. And that's what the authorities are far more concerned about the tourists that are not taking the advice of getting out of the sun in the middle of the day, or staying hydrated. And so, the concern in these next couple of days, it's supposed to be very, very hot, that we're going to see some problems. Now, we had several tourists collapsed here in Rome, but there are authorities around to help them. You know, it is just a difficult situation for the authorities to try to manage the people, the citizens, the population and the tourist, and this is the busiest time of the year here in the city like Rome, in Florence, in Sicily, and across Southern Europe.

We are still waiting for a readout from that meeting from both sides, but the length of it suggests that they had a lot to discuss.You know, China and the, U.S., as you say the world's two largest economies, the world's two largest emitters. They accounted for 40 percent of global emission. So, there needs to be cooperation and a concerted effort to drastically cut fossil fuel production to make an impact on climate change and to lead by example. Climate talks, Rosemary, came to a still, August last year when then U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan. Beijing severed talks in protests. But there have been a slew of high-level U.S.-China meetings that was seen in the past months to try and improve this bilateral relationship. The U.S. Secretary of State, then the Treasury Secretary, now U.S. Climate Envoy John Kerry. Kerry and Xie, they have you know, history. They worked together for COP 26 and Glasgow back in 2021. And they did make progress and there was hope. They met on the sidelines of COP 27 in Egypt last year. In January this year, they talked via video conference. You know, communications have continued despite the strained relations. And obviously, this face to face meeting that they have this morning, you know, it's about resuming the joint working group on climate cooperation before that big meeting, COP 28, in Dubai, which starts at the end of November. Kerry said it was imperative that China and the U.S. make real progress in the next four months. Now let me read to you what John Kerry also said. He said, in the next three days we hope we can begin taking some big steps that will send a signal to the world about the serious purpose of China and the U.S. to address a common risk, threat, challenge to all of humanity created by humans themselves. Kerry will no doubt meet with other Chinese officials, possibly even Xi Jinping. Kerry met with Xi when he was U.S. Secretary of State under Barack Obama.

Ukraine has not confirmed it launched a strike. The Russia appointed head of Crimea says an emergency incident has halted road traffic on the bridge, but Russian reports say rail service continues though with delays.

Yeah, so a Crimean official says that this is a terrorist attack, in his words, carried out by Ukraine, suggesting that there will be retaliatory strikes carried out by Russia.He also said, as you mentioned, that the bridge is divided into two parts. There's the part that carries trains and then there's the part that carries vehicle traffic, and the road part of the bridge has been damaged, but the train section has not. And for evidence of that, you have to look at the new video that were seeing, that appears to be taken from the inside of a train car alongside that bridge. And you could see it in the video, it seems like one of the sections or one of the spans is partly dislodged from the pillars in the Black Sea there.  Now, what you don't see in this video or others is any kind of an impact crater on the surface of the bridge, so it is not entirely clear where or by what caused the actual impact on this bridge. The Ukrainians have not directly claimed responsibility but the Ukrainian Security Service, the SBU, has heavily hinted that they were in fact behind this attack. It should also mention that Russian officials are saying that at least, the early numbers suggest that two people were killed and one person was injured. This was a family traveling together in a car. The parents apparently were killed. The girl survived but is injured. This bridge, obviously, has targeted -- has been targeted before. And that's of course because it's not only strategically important, it's symbolically important for Russia, which illegally annexed Crimea back in 2014 and then spent years bringing this bridge. And then in 2018, when it opened, it was Vladimir Putin himself who actually was on hand for the official opening. And in terms of it being targeted, it was just earlier this month that Russia said that the Ukrainian cruise missile targeted the bridge that shot it down, but it caused the bridge to actually be closed for sometime, causing traffic jams. And of course, as we know, in October of last year, it was hit by a truck carrying explosives which detonated on the bridge, causing huge damage on both the roadside and the rail side. It wasn't until February of this year that the rail side -- or that the roadside completely reopened and then the rail side was supposed to be completely fixed by June last month. Obviously, there's going to be issues now with the roadside. We don't know how long it might take the Russians to actually repair that bridge. Rosemary?",

Now, sanctions on Russia don't actually impact directly grain or fertilizer from Russia. But obviously, they impact the banking system. And so, the Russians seem to indicate that not enough has been done to help them on that. And so, a U.N. proposal suggested that the Russians could be reconnected through their agricultural bank in order to satisfy their concerns. But again, the ball is really in the Russians' court.
