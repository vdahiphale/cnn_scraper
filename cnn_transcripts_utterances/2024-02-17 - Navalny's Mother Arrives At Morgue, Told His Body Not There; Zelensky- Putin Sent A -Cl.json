Thank you so much for joining me, I'm Fredricka Whitfield in Washington, D.C.We're monitoring several new developments as world leaders convened for a major security conference in Munich, Germany. One of the leading topics, the death of Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny, and allegations that it came in the direction of Vladimir Putin. New today, Navalny's team says his mother and lawyer arrived at the morgue, where officials told them his body was being examined, only should be told his body was not there. Navalny's family saying, he was murdered in prison. And the global backlash surrounding his death is growing. Officials at the Munich conference are also discussing new revelations about Russia's attempts to create a nuclear space weapon. CNN is learning exclusive new details about its capabilities to cripple global communications. All of this as the wars in Israel and Ukraine raged on. Today, Vice President Kamala Harris met with Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. USA aid for Ukraine is on hold as House lawmakers go on a two-week recess without taking action on a supplemental security package. Today, the vice president said it's time to stop the political games in Washington. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Thanks so much.Ahead on CNN, a special encore of the Oscar winning CNN film that follows Alexey Navalny's life as an outspoken opposition leader and assassination target. \"NAVALNY\" airs tonight at 9:00 Eastern right here on CNN. All right, let's get more analysis now from someone who knows Putin's Russia very well. Bill Browder is the CEO of Hermitage Capital Management and head of the Global Magnitsky Justice Campaign, a campaign named for Browder's lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky, who died in a Russian prison after Browder had been forced out of the country. Good to see you. So, no one doubts, you know, Putin was behind Navalny's death. We're hearing it, you know, a real cacophony of voices. His family, an advocates want his body returned, especially to get to the bottom of the cause of death. Do you believe they will ever receive it? BILL BROWDER, CO-FOUNDER, HERMITAGE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT: I do not. They may receive the body, but what what's going to happen is the Russians have a script for playing out these cover ups. We saw it when they murdered Sergei Magnitsky, they then forced the family to bury the body because they said that if the family didn't bury the body immediately, it would decompose. So, the family wasn't entitled to their own autopsy. Same thing -- same types of things will happen here. And we're already starting to see it, where they first said, there was -- that no foul play, that he died of natural causes. Then, they want -- the family wants the body, and they say they don't know where the body is. When they finally find the body, there will be some more nonsense like this. These are the games that the Russians play in order to prevent people from learning the truth about what happened to Alexey Navalny.",

No matter what they did to him, they sent -- they poisoned him with Novichok, he survived.He then was brave enough to come back to Russia. And then, they put him in jail. And basically, put him in torturous conditions with solitary confinement. And whenever he comes out, he smiles. And so, he is a symbol of what it means to defy Putin. No matter what they throw at him, he still smiled, he still joked, he was still sarcastic, and he still ridiculed Putin. And so, that -- if Navalny could do that, then, other people could do that. And so, for Putin, who is like a mafia boss, he can't tolerate that kind of disrespect. And so, at a certain point, he decided to end it. And he ended it with the -- with the murder of Alexey Navalny. And there is no question in my mind that this was a murder.",

Instead, the explosion produces an electromagnetic pulse, an incredibly powerful wave of energy that essentially fries the insides of satellites and renders them ineffective. Now, crucially, this is not a system that's operational yet it's still in development. The White House and the Biden administration said that earlier this week, and President Joe Biden himself said on Friday that there is no threat or any sort of nuclear threat to the United States at this time. But this is clearly something the U.S. is watching. And here is why. Critical satellites for the U.S., including many military satellites, are built to defend against these sorts of electromagnetic pulse waves, and be able to withstand these waves. But an explosion like this in space, would affect a lot of commercial satellites and disrupt not only U.S. satellites, but Russian satellites, Chinese, and so many others. And those satellites are used for a number of different reasons, including communications, cell phone, services, Internet, and so much more. It would effectively disrupt or could disrupt all of that, if it were use. Not to mention it would be a violation of the Outer Space Treaty of the late 60s, which prohibits the use of nuclear weapons in space. And that's why the administration is watching this so carefully, because of the threat and the risks such an explosion would have. Russia would only likely use it the official say or the sources say as a last-ditch effort, because it's indiscriminate. It doesn't just affect U.S. satellites. It affects any satellite that's near it, and could potentially render a large number of satellites ineffective. Still, it is a capability that the U.S. is watching very closely as Russia presses forward with this program. Oren Liebermann, CNN, at the Pentagon.",

Old skulls under domes and butterfly collections and dusty stacks of books. It's old miniature photographs and tiny paper dresses. Growing up, my grandfather made doll houses for my sister and me. And we enjoyed filling them with all sorts of little treasures. And now I ship my miniatures all over the world to private collectors. And it's been in museums. I've had exhibits, window displays. I grew up loving ghost stories. In the case of the haunted doll house, I send these mysterious case files to people. It's almost like an escape room in a box, where you assemble the doll house and then you fill the rooms with tiny furniture. And each little piece in the box is a clue to the larger mystery. It tells a bigger story. Tiny Tombs is a self-guided walking tour. The Tiny Tombs are scattered all over New Orleans, in hotels and antique stores, all inspired by real New Orleans tombs and mausoleums. Each Tiny Tomb is dedicated to a different character.
