Plus, President Biden's son Hunter in court today on felony gun charges, the first child of a sitting U.S. President to stand trial. We'll look at the political ramifications. And Dr. Anthony Fauci back on Capitol Hill today, testifying in front of the House Subcommittee, fireworks expected, as Republicans pressed him on the nation's pandemic response. First up this hour from Mexico City to Mumbai (ph), key elections across the globe and some historic shifts coming along with those. Mexico electing its first female President Claudia Sheinbaum, according to Mexico's National Electoral Institute in South Africa. For the first time since the end of apartheid, 30 years ago, the ruling ANC party has now lost its majority, and a massive voter turnout in India, where a record 642 million people cast their ballots over the past six weeks. Let's begin first in Mexico, where Gustavo Valdes is in Mexico City. So, Gustavo, what have we been hearing from President-elect Sheinbaum in terms of what we can expect from her administration?",

And the question now is whether she'll be able to eventually step away from under his shadow, and really make the next six years of vision of her country for the future. And that's what the voters want to see. They told us that it was very nice to be able to say that now they're going to have a female President, but they want action beyond the gender of their political leader.",

So, she has an opportunity here to define herself.And then, very soon, we're going to see how she is going to deal with the United States. We're in the brink of a major announcement in the United States on immigration. Obviously, this is going to be a decision made by Lopez Obrador. But, this is going to be her first test. She is going to have to maneuver whatever Lopez Obrador agrees to in the next few days with the United States, and then see how she is going to continue that relationship with the Biden administration or whoever wins in November.",

Some of the pushback, though, is actually fairly similar to what we heard around Donald Trump's most recent trial, of course where he was convicted last week, that this is a charge or these charges, I should say, are rarely prosecuted, and that this feels overly political.

      "sentences": "So, that's a big blow. I mean, look, judges have a fair amount of discretion, and this judge has determined that the addiction issue, as it relates to determining whether he knew he was -- had an addiction or not, is not up for expert opinion. And perhaps the defense will try in other ways to get it in, whether it is through his family members who were testifying and relating the state of mind he was in at the time, what drugs he was using, what he was doing, what he was about, how his behavior was.But, I disagree with the judge in terms of not allowing it in. You are allowed, once you have an expert, to establish your defenses. And if the prosecution wants to cross-examine your expert with respect to raising issues that rely upon the expert's credibility, the expert perhaps not having evaluated him at that particular time, that's fine. But, to particularly exclude it and say, hey, there is nothing to see here, I think it is relevant. You're an addict. How do addicts behave? How do they conform? How do they not conform? How do they go about their daily activities in life? How do they function? What are the differences, if any, with respect to people who are not addicted? All that is fair game. And so, I think you want jurists on that jury, as it's being selected now, who might have some empathy, some sympathy, some relatability, to someone in the family, a friend, someone else they knew who was going through it so that they can know this is how addicts behave. And I think it's a shame that the judge did not permit it, saying it's not relevant. It's not probative to the issues here. It is. And otherwise, it would create confusion. I don't think it creates any confusion. I think it creates clarity. But, judges rule every day and every night. Sometimes, I agree with their ruling. Sometimes, I don't. But, we know in our system. We have to live by them. And the defense is going to have to operate in the confines of not having the ability to call that expert, Erica.",

He testified over two days, for about 14 hours. So, many of the questions that they have in public today likely have already been answered behind closed doors. They did release that transcript on Friday.But, what Republicans are trying to show today is that Fauci was not completely honest or forthcoming about the origins of the coronavirus in the beginning of the pandemic. What Democrats are arguing is that this was an ongoing crisis back in 2020 that Fauci was doing everything that he could and all that was scientifically and readily available at the time to stop the spread of the pandemic and to understand the root cause of that pandemic. But, it took time to uncover. Now, you're going to get caught up in some of that potential nuance today in the hearing, but we can also expect that there is fireworks that are going to occur because of just the political nature of the coronavirus in the years after the pandemic. Now, as Democrats are asking Fauci questions, many of them are applauding his efforts to get the vaccine finalized, that that was something that he ushered through, something that they say saved lives. Meanwhile, on the Republican side, they continue to question him about the origins of COVID. And like you noted, they have questions about whether or not he ever used his personal email to conduct official business. Now, Fauci defended himself against those accusations, saying in his opening statement, that to the best of his knowledge, he never used his personal email address to conduct official business. Here he was on other issues, defending himself. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, FORMER DIRECTOR, NATL.

And in some cases, the rain was obviously too much more than Kenya has seen in some time.

He laid out this proposal, and he very much framed it as a way to end the war. And he did so quite intentionally, not only as a signal to Hamas and to the rest of the world, but also what he was aiming to do, was to ensure that this Israeli government stands by this proposal, which they came up with themselves, and also to try and head off some of the anticipated criticism from these right-wing members, who are now threatening to leave the government should this deal actually go through. And so, the Israeli Prime Minister over the last few days has been focusing on trying to reframe this Israeli proposal, insisting that Israel has not agreed to and will not agree to upfront a permanent ceasefire to this conflict. And indeed in this Israeli proposal, as President Biden himself described it, it is only in the first phase of this agreement that these two sides would actually negotiate getting to a permanent ceasefire in the second phase of this deal. And that is the nuance that the Israeli Prime Minister is focusing on at the moment, trying to convince these right-wing ministers that he is not agreeing to end the war, and that it will be subject to further negotiations with Hamas. Now, at the same time, the Israeli Prime Minister is trying to have his cake and eat it too. He is talking about the fact that the Israeli -- that the government is not yet committed to an end to the war, that it will still focus on destroying Hamas. But, ultimately, that is something that remains to be negotiated.",

The Israeli Prime Minister, of course, is no stranger to that pressure. And the question is, what does he view as most important? Does he view the survival of his government as most important, or does he view getting this deal done as the priority? And that still remains to be seen.But, there is a world in which he won't have to make that decision, of course, and that is if Hamas, which is currently reviewing this latest proposal but has yet to actually provide its response, if Hamas rejects this proposal, then there is no decision for the Israeli Prime Minister to make.

Oh, there we go. Now, we got the right one. There we go. Very little change. And what we see is Joe Biden up by two points. Compare that to where we were pre- conviction in New York, when it was a tie. That type of movement is well within the margin of error. In both particular cases, I think the way you might want to talk about it is no clear leader.Of course, the one thing I will point out, Erica, is if we start seeing this two-point movement across not just one poll, but multiple polls, that could be very interesting because the race is so close that even the slightest bit of movement in a race that really hasn't moved at all would in the grand scheme be tremendous movement, especially when you funnel it down to the swing states like Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania.",

And the majority of Americans said that, in fact, he should be found guilty. 56 percent of Americans said they thought Trump was guilty before the trial. After the verdict came down, well, look at that, 57 percent, which is basically the same as 56 percent, thought that the jury made the right verdict.And applying this forward with all these different legal troubles that Trump has going forward, the polling is probably not going to shift that much, the idea that Americans, the few Americans who are undecided or that finely tuned into this stuff, is just not true. The real people who are tuned in to this are the people on the very far left and those on the very far right. The Republican base, the Democratic base, those folks have already made up their mind. And yeah, Trump might be able to raise a ton of money going forward if he is found guilty, and then these other trials, but the fact is, when it comes to that middle, the electorate, the ones that truly matter, nah, they're not going to probably change their mind based upon any of these potential verdicts down the road.",
