You are going to see some of the biggest - probably some of the biggest disruptions of what the FCC has done in decades.EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER: This is a person who - Donald Trump likes to put himself forward as someone who has no ties to anybody. But this is somebody who, obviously, has a lot of business interests that are enmeshed in other things that are going on with Elon Musk. You see, for Musk, that part of what was going on perhaps was deep commitment to the Trump ideology. But there's also a big business interest here for Elon Musk.

But too often we have been effectively caricatured as coastal elitists. That is a real problem. It started out really among white working-class voters departing us in big numbers. And now we've seen that among Latino, African American and Asian American working-class voters as well, in increasing numbers. So, I think it is a real challenge as a party that we have to be serious about addressing, otherwise, and rather than getting into recriminations about 2024, I'm much more concerned about 2026 and 2028 and fixing this problem.

MCKINNON: Well, Kasie, let me go big picture on the appointments, because that's sort of the discussion of the - of the hour and the day and the week. You talk about Trumps mandate to govern. It's really a mandate for chaos and disruption. I'm struck by how different this feels than eight years ago. I was at the - at the Hilton in New York election night, and I can tell you for sure that Donald Trump was the most surprised person in that room. He was sort of an accidental president in many ways and went into the administration that way. This is different this time. And I'm really - and it's really interesting to me the extent to which in MAGA world the point is to blow things up, right? And so a lot of these appointments, the chaos is the point. And the more chaos there is, the more that Trump's going to double down on all of them. And so, what he wants from these people is disruption. He wants chaos. He wants controversy. And so, that, to him, is fealty to him. And the more chaos the better. And it's just - it's going to be a very interesting time in government because in pure MAGA world the - and I spent a lot of time with Matt Gaetz, and I can tell you, when he went to Washington, he didn't go to the office, he didn't go to meetings, he just went on TV to blow things up. Ask Kevin McCarthy about that. And so, in a lot - in most of these agencies, those people are going in, not to govern, but to really blow things up. And, for example, the Department of Education, to eliminate it entirely. So, it's going to be interesting to see, once these people get in place, and most of them will, their mandate is to - is not to make things better, but to dismantle them. So, it'll be interesting when we - when and if - I hope to God we don't have another Covid crisis - people turn to government and say, oh, wait, government's supposed to do something and now it can't.",
