Kevin McCarthy is no longer the House speaker, but they forgot to figure out what happens now.Plus, the race is on. Jim Jordan says, he's running for speaker. Others are already doing temperature checks with members. I'll talk to two Republican Congressmen and ask who they would back. That'll be in minutes. And a warning. Donald Trump is instructed by a judge to stay silent and say nothing about that judges' staff after the former president post and then delete an attack on a judicial clerk. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. Up first, speaker for higher. The Republican rebels may have succeeded in kicking Kevin McCarthy to the curb. A very real question now is who can lead an unruly chaotic Republican conference, that puts its money where its motion to vacate is. This morning, a little Washington humor at the former speaker's expense. You can apply now on the job site daybook for Kevin McCarthy's old job. The title and salary are pretty good, but it's fair to say whoever gets the gig is walking into a toxic workplace. These are eight of your potential co-workers, the insurgents who history will record as helping engineer McCarthy's ouster and siding with Democrats to do so. McCarthy is now the third shortest serving speaker to ever hold the gavel. And now former speaker delivered a late-night invective, aimed squarely at those rebels. McCarthy says it's their turn to feel the heat. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): One thing I do know, this country is too great for small visions of those eight. Well, you know, one of the things when I was running for speaker, I said I couldn't get involved in primaries. But I told the conference, I'm a free agent now. I think I'm pretty good at electing people. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Talking about his pitch to become speaker, trying to say that he wants to unite the republican conference but in a very significant comment that he just made to me.I asked him about, if he speaker, would he move forward with the new aid package for Ukraine. And he said, \"I am against that.\" That is further than Kevin McCarthy went as speaker of the House. Even though McCarthy put the brakes on moving forward and aid package, he suggested he can move forward with one if it was tied to the issue of border security. But the next speaker will have a huge say in the agenda and as well as key issues like moving forward on aid to Ukraine. Now he did say that perhaps if the Senate were to send something over, they would consider it at that point, but he said Ukraine is not a priority for the American people. One of the many things that he is saying behind closed doors as he tries to get the support to become speaker. Now he's going to take some time for the House Republicans to hash out who they want to become speaker. There are other candidates as well. Steve Scalise, the number two Republican right now plans to run for speaker. He also is meeting with his Texas delegation. And I also caught up with Kevin Hern, who's a member -- who's a chairman of that largest Republican group with a conservative group, within the larger House GOP conference. He is open to the idea of running for speaker as well as caught up to both Jordan and Hern earlier, and they both made their pitch about why they think they could be the next speaker.

I think what I'm listening from people is they want a different face. They want somebody to put policies over personalities.

But make no mistake about it this historic vote yesterday to oust Kevin McCarthy. He is completely scrambled the House GOP leadership.A number of members looking to get into different spots within the leadership. And it's not just a game of musical chairs. This is so significant because it determines the party's agenda, their strategy, their tactics, and ultimately determines the policy that affects the lives of people here in the United States and around the world. So, these key decisions will be made, Dana, by next week as the House Republicans expect next week to nominate their candidate for speaker and then that person has to be elected to be the speaker of the House, in the full House. And that is going to be no easy task, because any four or five Republicans could defect and scuttle the plans for a Republican speaker, which is why these conversations are happening now for these potential candidates to get some support.",

So, get back to us if you get any new information. And here with me to share their reporting, CNN's Kasie Hunt, Seung Min Kim of the Associated Press, CNN's Eva McKend and CNN's Jeff Zeleny. I feel like we never left the studio. It was different. Yes, exactly. We all just saw each other.Let's just start with that reporting from Manu. Jim Jordan is obviously being very aggressive, suddenly about trying to get the votes to be speaker. And the fact that we're going to talk a little bit more in the next segment about Ukraine and what they're saying over at the White House. But the fact that he believes that this is a good campaign platform, if you will, to say, I'm against Ukraine funding. What does that tell us?",

But, you know, I was just talking with another Congressman Kelly Armstrong, who was actually a strong supporter of Kevin McCarthy, who had reservations about Ukraine funding.I mean, I think this has really become something that's coming from, I would say, I mean, Jeff, I think you're out on the trail more than I am talking to what I would call a MAGA base. But I think these members really -- there are some serious bottom-up pressure on them right now that they are picking up. And so, I think Jordan is kind of reflecting that and kind of a broader -- in kind of a broader sense. And, you know, in terms of his bid for speaker, but have you ever seen Jim Jordan do anything in a manner that was not aggressive, right? BASH: OK, fair. I just, nope. I also, I'm just remembering the days of standing in the hallway with you guys back when he was making John Viener's life a living, you know what, and he was flame thrower. And imagining him in the position where his life would be made, you know, what, and not the flame thrower, but the flame target, if you will, is it's hard to say but, you know, it's going forward. And as we talk more about that. Jeff, I want to bring you in an answer to Kasie's question. He's not the only one running for a speaker. Patrick McHenry is the current sort of temporary speaker, if you will. Steve Scalise is the number two, who is also considering running. Tom Emmer is the whip who is also considering running. Jim Jordan is running, and then Kevin Hern. You just heard the, Manu talked about him. He's a conservative. He is the leader of what's known as the Republican Study Committee, which used to be Freedom Caucus, like the most conservative House Republicans.",

They can rely on small dollar donors.So, the threats from the establishment really ring hollow.

But I will also point out that a lot of this, you know, some of the rationale for oust seeing McCarthy a speaker, obviously stemmed from the whole fight over the budget deal, keeping the government open. And theoretically, House Republicans wanted to spend the next, you know, 40 some odd days working on actual appropriation bills, doing the work of the people, try to get the government funded, even if those bills were kind of DOA in the Senate.And now all that oxygen is going to be consumed by trying to figure out who the next speaker of the House is, which is why I was actually kind of surprised that they weren't just going to kind of stay in town for the next, you know, three days or so to try to figure this out before next Wednesday. But that is the path that they are doing right now. And I'm also surprised that we don't see and speaking of retribution, why we haven't yet seen and expulsion resolution for Matt Gaetz yet, but maybe we'll see that soon.",

But the president in his official capacity is not exactly taking a victory lap. Aides are trying to project an image of calm and business as usual for Biden.And yesterday the White House released a statement immediately after or in the short aftermath after the House voted to oust McCarthy a speaker that said this. President Biden has demonstrated that he is always eager to work with both parties in Congress in good faith on behalf of the American people. Because the urgent challenges facing our nation will not wait, he hopes the House will quickly elect a speaker, urging Congress to get back to the business of governing especially with the clock ticking on funding the government in the next month and a half or so. To that end, President Biden is going to be giving a speech today on student loans and forgiveness plans. And the administration is still working behind the scenes to try to shore up support for Ukraine aid. Yesterday, John Kirby, the spokesman for the National Security Council said that the administration is confident that the vast majority of Republicans do support that aid that being House leadership and the chairs of the relevant national security committees, but he would not say how the administration viewed the potential speaker race and would not even address the speaker in the past tense yesterday.

So, look, he was trying throughout the news conference last night to project optimism and be happy warrior, but he was deeply angry and wounded. And his relationship with Nancy Pelosi is accept -- I mean, essentially non-existent.But I think the bigger picture here is if this next year and two months is supposed to be a referendum or a choice for the White House and for Republicans and Democrats.

When it comes to that another thing that happened just barely 90 minutes after the McCarthy was kicked out of the speaker's chair. The Pelosi office got an email from the temporary speaker, Patrick McHenry's office. This is at 6:11 pm last night, going to reassign h-132 for speaker office use.

But I think it really goes to show you just the level of personal animosity. And I guess, from, yes, between -- I mean, honestly, I think probably between McCarthy and Pelosi. You know, McHenry is an interesting figure and all this. And I think we're still kind of getting to the bottom of exactly where this request came from.
