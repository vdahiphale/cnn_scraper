This is after he faced a number of charges in the state of Georgia in a widespread racketeering case. The Fulton County DA gave Donald Trump and his 18 co-defendants until noon on Friday, August 25th, to turn themselves in. The U.S. Secret Service has already been around the Fulton County Jail, scoping out the situation. This is what we would expect. You don't want to take someone like the former president to this jail for processing without understanding the layout, how to get him in and out. But a couple steps will need to happen before he surrenders. His attorneys need to work with the DA to figure out any potential bond or conditions of his release. We expect those conversations to continue into early next week. When Trump shows up, he wants the paperwork about his bond so he can be in and out as quickly as possible. And speaking to attorneys, it can take normal defendants hours to get through the booking process at the jail. For a VIP, he could be in and out rather quickly -- Sara Murray, CNN, Washington.
