One thing with canines is we don't want to injure scents.I know I can't give you all of the details of the investigation but I can assure you that there was a lot of teams that searched the area. On top of -- I will add one thing -- on top of it being an industrial park, numerous different businesses, obviously there is one business that we're interested in, and our tactical teams did clear that building, I mean recycling. And as we pointed out, there was an open door that was found that one of my officers found on the overnights again, and we cleared the building again with several agencies. But I'll just point out this. While this is all going on, and you have to also understand, everything we do is a methodical approach and be safe and make sure our officers are safe. And we were fielding hundreds of calls at our call center and there was also the tip line that I heard today, how many calls came in there. As you can imagine, it was an astronomical amount of resources being used across our community, not everybody is in marked police cars, and not everybody is in full uniform, but there was a lot of resources from across New England that was here, including helicopters, moments after I arrived on the scene, that car was located. So we used every resource that was available, and we, you know, I think it was this gentleman down here, asked me, you know how long are you going to search for, and you expect to find him. Every officer there wasn't going home until we found the individual. (INAUDIBLE)",

      "sentences": "Yes, Fred, a lot of hard-earned relief, and congratulations to them and to their talent for getting to this point.I think first, it's important to note that like, they all committed in a massive effort to getting this done, and they ultimately found the shooter. And so this is a good news story. But it is also important to ask questions about how the search was taking place, because not because there is someone at fault here, or trying to point the finger at somebody, that is not the case. But it is really important, not just for the town of Lewiston, or Lisbon, or the state of Maine but for all police agencies to learn from each one of these situations, to try to do better the next time because it's going to happen again. And so I think this -- the facts and the time line around the search are really interesting. If you go back to Wednesday night, we know where the vehicle was discovered and that is at the boat launch which is about one mile north/northwest of where the body was found. At that site, there is access to the river, and there's access to the walking path. And so because that was the -- that's where the trail went cold, so to speak. I think there are legitimate questions for law enforcement to ask, like did we focus enough resources on that site and everything branching out from it, the assumption that our person might be -- our subject might be somewhere in that area. It turns out he was. In all likelihood he walked the mile south to an area that he knows well, the property of the recycling center, and then secreted himself inside the back of a box trailer. So I think there are good questions to think about and for officials to answer about that. Now the area we found him was searched three times but the actual parking lot with all of these 50 or 60 trailers was not searched until the owner of the property brought that location to the attention of law enforcement, and then went back and then looked. And to be clear, this is not easy. Every one of those trailers has -- you have to assume that there is a heavily armed murderer inside that trailer who may be waiting for the police response. But nevertheless, that is the kind of searching that you have to do in this situation.",

And thank God they were, that's what they were asked to do.So you can't -- you can't overstate the intensity and the chaos of trying to run a situation like this. I remember this from the day we spent searching for the Boston bombers, after the bombing, the numbers of leads that we ran, the numbers of sightings of the bombers, which, of course, turned out not to be them. It is very hard to cover all of those things, which you have to do, but to also focus on your search in a very methodical and tactical way. (CROSSTALKING)",

And then he said to them, well, did you search this overflow area. And they didn't.Though they were in this area, they never went to the overflow area. And I think there are legitimate questions about whether or not the law enforcement folks here flooded enough resources into that area. Because I can tell you, when we arrived in Lisbon, just the morning after the shooting, early in the morning, 5:00 -- 6:00 a.m., we were on the scene, we did not see a lot of law enforcement officials on scene there, searching. And we were asking questions. We mostly saw the local police department, which is a 17-person police department, doing the searches. We were with them as they were doing some of these searches. And then the next day, on Thursday, we actually saw law enforcement officials in the area of this recycling plant, conducting these searches, but they were on the perimeter, and they told us that the state police asked them to close up the area, because there was potentially something going on down the street that is connected to the suspect. But we did not see resources that you would normally see in such a widespread search. It wasn't until yesterday that we started seeing more resources flood in to the area. We saw state police, we saw U.S. Marshals, ATF, other law enforcement officials, suited up, going through the woods, going through businesses. And then again, now as we know, that is when this discovery was made, and it was only based on the call from the business owner. So there are legitimate questions. And we tried to ask about that. But I don't think at this point law enforcement officials are going to say yes, maybe we should have been more thorough, I think it is certainly something they are going to look at. But the importance of this, and the reason why these questions should be raised, of course, is because of the effect that this had on this community. And then in the end, of course, we cannot forget the victims here, and sort of the effect all of this has had on the people living here in Lewiston, who have been dealing with this fear of this killer being on the loose, and have not been able to grieve. But now that's the time for them to do that. There's going to be a vigil here tomorrow and more in the days to come so that these families and the people of this community can get together and grieve and mourn the folks that were lost.",

All right. Now to our other breaking story overseas. The escalating situation in Israel's war with Hamas. The IDF now says it has soldiers inside of Gaza entering the enclave during the cover of night. The scope of current activities remains unclear, but it does not appear yet to be the expected major offensive deep into the Hamas- controlled territory.

We have also been hearing machine gunfire and small arms fire from our position, which indicates that there is still very much active fighting between Israeli forces and Hamas militants inside the Gaza Strip. And that is very different, of course, from what we have seen over these last several days, where the IDF did conduct some targeted raids, as they called them, inside of Gaza, but the next morning, they announced that those troops, those tanks, that had gone into Gaza, had since returned across the border back on to Israeli territory. That has not happened in this case. And so even as we wait to find out whether or not this is indeed that official ground invasion, right now, the IDF simply saying it has expanded ground operations.

But I don't know the particular tactic, and what will be used on the different locations, that's something that the Israelis of course will have thought through. They probably are as well-equipped and trained for this sort of fighting as anybody. But it does, it does beg the question, Sara, how -- what is the mission for the Israeli Defense Force? You know, we've heard from the government, going in there to destroy Hamas, to make sure that Hamas can never operate from Gaza again. I don't think that this is a feasible end-state unless Israel is willing to commit the resources to isolate Hamas from any external support, to eliminate or eradicate the root cause for Hamas, why is there a Hamas, and also, to invest the resources necessary to occupy Gaza for as long as it is necessary to destroy Hamas. So if I'm the commander or if I'm a colonel there, I'm very concerned about what is the end state that I have to accomplish. I don't think destroying Hamas is feasible on its face.",

Other parts of the country close to the border tend to get rocket attacks every now and then, but it is rare to see them in Tel Aviv, though we've been seeing them ever since the war began here. Now, Israel is also stepping up its ground operations in Gaza. The families of the Israeli hostages that are being held by Hamas are demanding answers, and a face-to-face meeting with their leaders. They want to know how the military campaign may impact the lives of their loved ones, who are likely in tunnels, underground, those tunnels built by Hamas and Gaza. In a just-released statement, those family members say, we expect, quote, \"the prime minister and the defense minister to meet with us today, look us in the eye, and give a clear answer to the question. Does the escalation of the military activity in Gaza endanger the well-being of the 229 hostages? We are tired of slogans, our loved ones' time is running out.

Certainly officials say that this is an hour-by-hour effort, and it is hard to say how this effort will be affected by this ground invasion beyond saying certainly that it will be complicated by it.Because you will remember, Sara, the U.S. had encouraged Israel to delay a ground invasion, as these negotiations over the hostages' release were progressing. And yesterday it did seem like those talks were intensifying, brokered by the government of Qatar to potentially secure the release of a large number of these hostages. But of course, we haven't seen that yet, and this increased bombardment, the incursion of Israeli troops into Gaza will certainly complicate that. And that is one of the reasons that you have heard President Biden over the last several days really start to intensify his calls for what he calls a humanitarian pause. Some sort of delay or a pause in the bombing to hopefully get these hostages out. Now the other reason that the U.S. is calling for a pause is to get aid into Gaza. That is something that you've heard officials -- again talk more and more vocally about over the last several days. Things like water, food, medicine, fuel -- things that are in desperate need in Gaza for citizens who are becoming more desperate, as this escalation continues. Now, the U.S. of course has been in close consultation with Israel over the last two weeks, as it plans its response to the terror attacks. What you heard in public is President Biden certainly very staunchly support Israel in its right to defend itself. But behind the scenes, these conversations have been quite intensive. The U.S. asking what it calls tough questions of Israel, about its planning, about its intentions for Gaza, as this proceeds and potentially what happens after a ground invasion. And in fact, there had been a three-star marine general on the ground there in Israel consulting with the Israelis as they plan this response, the U.S. encouraging sort of a more targeted effort, not something that would potentially weigh down the Israelis on the ground there, for the duration.

SEAL: I have mixed emotions about that, just because first and foremost I wanted him to be found, apprehended. I wanted to ask questions that will not be answered. Why did you do this, what was the motive, why would you hurt so many families? 18 people lost their lived, people were injured. People who escaped and injured are traumatized forever. It's horrific. I would want answers from him. But at the same time it's important that he was found and he's gone. And that's good, and you know, that we don't have to go through anymore suffering with the court process and, you know, this could be a multi-year process to go through that legal endeavor and really having to suffer through the court process is a whole other level. I'm glad that that part of this is closed and we can start the healing for myself as well as for the other families.",

He was always involved chatting at home, taking them on outings, anything they needed. He was always supportive and always around.He was a fantastic husband. We were together over 20 years. I've known him since preschool. And he was a fierce advocate of the deaf community, fostering opportunities for deaf and hard of hearing children, for access to interpreters and their educational environment as well as other services. He actually established a camp for deaf and hard-of-hearing kids called Camp Dirigo Experience within the country camp (ph). And he was incredibly eager to get that up. He was so passionate about it. And he loved his deaf friends, constantly getting together, you know, going on outings, ATV rides, snowmobiles, camping, always gathering, messing around, joking around, you know, sitting by the fire, playing cards, what have you. And he cherished his family, not just me and his children, but his extended family -- brothers, sisters, grandparents. And yes, he was just a phenomenal person. He was a skilled interpreter. Most of the state recognized him, you know. They saw him regularly on the interpreting for Dr. Shaw (ph) or the governor of Maine. And so folks who knew him were incredibly lucky.",
