We saw last night, the president delivering these opening remarks and really trying to show this public image of the statesman and talking about these themes that are so central to his foreign policy, about protecting democracy all across the world, and how he believes that the U.S. has really a big role to play in leading those efforts.But I can tell you again, his audience this week is not just Americans here at home, but world leaders, world diplomats, many of whom are actually gathered here at this convention center in Washington, D.C., and the questions that many of them are wondering about are the very same questions that so many Americans have wondered about ever since that debate. They're wondering about the president's health, they are wondering about his fitness to serve including for a second term and underlying all of that, of course, is the question of does all of this lead to Donald Trump returning to the White House for a second term?

It was a terrible interview. He did a terrible job articulating why he is in the race, what happened at the debate, and why he is the person to beat Trump. He is doing a terrible job.

Thank you both for being here.Jon Favreau, I'm going to start with you because, first of all, I did listen to \"Hacks On Tap,\" so I'll get to that in a second. But, I listened to the entire episode. I think you dropped it yesterday. I mean, it gave me so much anxiety. I could feel the frustration coming through the car speakers as I was listening to it and then my ear buds. And so, the question is -- that I have for you is, I'm putting myself in the position of the Biden campaign right now, of the White House, and that is, you guys are so angry and you guys are so upset. Are you hurting more than helping by saying so much about what you're saying publicly? JON FAVREAU, CO-HOST, \"POD SAVE AMERICA\": No. I think what is hurting Joe Biden right now is not only the debate performance, but the response to the debate performance, in that he has been unable to articulate a coherent and compelling argument against Donald Trump, who I believe represents an existential threat to our democracy. And the debate did not -- voters had concerns about Joe Biden's age and fitness for the job long before the debate, an overwhelming majority of voters did and the debate amplified those concerns in a way that was very visceral for voters to see. And so, it is like it really doesn't matter what I think, but I hope that the Biden campaign and that President Biden will just like look at the -- listen to the voters, right? And the overwhelming majority of whom do not like Donald Trump, do not think Donald Trump is honest, but have had concerns for a couple of years now that Joe Biden is not fit for another four years because of his age and a majority of voters didn't have that concern in 2020.",

Jon, you and -- well, David, I think has gone a little bit further in saying effectively that President Biden should step aside, correct me if I am mischaracterizing your position, David.But Jon, do you think it would help at this point for people like you and elected officials who have microphones and megaphones to be more specific publicly, or is it better to continue to press this case privately with the president?",

But I do think the reason that I keep talking about it, the reason that a lot of people keep talking about it is because President Biden and his advisers are having these conversations with elected officials.The president does respect Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, all of these people around him that he served with for years and his advisers as well. And I do think that if they all gave him an honest accounting of what the numbers are right now and what voters' concerns are, then I still believe that Joe Biden would make, what I think would be, a very courageous honorable decision to say, I want to finish out my job as president here in the next couple of months, but I want to pass the torch to the next generation.",

You heard Michael Bennet on with Kaitlan last night saying that it is not just the presidency at stake, House and Senate Democrats are going to get wiped out. You've worked in the White House. You were both in the White House when there was -- I don't know about a wipe out, but it was -- I'll quote your former boss, he got shellacked -- Democrats got shellacked.

I think the same is true of Senator Rosen in Nevada, you know, Bob Casey in Pennsylvania running well ahead of him. But you know, the history -- there is -- there are very few cases of Senators in the last several cycles and presidential cycles who win when their presidential candidate is losing.And so, I think there is real fear, not just for the Senators, but for representatives in these swing districts, frontline districts, and a lot of Democrats think the House may be the last line of defense if Trump wins the election.
