The case is suddenly picking up speed and fast, as Trump gets scolded by the judge for intimidating a juror. The court sketch artist who was with Trump all day is OUTFRONT. Plus, Biden hits the campaign trail in a big way, slamming Trump's courtroom cameos, as our Harry Enten breaks down the numbers showing where Biden is gaining ground tonight. And this may surprise you. And, payback. CNN learning Israel is now considering a strike inside Iran. The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas- Greenfield, responds. Let's go OUTFRONT.

The first seven jurors who will be deciding Trump's fate have now been sworn in for Trump's New York criminal trial. There were zero jurors this morning, seven tonight. That is, you know, zero to seven and point two. I mean, the case is accelerating fast. Jury selection is now more than a third done, and the judge in the case told those who have been sworn in to be ready to go on Monday. Now, excuse me. That is week sooner than most experts had expected. So let's just go through what we know now about the first juror seated for Trump's historic trial. The first juror will be the foreperson. He's originally from Ireland, reads \"The New York Times\", \"The Daily Mail\", watches Fox and MSNBC. The second juror is a woman, an oncology nurse, reads \"The New York Times\" and watches CNN. The third juror is a corporate lawyer originally from Oregon. He is not married and has no children. He gets his news from \"The New York Times\", \"The Wall Street Journal\", and Google. The fourth juror was identified as a Puerto Rican man with an IT business, and he told the court that Trump, quote, makes things interesting. He says he has no strong feelings about politics. The fifth juror is a black woman who was an English teacher. She told the court she is not a political person and really doesn't care for the news. And the sixth is a software engineer who recently graduated college. She said she gets her news from \"The New York Times\", Google, Facebook, and TikTok. And number seven, a lawyer originally from North Carolina who told the judge he has quote, political views as to the Trumps presidency and thinks that there were policies he disagreed with. Now, this is the seven we've got. This is what both sides with everything have agreed to. So that gives you a portrait of who's in that room. When these jurors walked to the jury box, some did appear under stress. Juror three biting his lipped, or six kept her eyes on the ground. Trump did react during the juror questioning. We understand from our reporting in the room, the judge actually raised this voice after he heard Trump muttering and the judge said, Merchan, I wont tolerate that. I will not have any jurors intimidated in this courtroom. And just moments ago, Trump left. He spoke out to the cameras and lashed out at the judge. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT &amp; 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We are going to continue our fight against this, judge. We think he's totally conflicted. He's a conflicted judge, as you know, over an appeal. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

This comes as CNN is learning, Israel is weighing whether to launch what is being described as an attack inside Iran. That's according to U.S. intelligence.Details at this hour though, are sparse. A senior Biden administration official says, quote, we would hope that the Israelis would give us some warning. Any additional move now opens up a series of other possibilities, some of which are quite frightening. OUTFRONT now, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas- Greenfield, and she joins me now tonight for this morning in her case from Seoul, South Korea, where she has just returned from the DMZ, a rare visit for a U.S. official to obviously one of the world's most heavily armed borders between North and South Korea. Ambassador Greenfield, I want to ask you in crucial questions about that in a moment. First though, Israel's response to Iran is expected at any time. And one possibility I mentioned is a strike being described as a limited strike, unclear what that means, but on Iranian soil. Does the United States support Israel striking inside Iran? LINDA THOMAS-GREENFIELD, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS: Look, I can't comment on what Israel's plans are. I will say, Erin, that we have been in close contact with the Israelis. We are encouraging de- escalation, but we absolutely support Israel's right to defend itself from this brutal attack on its own territory that we all witnessed at over the weekend.",

I will be interviewing the foreign minister on this program on Thursday, Ambassador. Do you have a message for him? THOMAS-GREENFIELD: Look, he knows what are messages are. We gave him a very strong message in the Security Council on Sunday. We condemned their horrific attack on Israel and we made very, very clear that what they were doing went against all of the Security Council resolutions in terms of they're using the types of missiles that they were -- they were using. So I don't have a direct message from him that he has not already heard from the U.S. government.",

THOMAS-GREENFIELD: We certainly have a good picture. I don't know if we have a full picture. We were very disappointed when the Russians vetoed the 1718 panel of experts resolution that allows for reporting on their capabilities. And we will look for other ways to continue that reporting. But they continue over and over to break numerous Security Council resolutions that they are not being helpfully accountable for because the Russians and the Chinese provide cover for them in the Security Council.",

Johnson, though, has been defiant, even as he recognizes the embattled role that he finds himself in. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP.
