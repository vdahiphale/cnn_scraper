And they have yet to respond to the fact that it was confirmed that he was killed in that crash.All we know at this point is that President Biden had been briefed on the reports of the crash yesterday afternoon as he was traveling from Atlanta to Detroit. But beyond that, the U.S., the White House, the State Department hasn't put out any type of comments, but they have been watching all of these reports incredibly closely and likely will be very careful in the type of language they will use. One thing that the White House and U.S. officials will also be watching closely is what will happen now. What - who might emerge as his successor at a time when the region has been destabilized amid that conflict between Israel and Hamas. Now, the U.S. has no diplomatic relations with Iran, but there have been private backchannel talks in the - in the past. There have been indirect talks when it related to trying to revive the nuclear deal between the U.S. and Iran. There have been backchannel talks in regards to some of the Iranian-backed proxies that have destabilized parts of the region. But we will be waiting to see what exactly the White House has to say going forward. And they will be keeping a very close eye on who might be announced as Raisi's successor in the coming days, weeks, whenever that might happen.",

So, for whatever that is worth. Arlette, thanks very much for that report. I really appreciate it. All right, now this. Today, Michael Cohen returns to the witness stand for more cross-examination in Donald Trump's criminal hush money trial. Last week the defense hammered Cohen over inconsistencies in his testimony, but courtroom theatrical may have overshadowed what our next guest insists is the smoking gun. Here you can see two documents, including handwritten notes, outlining money that Trump owed Cohen. Cohen says part of that payment is reimbursement for the hush money payment to Stormy Daniels. And joining us now is Cohen's former attorney, Lanny Davis, who sits with our panel. Lanny, good morning. Wonderful to have you here. LANNY DAVIS, MICHAEL COHEN'S FORMER ATTORNEY: Good morning.",

As you know, and I put it to him, there was a letter signed to the ICC - when these reports first started to surface weeks ago by several Republican senators, who essentially told the ICC and Karim Khan personally, and I'm paraphrasing again, if you go ahead with this, we will sanction you. We will make sure that none of this can be carried out. And he took it as a threat to the mission and to the mandate. That's one issue. But he said, nonetheless, we cannot be bound by those kinds of political statements. We are - we have an international mandate that means when whatever country it be, whether it's, you know, against Putin in Russia, whether it's in many of the other countries that they look at, this is about evidence, this is about applying the law equally.Now, in terms of travel, as you know, and we can use Putin as the example, because he, as well as his hunch woman, were indicted months ago by the ICC in relation principally to the illegal abduction of Ukrainian children. Now, Putin, also, Russia is not a member of the ICC. Nonetheless, he, for instance, chose not to travel to a big meeting in South Africa in the last few months because it might have been the case that he might have been arrested because South Africa is party to the ICC. So, the individuals could travel in terms of places where the ICC does not have jurisdiction, but it would probably not be wise, according to the ICC, for them to travel places where the ICC does have jurisdiction. And some analysts have also said that this comes at a - I mean predicting that something like this might happen at some point. It comes at a time when this war is in a really, you know, very, very heightened stage, when there's a potential, you know, attack further invasion into Rafah while the hostages, the Israeli hostages, still have not been released, and for that they have indicted Hamas on the hostages as well.

What impact does this have in terms of -- I mean it strikes me that it might actually strengthen Netanyahu's hand inside Israel. What's your view of how we should be interpreting that?",

A very right-wing coalition that Netanyahu is reliant on very right-wing parties that are also forcing his hand.But just domestically, politically, when the prime minister is perceived as under attack from the outside, it's going to be very difficult for - for that to kind of - that - that fracturing of the cabinet from Gallant's point of view to take place.",

Look, we were just seeing a bit of a -- a tipping point now in Israeli politics where the senior leaders of the war cabinet were opposing Prime Minister Netanyahu's recent decisions related to a ceasefire for a hostage deal. His day after planning. They're going to now pull back because they're going to be seen as essentially throwing Netanyahu to the wolves. And they themselves can end up following him there. And I think it makes it harder now for them to raise significant opposition domestically and Prime Minister Netanyahu, to Stephen's point, look, he's playing to his right-wing base. He needs to keep his coalition intact. And he has some very firm - this will only strengthen his hand domestically.",

So far no reaction.But there's no question that this will indeed prompt significant reaction inside of Israel. And I suspect that it will also prompt quite a bit of defiance from the Israeli prime minister himself. We got a taste at the end of last month as there were rumors circulating that the ICC might indeed issue or seek arrest warrants against top Israeli leaders. We got a taste of what the Israeli prime minister's reaction would be when he preempted effectively this move, saying that a decision by the ICC to issue arrest warrants for Israeli political officials or military commanders, he said would be a, quote, \"scandal on a historic scale.\" He also called it - said it would be \"an indelible stain on all of humanity and an unprecedented anti- Semitic hate crime.\" [07:00:02] So that is the kind of language that I think we will - we can expect to hear from the Israeli prime minister as we expect reaction soon.",
