He's now facing charges of abuse of authority and orchestrating a rebellion. Yoon's Martial Law decree led to public protests and mass resignations from his cabinet.CNN's Marc Stewart has more.",

      "sentences": "According to investigators, the arrest would take place within seven days after the warrant is issued, but it's a deadline that could be extended, so we're just going to have to wait and see on all of this. But it is important to emphasize the context in all of this. Even though President Yoon is essentially suspended, stripped of his powers, he's still South Korea's president and he's still entitled to stay at the presidential residence.This is not something that suddenly happened out of the blue. This all stems from an investigation that was launched after President Yoon's declaration of martial law on December 3rd. The nation's corruption investigation office issued three summons asking for his cooperation in the probe, but he has refused. That's what led to this arrest warrant. It's an investigation focusing on charges of abuse of authority and insurrection after he announced martial law. During his short-lived martial law, Yoon allegedly ordered his defense minister to arrest several high ranked politicians, civil activists and even judges. He's also accused of obstructing operation of the National Assembly with military forces. Yoon's attorney is fighting back, calling the issuance of the arrest warrant illegal and invalid, hinting that the President will likely not comply with the warrant. He said the suspended President will confidently respond when the due process goes on. So, for now, we are just going to have to keep watch on this potential arrest. Marc Stewart, CNN Beijing.",
