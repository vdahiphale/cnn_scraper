I'm Phil Mattingly, in for Jake Tapper.We are just moments away from the closing bell on Wall Street on what's turned out to be a significant day for economic news. So far, the markets have taken to the bell right there at the slide, a reaction to two big developments in the last two days, the Fed's decision yesterday to hold their rates and a two decade high, and today's new jobs report that showed only 114,000 jobs were added last month. It's all underscoring fears the job market is slowing too quickly and could trigger a recession. A recession that, of course, would have major implications on the presidential race, the economy, the top issue for voters in the presidential election and in this election, while there's now officially a presumptive Democratic nominee. In just a few hours ago, the Democratic National Committee said Kamala Harris had earned enough delegate votes to seal the deal. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)",

It's still a great year if you own stocks. We've got us a triple whammy effect going on here. You've got one, some of the big A.I. tech stocks have lost ground this week, which has hurt this. The second thing its summertime, remember, lots of investors, unlike other, on the beaches. So that makes things choppy. And then as you pointed out, the third thing is economic data and those jobs numbers today, which has raised all sorts of fears of a broader economic slowdown. And more pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut rates, which as you pointed out, they didn't do yesterday. Look, I think we need to take a pause. No one is talking about some kind of imminent recession here. I think what was confirmed by this data is that you can pretty much guarantee there will be a rate cut in September. Yes. This was a weaker than expected jobs report. We've seen the jobs market weakening now for a number of months but we did add jobs, net overall. And I think that's important. We also saw the unemployment rate rise, which is a worrisome trend too. But again, its because as well that more people are entering the jobs market. You've just got to make sure that you've got enough jobs available for them to go to. And that's why a lot of people looking around today and saying, look, the Fed needs to ease rates back. They need to give room to the economy to breathe. Now, I'll be the first person to say that before this jobs number we saw weakness in the manufacturing sector, consumers, all of us, we're spending less. Starbucks is saying that McDonalds is saying that. And, of course, I think we're all arguing endlessly, the price has remained too high. But growth is still solid, Phil, and three weeks ago, stock markets were at record highs. So the key really for the Federal Reserve is what do you do now to try and maintain it and keep jobs growing. And that is cutting rates. You've got JPMorgan today, Citi saying, were going to see interest rates come down by around a percentage point, if not more this year. Some are saying we could see an entire market cut, that will cause panic. My message as a true Brit is keep calm, carry on. Don't panic about imminent recession and rates will come down in September.",

But they're also looking for someone who can control the map as you're just mentioning. I mean, Pennsylvania in the words of one person close to the campaign, is a tipping point.

But I will also say that there is just this new invigoration of people who also want to work on the campaign. I get text all day long about submitting their resume to someone and I'm like -- I only have so much full, like, I can, you go to kamalaharris.com and you submit your resume the same way and most everyone else does. I also think though that is because of the short runway of her campaign, you can't learn on the job right now. You have to know what you're doing. You have to know the different pieces but also in 2020, I didn't join the Biden campaign until June of 2020. So this is a natural course of a campaign, in the summer, you ramp up.

Back with me to discuss is our panel. And if you want an example of a momentum shift, David, these fundraising numbers are bonkers. Harris campaign, on it, bring it up -- brought in $310 million.

What I think people should just be aware of though that is not -- the momentum shift does not mean that Kamala Harris is in the drivers seat on this race right now. I mean, what that has done is snapped this race back two a margin of error race because Joe Biden was losing this race and the switch on the ticket and the switch and enthusiasm on the Democratic side has now brought Harris -- the Harris campaign sort of back into contention.

He was sitting for over a year, 23 hours a day in a cell, in a horrible, forlorn prison in Russia.And the first thing he does when he can taste freedom is asked his captor for an interview. I mean, he's so dedicated to his job, so dedicated to telling the truth and it's just incredible and remarkable to watch from afar and look like were just so, so proud of him.

He said this morning, it's totally up to Evan to decide what he's going to do next once he's recuperated. It's too early to figure out like, what is it going to get back on to be? What's he going to do is going to report. Clearly, he wants to interview President Putin. What do you think is next here? Yeah, look, I mean, I want to let Evan speak for himself. I mean, when he was in prison, we could sort of feel that airspace and speak on his behalf. And now, it's up to him and were going to follow his lead. I will tell you this. I think it was quite remarkable that the first thing he told the press when he got off the flight was that there are other political dissidents. There are other political prisoners still in Russia who don't have the resources and the leverage of \"The Wall Street Journal\" and the Dow Jones. So, you know, if he wants us to help in that fight and continue that fight, we're there at the drop of a hat to do it? Other than that, you know, I think and I hope that he takes couple of days off, he takes a little break to kick his feet up a little bit because he deserves to crack a beer and sleep for 14 hours, I think.",

It's about our American democracy.The way I see the threats, given my security background, when Americans are losing faith in their democracy, there's an open flirtation among some political leaders with authoritarian forms of government fueled by overheated, rhetoric irresponsible rhetoric, frankly, and we're also seeing rhetoric that condones and supports violence in some instances, and correlate with that, there's an actual rise in incidents of political violence in this country. Just over the last four or five years culminating, of course, with the attempted assassination of former President Trump on July 13th. So Judge Luttig and I are here as leader of a task force at the ABA Convention in Chicago, sending the call to lawyers that lawyers should be involved in tamping down the rhetoric in volunteering to support election workers, in volunteering to be poll watchers themselves, in volunteering to speak to community groups about correcting misinformation, misimpression, about how elections work, and a number of other things. Given the background and the training of lawyers, given their scale at conflict resolution, we think the lawyers are uniquely positioned at this critical moment in the history of our democracy to step up and support and defend the Constitution, the rule of law. Just like doctors step forward during the COVID crisis, it's now a time for lawyers to do the same when it comes to supporting and defending our Constitution, the rule of law and our democracy.",

There are different views of legal theories of the case to some degree, we can see it in the court system you see it a nominations, not to make things political.And you can also see in the fact that there are a lot of lawyers that surrounds the former president, his team would like to be in a second administration who have a far more expansive view of what they believed the executive branch should do, of what they believe is allowed in an election or around an election. They were lawyers involved in the effort to overturn the 2020 election. How do you explain this message in reaching those individuals?",

In one of them, it really focuses on some of the communications.And so what we learned today was there's a growing some growing clarity that the radio situation on the ground was pretty scattered and that's a problem, Phil, because what we know is that local law enforcement had been tracking that gunman for quite some time, but the information was at times being passed over text message at times being passed over the radio, of what the acting Secret Service director described was to command level sites, and one was this unified command post were local law enforcement was on the radio. They could hear each other and then there was a security room where the Secret service was positioned with a Pennsylvania state trooper and what he said was that in the urgency it appears that there was radio traffic that the Secret Service just didn't get. They just it just got missed and so those are the things that they're trying to nail down, but its important, Phil, because that the radio communications simplifying that is an actual fixable problem and something that they're moving forward to try to change as they continue to do protective cites. The other thing, Phil, is that this was the first time that they used Secret Service counter-snipers at the former presidents events. That was a piece of new information we learned today. And then finally, Phil, there were a lot of questions about accountability and so what reporters were asking is when are we going to know if anybody is going to be disciplined or fired because of this. And here's what Director Rowe said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RONALD ROWE JR., ACTING U.S. SECRET SERVICE DIRECTOR: Every single person within the secret service feels the weight of what happened. We are in an unprecedented threat environment and high operational tempo during this presidential campaign. The men and women of the Secret Service are working incredibly hard and doing their jobs under difficult circumstances. They need to focus on their work and they need to know that I have their backs, and that is my commitment to them. (END VIDEO CLIP) WILD: Phil, Director Rowe made very clear that we will not find out about that in real time, but he said at some point he may be able to make a high level statement about the accountability here -- Phil.",
