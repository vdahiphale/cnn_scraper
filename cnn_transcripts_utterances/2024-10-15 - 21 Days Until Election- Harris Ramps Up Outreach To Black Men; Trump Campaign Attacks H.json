And then when you look at the real votes, the exit polls in 2020, Biden got 75 percent, Hillary Clinton got 81 percent, got even more than Biden.

And that Donald Trump actually held the check up so that his name could be put on the check.

I said, if I run this country, if I'm going to be president of this country, I'm going to put 100, 200, 2,000 percent tariff. They're not going to sell one car into the United States because we're not going to destroy our country, right?So when -- because I know you're an anti-tariff guy, but I'm the exact opposite. If I had -- there was no other way I could have stopped them other than what am I going to do, negotiate with Mexico or China? You're not going to get anything from that. I said, I'm going to put 100, 200 or 300. I'm going to put the highest tariff in history, meaning, I'm going to stop them from ever selling a car into the United States. So I just see the guy by accident. I see him. He says, sir, they've abandoned. And, by the way, they built foundations. They were really rocking. They were going to do it. They thought that I was going to win or maybe they're just holding off. I tell you this, if I don't win, those factories are going to wipe out this country. They're the biggest factories ever built for cars. They're going to wipe out our country. If she wins and she won't -- she doesn't know what the hell she's doing. If she wins, she's -- and she's not going to be thinking about -- I couldn't -- every speech I made having to do with cars, but every speech I made having to do with tariffs, I'd mentioned that our country is being threatened by Mexico. Now, all of those things -- beyond even the car companies, all of those things are now dead. They're dead. I asked him, will they start? Probably not. They're dead as a doornail.
