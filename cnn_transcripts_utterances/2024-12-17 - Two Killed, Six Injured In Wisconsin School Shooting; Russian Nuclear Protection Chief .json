Were there any written plans that she left around to find? Was there anything on social media?I assume investigators are going to be scouring that. When I saw that this was yet another young teenager, I was shocked. You know, we've had several shootings in recent years. Appalachia high school, just in June, that the shooter was 14 years old, Oxford High School a few years ago, the shooter was 15 years old. Here we see yet again, another trend of young teenagers getting ahold of weapons somehow. And I'm sure investigators are going to look at where this minor got ahold of this weapon. If an adult gave this minor a weapon, we could see charges just like we did in the Appalachian high school shooting and oxford, where parents were charged. And in the case of the oxford high school shooting, actually convicted.",

And now this shooting, we also saw last year we had a church shooting in Texas, the Lakewood Church shooting, that was a female shooter. The Stem Highlands ranch shooting, that was a high school shooting five years ago. One of the perpetrators there was female.What this is showing me is that these gun attacks, which usually used to be the province of white males of a certain age, is now diversifying. We're seeing different races, different genders, were seeing Americas gun virus really extend to other groups. And this is -- this is troubling to me. It means that there's no corner of this country that could really be untouched by Americas gun violence epidemic.",

This was a general who ran the forces that look after the nuclear weapons, the chemical weaponry, and the Ukrainians had very clearly accused him specifically of ordering the use of chemical weapons effectively on the battlefield against the Ukrainian military.So they targeted him. They got him just four miles from the Kremlin, as I say. So, a massive breach of security for the Russians. We await to hear their response. But, you know, you could call it a triumph for the Ukrainians, but there will be a response as well to this. HUNT:  Yeah, well, I was going to say, Max, I mean, this is an intriguing time, I suppose, for Russia, considering, of course, the fall of Assad in Syria, where, of course, Russians were. They've given him asylum there and Putin making an appearance in public without even mentioning what was going on there, really, in many ways an embarrassment for them and potential security problems, since they have access to a warm water port through Syria.

Whether or not they'll be able to stay. But losing, you know, under a major pressure within Syria, in the Middle East also clearly under pressure in Ukraine, they have been pretty successful, though, on the battlefield, pushing forward on those front lines. So they've been claiming triumphs on the battle in Ukraine. But this is a major blow. A big embarrassment, which does show some vulnerability, to think that you could attack anyone in central Moscow as a Ukrainian agent is pretty extraordinary, let alone a top, a top general who was specifically targeted.",

So the mountain snow is also going to yield in the stronger winds in southern California. And that, of course, equates to the potential for some fire weather conditions going forward in the future. So let me explain. Here's the latest satellite loop. And you can see its kind of a stream of moisture into the western parts of the U.S. So this is gathering some shape, and it's produced a lot of snow, particularly across the ski resorts. This is what the snowboarder likes to see. Look at that. Almost two feet of snow at Jackson Hole, also coming in at 15 inches. So additional snow still to come. So, yeah. Why are we mentioning this, yeah. Some of the overpasses here could get a bit on the tricky side of travel, but its all part of the same storm system that will impact a larger part of the western U.S. So the radar very busy, again, high elevation snow, low elevation rainfall, a few different. Few inches of rain possible from Seattle southward towards Portland, especially into the coastal regions. But let me show you what happens in the future as this system kind of departs. We have a high pressure that will settle in across the Great Basin. So what that does is it sets up this onshore or I should say offshore flow offshore winds across southern California. That equates to Santa Ana winds. And when that comes up and over these mountain ranges, this creates that drying effect. And also the increasing in the wind speeds. So the high wind alerts in place across the same areas that were impacted by the fires last week. So this is something well monitor here going forward today over the next couple of days. Very dry conditions continue across southern California -- Kasie.",
