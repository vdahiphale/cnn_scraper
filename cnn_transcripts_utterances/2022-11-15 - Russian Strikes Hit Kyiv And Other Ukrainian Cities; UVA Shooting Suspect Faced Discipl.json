Now that in terms of these swarm-type attacks is a record. The last was the beginning of October, and that was 84. He also said that they're anticipating perhaps 20 more, imploring his countrymen to -- and women and children to get into shelters to take shelter. That is a message that is going out from Mykolaiv in the south, right through to Sumy and Kharkiv in the north, and way out in Lviv in the West.And that is because all of those locations have seen impacts. They've seen a lot of incoming. And they also say that they've shot down the vast majority of these missiles, which the government at the moment describing as cruise missiles. They were at least in the early salvos, cruise missiles we understand fired from aircraft but of course, they also -- the Russians have them capable of being launched out of the Black Sea. And then they have the Iranian-made loitering drone missiles which have been very effective in overwhelming in just -- in sheer numbers the infrastructure to defend the country. But the targets have overwhelmingly been the electrical infrastructure. 30 percent of the internet has been knocked out. A huge number of cities, not this one, the Kryvyi Rih, where the lights are still on, but a lot of other cities, Kate, had been very badly affected. And this is on top, of course, the damage that the Russians have done in the past to try and break the back of Ukraine as winter approaches, Kate.",

And indeed, he was also demanding reparations. That is going to be highly controversial.",

The leaders are meeting for the first time in person since the start of the invasion. And unlike the smaller G7, the G 20 includes countries like India, China, and Saudi Arabia, whose positions on the war have not been so clear. MJ Lee is live in Indonesia at this summit with more on this. MJ, what is the appeal that President Biden is making to world leaders there?",

      "sentences": "Well, Kate, there's no question that no other single issue has loomed larger over the G20 Summit than the ongoing war in Ukraine. And heading into the kickoff to the summit today, senior U.S. officials had noted that most G20 member countries have condemned the war. So, there was definitely a recognition that there have been a handful of countries that are G20 members who haven't always been sort of fully or openly critical of the war. They are some of the countries you just mentioned, like China, like India, Saudi Arabia, even the host country, Indonesia to some extent, so that has certainly been a complicating factor. But really President Biden's key overarching goal in coming to the summit has been trying to sort of elevate that collective global voice of condemnation against this -- against this war.Now, one dynamic that is worth noting, of course, is that Vladimir Putin was not in attendance. Russia, of course, is a member country. He ended up ultimately sending his Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov instead. So, ultimately, President Biden and other foreign leaders ended up discussing Vladimir Putin and the very war that he started and is engaged in, except just not in his presence, Kate.",
