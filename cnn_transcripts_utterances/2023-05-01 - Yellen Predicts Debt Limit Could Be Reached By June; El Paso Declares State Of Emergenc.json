Moved up to a point where people need to figure out a resolution, figure out a path forward, and no one is talking right now. When you talk to White House officials, when you talk to administration officials, they've made clear their position is the same as it has always been. The President wants a clean debt ceiling increase. There will be no negotiations on anything but a clean debt ceiling increase. Obviously, as Manu told you quite well, the Republicans are in a very different place right now. The difference between right now and yesterday where those two positions stand is, they have a lot of month to figure this out. There's not a lot of time. Lawmakers are out of session, the President has international travel. How they figure something out is still very much an open question, Jake.",

      "sentences": "Not at the moment, Jake. Of course, this letter just came out, but even Kevin McCarthy, the Speaker, saying earlier today in Israel that they will not do what the White House has been demanding for the past several months, that the House will not pass a clean debt ceiling increase, meaning, a debt ceiling increase without, with no conditions, whatsoever.The Republicans say there should be some conditions. They passed a bill last week along party lines, they lost a handful of votes, but enough to get it over the finish line. That included a slew of cuts across the federal government, also to go after Biden policies. What McCarthy has been calling for some time is to have a negotiation with President Biden, try to find some sort of agreement between what the President wants and what the Republicans want and try to get it through both chambers of Congress. The White House has resisted that for some time. Senate Democratic Leaders and House Democratic Leaders are so far on the same side as President Biden. There are some concerns among some moderate Democrats, some in the rank and file who are calling for direct one-on-one negotiations between McCarthy and Biden. And the question will be, now that we have a deadline, will that change? Will that pressure intensify to sit down and reach an agreement? Republicans say they are the only ones who passed a bill because the House Republicans did approve that proposal. Senate Democrats have not yet moved on any of their own proposals, and if they were to move on a clean debt ceiling increase at this moment, that would not get the 60 votes it would need in order to get over the potential filibuster attempt. Meaning, at least nine Republicans would need to support that effort that is simply not there. So, Jake, it is a major question whether they can get a deal, certainly, the biggest scare of a potential default since 2011. And that time the U.S. credit rating was downgraded as a Republican House battled a Democratic President. There was no deal in sight. The credit rating got downgraded. Ultimately, they did reach a deal, they did reach a deal to cut spending as well, so a lot of those cuts were later reversed. And nevertheless, we are -- this is the first time we're seeing this scare happening in Washington since the past dozen years. How they resolve this is anyone's guess at this point, Jake.",

I'm flabbergasted that some of the media treating the Speaker's bill which is deeply unpopular and is coupled with the threat of the collapse of the economy is anything other than extortion, unquote. That's Brian Schatz on -- skeeting on Blue Sky.Phil, that seems to be the White House position. You have --nobody wants this, it's unpopular, Republicans, you can't extort us. Stop.

      "sentences": "Yeah, no question about it. And when we're referencing that last debt fight from 12 years ago that that point, then Speaker John Boehner had a difficult time keeping his conference united. They tried to put past a Republican-only bill with a whole hodgepodge of Republican priorities that failed in the Republican House, and that gave Democrats significant leverage in the run up to the final outcome in that deal to raise the debt ceiling.This is different, Kevin McCarthy behind the scenes worked for the last several months to try and get his conference all in line behind a bill. They have a narrower majority now than they did a dozen years ago. They still managed to get it passed. They knew this was just an opening offer, an effort to try to strengthen their argument that there needs to be some conditions attached to a bill. So, the question will be whether any Republicans in the senate break after the House passed its bill. I can tell you, Jake, in talking to some of those Senate Republican deal maker types like Mitt Romney, for instance, I talked to him last week, he said this is not about Senate Republicans trying to cut a deal with Senate Democrats. This is about the White House trying to work with Kevin McCarthy in getting a deal. He is aligning himself with House Republicans on this issue, and you're going to hear a lot of how Senate Republicans say the same. Just shows you that even the ones who could potentially cut a deal are at the moment sitting this out. We'll see what happens in the coming weeks there, Jake.",

Again, we've never seen this play out before but the immediate impact, I think most certainly would be a spike in interest rates, I think from a broader macro perspective, it would lead almost certainly to a recession.That would mean significant job losses as well coming at the same time. But I think probably most importantly from a person to person family and household perspective, you would see your consumer products, anything that you have a dead end to some degree. The interest rate would certainly spike on that as well. So, you're owing more money on credit cards, you're owing more money on wherever you're borrowing, and that would take a, that would have a significant impact. And then you add job losses to that. You add a tightening of credit to that as well. And I think there's just a kind of snowballing macro effect here where I don't think you can necessarily quantify it because it's tough to kind of get your head around. And I think more broadly as well, if you pull it back a little bit, then you have kind of the geopolitical international aspect of this as the U.S. defaults on its debt for the first time. How the other countries look at that, what does that mean, going forward geo-politically from an international economics perspective. I think the cascading effect is something that people don't even want to consider or broach. And I think that's why this becomes such a dangerous moment because as Manu stated, 2011 is kind of the marking point. No one's ever gotten that close to that point again even though there's been battles related to this when Democratic presidents have been in office since then, this is the first one that feels as close to that and potentially worse given how far apart things are with such a limited time window.",

The reality is it's going to take both Republicans and Democrats coming together, maybe not getting everything they want but have a conversation, how do we curb some of the spending, how do we take care of our debts, and also how do we move this country forward?

We have precedent in the past where we've had a Democrat President and a Congress that wants to control spending, out of control spending, and they worked together. And we should do this right now for the American people. The American people don't want us to be divided especially on economic issues. And when it comes to default, it is a slight scare tactic because in terms of tax revenues today, we get 11 times in terms of the tax revenue as the interest on the debt. So, we're not going to default, and through the appropriations process, we can prioritize spending as needed.

And then we had the Russian head of the Wagner mercenary group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, over the weekend, suggest they're running out of artillery shells and might have to pull back. Now Ukraine says they're on the front foot and Russians are abandoning their positions. The city is becoming a kind of signaling game for both sides to project strength and then possibly drag each other's forces in. It is something of a sideshow despite the extraordinary loss of life. One indication from John Kirby, the National Security Council spokesperson, is they might. Russia have lost 100,000 troops since December, mostly fighting for Bakhmut, that's casualties, dead and wounded. They realize, though, right now on the larger counter offensive, most likely not around Bakhmut, but in the south of Ukraine. Jake?",

He and staff writer Anne Applebaum wrote, the June edition's cover story entitled the case for the total liberation of Ukraine. And you can read that online today. Jeffrey, thanks for being here. I appreciate it. You write that a victory for Ukraine can be easily defined. It would mean sovereignty, safety, justice but getting there, not so easy to define.

Russia bogged down in this tiny town, relatively small town, for months and months and months.If you recall, think back 14, 15 months ago, we thought Ukraine was going to be wiped out, wiped off the map in a matter of days. And, you know, we were in Kyiv, I was in Kyiv last year, I was there this year, the change is remarkable. Even though it's under periodic rocket attack, you know, there is no existential threat to most of the country anymore. And what I mean by all of that is that we have underestimated their resolve, their capabilities, their desire to win. Russia has no morale whatsoever. Ukrainians are all morale. Our argument, of course, is that Ukraine, the fighters of Ukraine, can do this without foreign troops, without U.S. troops, NATO troops. But what they can't do without is the support is the American material, the weapon systems, the most advanced weapon systems. This is the year to do it.

But what they didn't understand was that Ukraine had changed over the last 20 or 30 years and was now a Western army, an innovative or flattened hierarchy. The Russians are still fighting like Soviets. The Ukrainians are fighting like American Special Forces. The drone workshops are just the case in point. The Russians in Bakhmut and elsewhere are just trying to go home alive, right? They don't care. The morale is extremely low.
