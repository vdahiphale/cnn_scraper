But it's clear, Kate, that the Republican-led legislature in Tennessee believes that the remedy for school shootings is to put more guns on campuses and to arm teachers.The bill's co-sponsors says that there's a lot of misinformation about this legislation, principally, that it's not a requirement for teachers in Tennessee to carry a concealed gun, but rather it gives them the option but only if they reach a series of thresholds, including enhanced carry permit. They're going to need to get permission from the superintendent, the school principal, as well as the local law enforcement chief, submit a background check, go through 40 hours of school training, among other things. It's interesting, though, that this legislation comes just about a year after the deadliest school shooting in state history at the Covenant School, that private school in Nashville, and some of the parents of those surviving victims, they oppose this legislation and they could be heard after its passage, saying blood on your hands.

And this case brings us right back to where we were two years ago when the Supreme Court overturned nearly a half century of abortion rights and states like Idaho immediately put into place abortion bans.Idaho's ban says no woman can terminate a pregnancy in the state unless her actual life is being threatened. Soon after that reversal of Roe v. Wade, Attorney General Merrick Garland put out a statement that reminded everyone of a federal law called the Emergency Medical Act Law that applies to emergency rooms and would require any woman who would come there with pregnancy complications to get emergency care to stabilize her health, even if it didn't -- even if her death was not imminent. It would be serious life-threatening -- not life-threatening situations, health threatening situations like rupture of a membrane, infection, a serious infection, near organ failure. That's the kind of medical emergencies that are kind of right in the gap here of what the federal government says should be covered in emergency rooms and that Idaho says should not be covered. Up first, Sara, will be Joshua Turner, representing the state of Idaho, arguing that federal law does not preempt state law here, that the state still governs what goes on in the emergency room. Up next will be solicitor general Elizabeth Prelogar saying in serious emergency situations is federal law has to take effect. Women have to be guaranteed that their health will be preserved if they have serious complications in pregnancy -- Sara.",

There is a razor thin majority for Republicans in both chambers here. So Democrats need two Republicans to vote with them for this repeal happen. I'm being told they now have enough to first bypass the procedural hurdle, then the repeal itself.Now if they do this, that doesn't mean that the law is repealed immediately. It still has to go over to the Senate side. They are expected to pass the repeal, then it would go to the governor's desk. That could all happen by early May. But if they fail to repeal this law, the earliest it can go into effect is June 8th. And just to remind people, this law dates back to 1864. It bans nearly all abortions except in the case of saving the life of the mother. It carries a prison sentence for providers two to five years. And until June 8th the law that's in effect right now is actually a 15-week abortion ban that Arizona passed in 2022. Also does not carry any exceptions for rape or incest. The Republicans would like to focus, though, on the fact that there is a November ballot initiative by abortion rights advocates to try to enshrine abortion rights into the state's Constitution. They are going to meet today to try to make progress on introducing their own counter ballot initiative -- Kate.",

What are you watching for now? Almost every time the Supreme Court hears an abortion case post-Dobbs. GLORIA BROWNE-MARSHALL, AUTHOR, \"SHE TOOK JUSTICE\": I think I'm going to be listening for whether or not the Supreme Court is wrestling with the health of a mother versus the life of the mother. And what we have are fathers and mothers, parents on the Supreme Court. And when you're talking about the life of the mother, that means that a doctor has to wait to see if the woman's health deteriorates to a point where her life is indeed in danger as opposed to her being in the situation in which she could have a lifelong disability, such as a stroke if she's not given that termination of pregnancy at that moment. So I think I'm going to be really listening for their concern as human beings, as well as where the federal and state law stands. Federalism is the balance of power between the state and the federal government. And there's always a balance going on about power.

We heard from the first and very key witness, David Pecker, the former publisher of the \"Enquirer\" who is on the stand talking about conversations that he had with Donald Trump to help Trump's campaign and hurt Trump's opponents.Here's some of what transpired during court. Pecker said, and I'm going to pull this up here, as he's talking to Trump, he said, \"Anything I hear on the marketplace, if I hear anything negative about yourself or if I hear anything about women selling stories, I would notify Michael Cohen,\" who was then Donald Trump's fixer and personal attorney, \"as I did over the last several years.\" And the prosecutor say, OK. So they would not get published, you mean? And he responds, yes. So they wouldn't get published. Yes. Jennifer, why is it so important for prosecutors to show this was all about keeping negative information about Donald Trump away from potential voters. SIDNER: So the way they've charged this case is the falsified financial documents, but it gets a bump up to a felony if that was -- if another crime was committed to cover up the crime, right? So it's important for them to prove this election interference conspiracy. And that's what they do with David Pecker. So all of this testimony about this is what we would do, if we learned something that could damage his candidacy, and that was explicit in this meeting that they had, it's all about the election, then we would kill that story. So that's what they're proving with this testimony. It also has the side benefit of dirtying up the defendant a bit, totally legitimately because it does go to this critical issue that they have to prove. But it's disgusting what they did about false statement, false stories that they would plant about his opponents. And so you kind of get this side benefit of the jury thinking, wow, that's really dirty play that the defendant was engaged in with David Pecker.",
