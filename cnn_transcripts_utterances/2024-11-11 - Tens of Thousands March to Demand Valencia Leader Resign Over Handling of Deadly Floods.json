      "sentences": "Valencia, Spain is spilling over once again, not from the recent floods that devastated the region, killing more than220 people, but with anger. Protesters clashing with police following a rally demanding accountability for the deadly floods, including the resignation of regional leader Carlos Mazon. But many residents say lives could have been saved if the government had acted faster. On the day of the floods, the Spanish weather agency issued a red alert for heavy rain about 12 hours before the regional government sent out a text alert warning people to shelter in place. But by then, many residents say the water was already at their doors. Locals say they`re frustrated by what they say has been a slow and uncoordinated response by the government. So far, about 8,500 soldiers have been deployed to clear debris, guard against looters and search for the missing. Divers scouring river bottoms for bodies. But many of the troops have only arrived in the past week. Too little, too late for a disaster, many people say the government of Valencia should have known was coming. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Australia`s Prime Minister, AnthonyAlbanese, said legislation will be introduced to Parliament this year, and then the laws would come into effect 12 months after being ratified or approved by lawmakers. There will be no parental consent exemptions in these laws. The Prime Minister cited the harm that social media can have on young users and called the policy world leading. Meta`s Instagram and Facebook, ByteDance`s TikTok and Elon Musk`s X are all platforms that will be impacted by the new laws. Alphabet`s YouTube is also likely to fall within the scope of the ban. While countries around the world like France and the U.S. are also enacting policies to curb social media use by minors. Australia`s proposed policy is one of the most strict yet. Ten second trivia. Veterans Day originated with an observance marking the end of which war? The U.S. Civil War, World War I, World War II or the Vietnam War? The holiday observed on November 11th recalls Armistice Day marking the end of World War I. Today, November 11th is Veterans Day in the United States. It all started back in November of the year 1918 on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month of the year when an armistice went into effect ending the fighting in World War I. A year later, people in the United States first observed Armistice Day. Twenty years later, after World War II, the day became an official national holiday. Then, after the Korean War in 1954, the name of Armistice Day was changed. It`s been known as Veterans Day ever since. The event honors everyone who served in the U.S. Armed Forces. Events are scheduled throughout the day today as Americans pause to thank, salute, remember and respect the service and sacrifices of all who served. We take a look back now to this June which marked the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings in Normandy, France. June 6th, 1944 saw the largest military seaborne operation ever attempted and began the campaign to liberate Europe from Nazi control. CNN`s Melissa Bell traveled to the site with some of the last living American World War II veterans who participated in the Allied invasion 80 years ago. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MELISSA BELL, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  From the other side of the Atlantic, they returned to the continent they`d liberated a lifetime ago.

An official atthe volcano`s monitoring post said it threw volcanic material 3:7 miles upwards from its crater. And the thick ash spewed as high as 6,500 feet into the air, burning down several houses, including a Catholic nun convent, according to an AP report. Mount Lewotobi Laki-laki is one of Indonesia`s 120 active volcanoes. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
