That's a type of reconnaissance aircraft and U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, or Indo-PaCom for short, put out a video of this intercept, this encounter from inside of the cockpit of that U.S. Aircraft. You can see the Chinese fighter jet off to the right, then it cuts or slices in front of the U.S. Aircraft, and you see it shaking inside that U.S. Aircraft. According to Indo-Pacific command, that is when the wake turbulence of that Chinese fighter jet disturbed the flight path of the U.S. aircraft, and what the U.S. is calling an unnecessary aggressive maneuver to carry out this intercept. U.S. goes to great lengths to point out this happening in the international airspace, over the international waters in the South China Sea. It's not the first time we've seen this sort of aggressive behavior from Chinese aircrafts. In fact, we saw something very similar back in December, that's when a Chinese navy fighter jet, a J-11, came in within 20 feet of the nose of another RC 1-35 Rivet Joint, according to the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, forcing the larger heavier U.S. Aircraft with some 30 people on board to carry out evasive maneuvers before the two aircraft got too close. The U.S. sees this as a pattern of a more aggressive behavior coming from Chinese aircraft. It is worth noting the broader context in which this is all happening with a tremendous amount of tension between Beijing and Washington. In fact, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is in the Indo-Pacific region right now in a couple days about to attend, what's known as the Shangri-La Dialogue, a meeting of some of the important countries in the region, including the U.S. and China. The U.S. had been trying to set up a meeting between Austin and his Chinese counterpart Minister of National Defense Li Shangfu. But the Chinese, after essentially not getting back to the U.S for awhile, rejected the offer of a meeting and that gives it the broader tension between China and the U.S. between Beijing and Washington right now. It is worth noting that President Joe Biden said, earlier in May that he would eventually meet President Xi Jinping of China.

Now, on Tuesday, jurors heard chilling details of the attack and a 911 call from an 84- year old victim.CNN's Danny Freeman has our details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DANNY FREEMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Four and a half years after the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in modern U.S. history, the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting trial finally began, loved ones of the victims arriving with police escorts and hugging each other in front of the court. STEPHEN COHEN, CO-PRESIDENT, NEW LIGHT CONGREGATION: Today is another chapter, and hopefully, almost a final or closing chapter of what happened four and a half years ago. FREEMAN (voice-over): Defender Robert Bowers, accused of killing 11 Jewish worshippers, and wounding several others in October 2018, sat in a courtroom, wearing a collared-shirt and olive sweater actively speaking with his attorneys. All while the government graphically laid out the deadly rampage he's accused of committing. Federal prosecutors said in the months leading up to the shooting, Bowers looked up Jewish organizations and posted anti-Semitic and anti-immigrant rhetoric online. Then that Saturday morning, Bowers armed himself with several handguns, an AR-15 and a shotgun, and drove to the synagogue. The prosecution said Bowers then methodically went through the synagogue and hunted Jewish worshippers, sometimes shooting victims at such close range, they had singe marks from the rifle that killed them. Ninety-seven-year old Rose Mallenger, was shot through the head while hiding behind a pew. Her daughter hid from Bowers under her body. WENDELL HISRICH, THEN-PITTSBURGH PUBLIC SAFETY DIRECTOR: It's a very horrific crime scene, it's one of the worst that I have seen. FREEMAN (voice-over): After shootout, with members of the Pittsburgh police SWAT team, Bowers surrendered. An officer asked him why he had done this. Prosecutor Sue Song told jurors that he responded in part, all Jews need to die. The Jews are killing our kids. In her opening statement, Bower's defense attorney, Judy Clark, called her client's actions incomprehensible and an excusable, saying there will be no doubt as to who shot 11 congregants and wounded seven others. But Clark said the jury must determine if his, quote, irrational motive in his misguided intent applies to the federal charges Bowers faces. Twenty two of the 63 charges against Bowers are eligible for the death penalty. Steve Cohen is the co-president of New Light, one of the three congregations attacked at the synagogue that day.",
