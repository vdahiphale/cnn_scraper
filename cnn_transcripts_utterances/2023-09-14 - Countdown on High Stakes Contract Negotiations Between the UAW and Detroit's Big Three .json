So, that's why Senator Booker is right, poverty is a policy choice.And with 9 million kids in this country living in poverty today, it's a choice we can't make anymore.

And if we're going to talk about the income, we also have to talk about the expenses as well, which is even a bigger part.

RUBENBut I think it is really clear for voters, 70 percent of voters support expanding the child tax credit, and that includes black and Latino voters who tend to lean toward Democrats, it includes white working-class voters who tend to lean toward Republicans.
