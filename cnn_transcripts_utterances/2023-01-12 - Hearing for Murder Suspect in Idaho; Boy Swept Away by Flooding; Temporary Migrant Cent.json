Now, these are largely procedural in nature. We'll have to wait and see whether there is anything of substance that comes out.But this is, as we've been mentioning, a precursor to what's called a preliminary hearing, and that's where we could see additional evidence from prosecutors, additional witness statements. Now, of course, this all comes as Kohberger has been charged with four counts of first-degree murder. An attorney for him says that his client will be exonerated. But, of course, authorities have already unsealed a trove of potentially damaging evidence that include a DNA connection allegedly between the suspect and the crime scene. Police also analyzed the movements of his vehicle, the movements of his cell phone, which put him in the vicinity, police say, of the residence where these murders took place at least 12 times before the killings. Now, finally, we're also getting some new insight from people who new Bryan Kohberger. One of his neighbors spoke with CBS News and said that in discussion after the incident, Kohberger actually brought it up, saying that it appeared that police have no leads and that Kohberger thought that this was a crime of passion. Again, so chilling there that this neighbor says that this occurred after the fact. We know, of course, the suspect in this case was studying criminology and criminal justice. So, a lot of questions still about the motive here, whether there was any connection to these four victims. We're waiting to hear more from authorities. But, again, this prosecution, the trail continues in just a couple hours' time. That suspect will be back here in court in Moscow, Idaho, guys.",

We're expecting many of the neighbors, the family, the friends, who have been out here day after day looking through the mud, looking through the waters. The reality is that this mother says that she tried to hold on to her son. She describes, you know, saying that he told her, it's OK, mom, don't panic, it is going to be OK. And she did everything she could to hold on to her son, but the current was so strong that he was swept away by that water. Here is his father describing what that mother told him.

This overwhelmed the federal government, the local government and even non-profit organizations. And so what this giant -- it looks like a giant tent. And we have video of this. What this giant tent does is, it allows the federal government to manage that migration flow a little better because they're able to have more processing capacity. Now, that giant tent is climate controlled. It has areas for eating and sleeping. And it's important to note that all of this is part of the Department of Homeland Security's plan to prepare for the lifting of Title 42. Part of that plan is to increase resources and also to add ten soft-sided facilities, like this, along the border. And this is one of them. The one in El Paso is one of them. That's expected to help the federal government mitigate the impact of the next migrant surge. Erica and Jim, as you know, Title 42 is still in place, but border communities are bracing for the lifting of Title 42 because a migrant surge is expected after that.",

NATASHA BERTRAND, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: Yes, so this literally just happened moments ago. Thirty-five-year-old Taylor Dudley, a Lansing, Michigan, native, was released to former Governor Bill Richardson and his team there in Poland after being detained in Kaliningrad in April of 2022. Now, it is not clear how Taylor Dudley ended up in Kaliningrad. He had been in Poland for a music festival, we're told, and he ended up crossing the border and he was then detained by Russian border patrol agents there in that tiny little exclave of Kaliningrad that, of course, is Russian territory, sandwiched between Poland and the Baltic states. But what we know is that this has been the - a process of months of the Richardson team trying to get him release. And actually what we are told is that the former New Mexico governor, who now has a non- profit dedicated to these kinds of hostage negotiations, did bring his case up with the Russian officials, kind of around the same time he was trying to negotiate the release of Paul Whelan, Brittney Griner and Trevor Reid. Of course, Reed and Griner have been released and Paul Whelan has not. So, what we are told is that Trevor - or that Taylor Dudley is in good health. He has been released just moments ago to the team that has been negotiated his release. And the Russian officials did not demand anything in return for his release. So, they are actually very pleased about how this all went. And, of course, they are emphasizing at this point that they are still working very hard to get Paul Whelan home. He, of course, remains in Russian custody. Guys.",
