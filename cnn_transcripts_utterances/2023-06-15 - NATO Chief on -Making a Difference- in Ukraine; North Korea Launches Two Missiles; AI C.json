We are expecting them to essentially figure out a way to tailor what they couldgive to Ukraine at this moment in terms of military equipment, to what Ukraine actually needs to sustain that major counteroffensive which is currently underway. Ukrainian minister of defense, Alexei Reznikov, actually briefed allies at the Defense Contact Group today about that counteroffensive battlefield operations and what the Ukrainians need, of course, including how many battle tanks they will need. The kind of air defense systems. And the U.S., U.K. and other countries committed a new package of air defense munitions to Ukraine, because, of course, Russia continues to bombard the entire country with missiles. That is something that Ukraine really needs in order to protect its skies during the counteroffensive. That will be significant in terms of helping Ukraine maintain its momentum against the Russians while, at the same time, being able to protect its civilians. The Ukraine contact group also discussed F-16 training, those fourth generation fighter aircraft, that the Ukrainians have so desperately wanted. The Netherlands and Denmark have set up a training coalition and they say they will begin training Ukrainian pilots on these advanced fighter jets in the coming weeks. There was an update provided on that. And of course, an update provided on the Leopard tanks and when and how more of those will be able to get into Ukraine. Of course they are using, the Ukrainians are using these tanks by the hundreds in this counteroffensive. Many of them are being damaged if not destroyed. So a lot of this Ukraine contact group meeting was really focused on how to replenish Ukraine's stocks at the moment and, of course, committing to remaining alongside Ukraine and committing the military equipment for the long haul. Something Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said was really a priority for the alliance, Eleni.",

If you recall, the Trump administration was adamant about getting allies to increase their defense spending. We now see yet again it has become an issue. I think the message coming out of NATO at this point is that every ally is saying they are doing everything that they can to equip Ukraine, to protect NATO because, of course, they feel this is not just a war in Ukraine but potentially an existential war for the future of Europe. That if they don't continue to boost their spending, to replenish their equipment that they are giving to Ukraine, that could make them a vulnerable to a potential Russian attack on NATO soil. Obviously, this will be a key subject of discussion here. It is expected to continue to be an issue because some European countries do not necessarily want to spend as much as some other countries do. They don't have that kind of equipment, the kind of budget that other large countries do in order to commit. But at the same time, there is an acknowledgment that every country, including the 50 countries that met for the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, they are really digging in. That is the terminology that Defense Secretary Austin used. And they are prepared to do so for as long as it takes to support Ukraine, Eleni.",

And it's got off to an interesting and mixed start with raids into Russian territory, attacks on Russian logistics bases behind the front lines and indeed, inside Russia itself. Special Forces raids, attacks and killings of senior officers. And now we're seeing much more of the grinding ground fighting particularly in Zaporizhzhya, where the Ukrainians are claiming to have made small advances. But that will be part of the back and forth before there is, if there ever is, a Ukrainian breakthrough. That is an extremely well defended area of the front line. Less problematic at the moment for the Ukrainians is the front line among Bakhmut, where they are enjoying a degree of momentum in their campaign to free areas that were captured earlier this year toward the end of last year by the Russians. They have been advancing in the latest bound. The deputy minister of defense is saying that Ukraine has captured some three kilometers, two miles. It seems about that they may have recaptured about 20 square kilometers in the Bakhmut front. That's significant because it means the Russian forces are starting to get split in terms of their priorities. But really, what the Ukrainians want to do with the sort of extra weapons Natasha was talking about there, particularly short range and medium range surface-to-air missiles, anti-aircraft missiles, which will be deployed close to the front line, to try to offset the dominance in the air that the Russians have. And the Russians are using that dominance to really hammer the Ukrainian attempts to break through, Eleni.",

The U.N. believes up to 750 people were on board, including dozens of children. At least 78 people did not survive; more than 100 have been rescued. It is believed a sudden shift in weight made the boat capsize, then sink early on Wednesday. A Red Cross volunteer says he has never seen a rescue like this. Survivors have been taken to the Greek city of Kalamata. We have Melissa Bell standing by in Kalamata for us. It is absolutely tragic, the story.

What we know is that it was in the very early hours of Wednesday that the ship went down. From the Greek authorities, we hear that they tried to help this ship in distress but were repeatedly told that it wanted to carry on. The migrants on board wanted to carry on to Italy. But for migrant NGOs, those who work with these ships regularly in the Mediterranean, we're getting a very different idea, Eleni, of exactly what happened. Several of them are saying that, for many hours before the ship sunk, the Coast Guards of both Italy and Greece had been made aware of the fact that this ship was in distress. One of the questions this hour, even as hope grows faint for survivors, is how the ship could've been allowed to sink. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BELL (voice-over):  A dramatic rescue at sea. The Greek Coast Guard pulling a group of people to safety, the lucky ones. Survivors of yet another catastrophe on the deadliest migrant crossing in the world, the Mediterranean. Somehow, 104 people manage to leave this overcrowded fishing boat alive. But hundreds that you see here did not. Most still missing in the deepest part of the Mediterranean Sea, just 50 miles off the Greek coast. Onshore, medics rush to preserve the lives of those that survived, their bodies in trauma after hours in the water. All are men. Aid workers tell me others were unable to get out.",

This time came just hoursafter the defense ministry in North Korea denounced what they said was provocations by the U.S. and South Korea by holding large joint military drills. What we did see this Thursday was the end, the culmination of what was billed as the largest live fire drills ever between the U.S. and South Korea. Now they had five separate days, where they carried out these drills. We went along to one of them and they were significant in size; 2,500 U.S. and South Korean soldiers, more than 600 pieces of equipment. And what really struck me was the blatant nature of these drills. The messaging was far clearer than it has been in the past, saying the scenario was North Korea has staged an illegal armed invasion. What we were seeing in these drills was the U.S. and South Korean response. So clearly, that is something that North Korea did not appreciate. Today as well significant because the South Korean president Yoon Suk-Yeol went along to the final day of these live fire drills and said, as commander-in-chief, he felt confident and satisfied with what he was seeing. Now Pyongyang, from their point of view, said that these drills, they see them as provocative. They have said this is the reason why we have seen such a significant amount of missile launches, of weapons testing over the past 1.5 years. In fact, just at the end of last month, we saw North Korea try to put a satellite into space. That particular launch actually failed. But North Korea has said they will try that again as soon as they possibly can. They said, this time around, they will not warn the maritime organization that they are going to carry out this satellite launch. They believe they have the right to do so. So we are seeing tensions rising again on the Korean Peninsula. At the end of the significant U.S.-South Korea military drills, again we see Pyongyang firing two short-range ballistic missiles from just close to its capital, Pyongyang, into the waters off the east coast.",

He said soldiers did nothing, even at the first sight of groups of settlers, some of them masked, coming toward the town. And, Eleni, it's not that nobody knew that these attacks were going to happen. There are settler WhatsApp groups or even some members of the Israeli parliament are members of these groups. They have been calling for settlers to march toward Huwara and seek revenge after the deaths of the Israeli brothers. But that Israeli soldier said that the biggest failure of the Israeli forces that night was their inability to protect and let in those fire trucks to prevent extensive damage to the property we saw. Videos and testimony from witnesses show that emergency vehicles were blocked, either by settler attacks or by Israeli soldiers telling them it was not safe to enter. Eventually, they did go in after being told they were doing so at their own risk. Now since that night in February, there have been several more violent and sometimes deadly incidents between Palestinians and Israelis in and around Huwara. Since then, Israeli soldiers have remained in the town to reinforce the area. Now the IDF said, Palestinians saying sometimes that means that soldiers forced their shops to close. The IDF chief of staff, Herzi Halevi, told CNN, they learned from the rampage and they now, quote, \"rapidly reinforce security forces in the given area, when suspicion arises of the development of a similarly severe incident.\" But Palestinian residents in Huwara remain unconvinced and with settler leaders, now in positions of power in this Israeli government, they say they are very fearful of what is to come.

On Wednesday, the U.S. and China bothconfirmed that America's top diplomat, Antony Blinken, will visit China this weekend, as the U.S. looks to reset relations. The trip was originally scheduled for February but was postponed due to a suspected Chinese spy balloon that flew over U.S. airspace. This will be the first visit by U.S. secretary of state to China in five years. A senior State Department official says Blinken is expected to discuss the situation in Ukraine and reiterate a call for peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. Assistant secretary of state for East Asian Pacific affairs, Daniel Kritenbrink, was also cautious about the prospect of progress. He said this, quote, \"We are not going to Beijing with the intent of having some sort of breakthrough or transformation in the way that we deal with one another. We're coming to Beijing with a realistic, confident approach and a sincere desire to manage our competition in the most responsible way possible.\" Now according to Kritenbrink, Blinken is expected to raise the issue of the three wrongfully detained Americans in China and call for appropriate military to military communications. Now earlier, the U.S. secretary of state had a phone call with China's foreign minister, Qin Gang, and Qin urged the U.S. to respect China's core concerns, including Taiwan. According to a foreign ministry readout of the call, China's foreign minister said this, quote, \"The United States should respect China's position on the Taiwan question, stop interfering in China's internal affairs and stop undermining China's sovereignty, security and development interests in the name of competition.\" The U.S.-China relationship is at its lowest point in decades over a host of issues including Taiwan, trade, territorial disputes. And U.S. officials hope that Blinken's visit will pave the way for more bilateral meetings, including a possible trip by the U.S. Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen. This week Yellen told U.S. lawmakers it's in America's best interest to maintain ties with China regarding trade and that, quote, \"decoupling\" would be a big mistake -- Kristie Lu Stout, CNN, Hong Kong.
