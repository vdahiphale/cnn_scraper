Clearly, this is something Hamas wants out there as -- as the P.R. for Hamas, that look at how we treat our hostages. It is consistent, Poppy and Phil, with what the IDF had said, which was that hostages were being held in tunnels. They said tunnels that Hamas was not known to have used before.

That's just the battle plan itself.And they did have extremely detailed layouts in there of what to do with hostages, Phil and Poppy. I mean, they would say, you take the hostages. You take them to the communal eating area. Here's where it is. So hostages were very much a central part of the plan. In fact, when you read through it, every single thing that they did was a central part of the plan. What we didn't see in the documents for two of the kibbutz that I've read through was the rape and dismemberment and these absolutely horrific, inhuman acts that were perpetuated so broadly and horrifically. But this part, the part about hostages, that was very clearly in there. And it sounds like now she had -- sounds like from what she's saying, right, very clearly had conversations with the -- the people who were holding them captive, right, talking about their plans.

Of course, you want the hostages to be returned and returned safe and sound, and they should never have been taken in the first place.But what that actually highlights is that Hamas is doing exactly what Israel has accused them of doing, right, which is hoarding medical supplies. Right now you have hospitals in Gaza where people -- children are being operated on without morphine. They don't have any antibiotics. They don't have power. But Hamas clearly has all those things and had them stockpiled. Right? They're not using them on their own civilians, not using them there, right? They're providing them to hostages. Again, you want the hostages to be well taken care of, but they shouldn't be hostages. But it does show that Hamas was prepared, had all this stuff stockpiled, had medical professionals who were able to help. All of these things tell a very important tale. Of course, for the hostage families themselves, I hope -- it seems this would give them a real hope that the hostages are, as Israel said, a majority of them being alive. Would not just mean 50 percent plus one. It would mean maybe all of them. It's got to give hope to those families at the very least, of course. But it does also show Hamas has the antibiotics. Hamas has the doctors. But of course, the Gaza civilian hospitals right now do not.",

The government of Egypt, obviously, was specifically, along with the Red Cross, involved with the two elderly women who were released last night, one of whom we saw speak this morning.There has been a broad perception that foreign nationals, or dual passport, holders may be treated differently. Although the two women who were released were Israeli. So it is -- it is unclear. But there's also been discussion that maybe there would be a big group of hostages release and that there's been some holdups on any negotiations on that. But that's the real question as to whether that happens. And then, of course, whether that then gives a green light to Prime Minister Netanyahu to do whatever it is that he's planning to do, which he has a lot of options at his hands even now, right, when you talk about going into Gaza. It's not just one monolithic choice. Even within that, there are a lot of different options that continuing hostages being held in Gaza could impact. And the Israeli defense minister, Yoav Gallant, said that Israel is preparing for a multilateral operation in Hamas. So they're still talking, Phil and Poppy, about air, ground and sea. Here's how he put it last night here. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YOAV GALLANT, ISRAELI DEFENSE MINISTER (through translator): Keep preparing for our operation. It will come soon. We are preparing thoroughly for the next step: a multilateral operation in the air, ground and sea. Do your work. Get ready. We will need you. (END VIDEO CLIP) BURNETT: Meanwhile, a three-star American general is here in Israel this morning, counselling Israeli forces ahead of the expected Gaza ground invasion.

A U.S. official who confirmed that Glynn was in Israel said he would help with big-picture advice. Israel hasn't conducted operations on this sort of size and scale in decades, if not longer, whereas the U.S. has. Moreover, Glynn's experience in Iraq, in perhaps urban warfare, would also help Israel as they get ready to potentially move into Gaza and conduct warfare in a dense, urban environment, an incredibly difficult environment to operate in. So Glynn can offer all that perspective. The White House yesterday said that there were military officials and officers with relevant experience that would be there to help Israel, not only in its operations now but also on what Israel is planning to do. This as the U.S. urges caution, urges planning and urges Israel to set out very specific goals on what it wants to accomplish in Gaza -- Erin.",

And you've seen Secretary of State Antony Blinken put in a tremendous amount of work on shuttle diplomacy to try to head off a wider conflict and keep this fight contained to Gaza.The Iranian foreign minister said at a press conference yesterday that they've received two messages, as you said, from the Americans. One, explicitly saying, effectively, we don't want to see a larger war; and the second, also sort of urging or warning Iran to stay out of this and to keep its proxies out of this. That would be a number of those proxies, whether it's Hezbollah in Lebanon, Shiite militias in Iraq and Syria, or the Houthis in Yemen. So you can see the U.S. even trying to work through back channels and other intermediaries such as Qatar to try to make sure that others stay out of this fight as this looks to -- as the risk of escalation seems very apparent here, Erin.",
