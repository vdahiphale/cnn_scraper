The county says it's officials and election workers saw an increase in threats during the election, and during the primary earlier this year. Maricopa is the most populous county in Arizona, and became the focus of conspiracy theorists after Donald Trump lost the state in his bid to retain the White House in 2020 -- Whitney.

She is directly targeting Bill Gates, who is again the Republican chairman, supervising the Maricopa County board of supervisors. So when you look at the entire landscape here, the threat landscape we have been talking about for two years, that these election denying comments are persisting. They're resulting in real threats.

But if you live in Arizona or have been following everything since 2020 closely, he has been consistently a target because of his practice of speaking truth to the conspiracy theories in his own parties. And he has been consistently pushing back, not just against Kari Lake, not just against Blake Masters, but against all of the conspiracy theories, through Twitter, through education campaigns, public engagement with the voters in his state. And because he is a Republican, this has been a really tough spot.Many people may not know that on January the 6th, Bill Gates said publicly he had to move his family, relocated family to an Airbnb in order to keep them safe. He's been besieged by threats since the 2020 election. I think we heard about all of this in the context of election volunteers, or Democrats. But this is in fact a Republican official, within his own party, a prominent, respected Republican in Maricopa County, who has literally had to hide his family to protect their safety for the last two years.",

You're right that you would expect the vice president of a sitting president to say that she would remain the running mate if that president sought election a second time. Really, there are two factors at work here. One is that there have been so many questions inside the Democratic Party about whether President Biden seek a second term, and the second variable of course, is that Harris has had lagging poll numbers. There are some Democrats who think she is not a strong compliment to his ticket.But look, we do expect the vice president to say anything else? I am just not sure how much to read into her comments. What I read is oh, I just really want to focus on this thing in the Philippines and do that, or asking about this race. And the same question she has asked, when will she go to Georgia, a subject we were just talking about. She said something to the effect of I don't know guys, I still haven't decided that yet, I'm still trying to find out what to do tomorrow. So, I'm not sure she made a decisive statement, so much as wishing that this conversation would go away for a little while. Biden, in a new \"USA Today\"/Ipsos poll, emerging much stronger from those midterms. Many more Democrats, now than just two weeks ago saying they think he could win against Trump in a theoretical 2024 rematch. Do Harris's numbers come up with those? Does any of this mean anything?

And then as you mentioned, absolutely showing solidarity, to the anti government protesters and people at home, by not singing the anthem. It was a move which was cheered by members of the audience, the crowd, many of whom were supporting Iran with t-shirts, equally showing solidarity for those at home. Their captain had said ahead of the game, he and his teammates saw themselves as the voice of those people at home, and they were sending all of their sympathies to the three families of Iran.
