Hunter Biden in the spotlight on the Hill. The president's son shocking lawmakers and really pretty much everyone this morning by showing up unexpectedly to sit in the audience during his own contempt of Congress hearing. Several minutes later, he departed the hearing while it was still in progress.Biden quietly listened to some of the contentious squabbling among members of the House Oversight Committee. Republican lawmakers, remember, subpoenaed him late last year to testify in a court hearing. A closed-door deposition as part of an impeachment inquiry into his father. Hunter Biden has said he will only testify in public. Democrats in the hearing room this morning urged Republicans to let him speak right then and there. But Biden and his team abruptly got up and left when Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene began speaking. CNN's Melanie Zanona following the latest on Capitol Hill. We also have CNN's MJ Lee at the White House with that angle of all of this. Melanie, first to you. How are lawmakers reacting? How are Republicans reacting to this surprise, unexpected appearance?",

      "sentences": "Well, I can tell you that Republicans and Democrats alike on the House Oversight Committee were completely surprised by this appearance today from Hunter Biden. But that is pretty much where the similarities end in terms of their reactions. Democrats, for their part, welcomed Hunter Biden's appearance. They said this shows that if Republicans really wanted to hear from the president's son, that they had the opportunity to do so today.And that is a point that Hunter Biden himself and his legal team have made over and over again. They said he would testify. They said he would testify publicly under oath. But he just does not want to sit for a closed-door deposition because he's worried that Republicans would selectively or cherry-pick, selectively leak his testimony. Now, Republicans have pushed back. They said that's not how congressional subpoenas work, that he doesn't get to dictate the terms of his appearance. And they requested and demanded that he sit down for a closed-door deposition back in December. So his appearance today created even more drama and political theatrics. It led to some really tense moments. Really, Republicans saw this surprise appearance as nothing more than a political stunt. Let's listen. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) REP. JIM JORDAN, CHAIRMAN OF F THE JUDICIRY COMMITTEE (R): I think it shows just more how blatant the contempt is. It's like, I'll tell you, I'll show you. So, I think it just displays even, you know, just the fact that he was supposed to be here on December 13th in a deposition and goes to the Capitol grounds and says, I'm willing to answer any question publicly. And then leaves when the press wants to ask him questions. I think it just shows. Just how blatant and brazen the contempt is. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Melanie Zanona on Capitol Hill. Lets go to the White House now with MJ Lee. MJ, we heard from Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre in the last hour, and she would not answer directly as to whether the White House knew that Hunter Biden was going to show up on Capitol Hill today. MJ LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTBoris. The White House had really been quiet all day long about this issue since we saw Hunter Biden on Capitol Hill. And I'm just coming out of that briefing where, as you said, the White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre fielded a number of questions about Hunter Biden's appearance on the Hill, including that question of whether the White House had been given any kind of heads up that he would be doing this. And multiple times she declined to answer that question, saying that Hunter Biden is a private citizen and referring any detailed questions to his own legal team. Something that I pushed Karine on was just this idea that the president's son has pulled this stunt of his own. When the White House has consistently said that everything related to the impeachment inquiry, which obviously has everything to do with the president's son, has been a political stunt. That's something that the White House Press Secretary wouldn't engage on either. This is sort of an interesting difference from the last time that we saw Hunter Biden on Capitol Hill, when he, instead of sitting down for a deposition, decided to give a press conference instead and made this impassioned speech trying to separate out his own father, President Biden, from his own legal troubles. At the time, you might remember that White House officials said that had been forceful. And that the president himself had been given a heads up that he would be giving those remarks. But obviously today, the White House, much more tight-lipped and really not engaging on, again, multiple questions that they got at the White House press briefing. I can tell you for sure, there are many other things that the White House would rather be talking about, would rather be getting questions about, particularly given this moment in time that we are now in the calendar year 2024, the re-elect campaign. The election is just around the corner. This is certainly a tough issue for them and a very sensitive issue for this White House, anything related to the president's son. One question that a colleague of mine just asked in the briefing was whether this was a political headache for the White House. That's not a question that Karine Jean- Pierre would answer either.

And there are still, I think, consistently in polls, a majority. There's a majority of Americans who are concerned about Trump's action and who are reluctant to, you know, elect someone who may face the kind of legal judgments that he's facing, even amid all the discontent we know about Biden. So, in some ways, Boris, I mean, he may be trying to squeeze too much juice out of the lemon by highlighting these when he is already in such a strong position in the Republican primary.

Compare this to some of the last high-profile ones we've seen. Number one, Steve Bannon, former aide to former President Trump, who declared war from the moment the subpoena came out, and he was charged with contempt and ultimately convicted.Compare that to Mark Meadows, White House President. Chief of Staff, who actually did, despite what people think about him, go back and forth with Congress, provide some documents, and at least attempt to appear. He was not charged and not convicted.

George W. Bush at 11 points. Mike Huckabee at nine points. Of course, Donald Trump right now is ahead by 34 points on average. So, he is well ahead of anybody else in history.
