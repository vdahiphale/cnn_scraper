The next hour of CNN NEWSROOM starts right now. And you are in the CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Alisyn Camerota in New York. This morning, Donald Trump is falling further into a fundraising deficit, that's after President Biden raked in a record $26 million last night. The New York fundraiser was a display of Democratic Party unity with former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton stumping hand in hand with the incumbent. But President Biden's big night also highlighted one of his biggest challenges, winning over progressives who are angry with how he's handling the Israel-Hamas war. Multiple protesters interrupted, as you can see, the event as hundreds outside called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. CNN's M.J. Lee and Kristen Holmes join me now. M.J., let me start with you. What's the White House saying about the whole night? M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Well, for one, they're busy touting the $26 million that was raised from this single fundraiser last night. Of course, this comes from the star power of having all three presidents, a number of celebrities and musical artists all in one room, not to mention very expensive tickets, some that went up to half a million dollars a pop. And the Biden campaign already had an impressive war chest. Remember, some $71 million at the end of the month of February, almost double what the Trump campaign had. So, they've been able to add significantly to that dollar figure. And, you know, Alisyn, it's rare enough to see three presidents, one sitting and two former in this case, on stage at the same time together. But it was particularly notable because they were so focused on the other former president that wasn't in the room, and that, of course, is Donald Trump. We heard Barack Obama and Bill Clinton both echoing some of these warnings that we have heard so much from President Biden recently in terms of what a second Donald Trump presidency would look like in terms of the threat to democracy, the dangerous policies that President Biden so often talks about. I should note, network cameras were not allowed into this fundraiser, and the campaign has been releasing some clips this morning from the event. This is a little sound of President Biden talking about what is at stake as he heads into the November election. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  We're at a real inflection point in history, things are changing. This guy denies there's a global warming. This guy wants to get rid of not only Roe v. Wade, which he brags about having done, he wants to get rid of the ability of anyone, anywhere in America, to ever choose. I mean, all the things he's doing are so old. Speaking of old, and, you know, a little old and out of shape, anyway. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And one attendee I spoke with who came out of this event last night said that she was struck by how all three presidents tried to respond in real-time to interruptions to this fundraiser by showing empathy and leading into how important it is to try to understand why some of these protesters have been so impassioned.Just fascinating, of course, because both former presidents are very familiar with the situation in the Middle East. They had to deal with all of that when they were president as well. And this is now such a big issue for the current president, Joe Biden.",

Lee, Kristen Holmes, thank you very much.Turning now to the Israel-Hamas war and a promise from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, he told families of kidnapped soldiers that no Hamas hostage will be left behind. As his military prepares to enter Rafah in Southern Gaza, more than 1 million people are sheltering there. And UNICEF warns that a military operation in Rafah could be, quote, the biggest catastrophe of this war. The International Court of Justice is now calling on Israel to do more to get critical aid and supplies to the people of Gaza, as it warns that famine is settling in. Meanwhile, sources tell CNN Analyst Barak Ravid that several family members of hostages told Netanyahu that the White House treats them better than the Israeli government does. And Barak Ravid joins us now. Barak, that's very interesting. So, they confronted Netanyahu, it sounds like, about this. Why do they -- first, let me start with this. Why do they say that the U.S. government is treating them better than Netanyahu?",

They spoke with him on the phone. They met with several other senior U.S. officials, Secretary of State Blinken, CIA Director Burns, National Security Adviser Sullivan.And what they told Bibi yesterday when they met him in Tel Aviv is that, listen, you know, we get a lot of support from the White House. We get a lot of updates from the White House. They're keeping us in the loop, and we're not getting the same treatment from our own government, from the Israeli government. And Netanyahu didn't really like to hear that. And he went -- in response, he went on a rant about how, you know, the U.S., over history, told Israel, pressed Israel on many, many issues. And it's important for an Israeli prime minister to say no to the U.S. president. It wasn't clear to those families how is this connected to the hostage deal, but I think it made -- it was very clear that Netanyahu didn't like to hear it.",

This crane will help crews remove the wreckage, clear the channel and reopen the port.CNN's Gabe Cohen is on the scene for us. So, Gabe, what's the latest at this hour? Gabe, if you can hear us -- yes, I'm not sure that Gabe can hear us right now. Gabe? Okay, we'll get back to him as soon as we can for an update on what's happening at the port. But joining me now is Nick Sloane. He is a marine recovery expert and salvage master. He led the removal of the Italian cruise ship, the Costa Concordia, in 2012. You'll remember that it ran aground and capsized off the coast of Tuscany, and 32 people died in that accident. Captain Sloane and his crew of roughly 500 people managed to refloat that massive ship. The Concordia was then towed to a port and scrapped. So, Captain Sloane, thank you very much for jumping in and joining us. So, what needs to happen in Baltimore to get that huge ship, the Dali, out of port?",

Yes, obviously, this is a tragedy, one that people hoped would not happen, but obviously these ships are getting bigger and bigger, and when things go wrong, they go wrong spectacularly.So, there's a large amount of debris that's on the bow of the ship at the moment, it's on the forward section, and that's where the hazardous cargo is stowed as well. So the salvers (ph) are going to be working on identifying exactly what sort of hazardous cargo has been damaged or breached. They'll have marine chemists and taking air samples and water samples on board and around the vessel. Then they've got to make sure that they've got the right sort of chemical resistant suits and breathing apparatus to actually respond in that environment. Once that's safe, then they've got to cut away that damage on the bow section, and then get the ship re-floated and get her out of the way. The actual parallel operation will be to identify exactly what part of the bridge sections are lying in the channel, the orientation on the seabed, and, of course, with very poor visibility and cold water, and also you've got leaking hazardous cargo in that water, that makes it a lot more difficult and challenging for the divers as well.",

      "sentences": "So, Alisyn, from our vantage point, if you look over my shoulder, you can actually see that crane that they've brought in in the distance there. It is not operational yet. I spoke with an official at the command center a little while ago who told me they're hoping that it's going to begin its work later today, pulling debris from the water.We know two more cranes are on their way as we speak, according to the transportation secretary, Pete Buttigieg. But, look, this is going to be a massive project. [11:20:00] You may be looking at that crane in the distance, thinking, well, it doesn't look that big for being the largest crane vessel on the East Coast, and it speaks to the scale of this operation that that vessel is the size of the Eiffel Tower just on its side, plus the scale of that bridge, all of the steel and the concrete. And so it is going to take a lot of work. And right now, engineers are still trying to figure out how they're going to cut the bridge, those sections, into smaller pieces so they can safely and effectively remove it to the water -- from the water, I should say. And bear in mind, again, they need to do this in a very delicate and sensitive way because they still believe it's very possible that those four missing construction workers are buried down there somewhere under all of that rubble and they still want to send divers down once this operation is complete and recover those four men and offer that closure to their families. So, the more this moves forward, it does seem that this could take several days, if not weeks. And it is critical, Alisyn, that they get it done because the port of Baltimore is still shut down today. Thousands of jobs at risk millions of dollars and lost salaries and business operations here in Baltimore. So, major effects happening to the local community is this operation really gets underway.",

So, what about that, Captain, just what Gabe was saying, that, you know, they believe that there are four bodies of the construction workers, the victims, still under there, and just how delicate an operation it is to try to make it through all of this, you know, dangerous tangled metal and debris?",

You've got quite strong currents, cold water, and then you've got the threat of this chemical release from the damaged hazardous cargo that was knocked over. I believe there were some 50 containers that were knocked off the bow, and most of those will be presumed to be leaking.So, they've got to do what they call as a high definition survey, size scan survey, to get a picture of the underwater orientation of all the steel. Once they do that, then they'll put in ROVs, those are remote operated vehicles, like cameras, with baby robotic cameras, and then they can try and see if they can then confirm what the size scan survey and the drawings indicate, and they can then search in more detail. But the visibility is going to be pretty poor, so those cameras will really battle to find the bodies. And there might be a parallel operation where you move one piece of steel and then do another survey, remove the next piece, and then do a further survey. And as was mentioned, this is going to be a slow operation. It's not something that's going to take hours, days, but certainly we're looking at a week or two before that channel is open.",

The brutality does not end there. They're accusing Soto of then breaking into a home where three children were home alone. They say he beat them with a baseball bat, including one to death, 15-year-old Jenna Newcomb.
