Senate Bill 2, this was a sweeping piece of legislation signed by the California governor, set to take effect just days from now.And as you mentioned, one key component prohibits where you can carry a concealed firearm in public, so-called sensitive areas. They include places of worship, public libraries, amusement parks, sporting venues, and the like. This federal judge issuing this ruling yesterday, I'll read you part of that ruling. He said that: SB2 turns nearly every public place in California into a sensitive place, effectively abolishing the Second Amendment rights of law abiding and exceptionally qualified citizens to be armed and to defend themselves in public. So again, he issued that temporary block. Now, the California governor came out, obviously slamming this decision. This piece of legislation that he signed. Gavin Newsom saying that: This ruling outrageously calls California's data-backed gun safety efforts repugnant. What is repugnant is this ruling, which greenlights the proliferation of guns in our hospitals, libraries, and children's playgrounds, spaces which should be safe for all. Now, we'll have to wait and see what happens next with this decision. But as of now, it's temporarily blocked, guys.",

The pilot's still in control, making sure that it's fitting into the airspace the way that it's supposed to, so we don't have to worry about that.We talk about how it might have a positive impact on the ability to supply pilots, but that's not because there's fewer pilots flying the airplane. The airplanes still can control one pilot to one airplane. But the difference is that you don't have to have a layover for a pilot, the number of hours that they're waiting to get onto the next flight, all of that coordination doesn't have to occur. So, it will have a great impact on the shortage of pilots that we have today, so that will happen. Now, do I see this happening immediately? No, but I think within the next two years, you're going to see at least cargo airplanes like this one, especially in the regional space. I'm not sure the large commercial cargo planes are going to be in this for another five to 10 years. But I do think in the next two to three years, we're going to see a lot of these regional airplanes moving forward. It can also reduce the costs associated with flying the airplanes as well.",

World War I airplanes, if you can believe that, had the capability of coming back to the airport and landing themselves, and that was World War I, long, long time ago.So, the idea of autonomous flight, of an airplane that can take itself back, the reason they developed that was because if the pilots got shot, they could make sure that that airplane returned so that the enemy wouldn't get the technology that was on that airplane. So, they designed that way back then, and that was mechanical things. They worked on vacuums and lines and things like that. So, it's nothing new, but it also is new in the fact that it has integration with a lot of safety devices that can anticipate, and through, especially through AI, they can anticipate what might happen, not just what's happening at the moment and react to it but be able to do that and autonomously figure out what the best choice is to happen. It is a leap of faith. I'm totally with you on that. It's hard to say, yes, I trust that computer to do the right thing. But at the same time, you know that there's a lot more going on than what a human being could even react to at any given time.",

She's an emergency room physician, and she's the Dean of Yale's School of Public Health. What does this mean? This is really interesting to be able to get a heads up on this. DR. MEGAN RANNEY, DEAN, YALE SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH: Yes, this is a really exciting development with some caveats. So opioid use disorder is a huge problem in the United States. It developed in large part because of the promotion of opioids by folks like Purdue Pharmaceuticals and the Sackler family going back 15, 20 years ago. And we know that exposure to prescription opioids is a major risk factor for developing opioid use disorder for many people. The opportunity to have a quick genetic test to decide who is at risk of getting addicted and who it is safe to prescribe opioids to in the short term, that just has a tremendous impact for our ability to appropriately treat pain for folks with acute medical disorders. But there are some really big caveats about this new exciting test. The first is, it really is only for people who are getting prescribed opioids for a short-term problem. So, someone who's getting hip surgery or shoulder surgery, or maybe has an acute trauma. The second caution is this test is not perfect. It incorrectly identifies 20 to 30 percent of people as either being at risk of addiction or not being at risk of addiction. So, it really needs to be combined with a clinical assessment. So, the takeaway is it's an exciting development, but there are some cautions about it. So, there are a lot is going to depend on how we put it in place in the medical system.",

They then have to step up manufacturing. They have to set pricing. They have to get contracts with doctor's offices, and they have to train doctors and other healthcare providers on how to use it properly.So, I don't see this being in physicians or pharmacists or certainly consumers' hands for months to come, possibly even as long as a year, depending on how ready they are to scale up all those various parts. And importantly, it's going to be monitored really closely by the FDA once it scales up. So, stay tuned for more data on how it works.",

There's a reason why they are not completely eliminated, right, because there are situations where they can be used, should be used, and some people don't have risk factors. What is the issue with someone, say, testing positive on this? They maybe have an increased risk, and how that would interact with whether or not they might need it when they -- use it when they really need it, et cetera.",

If you break your arm or your leg, if you are undergoing surgery, if you have severe cancer that's causing pain, opioids can help ease that pain and allow people to make their way through to the other side. So, they have tremendous value when used in the right setting.The risk here is, if this genetic test says, incorrectly, that someone's at high risk of addiction, we might then as doctors feel obliged to not prescribe opioids. That then drives someone's pain up, which has its own set of problems on the other side. People who have uncontrolled pain have a higher risk of developing post-traumatic stress. They may develop chronic pain because their initial pain is not well-controlled. And as a parent, if your kid has pain, you know how much distress you're in. You can imagine as a caregiver for someone who has an acute painful condition, it's got to be frustrating to have them not have access to opioids if maybe it could have helped them.
