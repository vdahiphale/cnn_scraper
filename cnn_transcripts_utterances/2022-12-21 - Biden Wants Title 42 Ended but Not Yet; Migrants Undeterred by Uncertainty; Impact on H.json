It was the Trump administration that originally put Title 42 into place because of the pandemic. That policy was set to end today until Chief Justice John Roberts hit a pause on that deadline. The administration says it needs more time due to ongoing preparations for an influx of migrants in the upcoming days.During this limbo, migrants are facing new uncertainty, as well as freezing temperatures in the days ahead. For more, CNN, again, on both sides of the border. In the south, David Culver in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. Rosa Flores in Brownsville, Texas. Rosa, I wonder what the preparations look like now as this influx may have had delayed but it's still expected.",

And they are -- having come from many miles away, from many countries away, Jim, and having made a trek that was many months long, going through jungles, gang infested countries. And so for them to see barbed wire and a few National Guardsmen blocking, well, it's not going to dissuade them from that entrance. They're going to find another one. Because there's a determination and a desperation that Rosa spoke to that is certainly evident here.Now, just in the past few hours, overnight, we saw some major changes here at this portion. What you see behind me are hundreds of migrants who are lined up. That is the U.S. side. So they have already crossed illegally over the Rio Grande, but they're hoping to turn themselves in to then begin the processing. But this is different from where the Texas National Guards members, as well as the Texas state troopers, were set up with that barricade that rolled out just yesterday. Let me show you some of this video that one of our colleagues here captured overnight. And you're going to see a rush of migrants who are leaving that barricaded area and they are rushing about a mile to this direction. Now, why are they doing that? It seems that Customs and Border Patrol were having conversations, and they really have been the only agency to have that comfortable dialogue with the migrants over the barricade and said, come to this gate and we'll begin the processing. And little by little you've seen groups of five to ten people being allowed in to then start the processing. Those who are staying out are trying to keep warm in these freezing really very difficult conditions and they're hoping that that will continue through the next few hours and days and that they'll be able to seek their case for asylum, Jim.",

With rampant inflation and a tough economic outlook for 2023, some families aren't spending like they did in years past.Joining me now is Kayla Bruun, she's an economic analyst for Morning Consult. Kayla, good to have you on this morning. Listen, we've been covering inflation for some time. This is a time of year when people like to spend, right? They want to do nice things for the family and friends. Are we seeing inflation impacting the way people are spending these holidays?",

I think the biggest evidence we've seen so far was in last week's retail sales report where we saw that spending declined compared to October in both real and nominal terms. And I think really what we're seeing is that inflation is putting a lot more pressure on consumer budgets, making them a lot more price sensitive, maybe looking for more discounts and the ability to trade down, and that's really -- having this high inflation has just sort of eaten away at purchasing power and made it harder for consumers to spend as much as they'd like to around the holidays.",

And we've seen the Fed at least ratchet down the size of their interest rate increases from 75 basis points to 50 basis points.

And the fact that for 2022 it has not been keeping up with price growth. That basically equates to declining purchasing power all year. So that's - that's really what's gotten us to where we are.Inflation slowing is a very good sign and definitely essential for us to avoid any really major crisis next year. So, absolutely, inflation does seem to be heading in the right direction and there's reasons to think that will continue. Wage growth, though, with - as the -- if unemployment does pick up, which is likely with more rate increases, wage growth could be likely to slow as well. So, it's a bit of a question how much that gap will narrow and how quickly.",

Women there can also no longer work in most sectors, and they've been ordered to cover their faces in public. Turning back the clock.Now to a CNN exclusive. The Biden administration is taking a, quote, all-hands on deck approach to finding out just how western technology is making its way into Iranian made drones. This includes components made here in the USA. The drones, like the ones we see in this demonstration video here, are now being used by Russia to devastating effect on Ukraine. They're launching them by the hundreds into the country according to officials. CNN's Natasha Bertrand is here with more reporting. I mean, Natasha, how is this happening?
