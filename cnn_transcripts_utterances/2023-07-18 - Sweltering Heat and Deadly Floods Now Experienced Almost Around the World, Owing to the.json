Well, the searing heat wave across southern Europe is expected to get worse today with temperatures in the 40 degree range across Spain, Italy and Greece. Athens closed the Acropolis. Italian authorities are warning people to drink plenty of water and stay out of direct sunlight between 11.00 a.m. and 6.00 p.m. And in Greece, the heat has sparked 81 wildfires across the country. The Civil Protection minister says the day ahead will be difficult as hundreds of firefighters try to extinguish the flames.CNN's Barbie Nadeau is live this hour at the Trevi Fountain in Rome. She joins us now. Good morning to you, Barbie. So record high temperatures are severely impacting the lives of tourists and residents across Italy and of course other parts of southern Europe. How are people coping under these conditions? BARBIE NADEAU. CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Well, you know, there are two ways to cope with it. Either stay inside, you stay protected, which we're seeing the Italians and people who live in these southern European places do, and you see the tourists who are out here enjoying it. You know, as you said, they're supposed to stay out of the direct sun during the hottest part of the day, but we've seen day in and day out here that these tourists are just taking advantage of the time they have in Rome. They're at these sites, Trevi Fountain here. There are far more people standing in the shade than there are in the sun here. But, you know, as the day wears on, there's just no space and they'll have no choice but to stand in the sun. Now the city of Rome provides lots of free fresh water to drink, there are lots of fountains to dip your hands into and things like that to cool off, but the real concern is just the duration of this heat. It's going to be really hot today and there are a lot of people who are not going to take that advice who are going to stay outside and that's what the authorities are worried about. Rosemary?",

So while it seems practical, it's not necessarily, you know, viable for a lot of people.But there is water around. You know, you can go to almost any part of Rome and fill up a water bottle and drink water. Hydration, wear a hat, wear sunscreen. You know, we've seen some spectacular sunburns on the tourists here wandering around Rome because, of course, if you've spent a lot of money and a lot of planning on a vacation for just a few days in a city like Rome or Florence or even south in Sicily, you know, you're going to want to take advantage of it. So it's really a hard balance for them, a lot of them. A lot of the people that we've been talking to just say, we've just got to do it. We only have two days here. And so they're doing it. But, you know, we've talked so much about the real sort of silent killer that heat can be. And when we see temperatures hit 40 or above, as we're expecting here in Rome today, you know, that is detrimental. That's when it gets very, very serious.

Temperatures in China's Xinjiang province reached an all-time high of 52.2 degrees Celsius. Four other stations recorded temperatures higher than 50 degrees. And in Japan, three cities broke their all-time high records. And South Korea is still reeling from a weekend of deadly floods. The country's president is promising to overhaul the nation's approach to extreme weather. Anna Coren reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANNA COREN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Apocalyptic scenes in South Korea as an onslaught of torrential rain causes flooding and landslides, leaving more than 40 people dead and thousands in shelters. In Yecheon, about 200 kilometers south of the capital Seoul, a landslide enveloped around 30 homes in mud, killing multiple people. South Korea's President Yoon Suk-yeol visited the area on Monday. He promised to mobilize all resources to help with the disaster, including the police and military. Yoon also met with local residents made homeless, who are now gathering in a community shelter. He pledged to build new homes for those who had lost their homes. KIM CHUN-JA, RESIDENT (through translator): People don't have a place to live. We're gathering here because we have to eat and we have to sleep. COREN (voice-over): The rains have pummeled central and southern regions of the country since Thursday, and another deluge is expected in the coming days. Authorities say more than 40 cultural heritage sites have been damaged, including temples listed on the UNESCO World Heritage List. On Saturday, another disaster unfolded in the town of Osong, about 130 kilometers south of Seoul. A levee broke and flooded a nearby underpass in just minutes. Seventeen vehicles were trapped, including a bus and its passengers. The search has now ended after rescuers pulled out 14 bodies. Locals criticized the decision to keep the road open despite a flood warning. South Korea's president blamed the failure of the authorities to follow disaster response rules and he warned that they need to do a lot more to prepare for the future. YOON SUK-YEOL, SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT (through translator): This kind of extreme weather event will become commonplace. We must accept climate change as happening and deal with it. The idea that extreme weather linked to climate change is an anomaly and can't be helped needs to be completely overhauled. COREN (voice-over): Yoon's words will echo with other world leaders facing similar threats to their population, as Asia, the U.S. and Europe suffer record-breaking heat waves and severe flooding this summer.

That deal has enabled ships to safely transit the Black Sea to deliver Ukrainian grain to Turkish ports, a total of some 33 million metric tons since the agreement was reached a year ago. But Russia says the deal is unfair because it hasn't been able to export its own foods and fertilizers due to financial sanctions.Moscow says it will consider reviving the deal if its grievances are addressed. But the fear now is that grain prices will soar, straining cash-strapped countries that depend on Ukrainian grain to feed their people. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he is consulting with the deal's other parties, notably Turkey and the U.N., to make the deal work without Moscow's cooperation.

But relatively large-scale attack in a region that is no stranger to these overnight aerial sorts of port facility damaged in Odessa as well. Odessa, of course, one of the largest, or the largest port in Ukraine and one of those ports that's included in that now-defunct Black Sea grain deal. So perhaps not a coincidence President Putin had promised to seek retaliation for the Kerch Bridge attack. And this morning we're hearing from the head of President Zelenskyy's office also believes this was likely Russia's revenge, saying the world must realize that the goal of Russia is hunger and killing people. They need waves of refugees. He says this is how they want to weaken the West. Separately, the Russian Ministry of Defense this morning is saying that it thwarted an attempted drone attack by Ukraine on the Crimean Peninsula involving 28 drones. They say all of them were averted, either shot down or thrown, of course, by electronic warfare, they say. So, significant aerial activity over that southern region overnight, Rosemary.",

And he said that Russia's agricultural food exports are, in his words, stabilizing. We have heard from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, who said a couple of months ago that they think that this agricultural year, which just ended in June for Russia, will show record wheat exports. So it is unclear at the moment. what it would take for Russia to rejoin this deal.

In the coming hours, U.S. President Joe Biden will meet Israeli President Isaac Herzog in Washington. The two leaders will discuss ways to create a more peaceful and prosperous Middle East, among other things. It comes as the White House says President Biden will probably meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later this year.

At a weekend event in Chicago interrupted by pro-Palestinian activists, Jayapal said -- REP. PRAMILA JAYAPAL (D-WA): We have been fighting to make it clear that Israel is a racist state, that the Palestinian people deserve self-determination and autonomy. RAJU (voice-over): The remark ricocheted across the political spectrum and forced Democratic leaders to issue a rare rebuke of her comment on Sunday evening. Apologizing to those she offended, Jayapal said in a statement, I attempted to defuse a tense situation during a panel where fellow members of congress were being protested. I do not believe that the idea of Israel as a nation is racist. REP. BRAD SCHNEIDER (D-IL): I spoke to her several times yesterday. I think she understands that she misspoke. Israel is not a racist state. RAJU (voice-over): The controversy comes amid growing tension among progressives over the actions taken by the Israeli government and sympathy for the Palestinian cause.

Kerry said in a tweet and let me read you some of that the climate crisis demands the world's two largest economies to work together to limit the earth's warming and take urgent action on coal and methane pollution.

And this wasn't just a bunch of little known worry words. These were some of the founders of the field like Jeffrey Hinton, Ashwag Benjoo. It was the CEOs of the top companies that are building this. Sam Altman from OpenAI, for example, who gave us ChatGPT, said it might mean lights out for all of us. So what the experts are saying, and what the politicians at the United Nations are listening to now is that, hey, you know, this is happening, not in a distant future. It's happening really soon. So let's get prepared.",

In biotech, nobody would tolerate that a company starts selling a brand new medicine in supermarkets before they've gone through some sort of regulatory approval to show that this medicine is safe and that the benefits that it has are real and outweigh the risks. Whereas in A.I. today, we're in this complete Wild West scenario where companies can do more or less whatever they want and the government is all playing catch up.",

Twitter did not even formally begin discussing a separation agreement with them until after CNN reported on their case.And after that, these employees feel that they were lowballed by Twitter. They were reluctantly forced into accepting this severance offer of three months' pay as well as repatriation costs for foreign workers who had moved into Ghana for their job and the legal cost of the negotiating process. But after agreeing on all that back in May, they haven't heard back from the company. I want to read a statement from the lawyer, Carla Olympio, who's been representing them. She says, unfortunately, it appears that after having unethically implemented their terminations in violation of their own promises and Ghana's laws, dragging the negotiation process out for over half a year, now that we have come to the point of almost settlement, there has been complete silence from them for several weeks. The attorney representing these former Twitter Africa employees says she is considering legal options for action against Twitter and other jurisdictions including Ghana. And this is not hundreds of employees. There were just 11 people who are asking for this severance from Twitter and they feel that the world's richest man surely can afford to pay them.

I think we need to spend into research, but for me what clubs should be doing right now and what national teams should be doing is spend directly into your medical teams because in the end research will give us a solution in maybe five, six years time, where at least a financial change or like a change in your medical team might give us a solution right now.",
