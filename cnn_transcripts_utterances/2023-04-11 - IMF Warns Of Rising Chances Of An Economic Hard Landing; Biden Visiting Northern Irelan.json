Thank you.I'm reading the notes about this and it is interesting, it is sort of, on the one hand -- on the other hand, as it so often is in economics, in that you admit that inflation is coming down, but at the same time, not fast or far enough and you're still talking about growth slowing down and the possibility of a hard landing. PIERRE-OLIVIER GOURINCHAS, ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH, INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND: Yes, that is right. I mean, we have a baseline scenario that is one of modest growth this year, 2.8 percent, just revised a tad from our January projection by 0.1 percentage point and increasing back a little bit next year, and headline inflation coming back down. But core inflation, as you pointed out has still not turned the corner in many countries. In Europe, it is still increasing. It has not started decreasing. In the US, it is sort, of we get different readings from one month to another, but certainly not as has been decisively coming down, so inflation has proved more persistent. It's actually one of the reasons why we have a mild downgrade, is we anticipate that there will be a need for monetary policy to remain tighter for longer.",

The main concern we haveis that the downside risks around that scenario have increased a lot since our last round of projection, and that is largely because of the financial instability episode we've had. And there are two channels here and they are playing at sort of different speed and different strength. One is that, you know, as a result of this financial instability, banks around the world, certainly in the US, but also in the Euro area, and other advanced economies, you could look around and say, well, you know, maybe now is not the time to extend a lot of credit. And so we will have to watch and see, but there could well be a lending -- a credit crunch coming down the pike in a number of countries. Now, mind you --",

There could be surprises to inflation because it has been proving more persistent in the last few reads that we've had, and so that might require a little bit more tightening. But again, on the other side, you have this lending contraction that might sort of do the job for the Fed or the European Central Bank. Now, this is one thing and we've tried to quantify this. You know, if there is a lot of lending contraction, then in fact, we could see growth slowing down faster. We have in our report, we call a plausible alternative scenario. So it is to say, you know, here is another way things could unfold. And it is, you know, quite reasonable that it might unfold that way, and with that lending crunch, the credit crunch, then we would have growth of about 2.5 percent, instead of 3.8.",

Although, it's not clear what the diagnosis was because none of them have been told what the issue is. Here's the most worrying thing about what Kira Yarmysh, she's saying. She's saying this, we don't rule out that at this time in prison, Navalny could have been poisoned with something to make his health deteriorate slowly but steadily. I mean, that sounds sort of fantastical. But when you consider the context of Alexei Navalny and the fact that in August 2020, he was diagnosed as being poisoned with Novichok, a Soviet era nerve agent, then -- you know, you can see why, you know, there's such concern about this latest health scare. It's not the first time there's been a health scare. In fact, just in January, 500 doctors in Russia signed an open letter calling from more medical attention for Alexei Navalny because they feel that he is being mistreated and, you know, basically, his medical conditions not being properly looked at while he is in solitary confinement for much of the time in that high security penal colony, Richard.",
