And I think remember separation of church and state, but not to mention just the sort of -- he -- I mean, he consistently is trying to find a way to make money and puff himself up. And he's getting increasingly comfortable with this idea of comparing himself to Jesus. And I just have to say, as a Christian, particularly on Easter, and attacking this day that is also -- it is Easter. It is also the day that we recognize transgender people. God and Jesus did not preach hate and they were not for attacking diversity. And Donald Trump takes every opportunity he can to attack diversity, to demonize the other. And that is not Christian values, in my mind, as a Christian. [09:45:14] FMR. REP. BARBARA COMSTOCK (R-VA):  Well, first of all, you can get your Bibles usually at a church free. You can also get it online free. On Amazon, I think the bestselling one is probably about $15, so get them a lot cheaper than that. But, also, in very serious terms, I -- you showed this earlier. On Good Friday, Donald Trump was very viciously posting that very ugly post that you showed earlier of a bound Joe Biden in the back of that truck. And that was on the day where Christians are commemorating the crucifixion of Jesus. That's when Donald Trump thought he would post that very ugly, violent picture. So this is very serious, because we know when Donald Trump does these violent, very un-Christian things, they have consequences. And you have his supporters do ugly things and threaten people. So that's much more serious and un-Christian and dangerous. These kind of things aren't spoken out about and people aren't asked to respond on those. And I think we need to see responses from people on those kind of actions. And I'd like to see actions and responses on that a lot more.",
