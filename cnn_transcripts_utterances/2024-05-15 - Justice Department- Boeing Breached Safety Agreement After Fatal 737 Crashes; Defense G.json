Sustained.\" With us now, CNN legal analyst and criminal defense attorney, Joey Jackson. That's not all the judge said. The judge told Todd Blanche you can't do this.

There's not another active front line where the Russians are seeing success -- they've been seeing success and moving forward in the east quite dramatically over the past week.What they did on Friday is launch a significant new invasion, frankly, from their territory into parts of Ukraine that they'd been kicked out two years ago. And it's, frankly, depressing to be back here -- this was a front line two years ago that we worked around -- to see now this potentially under threat again. Now, the Russians have come at this with force, resources. They've not found the Ukrainians ready. We've not driven past significant fortifications on the way to here -- two places where they're being urgently built we did see. And key to all of this is a town called Vovchansk. Now, that is on the border. We were there when they were kicked out two years ago but now the Russians are back it seems. A local police chief talking about hearing gunfire in and around the city, so it seems that most generous the Russians are certainly on the outskirts. And Ukraine's military talking about how they'd moved to more favorable positions over the last 24 hours. That's sort of a euphemism for a form of retreat. So clearly, Russia on the forefoot there. They have other key settlements in their sights, too -- one of which, Lyptsi, might potentially enable them to shell Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-biggest city. You'll remember, a place where millions that have felt a while calm, the ability to get back to normal life and is now facing the possibility of continued shelling. They've heard airstrikes over the past days or so. And so, all of this a reflection of how Russia appears to have got its resources together, to have turned its economy into a wartime one, and regained its focus and its manpower, while Ukraine has been left with its morale cratered because this six months it's had to wait for that $61 billion. Back in December, people were talking about how if they didn't get it they were finished. They've had to wait five or six months. That's starved them of ammunition on the front lines to stop Russian advances. That's left them questioning where they have to essentially devote what little they have left. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

That we have put this $62 billion package forward. That we have made the statements that we will continue to work together. NATO is stronger than it's ever been. And so, collectively, together, we can make sure that we stop Russia and Russia's aggression because we know how imperative that is. We've been saying it on our side of the aisle and the president has been saying it all along that we know that if we don't, Russia would not stop in Ukraine. And they will go to our NATO allies, and we would then have to go into section five of the NATO and all of us would have to come together. But I am a firm believer -- no one thought that Ukraine would still be there two weeks after the war started. Here we are two years later. So all I know and I believe firmly is that once Ukraine gets the weapons that they need and our allies now see that we are standing up and we're not running, they too will then give Ukraine what it needs, and then that will then begin to reverse this aggression that Russia has put forward when Ukraine did not have the ability to fight back.",

New Orleans is known for the drinking scene, but there was no glass recycling program for all those empty bottles. One woman saw that as an opportunity to become a champion for change. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FRANZISKA TRAUTMANN, CO-FOUNDER, GLASS HALF FULL:  Behind me is what we affectionately refer to as Glass Mountain. Glass Half Full started, like most good ideas, over a bottle of wine. We realized that like every other glass bottle in the state of Louisiana it would end up in a landfill because we didn't have adequate glass recycling systems. Glass comes from sand, so we hatched a plan to recycle glass back into sand. Sand is the second most exploited resource after water. The first thing we thought of was coastal restoration because that's where sand is needed in our state of Louisiana. We are losing land at such an incredibly fast rate -- about a football field's worth of land every 100 minutes. Our coast in Louisiana is our livelihood. I'm from a small town in Louisiana and I grew up a lot around nature and around a bayou. Ultimately, I just wanted to protect the environment and be a part of it. We have pick-up programs and we have drop-off programs where folks can bring their glass to us. It'll be crushed into a mixture of sand and gravel, separated by size. To date, we have recycled more than six million pounds of glass and we will have done about six coastal restoration projects. By the avenue (PH) is a lot of open water and we hope in the future that it's restored to a healthy wetland. We partnered with 10 different scientists and engineers there to test the safety and the feasibility of doing this and now we're really translating that lab research into action. We have a restoration mix-out today and we'll be using it to build these islands and plant grasses and trees. We have a ton of partners on the ground to help with restoration projects.

All of this, the psychiatrist was going to testify to say that he suffered from intergenerational trauma and a fear of scarcity.
