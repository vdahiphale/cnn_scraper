The conversation comes just after Russia launched a new barrage of deadly assaults, more than 80 attacks reported overnight.CNN's Nic Robertson joins us now from Kyiv. Nic, let us know what more that you're hearing about these phone calls this morning and what was said.",

      "sentences": "Well, we know that the Ukrainians gave General Mark Milley and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan an account of how they feel the battlefield is looking at the moment. Of course, huge expectations on the Russian that Ukraine is about to launch a counteroffensive. So, no doubt they both have a better understanding of what the Ukrainians are actually thinking at the moment. We know that they discussed the supply of weapons and ammunition.There are certain types of ammunition that Ukraine particularly wants at this time in the -- in advance of what they're calling, not a counteroffensive but actually a spring summer campaign. They're giving the idea that this fight this summer when it comes is not just a quick offensive and over after a few weeks. So, this will be a long hard- fought campaign through the summer. It is very clear from the conversations we're having here, and I expect this is part of a discussion, that the Ukrainians want to make sure when this big campaign begins, that they have everything in place that they. And perhaps, as well, the generals would have discussed what the weather has been like recently, it's been pouring down a bit rain today. We've been in the north. [10:35:00] The fields are flooded up there. And what that means on the frontline roads where there might be a counteroffensive in the future, they're very heavily bogged down in mud and not really in a state of use for the movement of troops quickly to a fate a -- to affect a good counteroffensive. But in terms of Russia's response strikes overnight on Mykolaiv in the south, four S-300 surface-to-air missiles fired there, one person killed, 23 injured, one of them a child. And then further north in Zaporizhzhia, again, an area where Russia thinks that Ukraine might launch a counteroffensive through that area, Russia launching 83 different strikes, seven air strikes, five UAV's there, two multiple rocket launcher attacks, 69 different artillery strikes. All in that one area. And we know there that two men were killed in those strikes. So, Russia, keeping up an offensive where it thinks Ukraine potentially might launch its counteroffensive from.",

It's been nearly a year since the mass shooting that killed 19 fourth graders and two teachers at the school. More than 200 people have been interviewed as part of this review of the law enforcement response.

What was the communications between these other officers and the agencies that were involved?And remember, there were some 400 law enforcement officials on scene from several different agencies, some that we've never even heard about before until this happened that show up at the scene. It's a chaos. No one's taking control. They know kids are inside. They're getting 9-1-1 calls from kids that are inside and no one just takes action. So, the key thing they're looking at is leadership. Why was there such a lack of leadership on scene? What was the command structure? There was no command, there was no incident command which was a big, big problem because no one was taking charge. No one was really making any decisions. A lot of the blame, John, as you know has been placed on the school police chief who was fired by the school board. But you know, that blame is really now shared by everyone, by all the other different law enforcement agencies that were there as our reporting has really showed, none of them took charge.

And she's kind of -- I mean, parents believe she's been interfering the mayor there of that city, feels that she's been interfering in the investigations. And I think that's part of why we're seeing this delay as well.But think -- I mean, this is year. There was a lot of evidence. There is hours and hours, I mean, thousands of hours of body camera footage, some of which -- most of which I've seen. There are -- almost every officer who's on scene there was interviewed.

I'll tell you what they said.They said that they looked at more 900 than people who are obese of overweight and also had type II diabetes. On average they were starting at about 222 pounds and they lost, the study was 17 months- long, they lost 34 pounds. So, that is really pretty impressive weight loss if that's what -- that last analysis turns out to be. But -- and this is a big but, there were side effects. There were side effects such as nausea or diarrhea, and that was one in five people. One in five people had nausea or diarrhea, that's not a small number. And there were also a fair number of people who had other unpleasant side effects like constipation. I mean, it was -- some of these are really not fun. But even worse, the company, Eli Lilly, says that there can be serious -- there may be serious side effects like pancreatitis, kidney problems, thyroid cancer. So, you know, I think patients are really going to -- want to think about whether or not they want to take these risks. For some who are morbidly obese, and they are going to run into all sorts of terrible health problems because of that, taking these risks might be worth it. Kate.",
