First of all, I would take the word of the people on the ground, including Republican governors, who are not saying any of the things that you're saying. Republican governors have actually been praising the Biden administration and praising FEMA for moving and doing a good job. Thank you for putting it up.This is not -- this is coming from the people who have any responsibility today. People who have responsibility today are working hard, and they're getting support from the government. The reality is it has been the Republicans in Congress, unfortunately, who have been unwilling to fully fund FEMA. FEMA has been saying all year that they will need more money. They will need more money because we're having more storms, because we're having more disasters, and those disasters are getting bigger and it costs more money. Now, I don't know what Marjorie Taylor Greene is talking about. Maybe she thinks the Jewish space lasers are changing the weather, but I'll leave that to her. But FEMA does need more money, but the money they need should be appropriated by Congress. It's not being given to immigrants. And I'm very, very concerned here because when people are hurt, when people are scared, you want good leadership to have people turn to each other and not on each other. What's happening right now is some Republicans, not the ones who have responsibility, but others, are really interested in having people turn on each other, turn against immigrants, turn against newcomers, as opposed to doing what people on the ground are doing, which is turning to each other to help. I would really encourage Republicans who do not have any responsibility right now to follow the ones that do.",

They downgraded the previous years by a million jobs, a million jobs. So, that's not really a credible measure any longer.And people can ask the simple question and none of -- nobody can spin it. Are you better off than you were four years ago? And the strong feeling, and we see it in polling regularly, rolls in around two to one the other way. And so, if she can't separate herself from the economic record of this administration before voting really gets going, she's going to have a serious problem.

We're definitely better off than we were four years ago. And also, it is definitely -- you know, Donald Trump inherited a great economy from Barack Obama, slowed it down. We had a manufacturing recession under him, and then tanked the economy under COVID. So, we can argue back and forth.But I think where Ken is right is that people don't trust these numbers. They don't care about these numbers. These reports are good for political elites like us, of ordinary people who are looking around trying to see, am I -- do I have any hope, do I feel any better, and do I think any of these leaders are going to help me. I think Kamala Harris has done a good job of beginning to make the case. But, as you have to remember, she has only been running for president for a couple months here. Donald Trump has been running for president for 10 years and still can't tell you what he's going to do on healthcare. And so, what I think Kamala Harris has done, when she makes the case that she's going to do something concrete on housing, not blaming immigrants for the housing crisis, but something concrete, I think that helps. If she makes a case that she's going to get more loans to small businesses, I think that helps. But this week, nobody pay attention. She came out. She finally sounded like a Silicon Valley innovation first Democrat, which is what she is from our home state, from California, and talked about crypto, talked about innovation. She kind of let Donald Trump steal the march on her on that issue from her for a minute. She has now caught back up on that. Look, she's got to make that case brick by brick by brick.

And we know that using deadly force requires a threat of imminent bodily injury or death, and shooting your parents in the back of the head while they're watching T.V. and eating ice cream doesn't really qualify. California is unique in that it has imperfect self-defense, which means that if you genuinely believe that you're at risk, even if it's unreasonable, it does reduce murder to manslaughter. And, of course, the brothers were convicted of first-degree murder, sentenced to life without the possibility of parole because they avoided the death penalty.
