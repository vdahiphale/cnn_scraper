I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.We begin the hour with Donald Trump returning in front of a judge this morning as lawyers for the former president and E. Jean Carroll are set to square off in Manhattan's Federal Appeals Court. Trump is seeking an appeal after a jury found he sexually abused and defamed the former columnist, awarding her $5 million following a trial last year. The case is separate from the related defamation trial that was held earlier this year when a jury awarded Carroll $83 million, again, you should recall that. CNN's Kristen Holmes is with me now. Kristen. What do we know about this appeal? And why is Trump expected in court?",

The jury determined that he never once was in the courtroom, and he never once called a single witness. So, clearly, he is putting on a bit of a show here, something that he likes to do around his court appearances. They say that he wants to face his accuser in court. They will both be here.So, here's what we know right now about this appeal. We know that both Trump, as I said, and E. Jean Carroll will both be in attendance. That is obviously significant, especially given the fact that he never showed up before. There are no cameras allowed in court. The hearing is expected to last just roughly 30 minutes. And I will add here, that's not on here, but just to add, they don't expect a decision today. They don't even think one is likely before the election. Each side will get about ten minutes for oral arguments. This is obviously, as you said, separate from the defamation trial that awarded Carroll $83.3 million in damages. And Donald Trump has announced that afterwards, he's going to be delivering remarks or giving a press conference. They're calling it a press conference. We always try to hedge, so sometimes he just doesn't take questions at Trump Tower.",

We're going to be hearing about specific evidentiary arguments today, specifically with respect to the Access Hollywood tape and how that came out during the use of a deposition excerpt for Mr. Trump, as well as other witnesses to other ladies that had accused Mr. Trump of similar conduct.And given the fact that it is a federal appellate case, it will go under advisement to the bench.

Of course, we have Mr. Trump there who really knows how to run the circus, so to speak, so that's an unusual feature.But the thing that is so fascinating to me handling a lot of federal civil litigation is that the arguments today are going to be talking about the weight and the admission of certain evidence. Well, it's hard to argue with the scorer when you don't put your players out on the field. Since they didn't have any witnesses in the case, the balance of evidence is going to ultimately also go to whether any error constitutes reversible error. Remember, with the witnesses that were part on in the case to talk about whether he engaged in kind of a pattern, if Team Trump knew how to handle discovery in civil litigation case, they would have at a minimum taken a couple of depositions of video by a couple of female colleagues that they could play as deposition excerpts during the trial to be able to rebut that pattern evidence, that's basic federal litigation 101. They didn't even do that. So, this is pretty unusual in a few different dimensions.",

And the question is going to be whether the judge, Judge Louis Kaplan, who was the trial judge, whether he abused his discretion in allowing those other women to testify in addition to the Access Hollywood tape, where he admitted to essentially, forcefully touching women in their private areas. And, you know, the plaintiff, Ms. Carroll in her case, argue that tends to show what he does and his modus operandi, which is -- you know, or his M.O. That's what the exception is to allow this type of evidence.And so that's what they're going to argue in this appeal is whether the judge abused his discretion.

FRED GUTTENBERG, LOST DAUGHTER JAIME IN 2018 PARKLAND SHOOTING: Listen, the father should be charged. The book should be thrown at him. The father bought the gun for this kid after the FBI visited and law enforcement visited. The father absolutely is responsible and must be held to account.

You know, I joined the Brady Pack as a senior adviser because there is only one way to solve the incorrect assessments and the bad policy prescriptions of people like J.D. Vance, and it's to make sure we get them out of the world of politics and we get them out of any decision-making when it comes to our public safety. What J.D. Vance says is a fact of life. Well, for me, that would be true. I visit my daughter at the cemetery. But I will tell you, last year, we invited every member of Congress to walk through the Parkland school where my daughter was shot. It is still an untouched crime scene. The blood is there. The DNA is there. The coursework was still on the desks, as if the kids had just walked away from them. J.D. Vance never showed up. He didn't come. But you know who did? Kamala Harris. Kamala Harris came and walked that building with me. Because rather than thinking this as a fact of life that we need to accept, she wanted to see everything that led to the tragedy that could have been done to stop it and how we actually need to rethink schools and public safety going forward in a world where there are 400 million-plus weapons that aren't only making their ways into schools but making them to political rallies. I mean, J.D. Vance forgets Donald Trump was shot just a couple of months ago. And so this is not something we have to say is a fact of life. It is uniquely American.
