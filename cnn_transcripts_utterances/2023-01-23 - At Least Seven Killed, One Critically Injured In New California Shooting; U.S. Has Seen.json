It was around 4:30 P.M., local time when this 67-year-old male, apparently, once the sheriff's substation. And it appears that he was going to turn himself in but it was a sheriff deputy that saw him in his car because they already knew what car he was in. And so this deputy was able to arrest the 67-year-old Half Moon Bay resident. He was taken into custody. We know that the D.A. is working on interviewing him at the moment. They're trying to figure out exactly how this happened, and why it happened. But as you mentioned, authorities are saying they do not have a motive at this moment. They believe he was an employee at one of these nurseries. They believe that the people that were killed were also workers at the farm or the nursery, however you want to call it. But we know that these families are being notified and told their loved one is longer with us. Again, seven people, one in critical condition. Governor Gavin Newsom tweeting that he was meeting the victims of one shooting here in Southern California when he got pulled away to be briefed on this are the shooting. So, what the governor was saying is tragedy upon tragedy. That is what we are hearing tonight, and, again, the seven people who are dead at the moment.

But they are enforced unevenly, education is uneven and we have to really work. This all operationalizes at the local level. So, we have to keep working with local police on enforcing those red flag laws, but looking at every aspect of those, to the guns themselves, to micro tracing bullets, everything that is looking at accountability in the process are things that we are looking at right now.

There has not been somebody and often cases where the person has survived their attack. They have behaved in a matter to then commit suicide, it seems, in many instances.

There is the demonization of a huge umbrella term of mental health. Then there is the dismissal, as you mentioned, of same race crimes and not thinking hate crimes.And I wonder, and it's akin to thinking, oh, you must have to boil the ocean in order to get anything, but there are incremental thanks. I do want to ask you from your background in law enforcement in particular, Michael Fanone, there is -- for lack of a better term, there's a stereotype that often emerges from the pattern of people involved in mass shootings.

And shock and just sadness over a tragedy of loss of life and more violence. And the community, like ours, which is very safe. Monterey Park is a safe community. It's a community for families move to raise their children, to go to good schools, great restaurants, and businesses. And this weekend, especially, because it was our Lunar New Year festival. It was the beginning of the Lunar New Year weekend celebration. And so, people are just in disbelief and shocked and just quite feeling numb, and I think that's what all of us are feeling right now.

That's why mainly young black and brown people are afraid of interacting with the police.I know Chief Davis. She's a member of NOBLE. She's a former -- past president. I am not surprised that they had been terminated because I know how she would respond to such a horrible use of force, a three- minute beating as what we're hearing that took place on this young man. So, young people are seeing these videos, they are on YouTube. They are on many media platforms out there, and because video is so available today on cell phones and body cam, we're starting to see what people have been telling us for a very, very long time. We're black, people have been telling us for a very, very long time about their interactions with the police.",

But I, too, know Chief Davis, and for her to take that strong action tells me and she has seen the video, that their actions were way out of policy and inconsistent with training. The likelihood of criminal charges is probably very high. And she was able to take decisive action.Now, it's not a one-size fits all situation. There are some departments where because of the collective bargaining agreement, a chief can't take that kind of action that quickly. But fortunately, she was able to take direct action, which I think goes a long way to show that, you know, she is a transformational type of leader. But I do need to see the video to know exactly what took place. I understand the emotion of the family and attorneys and all that sort of things.

It's a white officer attacking a black man, unarmed black man has been the most prolific and prevalent narrative that has been out there. These are five black officers.

So, that also can happen as well.I'm not saying that's what happened in this case.
