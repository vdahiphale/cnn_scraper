The U.S. embassy in Khartoum has now suspended operations. Violence in Sudan broke out more than a week ago.

Because it was so volatile there was a declared 72-hour ceasefire between the warring factions. But according to our reporting, it wasn't holding and there were violations. But in the end, the decision had to be made and was made that there was enough of a window there to get in across a long route. This is a flight of some 750 or more miles from Djibouti to Khartoum. And then, of course, pick up the embassy members and their family, and then get them out. So it was an operation that was carried out successfully. The safe evacuation via military aircraft out of Khartoum. And as you pointed out, that means the embassy for now is closed in Khartoum. The question what happens from here? There are thousands of dual citizens, Sudanese Americans in there, who may be trying to get out or maybe monitoring the situation. DOD said in a briefing after the completion of the evacuation mission that they're considering a number of options, including monitoring from above the land routes out that would either be the port of Sudan, where you could get out by sea or trying to make it to one of the land crossings. They're also considering setting up deconfliction lines or mechanisms to try to keep in touch with the warring parties there. To see if it's possible to do something like that, some way to guarantee a safe way out, or at least a safer way out. If there are any American citizens there who are looking to get out, Fredricka, they're still monitoring the situation very closely. The fighting there now entering its second week.",

It was American Airlines Flight 1958 that left the airport headed to Phoenix when, at one point, according to officials that apparently hit a flock of birds, and that's when authorities say the pilots and just some really talented crew here, then quickly running into this emergency situation and then returning to the airport. The airline confirming that that Boeing 737 experienced a bird strike, causing a mechanical issue. The airline saying that the flight landed and taxied safely at the gate under its own power. The aircraft taken out of service and now the airline trying to get them to their final destination. The passengers that is. The FAA investigating this video from a separate incident. This one, though, on Thursday evening, capturing some really scary moments of passenger looking out her window and seeing this. This is American Airlines Flight 2288, with service from Charlotte-Douglas airport to Dallas. This one never even got off the ground. The plane was in the process of taxiing.

So let's dig a little deeper into these laws and what they do because there are important here. So the laws will allow the state of Mississippi to expand reach of state control law enforcement to the entire city of Jackson. Now this is a force that has primarily stuck to protecting the capital and the surrounding area. This is not a force that has been engaged with city law enforcement up until now. This is a force that does not answer to local officials but to state appointed leadership. Here's the other part of these laws. The judicial system, major changes coming to that, including establishing a new court within the boundaries of a new capital complex improvement district. The judge there will be appointed by the Republican state chief justice and the prosecuting attorneys appointed by the Republican state attorney general. Let's listen to one of the supporters of the laws that actually signed them into laws, Governor Tate Reeves. He spoke about this before doing the sighting. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. TATE REEVES (R), MISSISSIPPI: I won't what's best for Jackson, but for us to continue to see young kids getting killed in the streets, for us to continue to see property crimes that are happening here, that are causing businesses to leave, we've got to make sure that we have law and order, and I don't think there's any doubt that if you talk to businesses, if you talk to the residents of Jackson, capitol police shows up when there's a crime being committed and they're called.

A guaranteed sort of market for startups like Charm. You have to come up with a whole verification system, as I mentioned there. So, you know, how do you pay a farmer who is maybe grazing his livestock in a way that brings down an extra ton of carbon a year? How do you compensate him when you compare him to Peter's operation or somebody who works with seaweed or rock weathering or all these other machines? Some are $1,000 a ton now. Peter's $500 a ton.
