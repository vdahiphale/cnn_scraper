President Biden, in the meantime, making headlines today after sitting down with the cohosts of ABC's views, saying he's confident he would have beaten former President Trump in November, but at peace with his decision to exit the race. Let's go to M.J. Lee over at the White House. M.J., what more did the president have to say?M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Jim, you know, whether the White House is using this precise description or not, the President is clearly on his legacy tour. It's not clear that he would have sat down for a live interview on The View where he's still seeking a second term. And it is one of the many things that we are seeing him do in recent days to try to set the record straight, to burnish his legacy, and also put in a good word for his Vice President, Kamala Harris, who, of course, is the new Democratic nominee. It's been two months since the President dropped out. And he did say in this interview that he was at peace with that difficult decision. He also said that ultimately, age was a deciding factor. And when it comes to his Vice President seeking the presidency, he said that he believes that she has what it takes to defeat Donald Trump, and that the one piece of advice he would have for her is to stay true to herself. And he, again, interestingly noted that it wasn't because he thought that he was going to be defeated by Donald Trump that he decided to drop out of the race. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We, of course, have reported that U.S. officials are scrambling to see if that can be avoided. But the other thing that we have noted, Jim, and we have reported is that U.S. officials here in the administration, they have all but paused, making an effort to try to get a ceasefire deal across the finish line, believing that there is currently no political will on either side, that is Israel or Hamas. So this is one way in which we are seeing the situation in Lebanon really complicating what is clearly one of the most important foreign policy legacy pieces for the President as he's staring down the final months of his presidency, Jim.",

And one of the things he really wanted to talk about was the 30th anniversary of the Violence Against Women's Act. He considers it his greatest legislative accomplishment, something he's very proud of.And that has changed America for the better. That's what he was there to talk about. But I do think that he, you know, I do think that he wants to show himself, support Kamala Harris, show that he's at peace with this decision. And I think he's setting an example for passing the torch. I think he's setting an example for putting your country first. Like he has said now several times, he loved this job. He loves sitting behind the resolute desk and being president of the United States, but he loves his country more. And I think that's what he was there to tell us. And I also think part of what he wants to do as he's, you know, about to leave a 50-year career in public service is call to America's better angels, and remind us of the opportunities and possibilities of America when we are united.",

And it's kind of like a weird answer, Brianna, because on the one hand, you know, you're condemning divisive political and hostile political rhetoric, but at the same time, you have to condemn your opponent, your former opponent, Donald Trump, who commits that.
