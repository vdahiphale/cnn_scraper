Israel is also signaling that it is expanding its ground operation in Southern Lebanon. Israel has issued more evacuation warnings telling people to move north of the Awali River to save their lives. It says a strike killed several Hezbollah commanders in Southern Lebanon, at least nine Israeli soldiers have been killed in the fighting so far. Ben Wedeman is with us now and he joins us from Beirut. I mean, Ben, I know that you were in those southern suburbs recently and yet, the strikes are ongoing. What did you see there?

The governmentbarely functions as it is, but with this added burden, they desperately need help from abroad and they've appealed for more than $400 million to try to deal with this mass influx of the displaced from the south and elsewhere, but beyond that, what we are seeing is the Israelis are building up their forces in Northern Israel. As I said, Hezbollah is putting up stiff resistance in the south. The anticipation is therefore since the Israelis aren't just plowing into Lebanon, they are running into trouble, that they are going to increase their bombing of the south. They are going to basically go beyond the so- called limited and localized and targeted raids as they are calling into a full scale invasion. Hezbollah is not an organization despite all the blows it has taken in the last two-and-a-half weeks, it has clearly taken those blows, but it has been far from eliminated. Clearly, in the south, they are able to still fire rockets into Israel, still stop Israeli forces from coming in. Therefore, the anticipation is Israel is going to come back with even more force and basically, a full-scale invasion of Southern Lebanon, if not beyond. Keeping in mind that back in 1982, when Israeli forces in June of that year were going into Lebanon. It was described as a limited incursion. It didn't take more than a few weeks before they were besieging West Beirut. This could be a repeat -- Paula.",

That's the kind of the border between North and South Lebanon. And by doing that, they would put Hezbollah missiles and drones out of range for hitting Northern Israel. So that was the original intent, but as your correspondent said quite correctly, what they originally planned and what they actually do are not necessarily the same, and if in fact they cross the Litani and continue to drive towards Beirut's suburbs, the possibility of being dragged into a much more extensive long-term conflict with Hezbollah is certainly there. As far as the Iranians are concerned, while there has been some talk, initially, the Israelis were talking about hitting nuclear facilities, that's really not within the scope of their capabilities. They could hit oil infrastructure, that would be problematic and would almost certainly draw an Iranian response to the Israelis.

I am just not really sure how her messaging here translates; instead, it appears that she is mostly at odds with her husband when it comes to reproductive rights. This is -- overturning Roe v. Wade is one of Donald Trump's signature accomplishments, at least, he has said that in the past during his time in the White House. What is so interesting about this, it comes at a time in which we you have seen Melania Trump almost zero times on the campaign trail. She has been present for one event which was his launch last November -- excuse me, I mean, in 2022. Other than that, we have barely heard from the former First Lady. This video was put out to promote her memoir and here she is essentially going against the former president. The other part that is notable about this is that it is an issue that Donald Trump himself has had a real problem with how to navigate. Remember, we had heard him across the map on this. There is one thing that we know, he is the architect of the overturning of Roe v. Wade. The other thing we know is that he believes the issues of abortion rights are harmful to him politically with women, with moderates, we've seen him waffle on questions about access, we've seen him not answer questions about whether or not he would veto a national abortion ban. The first time he actually said he would veto it was earlier this week, despite being asked that multiple times. He has tried to please both the right and the middle and had a very hard time doing so. Now you have Melania Trump stamping out and essentially going against what he has put in place. Now, we have not heard him mention anything about this here in this rally, not surprising, he doesn't often talk about the former First Lady. I talked to a number of campaign advisers about this, who essentially brushed it off, said she is not traditional, that she is going to do she wants to do, but it does again, go against what Donald Trump himself has done, this overturning of Roe v. Wade at a time where this is really the only thing that we have heard from her on some of these policies and politics, which is just really interesting this close to the election.",

Listen, they are not only making this argument here in Ripton, Wisconsin, the birthplace of the Republican Party. They are up with an ad in battleground states across the country featuring a man who supported the former president in 2016 and in 2020 really pushing this character argument and now, he is supporting Harris. Over the next four days, they've got Republican surrogates in all of the battleground states leaning hard on this message. Now, I've been speaking to Democrats, not all of them think that this is the right strategy.

But he has made pretty clear as of right now that he doesn't plan to use that power. Instead, he is encouraging the two sides, USMX, which represents the ship lines and the ILA union, to come back to the negotiating table people to try to hammer out a deal. The only problem with that is you can encourage all you want, but it's really up to these two sides to say, OK, we will come and we will negotiate. USMX has said that they've made an offer of 50 percent in wage increases over the six-year contract. The union wanting something closer to over 70 percent, close to 77 percent in wage increases. And stronger language in the contract around automation. But the USMX alliance saying that they're not going to come back to the table with preconceived demands. So essentially you kind of have a stalemate between the two sides. But as you heard Secretary Buttigieg saying, they're really behind the scenes really encouraging the two sides to come together to make a deal. But ultimately, unless both parties are willing to negotiate in either direction, the only other power is President Biden and that Taft-Hartley Act. And as of right now, he's not prepared to use that -- Paula.",

And the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq,as you can see there as well, finished in the red, but not by much. Investors keeping a close eye now on the Middle East and the threat of Israeli strikes on Iran is driving oil prices higher. Both West Texas Intermediate and Brent Crude up more than 5 percent today. They're now trading at well over $70 a barrel. And keep in mind, though, that's still below their 52-week high of about $90 per barrel. But prices on oil have not increased that much, I will say, in about a year now since we've had other crisis in the Middle East. That is it for QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.
