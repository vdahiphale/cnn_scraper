Coming up this hour, Israel passes the first part of its controversial judicial overhaul amid mass protests. Tourist flee wildfires in Greece. Ukraine claims it carried out a drone attack on Moscow. And football star Mbappe could be headed to Saudi Arabia. What Israelis have been out protesting for the last six months gets it stay in Parliament. At least the first part of it. And so far, it's going as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had hoped. The Israeli Knesset has passed the controversial reasonableness bill by vote of 64 to zero. It would strip the Supreme Court have the power to declare government actions unreasonable. This is the first bill of Mr. Netanyahu's judicial overhaul plan to get this far in the legislative process. But protesters and not letting up. They took to the streets across the country to show their opposition to the bill. And surrounding the Knesset locking arms and blocking roads around the building. Police set up fences and barbed wire and hit some people with water cannons. At least 19 people have been arrested so far. And over the weekend, a group of military veterans said that 10,000 volunteer reservists will refuse to serve if the legislation went ahead. But the disapproval isn't just coming from the Israelis. It has been increasingly urgent please from Washington, Israel's most important ally, to rethink this legislation. For the second time in a week, President Joe Biden warned Israel's government against moving ahead with the judicial overhaul. Mr. Netanyahu's right-wing government has caused his relationship with the White House to become increasingly challenged. CNN's Hadas Gold was in the thick of the protests earlier and spoke to my colleague Elenio Giokos. Take listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

What we've seen today is a result of political whims onboth sides of the political arena that have basically ended the mediation efforts that were taking place. And because of narrow ego, interests and considerations, basically, putting those small, narrow interests over the good and the interests of the Israeli society and on Israeli general interest. So, I would say what -- what's actually happened today is a combination of the last seven months. The government ignoring all of what the people had to say. And I would actually say that Netanyahu today, he didn't achieve what he put out. But he actually missed a historic opportunity to bring the country back together. Histadrut, our general federation of labor. The chairman just announced that he will be convening all of our senior bodies within the next few days. And we are declaring a labor dispute. And this actually means that either we will see progress with a broad agreement, or there will be serious consequences on the ground. We won't allow this country to go into deeper division or polarization and the people need a new route.",

There are legal bindings for a general strike. But there are many things that we can do between then and now. So I would say that we have the next couple of days where we will be conducting our activities, rallying our members, you know, we have to keep in mind that our members are like Israeli society, across the political spectrum. Not everybody will be happy with a general strike, but we need to be accountable to them. We need to be accountable to Israeli society. And that is why we are gathering and this is why the chairman now, Chairman Arnon Bar-David has got decided to conduct this step. Because over the last four or five days, the Histadrut has been at the center of the mediation efforts. We put down together with the business organization. We put down a proposal that what we found and this is why we never went into a strike beforehand. We found that there is barely any daylight between --in the positions on the issue of the bill. So why need to go through in such a very strong manner in a way which undermines society, undermines our democracy. And just makes people feel left out. This is why we will be moving forward. We will be beginning our process in the next coming days. And it could eventually leave to -- lead to a general strike. But in the meantime, there will probably be steps on the grounds that we will see slowdowns and stoppages, perhaps walkouts, and so on. There are many independent unions that have already declared there will be going on strike. I saw on the T.V. footage, one of our affiliates, the social workers union out there already on the frontlines. So of course, our members are expecting us to be active, but active not in a way just to fight but also to bring that middle Israel point of view because we do represent everybody.",

People demonstrating and protesting for now 29 weeks on the streets. The labor union saying get together, find mutual and common ground. The global economy, the local economy, it's all struggling and it's all pointing to a very clear, red flag that the government should be listening to. We have the concerns of our workers. If the economy goes down, pay rises, paychecks, the stability of the economy, workplaces could potentially close. That would be bad for the working men and women of Israel.

We're right at the side Supreme Court's large screens outside the Supreme Court all the way down tothe Israeli parliament for protesters to watch the proceedings on the floor of Parliament. And when that vote was announced that 64 to zero vote, zero because all the opposition lawmakers walked off in protest, people started chanting. They started booing. They started saying things like shame. And they have started marching towards the stage behind me where it various speakers have come up and encouraging the crowd chanting things like, we will not leave, we will stay in the streets until things get better. Some of them I've been putting to use the language like this is war, the war has just begun. And protests as we know are also starting to take to the streets in places like Tel Aviv as well. You can hear the anger in the voices, you can see the anger on their faces over the how this -- how this -- how this all happened. And they say that they will not be leaving the streets. Now, some of the fallout we're seeing. We've already seen the first legal challenges to this. Legal challenge is seeking an injunction from the Supreme Court to stop this legislation from happening. Now, that legal process could lead to a very interesting political. You could call it constitutional crisis here because it could be the supreme court ruling whether the bill taking away their ability to do something unreasonable is unreasonable in and of itself. Now, that's a few steps ahead. Also, what we're seeing is the stock market falling around two percent last time I checked. The Israeli shekels also falling against the dollar about one percent. So obviously, there's economic impacts, you were just talking about a potential labor strike that could really shut down the country. That's what shut down the country back in March. That's what really caused the legislation to be frozen back then. And then the big question also is, of course, about the military reservists. There's thousands of military reservists who have already said that they will not serve, they will not heed the call to serve if they're -- to duty. If this legislation passes, the legislation has passed. Now the question will be, of course, there's a major conflict and they're needed. These are people including the elite Air Force pilots who have said they will not serve. They would be needed in a major conflict. So, will they not serve? And also, what will be the consequences for them? Will they be arrested? What kind of legal consequences could they face? A lot of unknowns. And I also think it'll be interesting to see what happens on the streets in the next few hours because the protesters are angry. The heat is starting to die down a little bit. So people started to get their energy back. And the protesters are not giving any indication that they're going to be going home anytime soon. Lynda?",

What we do get from the Greek side, however, is that authorities have really been trying their best to get everyone out. There have been no casualties, there have been no injuries. A very few people have been taken to the hospitals with any kind of respiratory problems. So, the side that you get in this country is that, you know, despite all these difficulties, operations are underway to try and get everyone home safely. At the same time, what the Greek authorities are pointing out is that especially the fire in roads is only affecting 10 to 20 percent of the island. So, the rest of the island is safe that a number of the tourists have been moved to other resorts to other destinations as well. But as you can understand, the impact is very heavy on the industry. This is a peak tourist season. And this is a time that people are expecting to make their money. This is, you know, through a Greek financial crisis, COVID. So much has happened in these last years.
