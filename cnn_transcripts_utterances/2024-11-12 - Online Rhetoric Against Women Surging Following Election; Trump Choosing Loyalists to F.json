It's been a little bit of a rocky ride on that front in recent years, but hopefully we're going to see some of that being put back together tomorrow.",

A New York judge has delayed the deadlines in Donald Trump's criminal hush money trial because of his election win. I want to bring in CNN's Paula Reid and Kara Scannell.

      "sentences": "It really does. Today, we were expecting Judge Juan Merchan, the judge who oversaw Trump's hush money trial, to decide if Trump's conviction 34 counts of falsifying business records should be tossed because of the Supreme Court's decision immunity a few months ago, where they ruled that presidents cannot be prosecuted for official acts and also that official acts cannot be used as evidence. Because Trump's lawyers have argued that some of the evidence that was introduced in the New York trial could constitute an official act, for example, conversations that he had with Hope Hicks. But prosecutors have said, well, that was just a little tiny portion of the evidence that was introduced. He was convicted on evidence that was -- quote -- \"overwhelming,\" this should not be tossed.But we broke the story last week that Trump's lawyers are actually pivoting away from this to new arguments, actually trying to argue that because Trump is president-elect that if the conviction is not tossed based on the immunity ruling that he shouldn't be sentenced. They're going to argue that, as president-elect, he has constitutional protections, meaning he cannot be sentenced. So what happened here is even though we were expecting this decision today, both sides have agreed to take another week to give the Trump lawyers time to make these new arguments and give prosecutors time to respond. So, right now, the judge has a couple questions that are likely going to be on his desk. First, does this conviction get tossed because of SCOTUS immunity? Or do you have to cancel the sentencing because Trump is now president-elect? There's also an appeal hanging out there still. So that's also another opportunity to delay the sentencing. But, at this point, Pamela, they don't want to delay. They want the sentence and canceled or, the best- case scenario, even though it's a long shot, toss the conviction.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Pam, I mean, this is going to be the big decision here. What does the DA's office come back with next week, and what do they propose moving forward what should happen with this case?I mean, on the one hand, they could move to have the judge still issue his ruling on immunity, saying that that could still happen before Trump goes into office, or they could decide that they want the conviction to stand as it is unchallenged in this case so far and not have the judge issue a ruling. And either way, the question will be, does Donald Trump ultimately get sentenced in this case before he moves into office? And with the calendar as it is, that seems unlikely. So it seems that if he is ever sentenced in this case, if it does move forward, not being overturned, that would not happen until he's out of office, but a lot for the DA's office to consider. They note in this letter that this is unprecedented, that there are issues that they need to weigh between both the jury's verdict, which is something that is very sacred in legal circles, and also Trump's new status as the president-elect. And that is certainly one of the biggest things that was overshadowing this case as the sentencing became delayed twice now, potentially a third time, this question of what would the impact of Trump -- of a potential Trump win on the election be on this case. And it seems that as many of the lawyers have suspected, that it could mean that this case goes away like what is expected with so many of these other criminal cases, Pam.",

Hello.This was passed by the state's GOP-dominated legislature and signed into law on Juneteenth, and it would have required the Ten Commandments to be displayed on all public classrooms, as you mentioned, by January 1. But now this federal judge has put out a ruling temporarily blocking this law by granting a preliminary injunction, and he has ruled that the law is -- quote -- \"unconstitutional\" on its face and that opponents of the law are likely to win their case, plaintiffs are likely to win their case because it violates the First Amendment. Now, this marks a victory for opponents, who have argued it is unconstitutional to display the Ten Commandments in classrooms because it is promoting one religion, which is against the Establishment Clause of the Constitution that says Congress can make no law respecting an establishment of religion. Now, supporters have argued that displaying the Ten Commandments goes beyond religion, that the document is historical, it has historical and educational value. The author of the bill also mentioning that it is important to return to a moral code, to bring a moral code back to the classrooms. Now, the language of the law it would have required a version of the Ten Commandments to be displayed in all public classrooms in large, easily readable font. And we heard the governor, Jeff Landry, calling it one of his favorites out of the many education bills that he signed into law. And we have seen similar pieces of legislation attempts undergoing in states like Texas, Oklahoma and Utah, but none of these have actually succeeded in becoming a law because of legal challenges. And I spoke with the ACLU, Pam, of Louisiana, one of the four civil liberties groups that sued in this case, and the executive director calling this a joyous moment, saying that they are elated by this response from the federal judge.",

And she also does the work. When you see this position, this is someone who likely will be called up before Congress to answer questions, and she will make sure that she has done the work to be able to answer those questions. I think that she also has been someone who's willing to prove that she's willing to take the tough positions and I think someone who's in charge of protecting homeland, protecting the border.

And they're not going to have to be in a position where they're answering for who they vote for. They're going to vote for the person that they think is best positioned to lead the party, lead the majority, and really take advantage of everything that we have to get that. You remember, we only have about 18 months before it's another election season,and so really putting someone there who the senators trust and they think they can build the coalition to really keep everybody rowing in the right direction.

Ladies, it's great to have you on. I'm really looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this. Nadya, I want to start with you.

And I think that now the image that you're talking about or the post that you're talking about will probably be viewed more times since we are now discussing it amongst polite company. I don't think that it's even a sign of him being emboldened because he doesn't have, like, feelings or emotions. I would also say he didn't want Trump to win because Trump was not racist for him.
