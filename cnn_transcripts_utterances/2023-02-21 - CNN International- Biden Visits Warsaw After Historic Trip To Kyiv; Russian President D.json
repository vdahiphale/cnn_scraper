      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to CNN Newsroom. I'm Max Foster in London. Just ahead, U.S. President Joe Biden is in Poland due to give a major speech on his view of the war in Ukraine. Comes just hours after another major speech Vladimir Putin laid out his starkly different worldview blaming the west for the conflict.And a large aftershock hit Turkey only weeks after that massive quake killed tens of thousands. We're live on the ground view. U.S. President Joe Biden is in Warsaw, a day after his historic visit to Kyiv. He's meeting with Polish President Andrzej Duda right now at the presidential palace. We have just seen the two shaking hands ahead of their meeting, and it's just a few hours away that Mr. Biden will deliver that crucial speech where he's expected to rally support for Ukraine ahead of the one year anniversary of Russia's invasion. CNN White House Reporter Kevin Liptak joins me live from Warsaw. We've already heard Putin's speech. So do you think there will be a response to that to some extent in what we hear from Biden?",

      "sentences": "Well, I think it will be impossible to read into what Biden is saying is not a response to President Putin. We did hear from the National Security Adviser, Jake Sullivan earlier today, who tried to make the point that this was not sort of a head-to-head speech.They didn't time it to coincide with President Putin's speech. They won't be in what he called a rhetorical contest. But really the underpinnings of this moment are hard to ignore, this extraordinary split screen between these two men with extraordinarily different visions of the war in Ukraine and sort of the world at large. And we will hear President Biden kind of rebut the message that Putin delivered in his speech, which was that the west was to blame for the war in Ukraine. We can expect President Biden to push back very forcefully on that concept in his speech from Warsaw today. But also try and make the point that this war is taking place in a larger context, this context that you hear him talk about all the time of autocracies versus democracies. And he'll try and sort of frame the stakes of the war in Ukraine around that idea. He has been wanting to deliver this speech for quite a long time, and he really wants to build on a speech he delivered 11 months ago from here in Warsaw, actually from the same castle where he'll speak today. And remember, Max, that was the speech where, at the very end, he outlived that line that Putin cannot remain in power. Of course, Putin remains very much in power, as we saw today in the speech. And U.S. officials do see this as a critical moment in the war in Ukraine. And President Biden in this trip to Europe, really does hope to emphasize that Western unity remains unbowed one year into the war. And that is something that he'll emphasize in his meeting with the Polish President Andrzej Duda, which is underway now. They are meeting one on one. President Biden will want to talk to him about Poland's essential role as sort of a logistics hub for the billions and billions of dollars of military assistance that's making its way into Ukraine. But also want to talk about the refugee situation here. Of course, Poland has absorbed so many refugees from Ukraine fleeing that country as the war rages on. So those talks are underway now. Now, tomorrow, President Biden will also meet here in Warsaw with the leaders of nine other countries, NATO countries along the eastern flank. So, clearly, regional security, a commitment to the NATO allies, all of that President Biden's message as he continues this trip in Poland. Max?",

He's really doubling down, isn't he, on his view of who started this war? One relatively new piece of information, though, was this idea that he's walking away from a nuclear arms control agreement. It's the last remaining one, isn't it?",

      "sentences": "Yes, I wouldn't say walking away. He said he's suspending Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty between the United States and Russia. He did say that that treaty could come back into effect in the future, though. So certainly, he is giving himself at least the opportunity to walk back on what he has said today.But certainly, it is a fairly big step on the part of the Russians. Obviously, that treaty, the Start Treaty, is one that's very important because it limits the amount of offensive nuclear weapons that both sides can deploy and also allows for verification of that. Which means, for instance, that U.S. inspectors could go to Russian sites, Russians could go to U.S. sites. And I thought one of the things that he touched on in that, Max, was actually really, really important is he said that, look, the U.S. he believes, or the west is helping the Ukrainians strike bases in Russia, and then the U.S. wants to inspect those bases as well. He said that that was something he thought was, quote, nonsense. So it does seem as though the Russians are a bit nervous about the capabilities of the Ukrainians to hit some of those spaces where the Russians have their strategic arsenal, certainly their nuclear capable strategic arsenal. One of the things that you'll remember is that last year, there was a strike on a Russian air base called the Engels Air Force Base in southwestern Russia that the Russians said had been conducted by the Ukrainians. The Ukrainians never formally admitted to that, but it's sort of -- it's pretty clear that they do appear to be behind it. So Russia now suspending that treaty. It's a pretty big step, certainly one that could be reversed. That treaty actually does run until 2026. But that was really the biggest news out of what we heard today from Vladimir Putin. However, one of the things that I'll also say, Max, is it was quite interesting to hear Vladimir Putin speak about the fact that Russia, as he put it, will persevere, that Russia is not backing down in all of this. But Vladimir Putin not talking very much about what's been going on on the battlefield and how he evaluates Russia's situation on the battlefield. Of course, we know it has been difficult for the past couple of months. Certainly, he remained quite vague there. Nevertheless, what we saw today was a Russian leader rallying the population. And one of the things that we've done, Max, is we've actually spoken to one of the top pollsters here in Russia, and he says Vladimir Putin's approval ratings right now are at about 80 percent. So, clearly, while a lot of people internationally feel they have heard all this before, they obviously don't agree with a lot of what Vladimir Putin said. Certainly, there are a lot of Russians who remain very much behind their president. Max?",

The Chinese foreign minister spoke about the conflict at an opening -- of a security conference in Beijing. His remarks come as China's top foreign policy adviser arrives in Moscow. The U.S. says that Beijing is considering providing lethal military aid to Moscow. CNN's Marc Stewart has been monitoring the situation. He joins us live from Tokyo. The Chinese perhaps lining themselves up in a mediating role as well. That's what some people are suggesting.",

There are so many similarities, so many parallels in the messaging that we are hearing from Moscow and now Beijing. In fact, China is now declaring blame on this conflict to NATO and to the U.S.In fact, China is not only avoiding any condemnation of Russia, it's actually avoiding using the term war. In fact, it refers to what's happening in Ukraine as, quote, a special military operation. Take a listen to some remarks from earlier today from Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) QIN GANG, CHINESE FOREIGN MINISTER (through translation): We urge certain countries to immediately stop fueling the fire, stop shifting blame to China, and stop hyping up Ukraine today, Taiwan tomorrow.

Putin's speech, the U.S. presence surprise trip to Kyiv. A lot to fold in, Clare, but in terms of optics, it's sort of what you'd expect, isn't it, the big, you know, western power in Ukraine one day, in Poland the next speaking about NATO?",

      "sentences": "Yes, I mean, I think in that sense, Ukraine's longer term goals of sort of taking its place in the western world order, they are achieving that. Even though the short- term goal, of course, winning the war against Russia, they haven't achieved yet. They are being quite dismissive, I think emboldened, of course, by President Biden's trip to Ukraine, dismissive of Putin's speech.And adviser to Zelenskyy, Mykhailo Podolyak, says that Putin demonstrated irrelevance and confusion at the head of the presidential office, saying they're at a strategic dead end. But obviously, Ukraine does need this support. We're getting more evidence today of the way that their resolve is being tested on a daily basis. A pretty major attack on the city of Kherson. Max, six civilians were killed, 12 injured. The Southern Command of the Ukrainian Armed Forces says that residential areas, a kindergarten, a hospital, were all shelled. A local market and transport stop is where we're seeing images coming out of that scene. Six civilians killed, as I said, 12 injured. President Zelenskyy saying in response to that, the world has no right to forget for a single moment that Russian cruelty and aggression knows no bounds. So I think, look, we have not seen Ukraine have a morale problem in this battle. They have been very clear about their goals from the beginning. But I think as they prepare for a Russian offensive, potentially in the east, it might already be in its early stages as they continue to see other areas of the country get hit. This show of support has come at a very useful moment for the country.",
