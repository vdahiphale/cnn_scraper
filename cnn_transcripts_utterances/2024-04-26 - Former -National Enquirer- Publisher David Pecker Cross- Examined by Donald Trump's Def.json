There's two things that this is directly impactful to Donald Trump's case. First, prior bad acts evidence coming into the courtroom. The second, the appellate court's finding that Harvey Weinstein basically could not testify because so much was going to be allowed in on cross-examination. The same type of argument would apply to Donald Trump. At the Sandoval hearing, that's where prosecutors are told by the judge what can come in if Donald Trump were to testify. They opened up the gates, the judge, to the E. Jean Carroll case, to the New York state attorney general civil fraud case. Because of that, Donald Trump will have a similar argument that he's hamstrung. He couldn't possibly testify because of everything that's going to come in on cross-examination. It's directly related to the appellate decision that we just heard today.",

Brynn, as we're watching for Donald Trump to just leave Trump Tower and get down to the court, can you let us know sort of how soon court resumes, and whether or not we're ever going to get an answer to this gag order rule, because it has been sitting there now for a few days?",

And that's really, when you get to the heart of who Donald Trump is, he thinks he is his own best defender, and that's where a lot of this is coming from.However, last night he did change his tune a bit on this question, whereas a couple of weeks ago he was saying, yes, I plan to testify. Yes, I want to testify. In an interview last night, he said, well, we'll see if it's necessary. Take a listen to how he put it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT:  Well, I would if it's necessary. Right now, I don't know if you heard about today. Today was just incredible.

I don't need to take the stand.However, again, this is a tactic he has used before saying he wants to testify only to have discussions with his lawyers who ultimately convinced them testifying isn't a good move here. And I think all of the legal experts I've been talking too lawyers involved in this are saying, look, you never really want someone to take the stand in this case. It's more likely this could hurt the former president than it could help them. And so that's where some of this is coming from.",

Of course, John, two vary the crucial battlegrounds in 2024. Trump won these states in 2016, lost them to Joe Biden in 2020. And I know from my conversations with his advisers that these are very critical to winning the election come November.But look, it is a bit weird to see how this has been shaking out for them. I know that in my conversations with his team they recognize that this has been a hard juggling act. It's been challenging to have him in court four days required a week, and then trying to use the other three days to campaign. We haven't seen much of that so far. He was supposed to have a rally last weekend in North Carolina. They ended up having to cancel that last minute because of storm weather. But apart from that, he hasn't been used using those days, really, to get out there. So we're going to see this happen Wednesday. I do think they're going to try to do more of this and really try to maximize his ability to be on the trail while also being stuck in court. John?",

Most Americans have heard the story about Stormy Daniels and it has already been kind of litigated in the court of public opinion, and they have made up their mind where they stand on Donald Trump and his character. Whereas the other cases that he is facing, those are cases that strike at the heart of our democracy, the charges he is facing are much more aggressive and severe, and so I think that when you're looking at these cases, it is not necessarily surprising then that this is where Americans are at in their opinion and polling on it.",

I know last evening, I was there until around 9:00 PM because people were protesting on the quad. No one got arrested that time.
