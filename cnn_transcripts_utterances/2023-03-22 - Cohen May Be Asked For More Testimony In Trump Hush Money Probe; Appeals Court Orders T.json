This would be Cohen's third appearance before the grand jury and the jurors meeting again as soon as tomorrow morning. So what does this say about the case the country is watching, waiting for against Trump?Plus, the threat of nuclear war, the highest it's been in decades, according to a top Russian official tonight, as terrifying video shows a Russian strike on civilians in broad daylight. And Asian voters in San Francisco, fed up with crimes targeting their community, unhappy with progressive policies on education. Is this a lesson for Democrats beyond San Francisco? Let's go OUTFRONT. Good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. And OUTFRONT tonight, the breaking news. We are learning that Trump's former fixer Michael Cohen, could be called back to testify for a third time before the grand jury investigating hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels. That grand jury is expected to meet again as early as tomorrow morning. Now, a source is telling our John Miller that the D.A. may want Cohen to push back against the last testimony that the grand jury had, which was from Cohen's former attorney, Robert Costello, who testified on Monday.

I mean, these jurors on the cusp of an historic vote deciding at any day on whether to indict a former president of the United States for the first time.So, is it a good sign for Trump that the testimony from Costello, of course, a witness that Trump had pushed for seems to still be weighing heavily on this case and may require a third appearance from the key witness, Michael Cohen? That's one way of looking at it. Or is Bragg as some legal experts who know the Manhattan D.A.'s office think maybe, is he simply holding off the vote on an indictment until he can line up just the logistics involved in arresting a former president, right? Is this just about logistics and not about substance?

I think that Jack Smith has done an excellent job of transforming the classified document case at Mar-a-Lago into a very worthy obstruction case. Keep in mind that the key event surrounding Corcoran's testimony involves the June 3rd meeting with Justice Department officials and Cristina Bobb on his team, where they gave him some additional classified documents and a sworn statement, that while Christina signed it, Corcoran wrote it or at least organized it. And they had hours of conversations, backing up the essence of what they were swearing to. So we know for a fact, shortly after that, in August, they did a search warrant and found hundreds more classified documents. So this is a very serious event and Corcoran, you know, testifying is there's no way for even the former president, to spin that as a -- as a positive event.

This is what just happened to my home, says this man. Look, this is where I was sitting with my mom just now. But even in the aftermath, fear is never far away in Ukraine. Ukrainian officials say Russian forces fired at least six missiles at the city on Wednesday. Search and rescue teams scrambled to find people trapped under the rubble. Young children among the injured. President Zelensky called it savagery, from a terrorist state. And overnight, a swarm of Shahed drones sent sirens blaring across Kyiv. Air defenses brought some down, but at least seven were killed near the capital, say authorities. Russia has repeatedly denied it's targeting civilians. On Wednesday, President Zelensky traveled close to the front lines in the east to visit injured soldiers and rally his troops and remind them what they were fighting for. It's your historical mission to protect our land and return everything belonging to Ukraine for our children, he told them.

Now he did mention it's a territorial dispute. That's the big shift, but I mean the ask of whether it's a vital interest of the United States, I'm not sure Biden's own administration advisers would all agree to that. DeSantis said that they shouldn't get F-16s. Biden says the same thing at least for now. And Tucker Carlson did not ask DeSantis, do you support present U.S. policy in terms of what the Ukrainians are getting? And I suspect if he was forced to answer that he'd end up saying yes. So it turns out, DeSantis, when he's pushed is more on team Biden or team McCarthy or team McConnell, than he's on team Trump when it comes to Ukraine, and, of course, if you're Putin, that means that DeSantis is not someone you're looking forward to seeing get the nomination.",
