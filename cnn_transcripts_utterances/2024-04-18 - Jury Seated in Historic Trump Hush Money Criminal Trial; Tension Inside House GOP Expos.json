What we're learning about the seven men and five women who will sit in judgment of the former president.Also tonight, the stakes could not be higher nor the politics more petty as House Republicans fight amongst themselves and threaten again to oust their own speaker. And the Kennedy factor, as Robert Kennedy Jr. gets on more presidential ballots and his best-known relatives endorse Joe Biden. Good evening. Thanks for joining us. The first criminal trial ever of a former president now has a jury. It's a big achievement, considering the day began with the dismissal of two of the seven members selected earlier this week. Then this afternoon, with Trump looking on, seven more jurors were quickly selected, plus one alternate. Meaning that if the rest of the alternates are chosen tomorrow, opening statements could begin Monday. Former president spoke to reporters today reading headlines from a stack of stories he was holding. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

This followed a dramatic start to jury selection on Thursday, with Judge Juan Merchan scolding press for reporting some information contained in the juror questionnaire, including specific employers that could potentially identify jurors. This after a female oncology nurse was excused after saying aspects of her identity were made public, saying she could no longer be impartial. She tells the judge, \"Yesterday alone, I had friends, colleagues and family push things to my phone questioning my identity as a juror. I don't believe at this point that I can be fair and unbiased.\" The second juror dismissed is an older man from Puerto Rico, who says he finds Trump fascinating and mysterious. Computers questioned if his answer about whether he had ever been accused of a crime was accurate. They identified someone with the same name who was arrested in the 1990s for tearing down political posters. The exact reason for this juror's dismissal, though, is not known. Nearly 100 new prospective jurors came through the courtroom for questioning. At least half were immediately sent home for saying they could not be impartial. At the defendant's table, Trump appeared engrossed with those left in the jury box, tilting his head, leaning way back in his chair and craning his neck to get a good view of each juror as they spoke.

But he said that we could no longer report on where the jurors work, their employer, because that could potentially help identify them.

JONES III, FORMER CHIEF JUDGE, U.S. MIDDLE DISTRICT COURT OF PENNSYLVANIA: I think he's doing a good job, Anderson.
