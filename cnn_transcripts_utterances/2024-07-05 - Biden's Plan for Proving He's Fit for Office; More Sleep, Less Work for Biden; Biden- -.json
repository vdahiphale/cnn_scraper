Good morning, everyone. I'm Paula Reid in for Kasie Hunt. It's great to be with you. More sleep, less work. That's President Biden's plan to stay sharp and focused on the job after last week's devastating debate performance. According to three sources, the president intends to stop scheduling events after 8:00 p.m. so he can get more rest. And there's no sign he's considering bowing out of the race. Listen to these remarks at yesterday's July 4th barbecue at the White House. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  This could not be done without the family support. So, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We love you. And I really mean it from the bottom of my heart. Thank you. Thank you. You got me, man. I'm not going anywhere. All right.

There is this unique thing though, Paula, with that moment between the resignation and the appointment, the king is running the country. So, an absolute monarchy for about 10 minutes, probably.But I think what we've seen here is, you know, in some ways, isn't a massive shift. You still got a center ground prime minister, but it's moved to the left slightly and by a landslide. So, the British public have completely flipped in many of their voting patterns, even in Scotland where the Scottish National Party has seen its vote collapse. There's been a lot of change here and a triumph for Keir Starmer because the last election, the Labour Party had the worst showing that it's ever had. Now, it's got one of its best showings. But you have underneath all of that something very interesting going on. You're seeing the hard-right and the hard-left also having successes. So, the Green Party getting four seats, which is extraordinary. Nigel Farage, who is obviously very close to Donald Trump, winning a seat. But also, you've got the Conservatives collapsing, and you're going to see the hard-right having an influence on the new Conservative Party that comes out of this. So, it's not to say the hard-right haven't had a role to play here in the same way they have in other parts of Europe, it's just not as defined. But we have got now a centrist government, which has moved slightly to the left.",

You might say, well, there've been so many elections here, and we had the Brexit referendum, so many prime ministers, people have just tuned out.I do worry that this is a crushing defeat, not for the -- just for the Conservative Party, but for politics. Politics isn't changing things in the same way that people hoped. So, they're just not engaging in it.
