We also have \"The Daily Star,\" with \"Bunk-Off Friday.\" I am hearing, Don, that the offices in the U.K. and throughout the country are pretty quiet today. I think a lot of people doing a bit of work from home ahead of this match. The thing is, I am told there is something of a curse with team England when it comes to matches against the U.S. in World Cup. In 2010 they drew. In 1950 they lost. They do have to get past that. I identify more as a Scot myself, and I slightly, only ever so slightly, Don, and I'll keep it quiet around here, slightly hope that Team USA wins to avoid some scenes that we saw here earlier this evening when England won.

Man, well, you just said my husband served under don't ask, don't tell, which meant that he would have been discharged from the American military had he come out of the closet. I know on the clip Tucker Carlson goes on to talk about how it seems that my husband only wants to talk about identity rather than his job. And I would just love for him to follow Secretary Pete on Twitter. He can follow along all of the things that are happening at the department.But remember, this kind of rhetoric is easy. It's so easy to attack people, and to go on your talk show, and fire people up about something that's not actually happening. I love my husband deeply. I know he's a committed public servant. And he has everyone's best interests at heart. I just think these people, again, with these megaphones, they have -- they have a big platform. And rather than focusing on real issues, people's lives, making them better. They've decided to focus on hate.",
