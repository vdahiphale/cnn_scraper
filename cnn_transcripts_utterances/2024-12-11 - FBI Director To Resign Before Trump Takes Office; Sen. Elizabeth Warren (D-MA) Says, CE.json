(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHRISTOPHER WRAY, FBI DIRECTOR: After weeks of careful thought, I've decided the right thing for the Bureau is for me to serve until the end of the current administration in January and then step down. My goal is to keep the focus on our mission, on the indispensable work each of you is doing every single day. And in my view, this is the best way to avoid dragging the Bureau deeper into the fray while reinforcing the values and principles that are so important in how we do our work. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We do disagree on this. I don't think he should have resigned. Because the reason Trump gave for his resignation, the reason that he said that Wray had to go, was because Wray raided his beautiful home, or I forgot how he termed Mar-a-Lago, but, you know, Wray went and then violated the sanctity of his home. Well, the FBI did that after requesting that Donald Trump return classified documents over and over and over again, and Trump didn't. So, by resigning effectively, what he did was, he said, implied, in some ways, that Trump was right, that he did something wrong. I would have stood there and said, Mr. President, if you want to fire me for doing my job, the job that federal agents had to do because you would not do yours and return these documents, then that's your prerogative.

SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS (R-ARKANSAS): SNAP is critical for struggling families but it's also a huge taxpayer subsidy for things like soda, candy, and dessert. I just sent a letter to President Trump's nominee for HHS, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and his nominee to lead the USDA, Brooke Rollins, asking them to prohibit SNAP purchases of junk food. And with obesity as high as ever, this would be a massive benefit to our health and our taxpayers. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
