      "sentences": "Yes. Well, Kate, it's a tough, tough day for employees over at Twitter. We're already seeing that some of them are posting on the platform, which they've worked out for so long that they have been locked out of company systems, presumably because they are among the employees affected by these mass layoffs, which are underway this morning.Twitter employees were notified last night via a memo that they would be receiving an e-mail in their inbox today, basically alerting them to their fate at the company. If they are staying with the company, it'll go to their company inbox. If they are being let go, it's going to be sent to their personal e-mail with instructions on the next steps. I should note, Kate, a lot of employees are handling this very tough day with really good stride. You're seeing a number of them post reminiscing on the time they had at the platform, the friends they made, and what they learned, so kudos to the tweeps for being able to take this day with such good stride. That said, you know, they -- Elon Musk, while he's executing these lawsuits, he could find himself in some hot water, as you alluded to, there is already one lawsuit that's been filed against Twitter for potentially violating a federal regulation that requires them to notify employees 60 days in advance if there are going to be mass layoffs at one site. The attorney who is leading this lawsuit against Twitter, she told CNN in statements that Elon Musk, the richest man in the world, has made clear that he believes complying with federal labor laws is trivial. She goes on to say we have filed this federal complaint to ensure that Twitter will be held accountable to our laws and to prevent Twitter employees from unknowingly signing away their rights. And one final point, Kate is that this comes right before the midterm elections. Twitter's a hugely important communications platform. And now it's, of course, been thrown into chaos.",

She's also an opinion columnist for the Washington Post. Catherine, I want to get to Twitter, but I first wanted to just get your take on the jobs report that came out earlier this morning. What do you think this report is telling us? 260 -- I want to make sure, 261,000 jobs added to the economy last night, what do you -- last month. What do you think the report is telling us about the economy right now?",

      "sentences": "Generally, a very strong report, this is not the kind of report you would expect to see if the economy were actually already in recession. As you point out, stronger than expected hiring this past month, some revisions to previous months, unemployment is close to its pre-pandemic numbers.However, there are some signs of worry, including the fact that a lot of people dropped out of the labor force altogether in the past month, meaning that they're neither working nor looking for work. And we're already experiencing pretty widespread labor shortages, which are contributing to inflation. So that sign that people are dropping out of the labor force is not what we want to see certainly not what the Fed wants to see.",

They're going to point to the fact that there has been record job growth since Biden took office, more than 10 million jobs added, you know. Whether that's due to things that he's done is up for debate. But they're going to run with the top-line numbers.However, you know, Americans have indicated that their worry right now is not the availability of jobs it is the price of almost everything that they buy. And so, you're going to see Republicans continue to hammer home these concerns about inflation, the fact that wages have not been keeping pace with earnings growth. And even though we didn't get direct numbers on inflation in today's report, we're going to get some numbers next week, shortly after the election, that probably show once again, that wages are falling behind prices. So, you know the same narratives we've been hearing so far, we'll probably continue.",

And it's not clear if there is a quid pro quo but what Ukraine is understood by these intelligence sources to be doing is looking for an alternate way to develop its nuclear program. If it doesn't manage to reconstitute that international nuclear deal it had with the United States and other international partners. The reason being that that deal is in jeopardy is Iran has already overly enriched uranium way beyond the thresholds that it had agreed in that deal. Of course, it's -- the United States pulled out of the deal under President Trump at the time. Now, Iran seems to be making a calculation that that deal won't happen or if it happens, it won't last long. And it needs an alternative means to actually guarantee that it can produce the nuclear material that it wants to and the concern, of course, that moves it closer -- ever closer to the pathway to making a bomb. Several years ago that was placed at about a year -- a year long. Now, it's in terms of months, according to U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken. So this, of course, is a deep concern that Iran would try to align itself and leverage help with Russia in this way.",

Harry Enten has actually done a deep dive into this because he shares my obsession with why the heck we do it.So, Harry, you know this from me because we've talked about it. But as someone who grew up in northern Indiana, it's a very special place that sometimes was on East Coast time, and then sometimes was on Central Time.

States went back and forth with some states having it, some states not until 1966.
