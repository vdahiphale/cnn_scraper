Ukraine's President Zelenskyy says his forces have seized a key town inside Russia. Five people are facing charges connected to the death of \"Friends\" actor Matthew Perry. Taylor Swift performs in London in her first concert since a foiled terror plot in Vienna. And the 15-year-old named Times Magazine's Kid of the Year for trying to fight skin cancer with a special soap. That conversation and plenty more coming up. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says his forces have captured a key town inside Russia as the stunning cross-border incursion makes new gains. And the Ukrainians aren't just seizing land, they're seizing prisoners. More video is emerging of Russian soldiers apparently being taken captive in this surprise assault. This video is showing alleged prisoners face down in the dirt guarded by Ukrainian troops. Kyiv says POWs will be treated under the Geneva Conventions. This offensive is now entering its 10th day, and Russia is struggling with how to respond. U.S. officials say Moscow is diverting thousands of troops from occupied Ukraine back into Russia. Well, a federal emergency was declared in the Kursk region days ago. But Ukrainian forces are still on the move, and Moscow has declared a new federal emergency in neighboring Belgorod. Our Chief International Security Correspondent Nick Paton Walsh, is in Sumy, Ukraine, near the border with Russia. Good to have you there for us, Nick. So, a dramatic shift in the battlefield.

And it's startling to see the devastation at that particular border point in itself, but even still now, the extraordinary freedom of movement for Ukrainian troops heading back and forth into Russia, and also, the large amount of resources, of armor, some of it western supply that we saw them driving up into Russia and coming back again as well. There's been a sea change too, Lynda, as well, in terms of how freely the Ukrainians move around during the daytime. For the past months, they've been in trenches, unable to use daylight hours for the most part in frontline areas because of the threat of Russian attack drones. Now, Ukraine has their own, but that's basically left both sides only moving around often at night or in daytime at extreme risk, none of that at all from, what we saw today in the areas around the border and the Ukrainians just relaxedly moving back and forth, reminding me, frankly, of a time a year ago before drones were indeed such a threat. That would suggest potentially that they have some sense of confidence built perhaps from a new capability. We didn't see much concern too about the threat of Russian air. So, something has clearly changed in the way Ukraine thinks about how it's going to pursue this particular battle. We don't quite know what that is yet, but they are increasingly confident. We are now in the 10th day, as you say, of their advances. 35 kilometers deep in, they said they got today, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy clear that they've taken now entirely the town of Sudzha, which had been the focus of their initial advance. There's still been clashes inside of it, but is now, it seems, fully under their control. As their grip seems to expand to various different areas in Kursk, and also it seems to Belgorod too, where there's been, as you know, an emergency situation and evacuations declared just recently. So, this offensive just continuing, it seems, in its strength and confidence.",

The Republican candidate, Donald Trump, has been holding a news conference at his New Jersey golf club, where he continued to attack Democrat Kamala Harris on economic issues. And all of this as the cost of living and other economic issues begin taking center stage on the campaign trail. Well, earlier today, in the U.S. State of Maryland, Harris and President Joe Biden appeared on stage together for the first time since she replaced him as the party's presidential candidate. The two touting the Biden administration success in bringing down the cost of prescription drugs. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT AND U.S. PRESIDENTIAL DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE:  We believe deeply every senior in our nation should be able to live with security, stability, and dignity. And so, in the United States of America, no senior should have to choose between either filling their prescription or paying their rent. JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  For years, Big Pharma blocked Medicare from negotiating lower drug prices. The consequence, they're able to maintain the exorbitant price increases and the profits are uncalled for. Look, but this time, we finally beat Big Pharma. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Let's start with that, Stephen, because it was interesting seeing Biden and Harris together for the first time in three and a half weeks since Biden dropped out of the presidential race.

It's going to save them potentially thousands of dollars a year when they have to stump up for these out-of-pocket drugs costs. So, that's the reason why you saw the vice president standing with the president to claim a share of the credit for a very significant win for the administration as she tries to perhaps get a little bit of distance from the president in other areas in terms of their economic policy and as she tries to shrug off attacks by Trump to the effect that she's to blame for the big inflation and grocery price hikes that we've seen throughout the last four years. So, it's a significant moment and it's something that could well be quite valuable to the vice president as she seeks the votes of senior voters in the coming months.",

I can't remember atime, you know, over that period when he has looked so ragged and ill- disciplined and almost disorientated as he does now. I think the shift in the race, the withdrawal of Biden, the fact that he now has to take on a new, younger opponent has really scrambled some of the former president's calculations. His campaign is still far more professional than it was in 2016 and 2020. He has a vice presidential nominee, J. D. Vance, who isn't very popular, but he's making some pretty direct and effective arguments on the economy. The problem for the Trump campaign right now is Trump, he's not delivering a clear message. That was supposed, today, to be an event highlighting the cost of groceries. He was at his golf club with a bunch of groceries all around him. It would have been much more effective if he was out there for 10 minutes, made his speech and then left. But now, he's talking about all of his obsessions, this has been going on for an hour and a half. It's very undisciplined and I don't think it's really that effective.",

He said, we're going to have 10 percent to 20 percent tariffs on foreign countries that have been ripping us off for years. This is an increase from the 10 percent tariffs that he'd already mentioned. And of course, leading economists have said that sort of a policy would certainly fuel inflation, right?",

He often complains that hegot billions of dollars from China because he hiked tariffs on Chinese goods. But what actually happened, and there have been academic studies since his presidency that have proven this, is that the cost of those tariffs was handed on to consumers. So, not only is this an inflationary issue, which could be a problem given the rises in the cost of living we've seen in recent years, which have now mitigated, but it's not really sound economic policy. A lot of it is policy making for political reasons because he wants to stand up and be shown as tough on China. But if Trump does win a second term, a lot of economists think we could be in for a bunch of trade wars, not just with China but potentially with Europe, and now, the partners. So, this is part of Donald Trump's economic pitch. He's saying he's going to do a lot of things, for example, slashing the cost of electricity by 50 percent.

      "sentences": "Well, perhaps the biggest indication that at least things are continuing, the most positive sign thatwe can glean so far is the fact that these negotiations are going to continue tomorrow. The Israeli delegation that flew to Doha, Qatar earlier on Thursday is remaining overnight and the negotiations are expected to resume on Friday morning. We aren't getting many details from inside the room about the actual progress being made as both sides try and work towards a bridging proposal effectively, one that could bridge the difference between Hamas' position on these talks and Israel's. And that may be intentional in terms of the lack of details coming out. We have seen at various -- very sensitive points in these negotiations that the key negotiators involved in this, the U.S. Egypt, and Qatar, are really trying to keep the details inside the room as they try and work through these thorny issues, try and work through compromises and concessions that can be made. Now, the Hamas officials who are in Doha, they are being updated by the mediators, by the Egyptians and the Qataris. So, even if they're not in the room, they're still very much involved in the potential progress of these negotiations. But we still don't know to what extent they've actually bridged the gaps on some of the key issues that remain. Notably, for example, the Israeli prime minister's demands that he's been making over the course of the last month regarding Israeli troops retaining control of the Philadelphia corridor, that border between Egypt and Gaza, as well as some kind of a security mechanism to prevent armed men to -- from going to Northern Gaza from Southern Gaza during a ceasefire. Now, one key indication that I think is important to note here is the fact that the prime minister who has been in the room throughout these negotiations, he spoke on Thursday evening with the Iranian foreign minister, and that just tells you how closely linked these ongoing ceasefire negotiations are to the future of what will happen in this region, as we have been on kind of a knife's edge over the course of the last two weeks since the apparent Israeli assassination of Hamas' political leader in the Iranian capital, since Iran has been making these threats of retaliation. Tonight, the Qatari prime minister updating the Iranian foreign minister on these negotiations and speaking about, quote, tensions in the Middle East according to the Qatari readout. I think that makes very clear that these ceasefire negotiations have wide-ranging implications in this region far beyond Gaza. Lynda.",

This is an equivalent of a Category 3 major hurricane in the Atlantic. We don't give numbers to Pacific typhoons, but very, very close to Tokyo. And not every little storm is going to stay in that window, in that cone. It could be wobbling a little bit to the left, even as we speak, that would spell more wind for Tokyo for sure. Now, the coast is going to get lashed with gale force winds, probably typhoon force winds, a lot of wind and also the waves along with it, maybe even a little bit of surge here coming in, but 150 to 200 millimeters of rainfall will not be welcome along that coast. It's kind of a sharp little drop off right through there. And again, a lot of rain for Tokyo. The wind will be howling through the buildings. Those skyscrapers kind of funneling into the wind tunnel effects. So, even if we're only at it 100 kilometers per hour, that is going to be a very difficult day coming up here, because we're already, what, 7:30 in the morning here, Tokyo time. And yes, typhoon winds do hit the Cape there, and eventually out to sea. But this is a pretty significant event for Tokyo and for the eastern part of Japan. Something else that's going to be an interesting part or maybe a dangerous part will be the Bermuda storm. We're talking here about Ernesto. This is the storm that will likely approach Category 3, but may never make it, maybe somewhere around 110 miles per hour as it does approach Bermuda. But if you're on their one side, which is the left side of the eye, then all of a sudden, it's not so bad. If you're on the right side of where the eye passes, then the winds are added together, the forward momentum of the storm and the wind itself has to be added. If you're on the over here on the west side, you can subtract that forward momentum. But you can see that there are plenty of areas there where the wind continues to blow, at least gusts, at 100 miles per hour. So, yes, waves wind. Now, Bermuda is a hurricane ready type of community. Don't get me wrong. These people know what they're doing. They don't really have to go to shelters because their house is already a shelter. And if they know that it's not, then they do, because these things have been built to withstand these type of storms for centuries, really. That's how long it's been there. And this concrete block, poured concrete buildings are going to have to take a pounding, going to have to take a beating here because there you see where the winds and the waves are. We're probably going to see even waves along the East Coast of the U S at 10 feet. More than three meters along the coast this weekend. Going to have to keep your children out of the waves because it could be a significant wind event. And also, storm surge event or even at least tidal, coastal tidal possibly pulling you back out into the ocean every time big waves come. Never turn your back on the ocean. We're still watching this. This is the most important thing right now at this point in time, because we're going to make close approach in probably less than 12 hours. Lynda.",

Again, this is going to be a huge welcome on that stage for Taylor Swift. Many of these Swifties say that it's an opportunity to re-establish that safe space for fans. Salma Abdelaziz, CNN, London.

His trial is set for October 8th, and he is one of five defendants in that case.

Pretty much the way that it worksis it uses this drug called Imiquimod, and it wraps it around these lipid- based nanoparticles. And so, without getting too in depth into all the science behind it, I guess the main point with this bar of soap is -- like you said, it's a more affordable and accessible alternative to modern day skin cancer treatment.

But now, that I've grown up and kind of realized the damages and the consequences of U.V. radiation for such long periods of time, I was really inspired to take action, not only to create a form of treatment, but also to make it affordable and accessible so that everybody could use it",

And so, right now, it's at a point where it's continuing to be tested. I'm really excited to see its future. But my hope, my goal is that within the next five years we can turn SCTS from a simple passion project into more of a nonprofit organization where, you know, coming full circle to the initial inspiration of giving an impact and an affordable and accessible manner, using that nonprofit to be able to distribute the bar of soap to people that need it the most.
