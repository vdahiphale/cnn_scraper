Again, when Pearce was making the argument about that he doesn't expect just because the former president is being prosecuted in this case, that in the future that there will be similar prosecutions, again, Trump furiously was taking notes. He leaned over to talk to his lawyer when, for example, Judge Henderson raised the idea that the take care clause that you guys were just discussing just a few minutes ago, where the idea that the former president, when he took office, obviously, he took an oath to take care and to make sure that the laws are executed in this country. And she said it was paradoxical that he then would be immune from being prosecuted if he broke those very laws. He leaned over and spoke to his attorneys again during that bit of questioning. So, clearly, he was listening very, very closely. Everybody in the room was eyes focused on him obviously to see what his reactions would be. Very unusual, obviously, to have a defendant coming to one of these proceedings. And in reference to Mr. Pearce's mom, I asked her, I said: \"Why are you here today?\" And she said: \"You couldn't keep me away from here today.\" (LAUGHTER)",

And so, certainly, I think, certainly for Mr. Sauer, as he -- as soon as he hit the podium, he started getting questions from Judge Childs, from Judge Henderson. So, they -- he didn't even have a minute really to start doing his presentation. It's always very fascinating to watch the lawyers who come with -- who prepare for days and days and weeks, right, to do this presentation. And then they come in here and it's rapid fire questions from these judges, who don't really have that much patience and don't really pay attention to the clock either.

He purses his lips and looks straight ahead. And that was one of those moments, very characteristic of the former president. You know. You know when there's something being said that he doesn't like.

And for a while, as we were waiting for the proceedings to begin, Smith was looking around at some of the portraits. As you know, that one room, that one courtroom has portraits of some of the judges who have sat on this appeals court in the past. And so he sort of familiarized himself with some of the people on the walls there. He did stop to talk to the Pearces, to the mom and dad who were sitting just a few rows back. So he had a little chat with them, but stoic, didn't look at the president, the former president, unlike previous times, where we saw them sort of exchange glances very, very shortly, very briefly.

Thank you for sharing that with us.And to break down what we heard from the actual arguments that were being made, we have our legal panel back here with us. Joining us now is CNN senior legal analyst and former assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York Elie Honig and CNN legal analyst and former chief assistant district attorney for the Manhattan DA's office, Karen Friedman Agnifilo. I'm so glad to have you here joining us. And just on what Evan was talking about there at the end and Laura about this sense that Trump's trial attorney is now being confronted with what previous attorneys have argued, which was, during Trump's past impeachments, they argued this is something that could be taken care of in the courts, saying that presidents could be prosecuted. They were very much saying that they could not today, unless that they have been convicted by the Senate. KAREN FRIEDMAN AGNIFILO, CNN LEGAL ANALYST:  Yes, clearly Trump's prior arguments in other forums are coming back to haunt him. And he -- judges are listening to each other, right? They're seeing what's happening in other cases or in other forums. And you can't be inconsistent and disingenuous, especially when you speak to the court. What I thought was excellent today, what they really did a good job of was narrowing the issues, because there were several issues that were outstanding going into today's oral argument. Number one, do presidents -- are they immune from criminal prosecution generally? OK, number one. Number two, could double jeopardy apply because he was impeached by the House, but he was acquitted by the Senate? Number three, does the appellate court even have jurisdiction to hear it at all right now? Because, normally, you have to wait until after you're convicted. And, number four, do you have to be impeached and then convicted in order to be prosecuted? That's the impeachment judgment clause. And what I thought the appellate court did a really excellent job here was narrowing those issues down. And, at the end, Judge Pan got Mr. Sauer, who represents Trump, to concede that there is no absolute immunity here, that if -- what she said was that if Trump is impeached and then convicted by the Senate, then would prosecution be entirely proper under the impeachment judgment clause on same or related conduct? Now, that has to do with the double jeopardy. So, by getting him to say yes to this question, she got him to concede there is no double jeopardy, number one, and, number two, there is no absolute presidential immunity. So the only remaining issues here are, does the impeachment judgment clause require a conviction first in order to do this? They could address this outer perimeter issue as well. That's one other area where they can fine-tune this immunity question of ministerial versus discretionary acts. But, really, they narrowed the issues, I thought, beautifully during this argument.",

Of course, as you know, the Justice Department doesn't always bringall of the charges at once. It's not unusual for a superseding indictment to come later. That is what happened in the case of Senator Bob Menendez, but he is furiously defending himself right now on the Senate floor, showing no signs up to this point that he is expected to step aside. Instead, he is just defending himself. And this is going to come as there are likely going to be more and more calls for him to step aside. And I think that that is really notable at this moment right now, given the fact that we have a number of his colleagues who have made it clear that they're uncomfortable with the charges against him, that they believe that he no longer should be a sitting U.S. Senator. But, ultimately, that is the decision that is up to Senator Bob Menendez. He's making it clear this morning that nothing in this superseding indictment is changing his belief that he belongs in the United States Senate.",

And, look, I think we should point out that it was Donald Trump's choice to take himself off the trail to be here in court today for this immunity claim argument. It's something that he cares deeply about. And he's choosing to show up. And I think, if you look at the rest of the week, I just want to point out his schedule. I think it's, again, a great example of him flitting between the courtroom and the trail. Today, he's obviously in D.C. attending his team's arguments in this immunity claim trial. But then he's also going to be back in Iowa tomorrow for a FOX News town hall. Then he goes Thursday in a totally different courtroom, a totally different case. He's going to be sitting in on the closing arguments in his New York civil fraud trial, another case that is deeply personal for Donald Trump and kind of strikes to the core of who he is. And I think, if we take a step back and look at all of this, I think, and, as I said, these are both issues that Donald Trump definitely personally believes in. But there's also a political strategy to this. His team -- and this is according to conversations with many of Donald Trump's advisers -- they think one of the best ways to try and suck all of the oxygen out of the race is to have Donald Trump personally and directly being involved in his legal battles. They know that this is coming at a time when his rivals are really trying to get as much last-minute traction as they can in the lead-up to Iowa on Monday. And this is a great way to turn all of the attention to the former president and have him do, as we have seen him do many times in the past, try to control the media narrative around a lot of his legal issues.",
