They have over 25 million people on their subscriber list.But it kind of breaks into multiple parts when we talk about their finances. First, they say that there were a lot of commitments made when Biden was still on the ticket to contract for consultants, to TV reservations that they felt they still had to carry out once the switch happened, which was a lot of money. And also, the subscriber list, right? We reported in this piece that they burned over a million subscribers. Again, out of the 25 million list, they called it a natural turn. Still, that's a million people who are not seeing their fundraising messages and not seeing those messages trying to get to you volunteer. And when they're making projections based off of that big money that the vice president was bringing in, in July, when that switch happened, a million people, that kind of shows -- or that creates kind of a dent in their financing. So we reported that they had to revise their fundraising deadlines, their fundraising goals, ultimately, missing the deadlines in September leading to the debt situation they have right now.",

Certainly, people have their criticism of him both inside and outside the campaign.But I think, if we back up and think about the genesis of this campaign, when Biden was still on the ticket, or when he announced he was running, it was really difficult for campaign leadership to staff some of these senior roles because people didn't want to work for Joe Biden. And people didn't want to move to Wilmington. So therefore, in key roles, you have people years to junior to fulfill it. So it wasn't at the scale it needed to be to really incorporate the enthusiasm and just the inflow of cash and volunteers that Harris brought when she switched the ticket. So then she didn't want these kind of staffing stories that plagued her in the first two years of office as vice president. And so she brought in this new -- advisers like Plouffe, like some other folks. But obviously, people had a lot of criticism for the way they planned the strategies and thought it was too much like 2008.",

And Democrats being like, hey, Trump is running these anti-trans ads that are attacking the vice president and making her look unserious. And we think they're having an impact and we should respond to them. And what he told them was they weren't having much of an effect. Clearly, now the Trump campaign is saying that was one of their most effective messages to drive home the message that the vice president was not ready to be president. So obviously, there are a lot of questions about what their analysis was and their analytics were saying to get them to this place where Democrats are really in disarray.",

Around 11,000 of those are apparently North Korean troops.Now, the Ukrainians have also commented on this. And they're saying, look, the North Korean forces, they might not be directly at the front line in many places, but what all that does is it frees up more Russian troops to try to then attack the Ukrainians. Nevertheless, the Ukrainians have also said that there have been direct battles between Ukrainian forces and North Korean forces, and that there have been losses in those battles. So certainly, all of this is significant. Also that involvement of the North Korean forces as well. One of the things that we have heard from the Russians in the past, is they, definitely, obviously, want to retake that territory in the Kursk region. That is, of course, part of Russia. But at the same time, the Russians are not in any rush to do so. Right now, the Russians are saying that, for them, the main battlefield is still in the east of Ukraine where, of course, they have been making significant gains over the past couple of months. But the Russians now also are gearing up for a large-scale offensive there. We haven't heard any confirmation yet from Moscow that there really is that large force that is gearing up there. The Russians are saying they have already managed to retake some of that territory where the Ukrainians have that incursion in August. At the same time, the Russians also saying they will continue to fight to push the Ukrainians off of all of their territory while, at the same time, also prosecuting that massive offensive going on in the northeast of Ukraine -- Boris?

And it is not under control.Authorities managed to capture a couple dozen of the primates that escaped from a research center last week but at least 25 -- rather, at least 18 are still on the loose. Twenty-five have been captured. Some have been spotted, as you can see in that footage, jumping back and forth in the woods near the facility they escaped from. Let's talk about the situation with the renowned conservationist, Ron Magill. He's the communications director for Zoo Miami Ron, thank you so much for being with us. Before we get into the challenges of rounding up these monkeys, I want to ask but this species in particular. Beginning with the name, which I am very nervous to say on television, Ron. (LAUGHTER) RON MAGILL, CONSERVATIONIST &amp; COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, ZOO MIAMI: Rhesus Macaques. Yes, listen, they are a very, very common monkey, one of the most common primates used in research facilities. People are probably familiar with them if you watch Discovery Channel, Animal Planet. They have those shows about the whole monkey troops that have taken over little cities in India. When I was in India, they were running all over the place as if they were part of the community. So they're a very common monkey. But I don't want people to panic and say, oh, my god, they're going to come after us. They're going to kill us. It will be monkey mayhem. It's really not that bad. You just need to be very smart.",

Look at the little cute monkey.No. You have to look at these monkeys -- with all due respect to the monkeys, you need to look at them as dirty little people that bite. OK? So keep your distance. You don't have to be like locking all your windows and doors, these panic situations, like you've got some Freddy Kruger out on the loose. It's not the case with these monkeys. They're opportunists. They will try -- if you leave a door open, they can walk in through a door. They can walk in through a window. They're going to look for food. They can eat almost anything. They're adapted to eating almost anything. And they're opportunists. So if you leave garbage in your garbage can with your garbage can open, you leave dog food or stuff out in the backyard, they're going to come to that. But don't think they're going to look at you and go, ah, human, I'm going to come get them now. No, that's not what they're doing. Now, having said that, they are frightened. They're frightened now.

They're going, hey, where's Alice? I haven't seen Alice. Well, Alice is over there. The best way they can do this is they can try to set up some type of enclosure next to the enclosure they're already in and try to bait them in slowly without trying to push them into it. This has to be the monkey's choice. Because if you think you're going to catch a monkey in a tree just by you chasing it, that's not going to happen.",
