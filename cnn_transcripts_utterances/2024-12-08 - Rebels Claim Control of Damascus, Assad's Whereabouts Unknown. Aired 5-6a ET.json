And we begin today with breaking news out of Syria where the rebellion that started 13 years ago has finally toppled the iron-fisted rule of the Assad family.In a statement carried on state TV, Syrian rebels declared that they have, quote, \"liberated the capital of Damascus,\" claiming President Bashar al-Assad has been overthrown. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): With the help of God, the city of Damascus was liberated and the regime of the tyrant Bashar al-Assad was toppled, all prisoners from the prisons of the regime were liberated. The operation center of Fateh Dimashk asks all brothers, jihadists and citizens to preserve all the belongings of the Syrian state. Long live free Syria.\" (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They purportedly took him to a hotel so that he could hand over government authority.Well, rebels seen celebrating in the grounds of the Syrian presidential palace this morning as well. And they say they are searching for President Assad, who has not been seen or heard from in days. Well, let's remind ourselves that rebels have been sweeping through the country of Syria since launching what was this lightning offensive last week. They captured four cities in one day before reaching the capital, Damascus, there in the south. New video shows the rebel flag raised over Damascus hospital and military uniforms littering the streets. Iran's embassy in the city also stormed during the takeover, according to Iranian state media. Well, back with me now is CNN's Paula Hancocks, who is monitoring the situation from here in Abu Dhabi. It is 1:00 o'clock in the afternoon, Sunday, the 9th of December, am I right in saying that? I think it is the 9th of December. This will be a day that many, many, many millions of Syrians will remember for the rest of their lives.",

But you can't underplay what is happening here and just how that will make many people feel. You see the celebrations on the street. You see them toppling statues of Bashar al-Assad, of his father as well, the former president and dictator.So there is no doubt that there is a celebratory feeling amongst most in Damascus. We could see in some images, actually, it was interesting, on the presidential palace you saw people coming into the palace itself. You could see children among there. It was almost a family day out. You go to where the president once had his seat of power and you could see some looting. You could see people coming out with chairs, with tables. Unmixed among them were the rebels, the gunmen. It seemed a very peaceful transition in that sense. So this is what we are trying to piece together at this point, what is happening on the ground. We see the Prime Minister, as you mentioned, being escorted from his home and then going to hand over authority. That appeared to be a peaceful transition, as the Prime Minister himself had said he wanted to see. And then you see these celebratory pictures as well. But at the same time, you also hear that Iran's embassy, for example, in Damascus, that has been stormed. We have seen that from press TV. We have seen from Saudi TV that there is damage, that there are pictures of Qasem Soleimani, who was the commander of the IRGC, being ripped up. So at the same time as you have this feeling of celebration, you also have this feeling of anger as to what had happened and some retribution and retaliation against, for example, the Iranian embassy, those that were behind the Assad regime.",

But he hasn't been seen of since they actually came into the capital itself. ANDERSONyou. Let's get you to Vienna, in Austria, Syrian writer and journalist Rime Allaf. And in London, CNN's Nick Paton Walsh. Reem, as you watch the images unfold from Syria this morning, your thoughts? RIME ALLAF, WRITER &amp; JOURNALIST: First of all, elation for all the Syrians who've waited 54 years for freedom from this regime. And I have to remind everybody, it is not just the Bashar al-Assad regime, it is the Assad regime as a whole. There's also apprehension. I think everybody understands full well, all over Syria, not just in Damascus, that things could go very wrong. People, I believe, were reassured so far by the leader of the rebels, even though this is not necessarily what they would have hoped for, you know, to have a transition in this manner. But they are hopeful that we have already a resolution. For nine years now, the United Nations Security Council 2254, which had always planned for negotiations between the opposition and the government, then a constitution to be drafted and then elections to be held. So this is what I believe I and many Syrians are holding on to for the time being.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, I mean, look, it's incredibly early days, Becky, and I think what's important to, I think it's important to remember that we are hearing inclusive messages from this rebel group so far, reaching out to minorities, explaining that there's a space for the variety of different religions, the different parts of the Islamic faith to make up Syria within this new government. But you have to remember, this would be an extraordinary achievement after the horrific sectarian nature of the civil war. And remember, too, that predominantly this rebel force is going to be Sunni.And there clearly are groups that have had more moderate, more sort of less religious motivations behind them that form part of the group. But ultimately, their figurehead, al-Jalali, is somebody who previously had affiliations with al-Qaeda that means there's still a $10 million bounty on his head. So it's a very complex needle for them to thread going forwards, because I think this group are going to have to simultaneously satisfy the anger and the sort of sense of sacrifice of its own fighters, while at the same time, too, trying to put out a message to the international community that they're not just another iteration of that sectarian hatred. And, of course, try and get some international aid in, too. Remember, so much of Syria is rubble at the moment and needs desperate, urgent rebuilding. There's an acute hunger crisis. So the needs of tomorrow, as we've seen in the past, people who are very good at toppling regimes or governments turn out to be rubbish at governing. But it does seem that behind this particular rebel movement that there are a lot of fairly well-sophisticated backers.",

You know, we're all disheveled. We're trying to understand what's going on. I have to tell you how we see it from the Syrian side. And, you know, we've been on the phone the whole time with our family, our friends and other, you know, people who are involved in this. We've always had this opposition. This opposition has been accepted. We are not necessarily, it's not for everybody. It's not everybody's cup of tea. But this is what we have at the moment. These are the people who have gotten recognition from the international community and who know what the steps that we need to take are. We have a group, and I'm going to have to disagree a little bit with Nick here. It is not the sectarian -- the sectarian violence or the sectarian mentality did not come exclusively from rebels, but mostly from the Assad regime and its backers, specifically Iran. But the point I wanted to make right now is that while the leader is absolutely an Islamist, he doesn't hide it. A lot of the young people who we have seen throughout the week in Aleppo and Hama and Homs and now in Damascus were the young men, the teenagers who were bussed out and forcibly displaced from Aleppo, from Hama, from Homs, 2014, 2016. You were there, Becky. You've talked about this. And Ghouta, 2018. These people, these young men in particular, have grown up, have been away from their country for eight years, some six years, and have always wanted to come back. So that brings me back to what comes next. What comes next is that Jolani himself has said that he would like people -- he would like to invite all the Syrians who have emigrated, who have sought refuge, and even the expats to come back to Syria so we build together. I think because of the last 13 years, they know, the people at the head of the group now, that Syrians will not take such nonsense any longer after the 13 years of hell we've had. And I think they understand that Syria is not Afghanistan, it is not Iran, and we are too mixed for that. The fact that we are all supportive so far, even people who are secular to the bone, like myself, and like many of my colleagues, I think we have all agreed that for the time being, let's see what comes. If then the next steps are not going to be the constitution and the elections, I think a lot of people will have something to say about it. But you know what? It's only been a few hours. I think we have to try to give them the benefit of the doubt and to take them at their word when they invite us all to come back to Syria and to participate. I mean, people are already making plans, Becky, and probably we will see each other there, hopefully in Damascus.",

It has implications for the wider region and, indeed, on the sort of spillover of refugees and those displaced from Syria into, for example, a country like the U.K. I'm reading social media posts from Syrians in the U.K. who are thanking those who've looked after them over the years but want to go home. And there will be a push for so many Syrians now displaced from their homes and their country to move back. Natasha, as you look at what is going on, what's your assessment?",

These countries met in Doha just this weekend, Russia, Turkey, Iran, to discuss the latest developments on Syria. As you rightly point out, there is a sense of abandonment by a very depleted Iran, an abandonment of the Assad regime, an abandonment by the Russians of that very same regime, and a Turkey who feels somewhat emboldened, influential, will seek likely further influence in the country going forward.What does that political solution then look like today? We have the leader of a rebel group in charge, it seems, in terms of what at least in principle will be the early days of a transition, a group that is designated by the U.S. and others as a terror group. What do you make of what happens in the days to come? It certainly feels to me as if a political solution of the sort of U.N.

You have this organization, Tahrir al-Sham, which is in essence in control, but there's all these other opposition forces that have united with it. In these kinds of instances or situations, you could have groups jockeying for power, and that could lead to more instability.The hope would be that they could come up with some sort of power- sharing arrangement that is as inclusive as possible, given the complex demographics in Syria, that then lures more people to come back, more Syrians to come back, and play a role in the transition, and that doesn't try to completely gut the state as what happened in the case of Iraq, which then led to subsequent state failure. I think that's one of the biggest concerns, that with all this uncertainty, that state failure could emerge where the institutions aren't able to provide the basic services, people get frustrated, and you start to see pockets of instability, lack of security, and then the rise of violent non-state groups, which could be like jihadist terrorist organizations, as I mentioned before. So there are so many critical things that need to happen, but there needs to be, at the very least, an openness to work with others, to not focus on retribution, and to try to focus on inclusivity to move the Syrian state forward.",

This is a family enterprise of many decades. And I think that if the international community takes this seriously, then they can see different arguments.There's a security argument. There's also a migration argument. You know, the subject of Syrian refugees in Turkey has been coming up again and again in recent years. Well, if you stabilize Syria and you make Syria safe and sustainable, then people will want to go home. Refugees don't want to leave their homes. Refugees don't want to be a burden in someone else's country. Refugees want to be able to return home. And I think that as long as we recognize that this is the reality on the ground, and we try to help Syrians actually create a more sustainable governing structure going forward, then it works for all of our interests in Europe, in the Arab world, more internationally.",

The sort of word of the day from whether it's Qatar or Syria or wherever it is, is blame Assad. It's all Assad's fault. He had the opportunity, at least since 2016, when the war in Syria went quiet to achieve national unity and to really work towards keeping the country in a positive and forward moving direction. And according to the Turkish government, he absolutely failed. They said that when they got sort of an inkling, and even over the past, you know, period, the Turkish president had tried to reach out to Assad and they had no response whatsoever. They claimed that they saw Syria, quote, unquote, and the regime \"decaying and collapsing.\" They said that even without -- practically without a bullet fired, this rebel group led by al-Jolani took Aleppo and then all the other cities and now finally Damascus. But the Turks are talking, you know, in terms of what the international community would, I think, you know, like to hear. And that is they want a government of national unity. They want a proper transition. They want territorial integrity for Syria. And they want, as I said, you know, diversity and national unity, in other words, protect the minorities as well. And in that regard, presumably they're speaking to the sizable but still minority Alawite population who over the decades have supported and been the power base of the Assad family. So I don't know how many decades people are saying, you know, five decades since the Assad family has been in charge of Syria and now that has collapsed.
