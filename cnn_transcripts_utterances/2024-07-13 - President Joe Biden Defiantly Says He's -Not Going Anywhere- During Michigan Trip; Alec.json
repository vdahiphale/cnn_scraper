Here's CNN's Brian Todd. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): For President Biden, Michigan is part of an urgent dash for the so called blue wall, traditional Democratic must win states which are likely to be tightly contested this year. AMY WALTER, PUBLISHER AND EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, COOK POLITICAL REPORT: The only real viable pathway to 270 electoral votes for Biden goes through the Midwest. It goes through Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan, those states that Biden carried narrowly in 2020, Arizona, Georgia, those states seem to be slipping away. TODD (voice-over): It's why the President was in Michigan Friday, and why he spent a lot of time in the Wolverine State during this campaign cycle. But Michigan is precarious for Biden right now. Some top Democrats in the state like Senator Gary Peters, and Congresswoman Elissa Slotkin, who's running for an open Senate seat in Michigan and hasn't said whether she supports Biden this year or not. We're absent from Friday's event. CNN just spoke with some older voters in Michigan, who supported Biden before but who are wavering on him now. JANICE WERBINSKI, VOTED FOR BIDEN IN 2020: I think he was wonderful as our president, but I really think he's failing. MAX HARDY, VOTED FOR BIDEN IN 2020: Deep down I would like to see some of the younger stars in the Democratic Party and have Joe gracefully hand over the baton to them. TODD (voice-over): After Donald Trump narrowly defeated Hillary Clinton in Michigan in 2016, a crucial loss for Clinton, Biden flipped the state back to the Democrats in 2020.

Look up and down the east coast as well. Some of this extreme heat again has just been sweltering. These are the heat alerts for today. You can see a lot of the warnings here still over the west coast, over parts of California, parts of Nevada, and then we're starting to find the advisories spread into the plains as that heat starts to shimmy its way east as we go into the work week.

They have now had seven consecutive days with that temperature of 115 or hotter, that breaks records. It's unprecedented. They've had three days over 118 degrees, again unprecedented heat.

And that's really an important thing to do, because not only does the air condition become less efficient when it's hot out, the power plants are less efficient when it's hot out. The whole system is less efficient. Just like you and I, if we go run a marathon when it's hot out, it's harder to do them when it's cool out. So, we need to make everything more efficient.
