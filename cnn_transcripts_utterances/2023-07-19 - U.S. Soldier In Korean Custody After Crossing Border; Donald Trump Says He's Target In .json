And we begin this hour in North Korea where U.S. Soldier Private 2nd Class Travis King is now being held after willfully and without authorization crossing over from the demilitarized zone of heavily fortified de facto border, which separates North and South Korea.Private King had just been released for detention in South Korea on assault charges, was sent to fly back to the U.S. to face further disciplinary action at Fort Bliss in Texas. But according to U.S. officials, once his military escort left the airport, King did as well, somehow joining a tour bus which traveled to the border village of Panmunjom in the Joint Security Area of the DMZ and from there, he bolted into North Korea. U.S. officials say so far there is no indication King is a North Korean sympathizer or this was an attempt to defect. But the incident comes at a very tense time, with North Korea firing off another two ballistic missiles just hours ago.

We don't know at this time know of anyone else who has been identified as a target or at least told by prosecutors that they are likely to be charged. But this is the sort of signal that the Justice Department gives at the end of an investigation. And this has been a sprawling probe from the Justice Department from the Special Counsel. It is separate from the documents case that Donald Trump has already been charged in in Florida. And this is an investigation that has looked at knowledge that Donald Trump had that he lost the election. It's looked at what was said inside the White House on crucial dates after the 2020 election in a late night meeting on December 18th, where supporters of his were throwing out outlandish ideas that he could use his powers of the presidency to overturn the election. It's also looked at testimony from Vice President Mike Pence for who was serving alongside Trump at the time and was pressured to block the election results. It's also looked at threats, intimidation and outreach that various people, including from Trump himself have made in battleground states, seven different battleground states and there have been officials that CNN has confirmed in each of the seven battleground states that Donald Trump lost and in which he tried to overturn the election. They have spoken to investigators that's Georgia, Pennsylvania, New Mexico, Michigan, Arizona, Wisconsin, Nevada. And so, this investigation is at a point where charges are very likely in the coming days or weeks. Donald Trump is very likely to be charged. We don't know if others are, we haven't found other target letters out there that others have confirmed receiving. But this is an investigation that while the Justice Department is not commenting publicly, their target letter to Donald Trump on Sunday speaks volumes about the work of their grand jury which still is expected to meet as soon again as Thursday.

But there are heat domes and tele connected ways across the western part of the United States, the western part of the Atlantic, all of the European countries, especially southern Europe, and then back out here into parts of Asia.If you are under the ridge of high pressure, that line you see there's the jet stream. If you're under that, south of that, then all of a sudden you are going to be in some very hot weather. If you're north of it, you're going to be a little bit cooler. Of course, that's how it all works. But taking you back all the way to July 3rd, the July of 2023 has been a above all the other months. In fact, all the way above the old record high setting you back into 2016. So, look at this, Persian Gulf International Airport, the heat index was 152 degrees, almost unbearable for most and we're going to be hot again for today. Hot again for tomorrow, this isn't going to change very much, temperatures are going to be approaching 50 degrees in Kuwait City a little drier there. But for Rome, 41.8, the new all-time record for July. That was just broken last July. So again, one degree higher than the old record there in Rome, and it's going to be hot over the next couple of days. Northwestern Europe, you're in awesome shape. It's cooler than normal. You're not part of that heat dome that I talked about. Very, very cool weather there, windy and cold in some spots. If you watched any of the Scottish Open. Here's the forecast for some fires here around Athens as well. We talked about that over the last couple of days. Rome, you're going to begin to cool down from the 40s down into the 30s. I think really low for Greece. For Athens, you're not going to cool down much, you're still going to be above 40 well above your normal high. Rome, you should be 32, you'll be 38, cooling slightly in the middle of the week, but not below normal. And then here the heat dome for the United States excessive heat warnings all the way for millions, tens of millions of people in the heat dome category here from Death Valley to Vegas to Palm Springs into Phoenix, all 10 to 15 degrees above normal for the next couple of days.

But when civil war broke out in Yemen in 2015, the Safer came under control of Houthi rebel forces backed by Iran and was essentially abandoned.And with no maintenance work over the past eight years, the structural integrity equipment and operating systems are all decaying. U.N. officials warned a major leak or explosion is simply a matter of time. The Safer has capacity of up to three million barrels of oil. But right now is holding less than half of that, about 1.14 million barrels. Still, if all that was to leak, it would be four times the amount of oil, which leaked during the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster, and would rank as the world's fifth worst oil leak from a tanker and with a cleanup cost, according to the U.N., around $20 billion. And recovery of fish stocks alone could take up to 25 years. Well, for more on how the U.N. plans to avoid that from happening.

So, within Aden and Sanaa, a great deal of sharp diplomacy, a year in groundwork and the parameters for this operation. And once that was agreed, and the secretary general authorizes this operation UNDP was tasked with the implementation, which is really the whole organization that then followed, but as you can imagine, even in the operational preparations, complexity and also lack of trust and doubts arose, so a continuous process of trying to build the trust and create the space and also the conditions under which you're able to deploy such an operation and what is the fact that delay was on a conflict zone.",

The tanker could break apart, even during the process of for instance, pumping the oil off. So we had to do a lot of work with a salvage company that we specifically recruited for this process. Smith that had to do an assessment of the structural integrity.Another risk was an explosion, and therefore, the levels of inert gas inside the tanks had to be first of all tested because nobody had really done this for a period of ideas. So, in the last month, month and a half, a great deal of testing and preparations have to be done in order to mitigate these risks. As we speak, we also have a consortium of insurance companies from all over the world, who we worked with our five months period to negotiate a package of insurances that have been trainings on land with local officials in case there's an oil spill, a stand by aircraft with chemicals, in case of a larger oil spill had to be arranged. All these are measures that UNDP has been putting in place over the last three to four months in order to bring the risks to a minimum.

So, these were the conditions with which we had to work and the priority and the most immediate risk was to secure the oil onto the vessel so that this catastrophic accident would no longer be a scenario that could happen. Now, obviously, with both sides and are as important, we'll continue to discuss with them. There are also plans to eventually sell the oil, but we have to go in steps and in phases, and therefore at this point in time, the oil will be transferred onto a safe vessel that we bought specifically for this purpose. And then in the next step, there is hopefully going to be agreement between the internationally recognized government that de facto authorities to sell this on eventually and those funds will then be injected into what is one of the largest humanitarian operations in the world that the U.N. is currently undertaking. So, the needs are enormous. And therefore, these funds could then be invested also in reconstruction of destroying facilities into support for the Yemeni population.
