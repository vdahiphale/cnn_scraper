We ill break down what he said under oath and why the judge struck down some of his very brief testimony as the case is now heading to closing arguments.Also tonight, the Republican National Committee is considering an unprecedented move to declare Trump the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, siding with the former president and against his remaining opponent, Nikki Haley. I'll get reaction from a top Haley supporter, New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu. And breaking news, a record close on Wall Street after new evidence of a booming U.S. economy with growth beating expectations. It's a boon for President Biden as he visits a key 2024 battleground state and ramps up for his expected rematch with Trump. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM. We begin with Donald Trump on the witness stand testifying in one of the slew of court cases where the former president is now a defendant. CNN's Kara Scannell has our report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KARA SCANNELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over):  In an extraordinary move for Donald Trump, the former president briefly taking the stand in the E. Jean Carroll defamation trial against him, as the 2024 Republican presidential frontrunner continues his strategy, a bouncing between multiple court appearances and the campaign trail. Trump testified for less than three minutes in the civil trial that will decide how much money, if any, he must pay Carroll in damages for statements he made about her sexual assault allegations against him. Trump Attorney Alina Habba asking Trump, do you stand by your testimony in the deposition? 100 percent yes, Trump replied. He was then asked if he made the statement in 2019 in response to Carroll's accusation. Yes, I did. She said something that I considered a false accusation, totally false, Trump testified. Judge Lewis Kaplan immediately cut Trump off saying everything after yes, I did is stricken. Finally, Trump's lawyer asked if he intended to hurt Carroll with his statements. No, he responded. I just wanted to defend myself, my family, and, frankly, the presidency. After a brief redirect, Trump was off the stand and the defense rested. The judge allowed only very narrow testimony, ordering restrictions that Trump could not deny assaulting Carroll or say that she lied about the rape allegation because those questions are not before this jury. A civil jury already found that Trump sexually assaulted Carroll and then defamed her in a 2022 statement. The judge previously ruled that verdict would carry over to this defamation trial. Before Trump's testimony, Carroll's lawyers rested her case after playing a series of video clips of Trump disparaging her and misidentifying Carroll as his wife, Marla Maples, while looking at a photo. DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT:  It's Marla.",

He chose not to attend that particular hearing, and now he's attempted to use a backdoor entrance to do so here, the judge not having it. Why? Because at the end of the day, this is no longer a matter of whether a jury ought to find or will find that he committed the acts alleged. Now, it's a matter of what the damages will automatically be for this particular now plaintiffs, in this case, the defendant. And so when you look at this, you have to think about why they're here.Now, why that jury is there as opposed to why Donald Trump is appearing, very different things. But look at that narrow questioning, trying to almost contort oneself into pretzels to try to even have a reason to be on that stand that would speak to the very important issue of damages. He did not have that opportunity to do so today because that had already been resolved as to what he wanted to talk about. So, what you saw here today was an opportunity, I think, in some ways to show that he was present and before this jury, but not for the reasons that he articulates now for having wanted to be, I guess, a year ago.",

He chose to go there and wanted to testify. That is an optional presence by him in that courtroom today.But what stood out to me was there was this moment where the jury was actually not in the room. And that was when Alina Habba, Trump's attorney, was asking the judge, Judge Kaplan, about Trump getting on the stand to testify before he did ever so briefly. And during that back and forth, the judge and the attorney were talking, but Trump could be overheard also making statements in the court and also talking to Alina. Now, the jury was not in the room to hear Trump saying things like, I don't know this woman, this is a made up story, which is what he was saying about E. Jean Carroll, but reporters in the room could certainly hear those comments. And I think it fits into Trump knew that was not something the jury itself was going to see, but it's something that gets amplified and it fits into how he is using the courtroom as this political platform while he's trying to lock up the Republican nomination.",

Certainly, it appears to be, if true, an unforced error to have appointed somebody with whom you have a personal romantic relationship, why? Because judges are likely to recuse themselves for the hint of impropriety. In an instance like this, it serves as quite a big distraction. And the last thing you want to have as a jury is looking at a prosecutor and wondering why they're there. Is the length of the trial or the nature of the charges somehow intended to elongate and prolong a relationship of some kind? You don't want these conversations happening. So, this is going to be very important to going forward as to whether it actually implicates the underlying facts. We've seen no evidence whatsoever yet that it actually goes to the heart of the matter for what Donald Trump has been accused of doing, but a distraction, it certainly is.",

This is where they say that it could be really problematic, obviously, not for Trump, but for Fani Willis here. And I think it's not even just whether or not she recuses herself. It's the optics of this case because we've seen, you know, what's been laid out in this indictment, how damaging this was. We watched all of these co-defendants have to come and plead not guilty.

First of all, as Laura mentioned, there's questions over the relationship between D.A. Willis and Mr. Wade. There's questions over why someone who was underqualified, in my view, to handle a case like this was appointed. There are questions about why he's been paid seven, eight, nine times more than the other prosecutors on the case. And separately, as Zach Cohen just told us, the D.A. went in public and said that the defendant's motivation in bringing their motions here was racist. Now, that's potentially prejudicial to those defendants when it comes time to pick a jury. So, we've got two sets of substantial issues here.",

One of the committee members, an ally of Donald Trump's, brought this forward to the resolutions committee so that eventually it might go before the 168 members.This would be a huge departure from what the Republican National Committee usually does. It effectively says that they would back Donald Trump as the presumptive nominee if this was to be approved, even though Nikki Haley is still in the race. And that's really the key here, that it's not just that it's early, it's that there are still two rivals who are both Republicans. Again, a huge break from how they normally handle the nominating process, which is to remain neutral. Now, the one thing to keep in mind here is that we've already heard from the chairwoman, Ronna McDaniel, also an ally of Donald Trump's, effectively saying it was time for the Republican Party to unite around Donald Trump because he was going to be the nominee. That in itself was already a break. This would take it a step farther. So, if this was to get approved, here's what this would give Donald Trump access to. It would give him access to the RNC data operation, he would benefit from the fundraising with the RNC, and it would give him access to the ground operation. Now, we have already heard a reaction from Nikki Haley's spokeswoman, the campaign spokeswoman, saying if Ronna McDaniel wants to be helpful, she can organize a debate in South Carolina unless she's also worried that Trump can't handle being on the stage for 90 minutes with Nikki Haley. [18:20:08] Obviously, we know that something Nikki Haley is pushing for is the debate. Donald Trump himself, no indication that he is going to do that. And I will tell you one other thing. There was a little bit of pushback from the Republican National Committee who sought to clarify that Ronna McDaniel herself does not offer up these resolutions and it still has to be voted on and approved. But, again, it is a pretty striking proposal right now and a huge departure from the way the Republican National Committee usually handles this.",

Let me get your quick reaction to this RNC draft proposal to declare Trump the presumptive presidential nominee. GOV. CHRIS SUNUNU (R-NH):  Yes, it's absolutely awful. You know, the Republican Party, we like to talk about civics and the process and the voters having a say, but then when it comes to Donald Trump, his attempts -- I mean, the hypocrisy, right, is just so silly because his attempts to now manipulate the process that he claims was so rigged against him a couple of years ago. And it is right out there in the open, right? I mean, they don't even have the courtesy to go into the backrooms and smoke cigarettes and do it like you see in the cartoon. So, look, the RNC is -- from the very beginning, they hired David Bossy, a former Trump guy, to design the system to do the debates. And then they never forced Trump onto the stage to do the debates. And now, Ronna is taking a side and now they want to do this resolution. It's just dumb. It's awful. So, the good news is this, the voters decide. They really do. There is going to be an election in South Carolina.

No, she's going to fight hard.And she went from, again, 5 percent to 20 percent to like 44, 45 percent going into her home state. She has all that wind and momentum at her back. That's why Trump is so scared. He's very nervous about what could happen there.

And talking to the McConnell folks, they're very confident this bill is going to get through the Senate but it's dead on arrival in the house.And as a lifelong Republican, I just have to say, it is so disingenuous and it is so counterproductive to the cause of wanting to secure the border to say that we're going to hold off on this crisis and not address it until the earliest January of next year if a new president were to be sworn in. This is a mistake for Republicans and it frankly could end up really jeopardizing the House majority.",

And for him to have to take this tone while also wanting her to get out of the race so that he can focus on being the nominee is really challenging for him. And we will see how long Donald Trump will stay disciplined on this. I do believe in a primary process on both sides of the aisle. And it is interesting to see how he is doing in this primary process and not enjoying it as much as one would think he would, the fact that he's still winning, right? Yes, Nikki Haley is probably making him a sharper candidate. He has to talk about certain issues that he doesn't really want to talk about. But the primary process actually could bolster him to understand where exactly his support is, but it is interesting to see him walk backwards on his full-on attacks of Nikki Haley wanting everyone to unify around him, and this time go against the RNC.",

Investors encouraged by a surprisingly very strong report on economic growth here in the United States that trounced expectations.Let's go to CNN Senior White House Correspondent M.J. Lee. M.J., so, what is President Biden saying about this? M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Well, the White House, Wolf, is certainly pointing to today's GDP as one more data point in what they see as an economy that is continuing to move in the right direction. GDP last quarter of last year grew by some 3.3 percent. This far exceeded expectations of around 1.5 percent growth. And what White House officials say is that it is that, in addition to a number of other indicators that have them feeling optimistic. Of course, inflation has been trending down for some time. The Consumer Confidence Index, which is one data point that the White House watches particularly closely, that jumped up last month. And we also have seen the jobs market be robust for quite some time. Now, when we saw the president traveling to Wisconsin earlier today to try to sell his record on the economy and infrastructure, we saw him doing that in part by taking a jab at his predecessor, Donald Trump. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  My predecessor, though, he chose a different course, trickledown economics, cut taxes for the very wealthy and big corporations, increasing the deficit significantly. He talked about infrastructure every week for four years. On my watch, instead of infrastructure week, America is having an infrastructure decade. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
