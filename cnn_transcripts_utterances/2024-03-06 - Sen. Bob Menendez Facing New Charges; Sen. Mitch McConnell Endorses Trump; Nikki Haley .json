They were talking about how the next couple weeks are really going to look like expanding their ground game, how they were going to build out in states like Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona, those battleground key states, Pennsylvania being one of them as well.But I do want to note one thing that happened, because you heard Manu there talking about these lawmakers, the Republican Party really falling in line between -- behind the former president. We also heard from the Republican National Committee. They issued a statement saying, essentially, congratulations to Donald Trump. But the real key part of this is that they acknowledge him as the presumptive Republican nominee for president. The reason why that is so key is because, once someone is the presumptive nominee, the RNC no longer is a neutral with a candidate, and they get all the resources, meaning Donald Trump gets all the resources that the RNC has. That means access to funds, fund-raising, donor lists, infrastructure in various states. Donald Trump's campaign needs this. As we have reported time and time again, they have kept a very lean staff, a very small staff, and they need more money. They were waiting for this moment to become the presumptive nominee. It's also part of why they were so annoyed that Nikki Haley stayed in the race, because they wanted access to all of these resources. The other thing to note, it's really the Republican Party becoming the party of Donald Trump. I know we have said this for years, but it couldn't be more clear in what is happening right now. Keep in mind, the chairwoman, Ronna McDaniel, has said that she's going to step down after Donald Trump becomes the presumptive nominee. That is because Donald Trump had grown frustrated with McDaniel. Now he has nominated the head of the North Carolina Republican Party, Michael Whatley, who focuses on elections, to be the chairman. He also nominated his daughter-in-law, Laura Trump, to be the co-chair. On top of that, his campaign manager, co-campaign manager, Chris LaCivita, is expected to go into the role of chief operating officer. I'm also told that various other campaign staffers have been approached about various positions within the RNC. You are seeing a full alignment of the Republican Party and Donald Trump really coming together right now even faster than you have ever seen before.",

So what we're calling Haley voters are actually going to be independents, never-Trumper Republicans, and some Democrats. So what we're looking at is pieces of the Biden 2020 coalition. I mean, in our January poll, we found 19 percent of Haley supporters said they voted for Joe Biden in 2020. So there is overlap there.

And that kind of language, the campaign, Donald Trump's campaign understands that that is not how you do addition. And I guarantee you the person who wrote the statement this morning for Donald Trump, which is opposite of what he has been saying, was not him. And so I think, moving forward, I think it's going to be hard for him to maintain that stance, because, for him, it is all about just the MAGA movement. And, interestingly, in Nikki Haley's statement, she kind of went after the MAGA movement. She talked about how dysfunctional Congress was. Well, Congress is dysfunctional because of the MAGA movement. They haven't been able to do anything. She went after people who were not supporting money for Ukraine, money for Israel. Who is that? That's the MAGA movement. And so I think it's interesting. She also is trying to continue to have her lane.

I don't know any Republicans anymore that embrace Trump or can embrace the party. They have all become independents. I think a lot of people don't understand what's going on. I know that the type of personality that is attracted to Donald Trump isn't troubled by this. They're authoritarian personalities, and they think this is their strongman, and they want to have him prevail. So it tells us where we're going. I suspect we're in the general election mode right now. While Haley was mentioning his criminal problems, not very much. I think that's going to change, and I think that they're going to become much more front and center as the White House goes after him. ACOSTA:  Yes, I mean, John and Wolf, I mean, one of the things that we didn't talk about very much this morning is all of the legal hot water that Donald Trump is in and will stay in for the duration of this campaign, it looks like. And I do want to ask you about a new CNN exit poll last night that indicates the majority of Republican voters in six Super Tuesday states say Trump is fit for the presidency even if he's convicted of a crime. John, what does that say about the state of your former party? I can't imagine, when you were around during the Watergate days, that you would have seen similar numbers in the case of Richard Nixon.",
