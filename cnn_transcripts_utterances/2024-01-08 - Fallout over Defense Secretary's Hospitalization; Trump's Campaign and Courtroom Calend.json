That omission apparently includes the Pentagon's number two.Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks, two defense officials tell CNN, she was not notified that Austin was in the hospital, even when she began assuming some of his duties on January 2nd, one day after he was taken by ambulance to Walter Reed. CNN national security reporter Natasha Bertrand is at the Pentagon. Natasha, we know that Lloyd Austin is a very, very private person, but he is in this major public role.

He's saying that I can't be prosecuted in this case because what I am charged with doing here was in the scope of my job as president. Important distinction though, Donald Trump is actually not arguing that every single thing that happened during my endure four years is president I cannot be charged for. What -- his argument's a little narrower than that. He's saying, I can't be charged because it was while I was president, but also within the outer scope of my job as president. Now, he lost that argument before, Judge Chutkan, the district judge, forcefully rejected that and he's lost variations of that argument in other contexts, as have others, including Mark Meadows.",
