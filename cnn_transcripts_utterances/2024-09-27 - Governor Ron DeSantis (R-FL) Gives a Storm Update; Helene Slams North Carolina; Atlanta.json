We understand five deaths overall as you move up north into Georgia and North Carolina. The governor reporting more than a million customers currently without power in Florida, although power has been restored to another million who had lost power at one point. The storm surge along the coast, Tampa, Clearwater, south, record- setting, worst maybe in some cases than they were expecting. Still assessing some of the damage there. Hundreds and hundreds of water rescues overnight. Now the storm has moved up into Georgia and North Carolina.

We know this scene has been repeated throughout the city of Atlanta. We know more within 25 rescues happened with the Atlanta fire department being able to jump in this morning and actually had to use boats to get some people out of their homes. And then we have that video that I think is going to be - a lot of people are going to remember of that baby, that infant, being rescued from a car that happened early this morning as well. So, you see that process in terms of them having to rescue people. Water of more than eight inches coming into the Atlanta area. So, very quickly. And, of course, we're still expecting more rain. The good news is, we have had heavy wind gusts so far, but they haven't been substantial in terms of sustaining themselves for several hours. So, that has been the good part. As with trees falling all across the area and power being out. As you look back this direction, those men are getting to take that long walk back toward their apartment as they surveyed everything. But they're going to have to go back in that waist deep water as I deal with this flooding situations here in Atlanta. John.",

And again, the ground is so saturated there it will be some time before it's really safe to move about. And the same is here true in Tallahassee. I have to say, we just heard some cracking up in the trees there, making us wonder if maybe a branch or one of these limbs that was waterlogged last night was beginning to fall. But it doesn't look like anything new is coming down there. Let's get to CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar at the Weather Center. Allison, where is the storm now? How much more rain will it bring, particularly, we were looking at Asheville, North Carolina. Our Isabel Rosales just standing in gushing water there.",

Obviously, something that's going to be affecting people for some time.With us now is the mayor of Tallahassee, where I am, John Dailey. Mayor, thank you so much for being with us. This may be the last time we talk because I get the sense Tallahassee doing OK this morning. MAYOR JOHN DAILEY (D) TALLAHASSEE, FLORIDA: well, the sun is shining, that is for sure, and it's a beautiful day outside. Yes, look, when the storm took a jog to the east, it made landfall 57 miles away from Tallahassee. So, we did not have the brunt of the storm. You know, my thoughts and prayers are with my neighbors down on the coast over in Taylor County, the good people over there. Nonetheless, we did - we did have some damage. We've got about 50,000 customers without power, representing about 40 percent. That's down from 50 percent earlier this morning. But look, hats off to the great men and women of the city of Tallahassee out there on the frontlines. Our first responders and the utility workers. They got out there, you know, at 2:00, 3:00 in the morning, as soon as the storm passed, did the initial assessment, started working on the utility lines. Our wastewater system worked. Our water system worked. Our storm water system worked. We had no flooding, no reported deaths. But we do need to get out there and we're putting the electricity back up so we can get everybody turned back on. We had about 50 roads that were blocked. So, you know, we've got a lot of work we need to do in this community. By no stretch of the imagination are we done. We have just begun. But it could have been much worse. That is correct.",
