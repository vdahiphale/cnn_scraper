Leaders are gathering in Vilnius for the NATO Summit, split on Ukraine's hopes of membership in the alliance. Plus, protesters are promising an all-nighter outside Israel's parliament. Lawmakers are set in the next hour to vote on changing the country's judicial system. And disgraced former USA gymnastics doctor, Larry Nassar, has been stabbed in prison. An internal investigation is underway. We begin tonight in Vilnius, Lithuania, on the eve of a critical NATO Summit. Leaders from around the world preparing for the meeting, which will put Russia's war in Ukraine front and center. The crucial question, is there a path for Ukraine's membership to the bloc? Well, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is pushing for a united response to his country's request to join. But U.S. President Joe Biden tells CNN, he doesn't think Ukraine is, quote, \"ready, and the time isn't right.\" (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Christina, a number of huge items on the agenda for the next two days, chief among them, ofcourse, as you mentioned is whether or not Ukraine will have a path to membership in NATO. How fast that path will be, and what it will actually look like. There is a lot of dissension among the allies about whether Ukraine can join now, whether there can be a fast track to that membership where they can kind of skip some steps in terms of their membership in NATO, or whether they have to wait until the fighting with Russia is over. And even if they do wait until that moment when there is peace, how lasting is that peace? And will the alliance then welcome Ukraine in at that point? That is something that they simply do not have an agreement on just yet. Another question, of course, is in the interim before Ukraine is able to become a member of NATO. What kind of security guarantees is NATO willing to give to Ukraine? President Biden said that the U.S. and NATO seem willing at this point to give them security assurances, akin to what the U.S. gives to Israel. So, perhaps a model like that. But there's still no unanimity on this question. And then, of course, just moving past Ukraine, there's the question of Sweden. Will they be able to join the alliance given Turkey's staunch opposition to their joining, and now a new demand that Erdogan has thrown into the ranch here, which is, that Erdogan wants Turkey to become a member of the European Union, before he will allow Sweden's accession into NATO to actually move forward. So, there's a whole host of ideological issues here, as well as of course, the practical issue of whether the U.S. and NATO are going to be able to continue their logistical and weapons support to Ukraine. President Biden said just this past weekend that the U.S. is running very low on ammunition. Something of course, that the Ukraine desperately needs to continue their counteroffensive against Russia. So, all of these issues are going to be -- you know, try to work out at the summit and over the next two days, but unlikely really, to come to any kind of firm answers that will satisfy everyone.

      "sentences": "I think there's general disappointment we've heard from Jens Stoltenberg, that he says --the NATO Secretary-General, he says that he still thinks there is a positive outcome for Sweden. The Swedish Prime Minister seems optimistic that there's still a positive outcome ahead. German chancellor has weighed in, and he says that Sweden is ready to become a member of NATO. Jens Stoltenberg said that Sweden has met all the things that it needs to do to become a NATO member. Remember, President Erdogan originally said that Sweden wasn't doing enough to combat the PKK, the Kurdish separatist group that Turkey and many others see and call a terrorist organization. He felt that Sweden wasn't pulling its weight, sending some PKK members back to Turkey. Sweden has changed some of its laws in that regard. But this seems to be a whole fresh issue that President Erdogan is opening. And it does sort of raise the question in people's minds what exactly is President Erdogan's bottom line? Will there be something else after this? And from a European Union perspective, there are concerns that President Erdogan has been taking more power, shifting himself from prime minister to president, taking the powers from prime minister into the presidency, a lengthening presidency. That these are not in keeping with the standards that European Union membership would require. So, there is a sense here that Erdogan is putting himself in a position where he cannot get what he is asking for, fulfilled. Therefore, will he continue to block Sweden's membership? And that's an open question. There's, you know, a small amount of optimism there, but it's hard to see the way, because Erdogan hasn't had, sticking by what he says. And this comes hot on the heels of yesterday, President Biden calling President Erdogan from Air Force One when he was flying over here, having a long conversation, talking about the F-16 fighter aircraft that Turkey has -- that Erdogan wants upgraded. And in the same sentence, Biden's National Security adviser bringing in the issue of Swedish membership of NATO. So, it seems that there were some corollary there between those two things. So, you know, it's really unclear, but I think the very short answer to your question is, this is being viewed as widely unhelpful by President Erdogan at this stage.",

Well, it's been weeks since we've heard from Yevgeny Prigozhin, but the typically outspoken leader of the Wagner Mercenary Group is still making headlines. The Kremlin says Prigozhin met with President Vladimir Putin, this, days after ending his rebellion against Russia's top generals, and reportedly agreeing to exile in Belarus. Well, Moscow responding to a report in a French newspaper, the Kremlin says 30-plus commanders attended, but wouldn't say if the defense ministry was represented at that meeting. Well, CNN's Fred Pleitgen joins me now live from Berlin. And Fred, this is pretty puzzling. This was a man who just days before had attempted an insurrection on Moscow. So what do we think Putin was thinking here? What would this mean for Prigozhin's current status?",

      "sentences": "Yes, I think puzzling is exactly the right word, and you know, puzzling for manyinternational observers, certainly, puzzling for many Russians as well to see this happening. And of course, one of the things that we have to remember is when that mutiny or as that mutiny was unfolding on June 24th, and even after Yevgeny Prigozhin called back his forces that were marching on Moscow, as they put it, to try and get to the defense minister and the top general of Russia's military, that Vladimir Putin went in a video message to the Russian nation and called this a betrayal. He essentially called Yevgeny Prigozhin a traitor. And so, just a couple of days later, he hosted Yevgeny Prigozhin inside the Kremlin. And that certainly is something that is quite puzzling to a lot of folks who are -- who are observing this. And then we got some of the details as to what apparently was spoken about. This is, again, according to the Kremlin -- and you already mentioned they said that there were 35 commanders who were at that meeting, including Yevgeny Prigozhin, of course, unclear whether or not anybody from the defense minister was there -- defense ministry was there. But one of the things that we picked out which we thought was really interesting is that, the Kremlin said that Vladimir Putin at that meeting spoke about the mutiny itself. Spoke about the way forward, but also spoke about as the Kremlin says, possible future deployment. Now, that could be seen to mean that Wagner, the Wagner Mercenary Group could make a comeback to the battlefields of Ukraine, of course, completely unclear whether or not Yevgeny Prigozhin would be part of that, whether he would retain any control of the Wagner Group. However, we do know that he's not in Belarus, apparently he is in St. Petersburg, so inside Russia. And we also know now that he was indeed hosted by Vladimir Putin just a couple of days after that mutiny. So clearly, it seems to indicate that the Wagner private military company is very important for Vladimir Putin.",

He essentially said, no, he very much openly encourage Benjamin Netanyahu to walk away from this judicial overhaul plan. But these comments, so far we haven't received any sort of official response from Benjamin Netanyahu himself. But the more right-wing members of this coalition, like Itamar Ben-Gvir, Bezalel Smotrich, have been pushing back in ways that they often push back when they feel the Americans are intervening too much, saying things like we're not a star on the U.S.' flag. We're our own sovereign nation. We can do what we want, we're a democracy, we can do what we want. What's interesting to me about the messaging from this Israeli government regarding the relationship with the White House is, you know, we hear both sides. Their National Security adviser, Tzahi Hanegbi, a few weeks ago was saying, we don't need an invitation to the White House, it doesn't matter. You know, we still deal with the White House all the time on security issues. But then when I once asked the foreign minister who gave a press conference last week about this, saying, so what, you guys don't care about an invitation to the White House? Of course, they care about an invitation to the White House. They want to have this relationship with the White House. And for right now, Benjamin Netanyahu so much of running this government is a balancing act. It's trying to balance, you know, Israel's position on the world stage, Israel relationship with the United States, with his own domestic politics.

Obviously, there are so many Ukrainian civilians who are dying every day, who are getting injured every day by Russian missiles. They need more arms.

We're actually just about a 45, you know, drive north of New York City. This is what this flooding left at its wake, to just demonstrate the sheer strength of the floodwaters that were rushing through this home. This is a massive log that's going to be very hard to move. The owner of this property telling me that those floodwaters are basically depositing. That's just this log. Debris, large and small, and even some picnic tables from a park that's right across the street that you would see right in front of you if you would be standing where I am. It gives you a sense of the cleanup of the force of the water. All of this water coming from a creek that's not far from this home here. Right now what we're seeing, just off camera here, actually, the owner of this home getting a little bit of help from the neighbors. He tells me that he's about 80 years old, has lived here for about 55 years, and he has never seen it at this level. Yet he considers himself lucky. His house, which is behind me, largely spared, except for some basement flooding, but the true loss just north of here in neighboring Orange County, New York, that's where a young woman in her 30s, as she was trying to evacuate her home with her dog and her fiance, was -- she lost her footing. She was swept away and sadly died. Her body later recovered in a ravine. So, it does give you a sense of not just obviously the property toll, but certainly the irreplaceable loss for at least one family. And this also gives you an idea of what could potentially happen as you see the system continue to move to the northeastern part of the United States as there are still millions and millions of people still under threat of flooding.",

Now back in 2018, Nassar admitted to sexually assaulting athletes while he was a sports doctor at Michigan State University as well as USA Gymnastics among some of the athletes that he admitted to sexually assaulting are Olympians Simone Biles and Aly Raisman. Now during his sentencing trial, more than 150 women and girls, they all testified in court. They all described how NASA sexually assaulted them after the women went to him to get treatment for sports related injuries. And he said that the sexual assault that had taken place was a treatment. Now Nassar who is essentially serving a life sentence in federal prison was also pleaded guilty to possession of child pornography charges. Again, Cristina we were told that he is recovering in a hospital that he is in stable condition after he got into some sort of altercation with another inmate at this federal penitentiary.

Belarus supports Russia's war on Ukraine and after the match, Svitolina declined to shake her opponent's hands. Our Patrick Snell's at CNN Center Atlanta with much more on this. And Patrick, before I get to a couple of questions, I just want to say I was actually on court for that match yesterday and I still think, because we saw some boos directed at Azarenka, that there's still a lot of misunderstanding about the stance that Ukrainian players have taken at these grandstands. And that's why we, you know, saw that booing towards Azarenka so that was my read on what actually happened on court number one yesterday, but it was indeed a great match between two titans of the game, two mothers of tennis. But getting to today's action, Patrick, I know there's been a huge upset. We saw world number five Stefanos Tsitsipas ousted by Chris Eubanks who is having the run of his life this fortnight it seems.",

Not long ago, he was ranked 200 or so in the world, he's now up to world number 43, Chrissy, he's only going to go higher after this Wimbledon one.
