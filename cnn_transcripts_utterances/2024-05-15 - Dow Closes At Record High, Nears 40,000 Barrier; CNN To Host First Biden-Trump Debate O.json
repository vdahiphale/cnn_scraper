Consumer prices up 3.4 percent for the 12 months ending in April, compared to 3.5 percent the month before. The other report showing retail sales were flat unchanged during April. Turning to our 2024 lead, mark your calendars for June 27th.

The first one coming up right here on CNN in just six weeks in which I will co-moderate along with my colleague Dana Bash at CNN Studios in Atlanta, Thursday, June 27th. That will be followed by a second debate hosted by ABC News in September.

You know, this was just a recent moment in history when we were all covering these stories and now were seeing the main characters come in, tell their stories under oath, be pushed in prodded by the cross-examination to unearth the truth. So we're getting a lot of the behind the scenes things that we've already seen so much of in the real time that it was, it was playing out just a few years ago. I mean, one thing to that as a criminal case, there is so much extra weight and intensity in that in this moment, even though if convicted Trump is not facing decades in prison, but he could go to prison. And I remember when Donald Trump walked in for his arraignment, it was the first of the criminal charges that he faced. It was the first time that is ever been to a former president. And when he walked in the door, there was such an intensity to the moment. And as you probably remember, when he walks in the door and this courthouse, it's very quiet. It's almost eerily quiet as you see him walk to the defense table and for the proceedings to get underway? But now that we are so close to their being of jury deliberations and a verdict in this case, it feels like the intensity is growing because there is nothing like sitting in the courtroom for the moment when someone is there waiting for that moment of when the judge or the jury, depending on how its handled, says guilty or not guilty.

But what about the center of his testimony, the core elements of his testimony? So far, as far as that goes, he hasn't been nicked.

If he had done that in front of the jury, the jury would have focused on these people and maybe even figured out who they were. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And I have an interesting aside on the last question you asked Judge Konviser about the Trump entourage coming in. I was so locked in to the testimony at the time, I barely noticed them. And I'll patch -- I mean, if you weren't in there -- but I was so locked into what was going on when I heard the reports after, I saw, yeah. So that's the kind of sense that's going on and you have a feeling that the jury and I glance to the job taking very copious notes. So I can't be looking at the jury all the time.
