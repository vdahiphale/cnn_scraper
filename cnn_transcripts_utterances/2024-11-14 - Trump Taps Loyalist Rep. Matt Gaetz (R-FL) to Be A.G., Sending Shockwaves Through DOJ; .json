This morning, one analyst tells the New York Times that President-elect Trump has effectively provoked his first constitutional crisis eight days after winning the election. We are waiting to see what newly elected Senate leaders do after the announcement that Trump will nominate now former Congressman Matt Gaetz to be attorney general.Gaetz is, objectively speaking, loved by some MAGA enthusiasts, but he is, objectively speaking, loathed by a big and very public number of Republicans in Congress. He resigned his House seat just days before the release of a bipartisan House Ethics report on allegations of sexual misconduct. So, how could he get confirmed in the Senate? That is a major question this morning, along with what it tells us about Donald Trump's new administration. A Republican strategist and appointee under Trump's first administration tells Politico, we went from some solid picks to some interesting wild cards, to some that are more than controversial, no way confirmable. This is Trump daring the U.S. Senate. This is Trump potentially usurping the U.S. Senate and going to try to put people in place through recess appointments, which could mean we're at a constitutional crisis from the start of Trump's second term. Let's get right to Steve Contorno in Florida this morning with the pick in the plan here from the transition team, Steve.",

Would there still be a vote? And I think that that is still a question that a lot of people are trying to understand the answer to.You know, I talked to sources who have made clear that if this report is finished, perhaps that is different than just continuing an investigation of a member who has since stepped down.

First, he heads to Peru to attend the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit, the APEC Summit.And what's happening on the sidelines of the summit might even matter slightly more than the official program. Biden is going to be meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Saturday. It'll be their first face-to-face meeting in a year, and likely the last, obviously, before a new era, a Trump era of U.S.-China relations begins.

      "sentences": "Well, Kate, President Biden had hoped to head to these summits preparing to hand off to another Democratic president, but instead he is now facing this new reality as world leaders are now grappling with and trying to game out what a Trump presidency will look like now.The most high-profile meeting President Biden will have will be on the sidelines of the APEC summit in Peru when he sits down with Chinese President Xi Jinping for the first time in a year. Now, senior administration officials said not to expect a long list of deliverables-like meetings in the past, given that Biden is on his way out, but they are expected to touch on issues like Taiwan, also China's support of Russia amid its war in Ukraine, cyber concerns among other issues. Now, Biden has really tried to manage this relationship with an increasingly assertive China, with officials saying that one thing that has been key in this relationship is keeping open lines of communication. The U.S. has taken steps to limit Chinese technology as well as watched with concern about China's aggression towards Taiwan and in the South China Sea. These are all issues that President-elect Trump stands to inherit at a time when he has suggested he will take a very hard line on China. He has promised much tougher tariffs. It also has already selected several China hawks to be part of his administration, perhaps suggesting a more confrontational approach with Beijing in the coming four years. Now, one thing that the Biden White House has stressed is that they believe that his efforts to shore up alliances in the region have really been key to trying to build a counterweight to China. President Biden in the coming days will also be meeting with the South Korean leader as well as the new prime minister of Japan, all as they're trying to show that their efforts towards building and shoring up these alliances have been key in the Indo-Pacific, but they also should be something that a President-elect Trump should continue down the road. But for President Biden, this trip also serves as a real bookend to his presidency. Biden has long focused on foreign policy. It's been a key priority and a personal passion of him. So, he will now be in front of the very world leaders that he has worked with over the last four years, but also at a time when they are grappling with what a Trump presidency will look like. We know that when Obama went on a similar trip after Trump won in 2016, world leaders were asking for advice, asking for their thoughts on Trump. So, we will see if those kind of conversations continue play out as well as Biden heads to both Peru and Brazil this weekend.",
