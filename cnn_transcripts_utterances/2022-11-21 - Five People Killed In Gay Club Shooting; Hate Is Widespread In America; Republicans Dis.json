Hate crimes are up 41 percent across the country since 2019. And we've heard from people in the LGBTQ community in Colorado Springs who say that they've sensed hatred growing against them. So, so why is this happening in Colorado? SEN. JOHN HICKENLOOPER (D-CO):  Well, I think it's happening all across the country.

You have to be - you're touching the person. You have to be right next to the person.A gun, you can be at a distance and kill someone. Not with stabbing. You're looking at them. Sometimes you're talking to them. That's why, as you know, Tom, I'm going to have to tell you, they often look at the significant other of the person when somebody is stabbed because it is a crime of passion. So, do you think it is possible as a serial killer, or what do you think of what Mary Ellen is saying.",

But nonetheless, when someone is stabbed, especially stabbed multiple times, right? That's someone who the stabber, is someone who's either high on drugs, someone who is psychologically out there and having a moment.In many cases, though, we see that this becomes a domestic incident of some kind, right? where the boyfriend and or girlfriend or significant other stabs the other person in a fit of rage or jealous rage or whatever it may be. What's interesting about this case is that it's so unclear as to where we're going in, what direction we're going in. But clearly, the person who committed this heinous act was someone who is seriously troubled. So yes, the community should be on notice until we get a better lead as to who or who we're looking for.",

Hard to know. But the community, of course, would be terrified. This is too unsolved.MARA S. CAMPO, JOURNALIST:  Yes. It's hard to overstate how unusual this case is. I mean, you have four college students who are stabbed to death in their sleep in a small town of 25,000 people that hasn't seen a single murder in seven years. There's no suspect. There's no murder weapon, no sign of forced entry. Apparently, a lot of people knew the code to the keypad. The killer is on the loose. And police say that the community may be in danger. And to your point, all these other unanswered questions, how could the two surviving roommates have slept through four of their roommates being murdered in the same house? How could the killer disappear without a trace when a crime that is very messy. Stabbing is messy. It leaves a lot of evidence behind. As we heard, the killer would've been covered in blood, so there were so many que -- this is not your typical who done it. I cover a lot of crime. I have not seen anything like this.",

And once he escaped from jail in Utah, he traveled down to the Kyle Omega house in Tallahassee, Florida, and he committed multiple murders inside that house. And they were a mess. So, I mean, we've seen this happen before.

Until October 31st, little Lydia and Timothy Ridgeway were born from what is considered the longest frozen embryos to ever result in a live birth.This is according to the National Embryo Donation Center. Joining us now are the parents of these little twins, Rachel and Philip Ridgeway. Great to see -- great to see you guys and how nice that twins are sleeping at the same time.

And we'd heard about embryo adoption through our process of having children. And the idea for me of giving birth to my adopted child seemed like a dream come true. I just, I enjoy being pregnant. I'm able to do it well, and it seemed like kind of a no brainer for me in regards to why, why wouldn't I do that?We also have a passion for life, and we believe that each of these children in the freezer are indeed children that need saving. And for us, when we went to the NEDC, we were looking at who was the most needy, who was waiting the longest for a mom and a dad. And these guys happened to be those embryos that had, as far as we could tell them, waiting at the NEDC longer than any other embryos that were there.",

As far as they know, there's no known shelf life in that these, these children can stay frozen on ice indefinitely. So, there's no concern about the length of time that they were frozen. There was -- there was some concern about the freezing technologies at the time, whether they, any of the embryos would survive the thawing process.

RIDGEWAY:  Well, when you go into the NEDC, they have a wall that with some pictures of the record holder. So, in my mind I knew, OK, so the record is 27 years, it didn't really hit me until after they -- we had found out that two of the three they had transferred implanted, and then we had our first ultrasound and everything looked well. And then it kind of crossed my mind, so these guys are probably the new -- the new record holders, but didn't really think much of it after that until Mark Mellinger from National Embryo Donation Center reached out to us later in the year to talk about the fact that they would be now the new record holders, Lord willing, that they would come to -- come to birth.",

And then, really giving these children value a lot of embryos, a lot of people look at embryos as somehow less than human. And the reality is, is that God created every single embryo, that it's because of Him, that they are -- that they are living, that they are given life, and they each have value. They're made in His image. And we really wanted to show how Timothy and Lydia were embryos, but they're the same children. They were the same children now as they were then. They were just small. And so, we really wanted to give these children, in particular these embryos that are frozen a voice and show the world that they deserve life and that they should be given the opportunity to have life, you know, one parent and couple at a time.",
