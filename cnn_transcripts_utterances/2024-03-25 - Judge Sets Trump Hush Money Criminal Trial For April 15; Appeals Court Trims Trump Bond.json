So this - the court - the judge ruled everyone into the hearing today because of claims that Donald Trump's team made that prosecutors were withholding information and obstructing their ability to obtain information from federal prosecutors who had investigated and prosecuted Michael Cohen several years ago. Trump's team now are trying to get access to the information because Cohen is going to be an important witness in the case.Now, the judge went through methodically the timeline of events that took place here. He challenged Trump's attorneys about why they waited until just January to try to get this information. And he also said to one of Trump's lawyers that he was beginning to notice a pattern that the judge would observe facts in this case and that Trump's attorneys would interpret it differently than he did, calling into question at a point why they were even here today. Now, the judge was not expected to rule from the bench, but he decided to take a 45-minute break, brought everyone back in and said that he was going to rule based on all the material and the arguments he heard. He said that the prosecutors here were not at fault for any delay in turning over any evidence from the federal prosecutors to Trump's team. He said that the local prosecutors here, the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, acted in good faith. And so he said this case is going to trial with jury selection to begin on April 15th. At that point, Trump was shaking his head, clearly unsatisfied with the outcome in this case. And as he walked out of the courtroom, he kind of had a bit of a scowl on his face heading out. But as you said, it came where - it was also buttressed in part by that positive ruling from the appeals court in the civil fraud case.",

And as you said, a lot of falsehoods, talking about how these were Biden's cases.We know that one of the things that he has continually done is try to link all of his criminal cases to Joe Biden, essentially saying that it's election interference, that they're trying to stop him because he is running for president and because he is doing so well. And obviously, as we have reported, they are not all linked, and most of them have absolutely nothing to do with Joe Biden at all. But this is a line that Donald Trump uses, and it is one that is successful with him when it comes to his base. Now, in terms of that trial, it was clear how angry he was that they didn't get that second postponement. What's interesting here is that his team and he were fully prepared to start that trial today. Remember, they were actually supposed to start that trial today until there was a last-minute postponement after they returned over a hundred documents. Trump's team asked for 90 days and wanted to dismiss the case altogether, issue sanctions. The D.A.'s office came back and said there's probably about 30 days' worth of material in here that's actually relevant, so you can have that time starting on April 15th. Now, as you noted, it did get heated in that room, in that courthouse, between both the judge and Trump's defense team. The judge kind of lashing out at times, saying that they did not believe that their arguments were valid. They were - it was really quite interesting to see, because, as we know, being a lawyer for Donald Trump is often putting on a show for Donald Trump. In this case, the judge was not going to allow it. It gives you a little bit of a taste of what we're going to see. The last point of this, they are still planning to have that trial. They were already planning around it, and they're planning on campaigning around it, meaning Wednesdays and Saturdays, you can expect to see Donald Trump on the campaign trail.

The Manhattan DA's office is no more beholden to the attorney general or President Biden than, say, a mayor of the - by the president of the United States. These are totally separate entities. What's important to think of here is this judge was so incensed by whatever he heard from the Trump team that he didn't even give what Alvin Bragg, initially, what he'd do, a 30-day extension. He gave a 20-day extension. Shaved off 10 days even of that, so it tells you that he was obviously finding there was no basis to have a misconduct claim against these prosecutors. There was nothing that was nefarious done in the withholding of documents, and that whatever time is available, it's enough to prepare for an adequate defense in line with due process.",

They could also have gone after his bank accounts.And it was the day that Trump was supposed to bond in this case. They did have this outstanding question before the appeals court, but it was really unclear coming in today how that was going to play out. Then we did hear in the middle of this hearing in the criminal case a decision by the appeals court to give Trump time, they're saying he has 10 days now to post a $175 million bond. That's less than - I mean, that's more than half of what he was on the hook for, the nearly half a billion dollars. And so Trump's saying that he can make this deadline, he can post the money and he has enough cash to do it.

They did not have to tell us anything in that 10-day review.But the arguments on appeal about whether it's an excessive fine or whether he ought to have to pay that amount has to do with the underlying facts in this case, the judge's findings of credibility and factual-based arguments. And also, any Eighth Amendment claim, which is what he's trying to do on social media with excessive fines, has to do with the proportionality. Is it proportionate to the actual alleged crime committed? Is it proportional to who is before the court today? All that will factor in if he preserved it at the trial setting for the appeal process. There's a lot of ifs here, but I would not read so much into saying that because they have lowered the fine, that means they will find the underlying ruling problematic. Also remember why you got this bond. It is to secure your ability to appeal, for two reasons really. On the one hand, you don't want to have the full amount paid and then not be able to recollect it if, in fact, your appeal is successful and they find you should not have had to pay it in the first instance. Another issue, of course, is if you were to litigate this matter at the appellate level, the underlying plaintiff in an action might say, well, they've now become bankrupt. That person has not been able to pay the bills because of all the legal bills to the appeal and I no longer have my money. And so now it's a way to preserve the right of the defendant in an action and that person securing the money to say, either way, you can make good on this. You're not just going to have a frivolous appeal that goes indefinitely to try to game the system, which is ironic here for a number of reasons.",

We've gone through all of it today, all of kind of the movements. Does this affect Trump politically? S.E. CUPP, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: I have to be honest. Just based on the emails I've gotten today from Trump PACs and Republican PACs, I think they were expecting these seizures to happen today. And it seems like they might even be a little disappointed that they didn't, because the emails I'm getting from these PACs are Trump Tower seized, Trump Tower about to be seized, MAGA emergency, please donate now. They really want to profit financially off of this for obvious reasons. But I think also politically, they know that this is good for his base. He has conditioned his voters over eight years to believe him when he says these are all Biden trials, to believe that everything around Trump is corrupt and he is the one with the integrity. He did this over time by calling the media the enemy of the people, by talking about the deep state, the intelligence officers, the generals, the Democrats, everyone's in on it to get him and he's completely unimpeachable. They believe that. So I think today, legally, he got a win that 10 extra day delay and that lowered bond. But politically, he's winning - he's kind of winning no matter what among his base.",

And I think most of his voters are completely sold on him. I think there's a very small pocket of Republicans who really can't stomach the idea of voting for Joe Biden, and they're going to hold their nose to vote for Donald Trump.
