Just ahead, America and the world reckon with Donald Trump's remarkable return to the White House. We have reaction from the U.S. and abroad, coming up.Kamala Harris concedes the election, but not the fight that fueled her campaign. And now the focus turns to Joe Biden with the U.S. President due to speak today and later. The economy was a leading issue for voters. We take a look at how Wall Street is reacting to Trump's victory. Celebration and some for Donald Trump, in the wake of his election victory, the U.S. President-elect is looking at potential candidates for top positions in his administration. His transition team has set up offices in West Palm Beach near his Mar-a-Lago home. And sources say Trump could begin announcing key roles in his administration in the days. One big question now is, what roles prominent supporters like Elon Musk and RFK Jr. will hold. Musk is not expected to take a formal government position, as doing so would require him to divest from the companies that he owns. Kamala Harris, meantime, on Wednesday, conceded the election to Trump, taking a very different path than he did four years ago at her alma mater, Howard University in Washington, D.C. She delivered a positive and uplifting speech to supporters. She said she had called the president-elect to congratulate him on his victory and offered to help his team with the transition. She urged her supporters to accept the election results, but also said that her loss does not mean the end of their cause. She said it is time to organize, mobilize and stay engaged in the fight for freedom and justice. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS (D), U.S. VICE PRESIDENT: While I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign. Sometimes the fight takes a while. That doesn't mean we won't win. That doesn't mean we won't win. The important thing is, don't ever give up. Don't ever give up. Don't ever stop trying to make the world a better place.

So, you saw calls from President Zelenskyy, President Macron and various others, and we'll see how successful that is.

They could very easily be abandoned by the United States.

He's already been impeached twice. That is the remedy for presidential overreach in the Constitution. I don't think Trump's going to be too worried about that, even if Democrats were to win back the House in the midterm elections in two years.

He has trumpeted, if you excuse the expression, his relationship, his close relationship with Donald Trump, although there have been tensions in the past. And there's a general sort of expectation amongst pro government supporters in the country and Israelis in general, that this would mark a new, sort of -- you know positive period in relations between Washington and Israel.I mean, look that -- in the past year or so, since the October the 7th attacks, many Israelis, including many pro-Netanyahu Israelis, have been very sensitive to the idea that the Biden Administration has sought to restrain their military response to the October the 7th attacks, critical of what's been taking place in Gaza and the humanitarian toll of the military action there, not altogether supportive of what's taking place in Lebanon and Israel's attacks on Hezbollah and its invasion of southern Lebanon, its incursions into southern Lebanon. It's not clear the extent to which the U.S. supported Israel's recent strikes on Iran and its missile production facilities earlier either. Look in contrast, President Trump's first term four years ago or so, was seen as very pro-Israel. He undertook a number of moves which were very favorable to Israel, moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, recognizing Israeli sovereignty in the Golan Heights, which is territory in the north which Israel captured from Syria back in 1967. Trump adopted a very sort of anti-Iranian, or a tougher response, a tougher stance towards Iran as well. And so, I think the expectation here is that there'll be more of that in a second Trump term. And that's something that many Israelis are kind of looking, looking forward to, with the caveat that -- you know they've been through this once before. Trump is immensely, sort of changeable. He can say one thing and do another. And so -- you know I think there's a general understanding, both among ordinary Israelis and among privately Israeli officials as well, who know that.

      "sentences": "Yeah. I mean, I think it's important to remind viewers that there are a lot of races that are still outstanding. But like you, noted Republican Leaders and campaign aides that I'm talking to are feeling very bullish about their chances of maintaining their majority.And furthermore, they have been preparing for months for what they would do with that majority, if, for some reason, in this case, they are able to win the trifecta, keep the House, win back the Senate, win the White House. What are their policy agenda items that they want to be working on? And I've been talking with Republicans on both the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee they are staring down working on a massive tax bill. Remember that that signature tax legislation that was passed under the Trump Administration, the tax cuts and Jobs Act back in 2017 a lot of the provisions are going to expire at the end of 2025. And you know, I was talking to one Republican Representative from New York, Nicole Malliotakis, who told me yesterday that they've been actually working in these smaller groups on the committee for months, having meetings with stakeholders, having meetings with people downtown, trying to understand what's working about the legislation we passed back in 2017 what's not working. And this legislation could include more than just tax policy. It could also include some rollbacks of key parts of the Inflation Reduction Act. That's a piece of legislation that was a signature accomplishment of the Biden Administration. They're also potentially looking at doing some border security provisions as part of that larger bill. Anything that passes out of the House, however, is going to have to follow a very wonky budget process in the United States Senate, because despite the fact that Republicans have a majority in that chamber, and we know that now the reality is they have to pass legislation. We're just working through this very narrow budget process because they don't have 60 votes to overcome a filibuster, Fred.",

Here's how U.S. Futures are faring at the moment. Market attention is also expected to shift to what Fed Chief Jerome Powell could say about the future pace of interest rate cuts. CNN's Julia Chatterley is joining us now from New York. Good morning to you, Julia. So, what are we expecting to hear from the Fed later on today?",

      "sentences": "Good morning, Fred. It's all about the do's and don'ts for Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve today. What he does want to be talking about is, as best he can, the path of future interest rates and the economy. What he doesn't want to be talking about is Donald Trump and anything really related to his policies.It's a tough one. Look, the good news is, as you pointed out, they're expected to cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point. Good news for borrowers. Then it gets more exciting. He's going to try and circumvent and avoid any talks about tariffs, the impact of perhaps tax cuts, higher spending that's been suggested by the President-Elect and Trump in general. It's very difficult, but we all know some of the policies that he suggested, whether that's limits to immigration, whether that's potential trade tariffs and an impending tariff war, if he does do that, could have massive implications for the path of future interest rates. The problem is he can't be pre-emptive Jay Powell. He has to react to what he's got, and right now it's all promises and very little action. So that's where he's left today. It is a bit of a political earthquake. It could be an economic earthquake too, and that's the challenge. And we're already seeing it, by the way Fred. I'm not just watching stock markets go up. I'm also watching government borrowing costs go up, particularly longer-term borrowing costs. And mortgage rates in the United States are far more sensitive to that than they are to what the Federal Reserve is doing. So, if you're looking at mortgage rates in the U.S. and watching them track higher over the past six weeks, this is why. Now some part of that's tied to stronger growth, some part of this is tied to the prospect of higher spending. It's also tied to the prospect of higher inflation, and we know immigration limits tariffs, they could ultimately be inflationary. So right now, the expectation is Jay Powell will cut today. He'll try and cut in December. He'll try and cut next year, but Trump's policies themselves could change that. And the other thing Jay Powell is going to be asked today is, can he remain independent? Is he still going to have a job? Will he stick around? Because we know, in the first iteration of the Trump Administration, their relationship was pretty contentious.",
