FEDOROV (through text translation):It is critical to our activities because if we had not moved our information resources to the cloud before the invasion, in a few weeks, the state would not have been able to function as it does now. If Starlink and SpaceX had not started to deliver Starlinks quickly, I do not know how things would have happened because communication is critical during war and on the battlefield.
