      "sentences": "President-elect Donald Trump wielding new power over who will lead the Senate when Republicans take over control.Over the weekend he took to social media to demand that the next Republican leader agree to use recess appointments to get his team in place. Recess appointments allow a president to get around opposition from a minority party -- a way to bypass a congressional vote altogether. It comes as Republican senators are getting ready to vote on who is going to be their new leader -- a vote that's going to happen this week. Arizona and Pennsylvania -- you'll remember, those races still need to be declared, but Republicans will have at least a 52-seat majority when you're talking about this power in the Senate. CNN's Lauren Fox tracking all of this for us. So, Lauren, where do things stand in the race for a Republican leader because there's been a lot going on with that?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Kate. I mean, a huge question that was looming over this race was whether or not Donald Trump was going to get involved and endorse a candidate. Well, he hasn't gone that far yet, but his tweets yesterday made clear that he wants to see the Republican leaders moving forward with what are known as recess appointments.Now, all of the Republican people who are running in this race, including Rick Scott, John Thune, Jon Cornyn, all said that they would use all the tools at their disposal to try to move as quickly as possible with his nominations. But it's important to keep in mind here one thing, and that is that any recess appointment would require the United States Senate to go into recess. That requires both Republicans and Democrats to go ahead and vote to do that and if they do not -- Democrats have the power to block it -- then recess appointments become obsolete. So despite the fact that you saw Republican senators yesterday racing to try to make clear to Donald Trump that they would be willing to do his bidding when it came to recess appointments, the underscoring reality is Democrats can block that from moving forward. Now, in this race, you saw yesterday a number of conservatives coming out for Rick Scott. He's still seen as the longshot candidate in this race. And we should just remind everyone back home that Republican senators are going to go into a room on Wednesday. They're going to have this vote and it's all going to be by secret ballot. So despite the fact that Donald Trump is making clear what he wants to see in the candidates and what he wants to see in this race, the reality is senators can go into this room, vote how they want, and no one will ever know which senators voted for which candidate -- Kate.",

CHUCK ROCHA, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST, FORMER SENIOR ADVISER TO BERNIE SANDERS' PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN (via Webex by Cisco):  It tells you that things are going to be a lot like we expected them to be.

Politico writes, \"There's probably no group of Republicans more insulated from an outside pressure campaign than the 53 senators and senators-elect who will be voting Wednesday on Mitch McConnell's replacement.\" It goes on to say the bulk of the Republican rank-and-file is not pleased.

And I think the tension is, of course, you want to expand the Senate majority, but then what are you going to do with it? What are you going to do with the majority once you have it?

What I was hearing about is the need for affordable housing, health care, and child care. Look, whenever you see a politician focus in on an issue that impacts a handful of people in a handful of places and says that this should be the top issue in an election, you should ask yourself why. And the answer to that is that Donald Trump was trying to divide and distract from the fact that he has absolutely no policy solutions for the issues that are actually keeping people up a night. The issues that I was hearing about in Delaware. And let me just say I was out there campaigning. I wasn't running on my identity, but my identity was no secret to Delaware voters. We were seeing these ads. And despite all of that, we won our race with a higher percentage than any other Democrat running statewide in Delaware for major office.

As I am now in D.C. headed to new member orientation, I am filled with gratitude to the hundreds of thousands of Delawareans who turned out to vote and entrusted me with the awesome responsibility of representing them in the United States House of Representatives.I love Delaware. I am so proud of our state. Not only were we the first state to sign onto the work of building a more perfect union but we are also, as we like to say, a state of neighbors. And I think in this election we demonstrated that once again, Delaware voters are judging candidates based on their ideas and not their identities.
