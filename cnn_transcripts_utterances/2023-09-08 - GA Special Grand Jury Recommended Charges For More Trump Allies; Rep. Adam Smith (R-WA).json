It was a much closer vote. There were only nine votes to indict them. In the end, obviously, that didn't happen. But what's interesting, obviously, is, you know, the role of these high level officials that some of which obviously played out in public view. And in the end, Fani Willis decided for whatever reason, that she was not going to bring those charges, perhaps because of the additional political implications of it and the difficulty that would present for her case.

He believed that Lindsey Graham was essentially pressuring him or wanted to get rid of legally valid ballots. And that could, I mean Raffensperger's view, disenfranchise the voters of Georgia.Now, that is something that Lindsey Graham flatly denied. When I asked him about that allegation, he contended that he was not even talking about the 2020 presidential race. He said he was talking about the mail-in voting system in Georgia and how the signature verification system worked and how that would work headed into a very, very critical Senate races, two Senate races in Georgia. In January 2021, there were the two Senate races, the runoffs there that ultimately Democrats won and took back control of the majority. Lindsey Graham claimed that was in focus entirely, and he pushed back on Raffensperger's claims. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): What I'm very concerned about is that if you're going to continue to vote by mail, that we need to know what systems work and what don't. It's up to the people of Georgia. I think I have every right in the world to reach out and say, how does it work? And that's what it is really, I thought, a pretty good conversation so.",

So this report does not detail any of that specifically.We do know that Lindsey Graham did ultimately testify before the grand jury in Georgia after he fought a subpoena, did not want to testify, did not think he would believe that it was appropriate to bring a sitting senator in to testify before this panel. He took it to court. They fought it. He ultimately lost that fight and did cooperate. And then afterwards, I did talk to him about the testimony before the grand jury. He said he cooperated fully, but he refused to provide any details about that testimony. I asked him also, did he expect to be charged? He said flatly he did not expect to be charged.

This is what he said, Democrat partisan Fani Willis and her unlawfully constructed, politically motivated, so called special grand jury have now been completely exposed as operatives and tools of the radical Democrats that they are.In a clearly biased on American act, a majority of the special grand jurors voted to indict dozens of innocent individuals, including former and sitting U.S. Senators, simply for raising concerns about election integrity and exercising their First Amendment rights under the Constitution. So, again, this is really the same line that we have heard over and over again, saying that this is partisan, saying that this is political, and pointing to the fact that because there are U.S. Senators, Republican U.S. Senators, that that is why this is political. And one thing to point out here is I actually spoke to a number of Trump advisors just a few moments ago who noted that they believed that because they were thinking about discussing indicting sitting U.S. Senators, that this would actually look good for Donald Trump because it would look like they were overreaching in some way. Now, again, this is what they are telling me, and this statement here is almost exactly what we would expect to see, which is Trump saying it's all political. As we know, one of Trump's biggest things that he likes to say is they're not coming after me, they're coming after you. I'm just standing in your way. And I do want to note one thing because I forgot to tell you this earlier, Sara, he will be speaking tonight. He's going to South Dakota for a rally.

We can't see the transcripts and all the evidence. We're really kind of seeing a summary here. The votes, I'm a little bit skeptical of that, but there's some distinctions to be made.Having indicted hundreds of grand juries indictments, I can tell you that vote did not matter to us very much unless it was really, really slim, like almost a deadlock to it. But I think to Michael's point, this is a grand jury which had been very focused on this one case for a long time, and therefore the weight of those votes might have carried a lot more meaning to the prosecutor in making those. It's also, I don't think the potential federal official defenses would have bothered this prosecutor very much. That's speculation. But it seems like she would feel she had the evidence, you know, full steam ahead. It's possible to me that they may have done a good job for themselves in the testifying before the grand jury for some of these folks. Graham, politicians sometimes come across pretty well as witnesses for the down home kind of approach talking to the grand jurors, may have influenced some of that votes. But also the prosecutors may have looked at that and said, well, you know, he has a colorable defense here and they may have felt there was not enough evidence to overcome that. So I lean more towards she had a look at the evidence that we can't see, and that's probably the biggest factor.",

It is for Donald Trump and some others. Their phone call, Lindsey Graham's phone call is not specifically listed here. Michael, if you can teach a little bit of law school here so I can understand and our viewers can understand in a normal grand jury, in a normal grand jury if there is a vote and that grand jury does vote to indict even by a margin of one as Shan was saying, is a person charged?",

      "sentences": "Well, and I'm glad to be with Shan this morning, too, in a normal grand jury, unless there's a difference in the state grand jury and a federal grand jury. So in a state grand jury, which was what we're talking about here, a prosecutor in Georgia would have to basically present an indictment. You can't go into the state grand jury and say, I want you to investigate this, and then we can decide together which charges we're going to bring.The rule is that an indictment, we call it having to be laid on the table. In other words, presented to the grand jury for their consideration. They hear from some witnesses, they hear a little bit of evidence. It can be a very little bit summary type amount of evidence, and then they take a vote. And so at that point, it's up to the grand jury. If they vote to indict, then that indictment is, in fact, issued by the grand jury. So they are not investigating. That's the difference in what this report is about. This report is merely an investigative tool. And we don't use those, as I say in Georgia, typically, that's what makes this unique. But it gave the DA the opportunity to subpoena witnesses, to subpoena evidence, to bring a bunch of people in and have them all talk to these grand jurors over an eight month period to make a decision on how she wanted to move forward with the case. And so their report is advisory only, and that's different than what you would have in a criminal grand jury in the state system here. Our state system does not have an advisory grand jury process for a regular criminal grand jury. They simply vote to indict or not to indict. And the prosecutor uses his or her discretion in deciding whether or not to present that indictment to the grand jury. Here, she's using her discretion in deciding whether or not to accept the recommendations of this special purpose advisory grand jury. So they're different beasts. But the simple answer is, if you were in Georgia and an indictment was presented to a criminal grand jury, their vote is going to rule the day.",

      "sentences": "Well, I don't think we can glean too much more from what the prosecution might do with it. I mean, obviously they know a lot more than in the sparse report. For the defense, I think, as has been discussed, there are some nuggets here. For example, people who weren't charged, if they haven't already been interviewed, which they may have already been contacted by the defense, be interesting as a defense counsel to know the sorts of questions, what theory the prosecution is pursuing.They may also be of some value as targets for finger pointing, which is they didn't get charged. But, you know, now I can blame them because they're the real masterminds behind this, not my client. So that may come into play as well. The one other distinction I want to follow up on that you made, John, is there's a little bit of analogy here to special counsel reports or the old statute independent council reports I've been involved in. An important difference, though, is when they write those reports, people who are mentioned have a chance to comment on them. And earlier, Tim Hayfield (ph) was making that point that one of the issues with this coming out in the grand jury form is that people who are mentioned, even recommended to have been charged, don't have the opportunity to really rebut that. And that's significant. But in terms of how it plays out in court, hard to say. Other than those two facts, these are people you'd want to talk to as defense counsel, and these might be people that you want to blame as a defense counsel.",

It's about 26 pages long.And the panel recommended charges against the sitting U.S. Senator and two former senators. I just want to get your take on that. Obviously, the senator was GOP Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. I just want to get some sense of what you think of what happened here and the fact that Fani Willis did not actually go forward with indictments against them. REP. ADAM SMITH (R-WA): Yes, I mean everything around this, around the election of 2020 and all of the efforts by the former President Trump to try to overturn that election, as we all know that it's incredibly serious. Now in any election, you know, if you have a close election, there may be people who legitimately say, well, I'm not sure this was right or that was right, and then there is a method for doing that. You can file lawsuits and do all manner of different things. It is very, very clear that Trump and his supporters went way beyond that and actually tried to do things that are not legal to overturn a legitimate election. Who did precisely what? I haven't, you know, dove into it in great depth. We do have other issues that I do have some control over that I'm focusing on, but it's a very serious thing and we need to keep an eye on it and see exactly who played what role. You can't simply try to overturn an election because you didn't like the outcome. You can't go trying to pick electors for the presidential election who are not legitimate electors.
