California raising the minimum wage to $20.00 an hour for some fast-food workers. And Trump Media, the company behind Truth Social lost $58 million last year.

A warm welcome once again to QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. Iran says two commanders in its Revolutionary Guard were killed in a strike on an Iranian consular building in Syria. They say other members were also killed. Officials in Iran and Syria are blaming Israel for the attack. You're looking now at that consulate building that suffered serious damage. Iran's foreign minister called the strike a violation of international law. Its ambassador to Syria says the response will be decisive. I want to bring in Jim Sciutto now for more on this. Jim, good to have you with us. The Israelis initially came out and said they wouldn't comment on foreign media reports, but if indeed this was an Israeli strike, it is a clear escalation.

As you know, there has been some quite public disagreement between US officials and Israeli officials about the progress of the war in Gaza, specific to this planned operation inside Rafah with some public US opposition to a military incursion into Rafah. In fact, US and Israeli officials met just a short time ago, a virtual meeting in which they were discussing this very operation, but it appears that the Israeli decision will be to move forward, but to have some sort of an evacuation in advance. We've seen this prior to other areas before Israeli operations went underway, but we've also seen that not all of those civilians get out prior either by choice or because it is not possible.

It is a photo of the late opposition leader and his wife along, with the message, \"Long live, Alexei Navalny.\" The hackers say they've obtained information on hundreds of thousands of prisoners and their families, and that includes people held at the penal colony where Navalny died. The hackers say they are sharing that data, hoping someone will give them information about what happened to Navalny. Sean Lyngaas is in Washington for us and reporting on this.

We are not sure if he suffered any injuries, but you can see the airbag deployed. The bomb squad had surrounded the car. They went through the car to see if there were any weapons on the inside of that SUV. They found no weapons on the inside. They found no weapons on the suspect. Now, the FBI clearly knows who the man is, but right now, they are not sharing his name or any information about him. So, we are not sure if there is a long time online beef or did he make any threats, but we do know he went to that gate right there, tried to bust through with that little orange SUV and got stuck by what they call the ramp system. That ramp system can actually sustain itself against a much larger vehicle. So once he hit that, I believe his airbags deployed and they went from there. Two other FBI agents were in the area and they were able to surround him and get him custody. At this point, they are not sharing if he made any statements on the way out, but once again, he was not armed. No FBI agents were hurt.

It is only just a more dramatic increase because it is on Monday, excuse me, and it covers so many workers. But I don't think it is out of range with previous minimum age increases and you have to keep in mind that the minimum wage for all workers in California is already $16.00. In many parts of the state, like Los Angeles, it is $17.00, and the San Francisco Bay, it is over $18.00 already. And many workers in the industry are getting paid more than the current minimum, the old minimum wage. So the increase to $20.00 is not a 25 percent increase in labor costs. It is more like a five percent increase in labor costs and labor costs are only about a third of overall costs. So when you think about what the operating cost pressure is on the industry, it is one-third of five percent which is less than two percent. That means $5.00 hamburger would cause a dime more. That $3.00 taco would cost a nickel more. That's easily absorbable by consumers. They're not going to buy fewer hamburgers or tacos because of those differences. But what individual franchisees get is that this is a cost increase for all their competitors, not just for them and so what usually happens with these minimum age increases is there is are small price increases.

Fast food does, though have the lowest wage of any major industry and it has quite a few problems with scheduling of the workers each week and also with workplace injuries and illnesses. And of course, part of the answer to that is, it is not just a matter who deserves to have a higher minimum wage.

They said that they would certainly look in the mirror and try to do something about it. But Erdogan was also running an environment where the economy was top of mind for people.  Obviously much of the West has been able to get inflation under control, Turkey has not. Inflation remains sky high. You have interest rates that if it 50 percent, five-zero. And obviously the opposition was able to take advantage. They won places where they were expected to like Ankara and Izmir and they won places that they weren't expected to win. Like one example is Adiyaman, a very religious conservative place in the South that the AK party, Erdogan's party had won with more than 50 percent of the vote just five years earlier. They also -- the opposition also won right here in Istanbul by an 11-point margin. Something that very few pollsters could have possibly predicted. And the man who won the reelection as mayor is Ekrem Imamoglu, one of Erdogan's most formidable opposition opponents. That is a view that has been widely held and certainly last night was confirmed by this result. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MCLEAN (voice-over): If there were any doubts about this man's ability to win, they were put to bed last night. Ekrem Imamoglu, the mayor of Istanbul from the secular opposition CHP Party was reelected by a comfortable 11- point margin. A gap few polls could have predicted. Hello, Istanbul, he says. 16 million Istanbul lights have won. Congratulations. There are no losers in this election. But Imamoglu's win is a huge blow to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's religious conservative AK Party, which not only failed to win back Istanbul, but even lost Erdogan's home district. Imamoglu is widely seen as one of the few perhaps the only opposition figures strong enough to beat Erdogan in a presidential race. Originally from the Black Sea city of Trabzon, Imamoglu moved to Istanbul for university, then worked with his family's construction company. Two decades later, in 2014 he was leading a small district of Istanbul, then five years later in 2019 won the race for city mayor by a razor thin margin. After a court overturn the results in order to another vote, Imamoglu won the second time around by an even wider gap. He later face charges of insulting public officials stemming from the aftermath of the bitterly contested race. He's been convicted and sentenced to more than two years jail time on the charges that many believe are politically motivated. Erdogan has denied any link. The appeals process is still winding its way through the courts.",

So there are, you know, plenty of skeptics who think that President Erdogan would not likely try to change the constitution toeliminate term limits, allowing him to run but he does want to change the constitution period. But that may be something that could end up being shelved, Julia, because it seems like given the results and given the fact that President Erdogan would need to hold the referendum in order to change it, he would need a majority of M.P.s or a bigger majority of M.P.s, something he doesn't have. That all seems unlikely at this point to actually move forward. Surely, the opposition will be emboldened to try to stand against that. You also have a much easier route for President Erdogan to make the case that he can run one more time because right now, the Constitution bars him from running for election again. But there is a loophole if parliament were to call for early elections as a technicality, Erdogan could probably run one more time. And it's unlikely that the institutions or the courts in Turkey would challenge him on that. But given these results, obviously President Erdogan if he does intend to run again, has some work to do to get himself back in favor with voters. He needs to do something about the economy and he needs to do it quickly or at least over the next four years. One other thing that's worth mentioning, Julia, is those criminal charges against Ekrem Imamoglu. I think a lot of people will be watching those very closely to see what happens. And it's also worth noting that there are parallels to be drawn between the treatment of Ekrem Imamoglu, charges against him that are widely considered to be politically motivated. And a similar situation that happened to the mayor of Istanbul back in the 1990s who at the time was Recep Tayyip Erdogan jailed for four months for inciting religious hatred for reading from a poem. Obviously, voters saw him as a victim there and years later elected him as the prime minister, and now the president. And it's hard to not see the parallels with Imamoglu case now.",

Now Turkey's economic crisis undoubtedly played a big role in this election outcome inflation there, as he was saying has skyrocketed to 67 percent at least according to official data. Unofficial estimates suggest it could actually be more than 100 percent. The Turkish Lira has lost so much value. Many Turks are putting what savings they have into things like gold stocks or foreign currencies. That's despite the Turkish central bank hiking interest rates to a stunning 50 percent. So where do things go from here? Joining us now to talk about it, Selva Demiralp. She's professor of economics at Koc University in Istanbul. Professor Demiralp, fantastic to have you on the show. Do you see this as some kind of delayed reaction perhaps to the economic challenge? Because there will be those that cast their minds back to May of 2023. Was it government giveaways that cushioned people and didn't see them sort of vote the way they chose to in the past few days?",

Becausethe unsustainable policies that we had followed in the period before the general elections both caused economic problems. But at the same time, they masked the economic problems through the minimum wage adjustments, or the subsidies that were provided or the low interest rate environment that allowed the businesses to borrow at negative real interest rates. But once the unsustainable became unsustainable and there was this inevitable U-turn to orthodox policies after the general elections, the bare reality of the economic crisis became easier to observe for the average voter. And at that point, what happened was, as you said, interest rates increased to 50 percent. From 8.5 to 50 percent in a matter of 10 months. And at the same time, the subsidies have stopped. And people started to feel the tightening impact and the pinch of the reality. And as a result, I think this vote was more of a protest of the people to note that they are not happy with the economic circumstances.",

      "sentences": "Right. So, if the election results were more in AK party's favor, I would have less doubts about the sustainability of the existing policiesbecause the election results or local election results 10 months down the road would be more of a confirmation and the support for the existing policies. But that's not the case. It's a major defeat for AK Party. So, I still think that the government is going to pursue the turn to orthodox policies simply because going back to the unorthodox policies would have disastrous consequences for the economy. I mean, I think AK Party is so that inevitable outcome, and that's why they had to turn to a traditional disinflation program. However, in order to calm down the angry voters, I think they might relax the intensity of the program. And at the moment, the Central Bank's goal is to lower the six to seven percent official inflation down to 36 percent. But in order to do that, the growth rate has to go down to 1.5 percent. So, I think a midway could be to let the growth rate go up a bit to say three percent. And as a result, inflation rate might go up to 50 percent or so. But like our research at Koc University is recent research is a household inflation expectation survey. And what we observe is that people have very little belief that the 36 percent is going to be achieved by the end of the year. So, the confidence in the program is at the moment rather weak, which is also affecting the capital inflows to the country. When you look at the foreign capital inflows it's very big compared to the extent of tightening. So, one option might be to stick to the program kind of like the IMF austerity program. But also, if you're going to pay the price, why not go to the IMF? So given that Erdogan said that we are going to reconsider our mistakes and in the past, we know that he was quite hesitant towards IMF, I think that might become an option moving forward.",

Some context, Twitter generated more than 100 times as much revenue in 2013, the year it went public. This is why some experts say the multibillion-dollar valuation on Trump media defies logic. One professor told me that this stock is a bubble. Another called it a meme stock. The Trump media's losses are so severe that accountants warn the reading raises \"substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.\" That's Wall Street code for we might not be able to survive. We should note though that that warning, that likely predated last week's blockbuster merger. A deal that allowed Trump media to receive an influx of $300 million in cash. Matthew Kennedy from Renaissance Capital, he told me that this cash infusion that should remove the going concern risk here. Still though Trump media struggles they've continued in recent months.
