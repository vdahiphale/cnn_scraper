      "sentences": "Today on Inside Politics, the reality of rhetoric. Donald Trump is now blaming Joe Biden and Kamala Harris's rhetoric for the second apparent assassination attempt. This coming from a man who has arguably pushed more incendiary political rhetoric than any other U.S. president or candidate.Plus, the breaking news we just heard live. Horrifying details from a new indictment against Sean Diddy Combs. Prosecutors want the rapper behind bars after he, quote, abused, threatened and coerced victims for 16 years. We're going to bring you all the breaking developments. And the Senate is voting this afternoon on a bill to protect IVF. But does it actually have a chance of passing, or is this all about election year politics? I'll speak with Senator Amy Klobuchar this hour. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. Donald Trump is hitting the trail today for the first time since the apparent assassination attempt at his West Palm Beach golf course this weekend. The former president is holding a town hall in must win Michigan, while his running mate campaigns next door in Wisconsin. Kamala Harris is also in a crucial swing state, Pennsylvania, and Tim Walz is heading to the Sunbelt with events in Georgia and North Carolina today. But sadly, in 2024 politics is not the only focus of these campaign events. With all four candidates on the trail, security is a major concern. CNN's Alayna Treene joins me now. Alayna, what are you hearing now ahead of this first time actually at a campaign event after what happened on Sunday?",

      "sentences": "Yeah. Look, I mean, I think a lot of people are eager to see Donald Trump in person for the first time. We did hear him speak last night during an X spaces' event, but this is the first time people will be seeing him, and we're actually going to see what security looks like in the aftermath of what happened on Sunday.I spoke with a number of senior advisers today to Donald Trump, and they told me that you should expect security enhancements going forward. We know that Donald Trump is continuing his schedule as planned this week. He has a number of stops, including, as you mentioned today, as that town hall in Flint, Michigan. Tomorrow, he'll be in Uniondale, New York. Thursday, he'll be in Washington, D.C., and over the weekend, he's traveling to Wilmington, North Carolina. This was his schedule. They have not changed it, but I am told they are ramping up security. Now, they will detail exactly what those new security measures look like, of course, because it's so sensitive of an issue right now, but they said you should see some of that on the ground today in Flint. Now I do want to turn to your attention, Dana, to what you mentioned about the rhetoric around this. You know, we are hearing Donald Trump really go on offense and blame Democrats, specifically Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and their language for some of the political violence that we are seeing. I want you to take a listen to what he said yesterday on during that X conversation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FAROKH SARMAD (voiceover): This was a second attempt on your life in under two months. What do you make of that? DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE (voiceover): Well, there's a lot of rhetoric going on. A lot of people think that the Democrats, when they talk about threat to democracy and all of this. And it seems that both of these people were radical lefts. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Donald Trump himself, but also his team and his surrogates had all called for unity.The Republican National Convention was just after that weekend, and everyone was saying, we need to be unified. Donald Trump himself was saying he was a changed man. It wasn't several weeks later until he started arguing that perhaps the rhetoric from the left was responsible for this. Now you're seeing him say that immediately, they are really injecting this as a key part of his campaign messaging. When I talked to his advisers, they say, you should expect the type of language from Donald Trump, but also J. D. Vance and other surrogates throughout the rest of this week and looking ahead to November. Dana?",

Or at least to me, he's a complicated messenger, as you just proved on that point.So, you know, I get -- he's trying to sort of co-op this and turn this around and say, hey, this is a democratic problem, and try to just whitewash and erase all of his rhetoric and language over nine years in the center stage of American politics on this.

VANCE (R-OH), 2024 VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm not going to say we're always perfect. I'm not going to say that conservatives always get things exactly right. But you know, the big difference between conservatives and liberals is that we -- no one has tried to kill Kamala Harris in the last couple of months, and two people now have tried to kill Donald Trump in the last couple of months.

This is the secret service's job to keep people safe. There are threats on a daily basis of the president, the vice president, elected officials, members of Congress. But J. D. Vance is also the person who started the false rumors more than a week ago about Springfield, Ohio, about false claims, about the Haitian immigrants there, and that has led to bomb threats, school evacuations, city hall evacuations, and a feeling of terror in that community, as far as reporting is concerned. So, you know, there's a complete double standard here. And you know, I don't see that this political rhetoric, this on -- you know, is going to die down. Seems like the Trump campaign, based on what has happened in the past couple days, is only going to continue to escalate this argument and those comments.",

And now -- and what is different? Obviously, the circumstances of the two events are totally different. He was actually -- shot him, bleeding and like, yes, I take that.Apart from the circumstances being different, the politics of the moment are totally different. Joe Biden was his opponent at that time, and Joe Biden was losing that election, and Donald Trump was on a winning streak in that election, heading into his convention, feeling very good about his prospects. The call for unity was the option for the messaging for that. That is not the political position Donald Trump finds himself in right now. He finds himself in a much more competitive race against Kamala Harris, still seething, as some of those clips from last week pointed out, that she is the Democratic nominee, and not Joe Biden. And he chooses a different kind of approach in response to this, this finger pointing, this blaming approach. I don't think we can lose sight that his political circumstances are different.

And the reason that plays into this case, it's important to know assault and sexual assault are not federal crimes in and of themselves.This is a federal prosecution, but the way they play in is the allegation is that Sean Combs was running a racketeering enterprise, an ongoing criminal business, and that the way he enforced that was through these violent acts. And the proof of that, we can already get a flavor of, is going to be quite straightforward. We've all seen the video. Prosecutors have alluded to that video. They are going to use that video and also, Dana, one thing that's really important, prosecutors said in one of their filings today that they have, quote, dozens of victims. So, we're not talking about five or 10 here. We're talking about dozens of victims. So based on what we've seen so far, we've of course, not seen any sort of defense case.

So, we're watching that space closely. Now, online, in person, on campuses and in their communities, the plan this week for the campaign is to reach out to college students everywhere that they are.That's why Governor Walz today is in Asheville and in Georgia. And in all, the campaign will support more than 130 youth voter registration events this week alone. New today, my colleagues; Arit John, David Wright and I learning the campaign, also aiming to frame this issue of abortion in a way that will be particularly resonant with men. That's because even small gains through a combination of driving up turnout among Democratic men and persuading some moderates and independents could really make a difference in states like Pennsylvania. The Harris campaign has tied this issue to a larger fight over freedom and youth surrogates to share their personal stories of how abortion bans threaten the lives of pregnant women and their ability to conceive in the future. In the story, we speak to a man, a 50-year-old electrician by the name of Chris Scholding. He attended the reproductive rights bus tour over the weekend, and he said that he was there because he has two daughters, a 20-year-old college student and a four-year-old toddler. And he felt the second Trump term would pose a broad threat to people's rights. He rejected the idea that the former president would be better on the economy, or that economic issues were more important than that freedom. He said, if I have to pay more for gas, so be it, he's more concerned about this broader issue of reproductive rights. So, they're hoping to capture more men like him, Dana?",
