Bill Maher has been a figure in the world of political comedy for more than 40 years. And he doesn't seem to care who is in power or whether his opinion's unpopular. He still hits the road for stand-up shows across the country. And he's currently the Host of \"Real Time with Bill Maher\" on HBO, which like CNN is owned by Warner Brothers Discovery. This hour, you'll hear Maher's takes on the next race for the White House, the state of comedy and, what he calls, cancel culture. But first, we talked about how he got started in comedy, and how he has become the great predictor of Donald Trump. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
