      "sentences": "Former President Trump is now falsely claiming he didn't call for the termination of the United States Constitution to return him to power. But isn't that exactly what he said in a Truth Social post this weekend?I mean, it is not in our imagination because here is the quote. Quote -- \"A massive fraud of this type and magnitude allows for the termination of all rules, regulations, and articles, even those found in the Constitution. Our great founders did not want, and would not condone, false and fraudulent elections.\" So, I'm not saying we should just freak out about every Trump comment because he says a lot of outrageous things all the time, and he happens to be a bit of a political provocateur, shall we say. But this is different. I mean, this is the idea of terminating the Constitution in support of his insistence that he won an election that he lost, and it's arguably maybe his most extreme and anti-democratic statement yet. And it's part of a dangerous and broader pattern. More than two years after his defeat, former president still won't accept the 2020 election results. Just last week, he defended the insurrectionists the Capitol on January 6th, who tried to kill then Vice President Pence who is upholding the peaceful transfer of power, and they were brutally assaulting police officers. In September, even mentioned potential pardons for the rioters. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (voice-over):  I met with and I'm financially supporting people that are incredible. And they were in my office actually two days ago. It's very much on my mind. It's a disgrace what they've done to them. If I decide to run and if I win, I will be looking very, very strongly about pardons. UNKNOWN (voice-over):  Amen. TRUMP (voice-over):  Full pardons. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And now, he talks about terminating the Constitution.He is destroying himself, and he's not smart enough to realize that. The Republicans are turning away from him in droves. And the only thing that gets people to support him or feel that he is a victim is how he gets treated by outsiders. For example, they should never have invaded Mar-a-Lago, and I use that term because that is his term that he used without explaining why. It was perfectly justified. These are classified documents. He had no business handling them. But the Justice Department did explain it for six days. Donald Trump will destroy himself if he is allowed to. And how you handle that -- and I know your viewers won't agree because they want to yell at him, but how he has handled determines whether or not he is still credible even at this moment.

Good people on both sides. For many of us, it was demeaning and degrading to the United States of America, to have a president who could not just call out hate speech and white supremacy as being wrong. And so, I think it is very possible that he just implodes. I think it is likely, and particularly given that we know, there is a sector of the Republican Party that still believes him, that still follows him, that still gives him money. And so, I think he still poses a danger. What I also think we need to call out is it is not a profiling courage to however you characterize his behavior now, after the 2022 election, when the voters so clearly are the ones who stood up and did the work and have the backbone. If Republicans members of Congress, if, you know, a Mitch McConnell or a Kevin McCarthy would have stood up to him, Charlottesville, after January 6th, we might not be where we are in this moment.",

The public want is better, cleaner, safer, healthier.Accountability. The idea that someone does something wrong. Transparency, merely to let you know what's going on. Oversight is performance art, but accountability, you could grab someone by the neck and say, you made this promise, you didn't keep, now I'm holding you responsible. And common sense. Don't talk to me like a politician. Talk to me like a human being. And let's get something done, let's work together, that's the unity. Work together, roll up your sleeves, and get it done. These are the attributes. And so, look at Georgia. I see early turnout benefiting Warnock. I see the fact that no longer there is a Senate in play, so that's more of a reason for Democrats to vote than Republicans. Herschel walker is not as good as a candidate. And so, a lot of people were voting for him because they wanted republican control of the Senate, not necessarily because of him but despite him.

That has only limited effect. And according to the polling, it is not having an effect at all. In the end, it's the candidate that can reach across, that can appeal to not just their base but voters who aren't ready to a specific side. I will give a word example, freedom. For Republicans have freedom, too. Freedom to do what I want. Freedom to be free to speak my mind. For Democrats, it's freedom from. Freedom from homelessness, freedom from hunger.
