Turkey's presidential candidates are holding final rallies ahead of Sunday's critical vote. Israel strikes more militant targets while further rockets are fired from Gaza. Imran Khan leaves court in Pakistan after being granted bail. And U.S. border towns are on edge as Title 42 ends. Welcome once again to CONNECT THE WORLD. And we begin in Turkey, where the main presidential candidates are making their final appeals to voters ahead of Sunday's high stakes election. Right now polls show opposition leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu with a slight lead over President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Kilicdaroglu who paints the voters a choice between pushing democracy forward or a continuation of rule by a one-man regime. President Erdogan's supporters view him as a defender of democracy and civilian government, who has stopped Turkey's military from interfering in politics. As Jomana Karadsheh tells us, this election is happening in the long shadow of February's devastating earthquake. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Few are the tombstones that identify the dead. They call it the Cemetery of the Unknown, where more than 4,000 victims of Turkey's catastrophic quake are buried. Some of the youngest lie here, with poignant clues left for those still searching for their missing loved ones. Time has yet to heal the wounds of the broken city of Antakya and its people. Life amid the ruins a mere existence in this deserted town where elections and campaign promises are overshadowed by despair. Grief and pain still so raw for those who survived, left only to mourn.

He broke away from the main opposition party, the CHP, and ran with his own party this time. And he was seen as a bit of a spoiler really, taking votes away from the main opposition coalition. He came out yesterday with a surprise announcement saying that he was withdrawing from the race after what he described as a campaign of slander. This is coming after some lurid allegations had been circulating online in the past couple of days here in Turkey. And then we heard from the presidential candidate for the opposition, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, coming out and accusing the Russians of interfering and meddling in Turkey's elections. And he -- in addressing the Russians he said, dear Russian friends, you are behind the montages, conspiracy, deepfake content and tapes that were exposed in this country. And he said if you want to continue this friendship after May 15th get your hands off the Turkish state. Now Kilicdaroglu in the past has said that his priority is restoring ties with NATO and the E.U., and at the same time, he did say he wants to maintain good relations with the Russians. Some see his statements really as tough election talk ahead of these really consequential elections in the country in a couple of days. Now we heard also today from the spokesman of the Kremlin, Dmitry Peskov, responding to these accusations, rejecting this completely, and saying that -- he's describing these as rumors and those who spread these rumors as liars saying that Russia does not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries or the election process in other countries. While Kilicdaroglu hasn't really offered any evidence why he's saying the Russians are behind any sort of interference in Turkey's election, Julia, not the first time of course Russia is accused of meddling in other country's elections and affairs.",

Now with ceasefire talks stalled, the deadly tit-for-tat and volleys of rocket fire and airstrikes over the Israeli-Gaza border seem to only be deteriorating. Islamic jihad expanded the scope of its rocket attacks on Friday, targeting Jerusalem for the first time in this latest conflict. And just a short while ago, CNN journalist near the border witnessed rockets flying right over their heads and being intercepted by Israel's Iron Dome. CNN's Ben Wedeman is part of that crew. And Ben, you and I were discussing this and describing, you could see what appears to be rocket fire in the distance behind you. What have you seen in the last hour?

Khan, as you can see there in the sunglasses in the middle of that crowd, appeared earlier at Islamabad's high courts surrounded by heavy security.

And you heardwhat Secretary Mayorkas just said in that soundbite you played, and that is the potential to be banned from the U.S. for up to five years. In fact, just a few minutes ago, we saw, as you see behind me, some of the people who are being processed, actually decided to come back over to the Mexico side of the border, and told us that they were going to be expelled, and deported, and potentially face those repercussions. And that's why they decided not to go through with the processing. So if you're looking for right now you can see actually what's happening closer to the border wall. So we're on the Mexico side, but you're looking at Texas soil. So this is the U.S. that you're looking at and you can see those migrants up there, they have their hands up against the fence, and they're being searched. This is a group of a few hundred right now, mostly men who are here, and they are being processed one by one, and then they're going to be loaded up into buses that are a bit farther back on the U.S. side of things. Again, what we're hearing from some of those who have returned is that there is a high likelihood that they'll be expelled and deported and face those repercussions of not being able to re-enter the U.S. Now this is an area that's really interesting to have watched for the past 24 hours because we've seen so many changes from really the Texas law enforcement side of things. Texas state troopers, Texas National Guard, continuing to put up these barbed wire barricades, making them smaller, and smaller as you've had a group of at one point well over 1,000 migrants in this area. It's now dwindled down to just a few hundred. And they have grouped them over the past 24 hours or so into families, who are then processed, along with unaccompanied minors. They've gone through as of overnight and what's left is mostly single men. I think the question that remains as they've blocked off most of this from anyone else continuing to cross and try to be processed is what happens to the other migrants that are here in cities like Ciudad Juarez. We know from the foreign minister of Mexico, who's actually here in Ciudad Juarez that there are some 10,000 migrants still in this city. So if you only have a few hundred here and a few hundred at another port of entry to be processed, where are the other nine plus thousand? Most likely where we've seen them over the past few weeks and months, and that is in the city center, camping out on shelters, on the sidewalks, trying to get in as they tell me the right way. Legally. And they've been trying to do that, Julia, mostly through the CBP One app. And that's one of the ways that U.S. officials have been trying to use technology north of Mexico City, geofence, where they can log on on their phone, and apply for an appointment to have their case for asylum heard. The issue that we've been hearing from a lot of the migrants we've spoken with is they've tried every single morning. And you see them pressing button after button, rapidly trying to get an appointment, and most have been unsuccessful. A few have been able to get them and are excited to look forward to having their cases heard and be processed and potentially enter the U.S. illegally. But the vast majority are trying to now think of other ways that they could potentially enter the United States. It is a continually frustrating and confusing situation, and one that at times, Julia, gets really dire, as folks here realized their resources are running a quickly.",

Christian Eriksen awarded his trophy byDavid Ginola, another former international player, who actually suffered a cardiac arrest whilst he was playing but in a charity match after retirement. And you could see how moved he was by being able to hand over this trophy to Eriksen, who said, you know, when he was a young boy growing up, he didn't expect to be winning trophies for his football in this way. But he's incredibly honored that he has been able to make a comeback to the top level of the game, back playing for his country in Qatar at the World Cup and also Manchester United now in the Premier League. He's still incredibly humble, but it was a real honor to be able to speak to him and to really learn a bit about how it's changed his life and his approach to life, not only for him but his wife and his children as well. And we've got that interview coming up in just a couple of minutes in \"WORLD SPORT.\"",
