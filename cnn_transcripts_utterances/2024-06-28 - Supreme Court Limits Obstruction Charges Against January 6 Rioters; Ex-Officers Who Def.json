In a 6-3 decision, the court ruled the Justice Department actually overstepped by filing obstruction charges against people who rioted at the Capitol.Dozens of people, of course have already been convicted and sentenced. And we've just learned that a federal court in D.C. is already reopening some of the cases.",

      "sentences": "Yes, so this decision today, this impacts potentially hundreds of people who have been charged in connection with January 6th. The Attorney General issued a statement today saying that the Justice Department will take appropriate steps to act on this opinion today. But they also tried to downplay the percentage of the 1,400 cases they have brought that will be impacted here.But like I said, we're talking about hundreds of people who could potentially be able to go back into court and challenge either them being charged with obstruction or having been convicted and already incarcerated on that charge. The other outstanding question here is how this could potentially impact the case against former President Trump who faces two charges of obstruction. Now, it is widely expected that the special counsel will seize on language in this opinion, that sort of differentiates, right, the kind of conduct that Trump is charged with because of course, he was not here on the Capitol on January 6th, and his obstruction, alleged obstruction is charged related to different conduct. But we can also expect Trump's lawyers, I'm told, to file motions to try to get those discharges to get (AUDIO GAP) those dismissed. Now, it's not expected that will be successful. But they believe even at a minimum, maybe it might help them get certain pieces of evidence, including videos of the violence on the Hill that day excluded if this goes to trial. But of course, the biggest question for the former president's legal team is what happens on Monday when they get the decision on that bigger question, which is whether the former president has any immunity to protect him from Jack Smith's prosecution.",

      "sentences": "Well, they're going to have to look at it case by case. Either the Justice Department will go back to the court, the defendants themselves will have their attorneys bug the judges that have -- are handling their cases or sentence them or the judges, like we've already seen a judge in the federal court in D.C. within two hours of getting this ruling, telling the man who was the first person to be convicted by a jury in federal court for January 6th rioting charges and this charge specifically, she said, we've got to put a new sentencing date on the calendar. He was sentenced to seven years for this and several other charges, but she's going to look at it again and have to determine does the sentence hold or does something else need to be what happens here.But the way that the Supreme Court wrote this is they're specifying language. So, it's quite possible that the Justice Department goes back into court for you know, 30, or 50 or so of these cases where these people face this particular charge and say, well, the Supreme Court told us we couldn't do it like we did before. But we're going to give you a new set of language under what the Supreme Court says. And also, remember, when we took this case to trial, we made sure in court to present evidence that the boxes of electoral votes were moved off the Senate floor, there's the obstruction these could hold. So, it's just going to have to be case by case how this plays out to see if people have their sentences affected significantly.",

They've been aggressively litigating on behalf of their client, exercising any option that could either help their client in an eventual trial or at least delay a possible trial in this case. [14So, it's fully expected that they're going to file motions that could potentially try to get these obstruction charges dismissed. It's unlikely that that would be successful. But we would expect that, you know, they're going to at least try this. Again, if for no other reason to delay. But at a minimum, they think that this could also possibly help them keep certain pieces of evidence out of a trial if this goes to trial.

And the vast majority of the rioters that have faced this charge, it's coupled with other things, very severe charges as well, violence against police, people who stole documents or tampered with documents in the offices of lawmakers.

And it's as if they're begging for something worse to happen. KEILAR: Can I follow up on that for you -- with you for just a second, because you actually had in this decision, it didn't quite break along ideological lines.

The vast majority of those people who have been charged with the obstruction of Congress procedure is because they were there at the Capitol, and they're actually had to suspend the process -- the process not because they didn't get a chance to, you know, to do -- I'm sorry, they only suspended. But it could have been a lot worse, because those people were trying who were inside the Capitol, were trying -- haunting those elected official room by room to the point of hurting them.

And we're still waiting to see not if the former president is responsible, if he can even be found responsible 3.5 years. So, speedy trial, I guess it just doesn't apply to society and the Supreme Court size. If that was the case, the Supreme Court would have taken up that case a long time ago when Jack Smith first brought it to their attention that this may come up.

And your former -- your past guest that just was on Nancy Mace. She couldn't even answer it there because she hadn't gotten her orders yet from Trump. And that's just -- it's just -- it's -- that sow the groundwork for what calls January 6th, the refusal to accept the legitimate results of the election. He said, he eventually said, yes, absolutely, he would, if it was fair. But over 60 courts ruled that it was fair, and he still didn't accept it. So, what is the category that that defines it as fair, where does that?

So far, the Biden campaign, one area that they're really trying to tout is the fact that they raised $14 million yesterday and this morning, trying to signal that they have some momentum in that grass fundraising effort -- grassroots fundraising efforts. And we're also told this afternoon that the Biden campaign team will actually be having an all staff meeting at the headquarters.
