They say, this violates DOJ policy, which says you're not supposed to do something too close to an election that might impact that election.And Jack Smith's answer has been, we're just trying to get this case proceeding on the normal process for criminal procedure here. Judge Chutkan sided with Jack Smith. She said, this is not intended to impact the election. But, Pam, I think you're exactly right. I mean, how could it not? We will be combing through that filing tomorrow because I think there's going to be some really important new revelations.",

Hezbollah says it was targeting the headquarters of Israel's intelligence service, Mossad. Today, the two sides have exchanged dozens of missiles across the border as fears grow of a wider war. And just a short time ago, Israel said it struck more than 280 Hezbollah targets in Lebanon just today. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh joins us now from Beirut. Jomana, how serious of an escalation are you seeing there?",

      "sentences": "Well, Pam, every single day, it seems the situation is escalating further. As you mentioned there, you had that unprecedented development today with Hezbollah launching a ballistic surface-to-surface missile targeting Tel Aviv, though it was, of course, intercepted by Israel's air defenses.But this is the first time that Hezbollah is launching a ballistic missile. This is the first time that they have tried to target Tel Aviv. And, in addition to that, you have also had, according to the Israeli military, dozens of projectiles that they say had crossed from Lebanon into Israel. The majority of those have been intercepted. There was one direct hit in a city in Safed in the north. There were also two people injured on the Israeli side. Now, when it comes to Lebanon, we have seen massive airstrikes taking place throughout the day by the Israeli military, focused really on the southern part of the country and the eastern Beqaa Valley, where the Israeli military, as you mentioned, said that they hit 280 Hezbollah targets. We have heard from the Lebanese Health Ministry, saying that at least 51 people have been killed, more than 200 others have been injured. And, now, while we don't know how many of them are Hezbollah fighters, how many of them civilians, if you look at what has been happening over the past week, and especially in this week, in the past couple of days, you have had hundreds of people who have been killed in Israeli strikes on Monday. That was the deadliest day in Lebanon in decades, when more than 500 people were killed. And many of them were women and children. And then, Pam, you look at the number of the injured, thousands since those pager and walkie-talkie attacks last week and other airstrikes that have taken place. The country's health sector that has really been struggling, now it has to deal with this overwhelming number of casualties. And that is just one part of the crisis. They also have to deal with the number of internally displaced. The United Nations is saying up to 90,000 people have been displaced in different parts of Lebanon. But that is just an official figure. Those are registered. It doesn't include people who have gone to the homes of friends and family in different parts of Lebanon. For example, in our hotel in Beirut, we have seen many people who have been displaced from the south, from the southern suburbs of Beirut who have ended up in the hotel as well. The Lebanese foreign minister saying that the number is approaching 500,000 people. That is nearly 10 percent of Lebanon's population. And this is a country that has been going through an economic and financial crisis, and it certainly can't deal with this. Neither side, not Israel, not Hezbollah or Lebanon, is calling this a war yet. But when you speak to people here, they tell you it's certainly starting to feel like one, Pam.",

We're continued on behalf of the vice president focused on reaching voters where they are, talking about how she's going to make their lives better.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [11:56:38] BROWN:  Well, the market for nonalcoholic drinks is expanding in restaurants and stores across the U.S. as Americans increasingly look for alternatives to their favorite cocktails. Dr. Sanjay Gupta joins us now to answer your questions about cocktails, mocktails, and how they all impact your health. Sanjay, great to see you. This is such a good question because this has happened to me too, I have noticed. So, 82-year-old Karen writes that she has enjoyed wine throughout her life, but she's noticed a change. She says: \"The other day, I had three glasses of a sauvignon blanc, and it really affected me, no sleep, and didn't feel that great. Why is it at my age alcohol affects me more detrimentally?\" So, what do you think? How does it affect us as we get older, Sanjay? DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, it's amazing how many questions that we got that are just like that.

First of all, your muscle mass goes down as you get older and as a result you're not going to metabolize alcohol as quickly as you used to. Same thing with regard to the liver. Liver is what actually processes alcohol and your liver function starts to decrease a bit as you get older as well. That may make the alcohol stick around stronger and longer. Also, a lot of people, and I don't know if that's the case here, but people start taking additional medications. Sometimes, those medications can have an impact or an interaction with the alcohol, so all things to keep in mind. So you can't drink the way you used to when you were younger.",

So nonalcoholic doesn't necessarily mean no alcohol.This can contain up to 0.5 percent alcohol. I think it's important, especially if someone's trying to be totally abstinent, to just be aware of that and really look at the labels. There is 0.0 percent alcohol. And so this is the Heineken version of that. This has no alcohol. So read those labels. But the way that they do this is interesting. In some cases, they will make the beer in this case just as they normally would, but then they will add steam to it to basically distill the alcohol out of the beer. That's how they're removing it. But you might still be left with a little bit of alcohol, up to 0.5 percent. Another way that they do it is they will ferment beer the way that they normally do, but they won't let it get beyond a certain temperature, the temperature at which alcohol starts to form. So they sort of stop the fermentation process before that. And that's one way that they can get to zero percent alcohol. So it's a fascinating process, something that, as you point out, is relatively new, but really growing.",
