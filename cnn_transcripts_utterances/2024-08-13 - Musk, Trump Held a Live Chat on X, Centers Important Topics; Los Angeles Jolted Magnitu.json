We're going to be strong. Well, she doesn't have to say it. She could close it up right now. They could do things right now. It's horrible. No tax on tips. And all of a sudden she's making a speech and saying there will be no tax on tips. I said that months ago.

And they're even worse at the ballot box\", adding that anyone who is willing to fake their crowd size, quote, \"will cheat at anything.\" Recent polling showing Harris improving on President Joe Biden standing in several battlegrounds with a close race in the critical states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

There hasn't been any additional recommendations when it comes to that. We did hear, though, from the White House on Monday saying that they share Israel's concern. They share their expectations that there will be some kind of response from Tehran, potentially from its proxies as well, following the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, the Hamas political leader on Iranian soil. We have heard from numerous Iranian officials saying that it is their right to respond, that it was a violation of their sovereignty. We did hear from the Biden administration as well about concerns that this could have some kind of an impact on upcoming talks, potentially on Thursday, at least that's the latest information we have at this point, to try and secure a ceasefire and hostage deal.

When you try to calibrate an escalation, you're assuming that you have control over all the variables. Of course, you don't. And any strike from Iran or any strike from Israel or any strike from any of these actors in the region over the past 10 months has the potential to spin out of control. And I think we're at that point again at the present moment in time. It's why the continual escalation by the Israelis over the past 10 months has been so concerning. Even during these negotiations, assassinating the lead negotiator on the other side, Ismail Haniyeh, attacking the school that your reporter mentioned, which killed at least 100 Palestinians, including many children, and injuring 200 others. None of this makes for a terribly good environment for escalation and for the success of ceasefire negotiations, even though the notion of a ceasefire where one-side promises that they will return to war as soon as they get their hostages back is still quite dubious.",

Hezbollah, for example, is much closely related to Iran than, for example, the Houthis. So they will respond, I think, in concert in the same way that, you know, France and Germany or the U.K. and so on might engage in one particular action together. But I do think that we have to keep in mind they all have slightly different interests involved here. Hezbollah is literally on the border with the Israelis and is going to be considering that very strongly. The Houthis are not. The Houthis are very, very far away. The Iraqis are very, very far away. The Iranians are also very far away. So I think that there are these quite different calibrations that are going to take place. Are they all going to jump in? I don't know. I don't know if that will be considered to be necessary. Are they all going to look at Israeli targets within Israel or are they going to be looking at targets that are related to the Israelis outside of Israel? Again, unclear. And we don't know that. What we do know is that the Iranians sent a pretty clear signal at the U.N. where they prioritized the ceasefire negotiations. And what we've seen over the last 10 months is that all negotiations that have taken place, they're constantly sabotaged. And the sabotage, as Israeli press and Israeli officials have stated, very often is related to how Netanyahu himself is engaging in those negotiations. And that's happened again on this particular occasion with the assassination, with the attack on the school, but also the raising of new demands within the negotiation\" that doesn't that don't follow the quote unquote \"Biden plan of last month that everyone seemed to agree to have agreed to. So if we -- if we want this to calm down, as it were, I think we really have to look at the key that unlocks all of this. And that's the ceasefire in Gaza.",

Obviously, the two sides still very far apart on that issue.And Russia, of course, continues to attack Ukrainian civilians. But it is a problem for Putin. He has to play it down, as I said.

So another big, big red line has crossed with very little response from Mr. Putin. I think it's very, very difficult for him to respond because Russia has deployed so many resources to the Ukrainian front line.
