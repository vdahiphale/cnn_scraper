Can you explain why it is that you believe, on the one hand, that this mission is so critical, and on the other, why it is that you have categorically ruled out contributing U.S. forces to this effort?

And so, you know, I'm very grateful for President Ruta's leadership here. A multinational effort, but Kenya's willingness to really lead this matter matters. They're not the only country. But you're leading this effort. And there's going to be U.S. forces, none on the ground. We're going to supply logistics, intelligence and equipment. Matter of fact, some equipment has already arrived. And Kenya's stepping up with police and other countries plan to do as well. The United States is going to support the collective effort here. And of course, Kenyan won't be going in alone. We're working with Congress to provide $300 million to the MSS mission and an additional $60 million for equipment assistance. And we've also -- we've received and are continuing to bring major contributions from other partners in as well. President Ruto and I agree that the Haitian people deserve better. They deserve peace and security. And I thank him for taking on this responsibility. But we have his back and we're there all the way.",

And it is the reason why Kenya took up this responsibility. Because we have been participating in peacemaking and we have been participating in peacekeeping over the plus 40 years in 47 countries, including very difficult neighborhoods like what we're going to face in Haiti. We are going to take up that responsibility, alongside the Haitian police. And we have clear modus operandi, how we are going to relate with the situation on the ground that has been agreed under the United Nations framework. So we are looking forward to this deployment, because we believe that the women and children in Haiti deserve peace, like all other women and children and people around the world. BIDEN: (INAUDIBLE) on ICC, you guys never keep the deal, but that's OK. Now, you know, we've made our position clear on the ICC. We don't think the -- we don't recognize that jurisdiction, ICC, the way it's been exercised and it's that simple. We don't think there's an equivalence between what Israel did and what Hamas did.

Now with regard to Haiti, Haiti is an area of the Caribbean that is very volatile. There's a lot going on in this hemisphere. And we're in a situation where we want to do all we can without us looking like America, once again, is stepping over the side of this is what must be done. Haitians are looking for help, as well as folks in the Caribbean are looking for help. And so we checked out with a number of other countries. The one who stepped up was Haiti (sic). We've committed to provide whatever, with all the intelligence and equipment and the like to Haiti (sic.) And so it's a logical thing. And you have a first-rate capability and you keep your word.

Yet, you're committing our national police force to Haiti and where is the priority of this? This has been one of your major manifesto pillars, talking about security. And to the extent that even the defense cabinet secretary talked about the deployment of, if need be, the Kenyan military or the special personnel to make sure that schools are open, children go to school in areas that have been vulnerable in Kenya. Why you're committed to Haiti when we have a problem back home? Is it an irony that you are putting the fire in the far-away neighbor's home when you're -- our own home is on fire?",

As we talk, there are 3,000 military officers in the North Rift, 2000 police officers in the North Rift. We have renovated the first 15 schools and completed. We have reopened20 schools already that we're closed in the North Rift. And that exercise is ongoing. We have made tremendous progress in making sure that we create security at home. But that does not take away our responsibility. Even as we we're deploying troops and policeman in our own country in North Rift, to sort out the banditry problem, we still deployed 1,000 -- 1,000 troops to DRC Congo because that is our neighborhood. We have 5,000 troops in Somalia because, equally, that is our responsibility. And Haiti should not be an exception. That's why deploying 1,000 security men to Haiti speaks to the same belief and commitment to peace and security.",

And shortly, we will be looking at how to begin the dialogue process under the Nairobi process. Because we believe there is no military solution to what is going on in DRC.
