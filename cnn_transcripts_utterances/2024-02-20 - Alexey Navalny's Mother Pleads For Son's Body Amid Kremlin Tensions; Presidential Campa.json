Today, the White House announced that on Friday, President Biden is going to release the details of a major sanctions package against Russia. A Kremlin spokesperson says that allegations that Putin is to blame are, in fact, boorish. In the meantime, Alexey Navalny's mother is struggling to retrieve her son's body for burial. She stood outside the Siberian gulag where the Russian opposition leader died last Friday and made this demand. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LYUDMILA IVANOVNA NAVALNAYA, ALEXEY NAVALNY'S MOTHER (through translator): Behind me is the IK-3 polar wolf colony where my son, Alexey Navalny, died on February 16th. I haven't been able to see him for five days. They won't give me his body. They don't even tell me where he is. I'm addressing you, Vladimir Putin. The solution to the issue depends only on you. Let me finally see my son. I demand that Alexey's body be immediately handed over so that I can bury him humanely. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yeah, there really seems to be an internal battle that's been going on within the Republican Party since 2016 when Donald Trump began running for president. You see that between the group of Republicans who wants the U.S. to have some sort of global presence. And those who follow Trump's agenda, his America first more isolationist agenda.And every day it appears more and more people start to back Donald Trump's thinking that we shouldn't be giving aid to foreign countries. Instead we should be focusing solely on America. Again, a policy initiative that critics call more isolationist. Now, we did hear from Liz Shayne (ph), who has been a longtime Trump critic, essentially saying that there was a Putin wing of the Republican Party. She herself, a Republican. I think a lot of Republicans would take issue with that, including Donald Trump himself. But as you noted, he has not criticized Putin at all. In fact, the only statement that he's put out on the death of Navalny has been about how he relates to Navalny, essentially saying that he is being politically persecuted in the United States by President Joe Biden. Obviously, this is a long messaging strategy that Donald Trump has taken about all the various legal cases that he is facing. The other part of this is that the quickest way to and probably easiest way for Republicans to put down the bare minimum against Russia would be to approve the Ukraine foreign aid bill or at least bring it to the floor, which we know Speaker Johnson has not done and seems unlikely to do. It's something that Donald Trump doesn't want the House passing. And as we have talked about, more and more people daily seem to be falling back in line with Donald Trump and his version of the Republican Party.",

They're not going to move, and the Speaker is also stuck because he wants to save his job, and they could kick him out of his job because they could, you know, you only need one vote to say we want to have a vote on vacating the chair.There is a majority of folks in the House, I believe, who would vote for Ukraine aid if it could come up on the floor, and unfortunately, they're on a vacation now for a couple of weeks, homework period, as they call it, and so I don't think anything will change soon.",

This is Ronald Reagan talking. That is not the case now. I mean, you know, we see this. This allegiance, in a way, to Putin, following Donald Trump, who, as we all know, when he finally said something about Navalny, he made it about himself and didn't even mention Putin.So, there is a wing of the Republican Party that is isolationist, as Liz Cheney calls it, and I think she's right, and she's calling on them to put their country first, and I think their answer would be, well, take care of the border first. There was a bill to take care of the border first, and they wouldn't let that occur. KEILAR: Are we being generous to say that it's just about, you know, nationalism and isolationism and America first? Is so much of this just to do with former President Trump's personal animus towards Ukraine because of a phone call that got him impeached, and that the world order as we know it, and that the U.S. has enjoyed for decades could potentially hang in the balance because of a quote-unquote perfect phone call that has Republicans getting in line between Trump on?",

And that phone call, the so-called perfect phone call for which he was impeached unsuccessfully, you know, sticks in his craw. He doesn't like Zelenskyy. He will never like Zelenskyy. And I think that is a big part of this. I also think that he likes Vladimir Putin. He's always liked Vladimir Putin. He likes strongmen. He likes authoritarians. He's called Vladimir Putin very smart, remember, at the beginning of the Ukraine crisis.So I think, in a way, you're right, Bree, it's a combination of both of those things, which are both very personal to Donald Trump, who says he gets along with these authoritarians, whether it's Putin or Kim Jong-un or whomever.

Baldwin held the gun that fired a bullet killing cinematographer Helena Hutchins. He said he never pulled the trigger and has pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter. Initial charges against Baldwin had been dropped in this case, but then earlier this year, a grand jury indicted Baldwin with prosecutors saying, quote, additional facts have come to light.

And there's been some new developments in this case that have been reported out. One, as it relates to the new charges against Alec Baldwin, we know that new prosecutors were brought onto this case. They got the FBI involved. There was an additional examination of the gun involved and new experts that have come onto the case. And Alec Baldwin's statement to the effect that he didn't pull the trigger is inconsistent with the forensic evidence in their investigation and examination of the gun.Also, we are now learning that this armorer, who we know was very inexperienced, hadn't had the level of responsibility on a movie set that she was given on this particular set, may have been using cocaine, alcohol, and marijuana the night before the shooting took place. Even some allegations, that she is the one that brought the live ammunition onto the set, had the live ammunition with the dummy ammunition in her hotel room the night before. Apparently, there were text messages where she's talking about getting high. So, there's a lot of damaging information that I think is going to be difficult for the armorer to overcome in her trial and then could bleed into the trial for Alec Baldwin because the charges against him is that he was indifferent to the safety of the cast, not as an actor, but as a co- producer of this film.",

So, he has different obligations as a co-producer than he has as an actor. As an actor, I think everyone would agree that he didn't have a duty or any obligation to check the gun that was handed to him. Actors rely on other experts on sets to make sure that there isn't live ammunition in a prop or a gun that's handed to him or her.But when you are a co-producer, Brianna, you have different levels of responsibility. And that level of responsibility requires you to not be indifferent to the safety of every member on that movie set. So, to the extent that Hannah Gutierrez-Reed may be, found guilty of involuntary manslaughter because of her negligence in the handling of the ammunition on this set, that could speak volumes about what may happen in a trial against Alec Baldwin.",

It's gone from the High Court to the Supreme Court right up to the British government that signed off on this extradition. What these two days worth of hearings are discussing is whether or not the government was right to sign off. Did it breach Julian Assange's human rights? He argues that he's in an unfit mental state. He could take his own life if he's sent to the United States. He says he's just a journalist and that the move is politically motivated. The British government is politically motivated to sign off on this extradition warrant.Another extraordinary allegation coming from Julian Assange's lawyer is that they have compelling evidence of a CIA plot to kidnap or assassinate the WikiLeaks founder during his time when he was held up in the Ecuadorian Embassy, which is from 2012 to 2019, where he was effectively hiding from the British judicial process. These claims haven't been verified. If the judges think there is something in them, then they could have further hearings. If they don't think there's anything in them, then the extradition process does begin, and Julian Assange could be sent to the U.S. in a matter of days or probably weeks. There is a chance he could appear to be in a position to do so, but we're not sure how that process would work at this point. At the moment, it's just hearing about those human rights and whether or not they were breached by the British government by allowing Julian Assange to be extradited to the U.S. Max Foster, CNN London.
