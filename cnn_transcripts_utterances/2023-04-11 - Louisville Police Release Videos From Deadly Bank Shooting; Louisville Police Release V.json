You might be able to see them behind me walking into the room to get ready. The video is expected to be around six to seven minutes long showing different vantage points of body camera video. And as you mentioned, focusing on the interactions between the shooter and police.The city is assured it's been carefully edited and respectful of the families that, of course, will have the ability to watch this along with the public as well. Though, we've been told they've been in contact with some of these families to make sure they at least get to see some of this video. We've gotten clues up to this point as to how this warning sort of went down. Law enforcement source or a city official has said that at this point out -- well, Jake, I believe the press conference has started.",

She'll offer her opening remarks, and then she will then turn it over to Deputy Chief Paul Humphrey, who will then play video that we have prepared for you all today. Deputy Chief Humphrey will do a play by play as the video unfolds. The video itself is about nine minutes in length. After that, we'll take three questions and then we'll conclude the presser. Immediately following the press conference, I will upload the videos to all of our social media platforms. Now, Chief. INTERIM CHIEF JACQUELYN GWINN-VILLAROEL, LOUISVILLE POLICE: Good afternoon. To the mayor, elected officials here today, to the media and to the citizens of Louisville, April 10, 2023 will be forever etched in our memory. But this is truly a time for unity, healing and compassion. Our freedom to live in safety and conduct business with peace of mind was challenged on yesterday. But be assured, it is a challenge that the men and women of LMPD are prepared to face and conquer just as was demonstrated by the heroic actions of our first responders to the Old National Bank. These officers unflinchingly answered the call to protect and their duty to serve. They confronted acts of violence, head on and neutralize the threat. Tragically, lives were lost, but countless lives were saved. Deputy Chief Paul Humphrey will show the body cam footage and he will walk us through the details as necessary. And again, we will answer three questions upon his conclusion of his presentation. Thank you.",

      "sentences": "OK. Thank you.Again, as Sergeant Sanders (ph) said after the conclusion of this press conference, all videos as well as the officers' information will be posted to our social media platforms for everyone to be able to access. So, on Monday, April 10, 2023, little (ph) Metro Police responded to 333 East Main Street at the Old National Bank on a report of an active shooter. Show you the overhead and we will walk through this entire situation. I will explain prior to each video what you're about to see so that you have an understanding of how events unfolded. At 333 East Main, you can see that's the building they're right next to Louisville Slugger Field. Main Street runs east and west while Preston Street runs north and south. This is a street level view of the building that we responded to. Officers from the first division were dispatched as rounded -- as well as officers from the surrounding divisions. What you will see shortly is the response from Officer Wilt and Officer Galloway's car. They will be coming up Preston Street. Preston Street runs to your right on the video, they will be coming from the river down towards Main Street, they will park approximately where that white van is. They will get shot at that location and then back up and exit their vehicles at that point. So, I want you guys to understand how we talk about and how we train and prepare for active shooter situations. It's easy to tell an officer that you have to run towards gunfire. It's another thing for them to actually do it. Anybody who's ever been shot at can tell you it is not fun. And it doesn't matter how many times you get shot at, it doesn't get any easier. Plain and simple, everybody reacts in different ways to gunfire. We have to train our officers and put it into them, into their care character that their job is to go towards that danger in order to protect others. [17:05:05] Our decision making model that we use starts with our safety priorities. Our safety priorities are grounded in our ethics that all life is sacred. And decisions have to be based on who is in the most imminent danger right now and who has control of the situation, who can remove themselves from the situation. So when we prioritize how we make our responses they are based on, do we have hostages or victims? Obviously, in an active shooter situation, we already have victims who have been injured, who are who are currently at risk of dying, as well as other potential victims who cannot remove themselves from that situation. Do we have other bystanders and civilians in the area who aren't the direct targets of that violence but still need to be protected? Officers come next in protecting ourselves in order to deescalate the situation, because we have a duty to respond and we have a duty to protect, and we have the tools and the authority to protect others. Finally, the suspect, the suspect has the ultimate say in every situation. We pray and we hope that the suspect gives up and complies peacefully prior to our arrival. But if they don't, then the officers have to take the appropriate action to make sure that they protect lives as they go throughout these events. The mission of being the police is fundamentally to protect lives and protect constitutional rights. That is absolutely what these officers did today or yesterday. You will see Officer Wilt's video. Officer Wilt was a brand new officer, he had no experience. He was going based on two things, his training and his character. And you will see that he never hesitates even after getting shot at. This young man went back in to the line of fire in order to protect others. And you're going to see that and how he made his decisions and how they ultimately protected other people's lives. Here's a quick chronology of events of the initial response by officers. So at 8:38 officers are initially dispatched and they arrive on scene by 8:41. You will see when we show the video from Officer Wilt, that they are immediately shot out while they're still inside the car or at least shots are fired in their direction. They do not know exactly where the shots are coming from exactly. But you will see that they're coming from the front lobby area of the building. At 8:42, they have redeployed, exited their vehicles and began to ascend the stairs going into the lobby area of the building at which time Officer Wilt get struck. Officers then continue forward in order to make an entry and respond to the shots. Officers rescue Officer Wilt, and I'll describe those events as they happen. Next, what you're going to see is -- and I'll give a disclaimer here, there is some graphic images but all of the really graphic images have been blurred out but we are trying to give you an accurate portrayal of the events as they happen. You will not see any victims from the active shooter situation. This is simply the encounter between officers and the suspect. This is a still image of the suspect inside the hallway prior to the event. This is still image of post shooting of the active shooter victims where he then went to the front lobby and set up an ambush and waited for officers to respond. He remained in that front lobby where he shot at another couple of people who passed by and then he waited and wait a lot (ph) and wait for officers to respond. And as soon as he saw them he shot at them. That's where he shot Officer Wilt. Officers cannot see inside this area. It is darker inside than it is outside and this subject is looking from a higher vantage point out onto them where they cannot see inside what they are approaching. You'll now see Officer Wilt's video. Officer Wilt is in training. And he is the one driving the vehicle of his training officer, Officer Galloway. You'll see them approach on Preston. They will park and immediately backup as they get shot out and then reapproach after they redeploy. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Officer Galloway was Officer Wilt's training officer who was riding in the passenger seat. He deploys with his patrol rifle that he retrieved from his trunk and moves towards the shots that were fired coming out of the lobby area of the location. What you will see is the continuation all the way through this event at this point. So Officer Wilt will be shot, he will not -- you will not see that part on the video as Officer Wilt is just a step behind officer Galloway. Officer Galloway will then move across the lobby area outside where he is shot and he will fall down and roll and return to cover on the opposite side on the main street side. He will take cover there behind a large planter box and try to assess the situation and get some situational awareness of both his status as well as the status of the downed officer and try to ascertain where the shots are exactly coming from. He received the minor gunshot wound but he continues to stay in the fight and try to assess exactly where the -- this shooter is. While he's doing that he is going back and forth. He is also communicating on the radio trying to get a good view of the shooter. You will not hear the radio transmission from him because he has an earpiece. You will later hear transmission from the radio that picks up on the officer that walks up behind him. As Officer Wilt is there and other officers begin to arrive, they attempted to go up the steps to rescue Officer Wilt. As they go up the stairs and attempt to rescue Officer Wilt, the suspect fires at them trying to kill them and their process of trying to save Officer Wilt. When the suspect does this, he breaks out the glass and shoots again through the glass breaking it out where Officer Galloway can finally get the vantage point to see where this threat is coming from. Once he is able to see the threat he then engages with threat, shoots and kills a suspect. You will not be able to see that on the camera just because of the vantage point of his camera is on his chest versus his eye level which is a little bit higher over the steps as well as the distance. This was not a close range shot from Officer Galloway. After the suspect is down, they will then approach the suspect while other officers are rescuing Officer Wilt. That is off camera, you won't even be able to see that, you will see that the suspect is down with a rifle next to him, that is blurred out because of the graphic nature of that image.

MAYOR CRAIG GREENBERG (D), LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY: I'm going to make a quick -- just a quick closing comment is just, again, to reiterate what the deputy chief and chief have said, but a giant debt of gratitude is owed by our entire community to Officer Wilt, Officer Galloway and all of the heroic men and women on LMPD and the other first responders that responded to this. We thank you for your service yesterday, and we thank you for your service every day. As we move forward from here, LMPD and our administration will continue to provide information about the investigation as it continues. We know there are still a lot of unanswered questions, you want answers, we want answers, the public wants answers, and we will continue to provide that information as it is available. We expect within the next 24 hours we will be releasing various 911 calls and audio tape of that.

Also with us, former Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Juliette Kayyem to help us digest everything we just understood. So, John, the deputy police chief, he underlined there that this was not a perfect response, but he praised his officers for their actions and noted that he would go anywhere with them, have them have his back on that they saved lives on the scene.

As as they advanced, Officer Wilt is shot. And Cory Galloway, who is the training officer is now putting over information on the radio, trying to get a beat on the gunman, giving a direction for additional officers to respond. So they don't arrive into the field of fire, and trying to signal them to, a, rescue his partner, his trainee and, b, who can see that gunman and it is he who finally takes the gunman out.

And obviously, protect everything that's going on in the bank, in terms of other victims. So what I thought was interesting is they had enough, they knew that at this stage, they had distracted the gunmen, that's the most important thing. Essentially, they have now engaged him, they now know he's not killing anybody else. That matters, because then they can take those two minutes figure out where he is. And then it's a single shot into the bank or however many shots to get him down. Like John Miller, you know, people are going to look at this. Like he's said, people are going to look at this and say, oh, this than that. This was near perfect, they distracted the gunman, took the shots, essentially, and then eradicate the threat. And then everyone rushes in to protect and save lives. So that's that three minutes that I think, are that what we call situational awareness or trying to capture it.",

By now, all of our viewers understand this concept since Columbine, that you go to the sound of gunfire. But officers as they're approaching, as we saw on that video, they don't always know what type of terrain that they're going to be encountering.And so, you know, as you mentioned, Jake, you see an ambush for yourselves on that police body camera footage. And at some point, what the officer does, Officer Galloway is what officers are trained to do when you are in a dangerous situation, you have gunfire coming your way, you'll seek either what's called cover or concealment. Cover is something you can hide behind that won't necessarily stop a bullet. Concealment is something that will stop a bullet. And that's what he does, as you see him go behind that planter. And officers are constantly gathering information in real time about what's happening before them. I think this Officer Galloway and all of us for ourselves now see that it appears it was the movement of the officers themselves that draws the gunfire. That's important for officers to know. Obviously, if they're hearing gunfire, particularly if it's getting more faint inside that building, that could indicate that the shooter is going after innocent victims inside that would obviously want a much different response. But you see here time and again, that video of the movement of the officer is what draws the fire. And that's actually a tactical advantage as you're waiting for backup to come if you can get enough officers surrounding and hold that position and keep the attention of that shooter as long as innocent people, you know, aren't being targeted, the shooter is coming after you that can be an advantage. And, you know, obviously we saw for ourselves it was that high powered weaponry that appeared that Officer Galloway had that was advantageous there to be able to take out that shooter from a long distance. So I think bottom line, what you're seeing here, you know, the deputy chief said himself, nothing is perfect, but you see those baseline tactics at play here. And this is why also it's important to note that, you know, we can't compare everything to Columbine, into Uvalde, into, you know, the Aurora shooting because officers trained for that baseline. But you never know what you're going to encounter, particularly a situation like this, officers ambush as they run into a threat.",

The leaks have reached across the globe revealing U.S. spying on adversaries including Russia and China but also on U.S. allies and partners among them Israel, South Korea and many more. Some of the documents reviewed by CNN offers sensitive details and Ukraine's military capabilities or lack thereof, including critical shortages of air defenses and overall casualty assessments after more than a year of war. Ukrainian officials downplayed the significance of the leaks saying some of the information wasn't secret at all. But a source close to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says the military has already changed some of its plans because of the leaks. In a new set of leaked documents obtained by the Washington Post, the U.S. learned Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi was considering providing 40,000 rockets to Russia for its war in Ukraine, but to do so quietly to avoid problems with the West since Egypt is one of the largest recipients of U.S. military aid. CNN has not seen the documents and cannot confirm their authenticity. Egyptian state media called the report an informational absurdity while the Kremlin called it another hoax. And the U.S. says they've seen no signs of Egypt providing lethal aid to Russia, but it underscores the far reaching consequences of the leaks. SEN.

And, you know, it's unbelievable that we're having this conversation that one alone judge, in Amarillo, Texas soffit up end what has been decades and decades of the way that the FDA does its business. And in Massachusetts, where not only are we proud of protecting abortion access and reproductive freedom for women, were also home to life sciences, and the discovery and innovation of so many drugs and research. And so, you know, it's very disturbing that any court let alone the Supreme Court, would let stand a ruling that effectively throws out what has been the way of research and innovation when it comes to medication in this country for decades. So we'll continue to fight that in court. But in the meantime, Jake --",

I mean, it was bad enough to have to go through Dobbs last year, 50 years of Roe reversed by the court.Here we have 20 years of medication, abortion, safe and effective. It's been tested time and time again, it's the gold standard of medication abortion, which is the way that the vast majority of women access abortion care across our country. The idea that the FDA is no longer supposed to engage in what has been the uniform way of doing work is just outrageous. So obviously the Biden administration's appealing that's important. I know, our state in a number of states will support that appeal. Right now, I don't think the FDA needs to do anything but to continue to do business as it does business. And, you know, this really gets to the heart of, you know, are we a country that believes in medical expertise, scientific expertise, research, and knowledge and innovation? It's pretty scary, because last week, it was mifepristone. What are the next set of drugs? And what are the implications for that, if this kind of ruling were allowed to stand?
