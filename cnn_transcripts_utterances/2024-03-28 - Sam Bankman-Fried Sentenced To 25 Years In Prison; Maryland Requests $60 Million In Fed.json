Here we go. And there is a gavel worthy of all. Strong gavels, good markets. The markets and the main events of the day: 25 years in prison for some Sam Bankman-Fried. Before the sentencing, the former crypto king told the court, \"My useful life is probably over.\" Ukraine's targets, Russia's biggest source of funds, it is oil. And the Eurostar chief executive tells me the dreaded post-Brexit queues are improving, and the lunch was rather good, too. Live from London on Thursday, it is march the 28th. I'm Richard Quest, I mean business. Good evening. Tonight, Sam Bankman-Fried has been sentenced to 25 years in federal prison for orchestrating what the prosecutor say is one of the biggest financial frauds in history. The judge ordered the forfeiture as well of $11.2 billion, that money is to help repay the customers of FTX, the failed crypto exchange that Bankman- Fried started and ran. The prosecutor said, SBF as he is known, wiped out people's life savings. They asked for a sentence up to 50 years. Bankman-Fried told the court he was sorry. He said he made a series of bad decisions and it haunts him every day. Allison Morrow was in court. What was the mood like?",

I think, look, clearly it is affecting inside Russia. Clearly, it is now affecting global oil markets as well. So, the key questions are, why are they doing this now when it has been very clear since the beginning of this war that oil and gas are the key sources of funding for this war, that they are using their refined products, literally to go into their tanks and logistical vehicles and things like that. And the second question, of course, is how they're doing it. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SEBASTIAN (voice over): Flying straight for Russia's biggest moneymaker. This precise hit, one of more than a dozen Ukrainian drone strikes reported on Russian oil refineries since the start of the year. VASYL MALIUK, HEAD OF SECURITY SERVICES OF UKRAINE (through translator): We have already reduced both production and processing by 12 percent, so we continue to work while the gas station country continues to burn.

We'll get to it all after these headlines because this is CNN, and on this network the news is first. A judge will decide whether to dismiss the Georgia election interference case against Donald Trump. The former U.S. president's lead attorney argued that remarks Trump made about the 2020 election constitute free speech and the case should be thrown out. We don't have any idea really on when the judge will rule. A bus crash in South Africa has reportedly killed 45 people who are heading to an eastern conference. According to state media, the bus lost control along a mountain road and fell off a cliff. An 8-year-old girl has survived the crash and has been airlifted to a hospital. South Africa's transport minister says the victims will be repatriated to neighboring Botswana. The Nobel Prize-winning economist Daniel Kahneman has died at the age of 90. His work revolutionized the field of behavioral economics. He argued people are driven more by instinct than reason. His book \"Thinking Fast and Slow\" came out in 2011. It was an instant best seller. President Biden will raise millions, tens of millions of dollars arguably, with a fundraiser in New York. The campaigns says the event has raised $25 million so far. 5,000 people expected to attend and the cheapest ticket is $225. The most expensive, half a million. Celebrity performances and the discussion with former presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. Joe Biden and Barack Obama arrived in New York together earlier. They had already campaigned together last weekend. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARACK OBAMA, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: He made it a priority to strengthen and build on the ACA.

But in answer to your question, look, even Trump in the month of January, the majority of his donors were not in fact small donors. They were big donors. And this is something that I think he's probably going to have to rely on going forward because those small donors that Trump has had have been drying up. He's been getting less and less bang for his buck. You've seen that in fact with these court appearances, which in the beginning of the cycle are really a big bang for Trump's fundraising capabilities, that money has been drying up, and that's part of the reason why, in fact, next month Trump is going to try and fund raise in front of big donors and he claims that he may be able to raise $33 million from those big dollars instead of that just $25 million that Biden has had.

So Joe Biden has to use that cash advantage going forward, spending that money in those swing states, spending on that advertising, trying to get those sliver, that small sliver, those independents in the middle, who don't like either candidate and are probably going to make up their minds at the very end of the campaign. That's what Joe Biden is hoping to use that money for. And you mentioned, of course, Trump in the courtroom, he has of course a PAC that's been spending money for his legal fees and that PAC is getting less and less money.
