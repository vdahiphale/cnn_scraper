It is Monday, February 12th, and we begin with two hostages rescued in the special operation by the Israeli military in Gaza.That mission conducted overnight in Rafah in southern Gaza included strikes on at least two Mosques and a dozen homes. The rescued hostages were in captivity for 128 days. They are reportedly in good condition -- you're looking at them right there. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tracked the operation from a command center along with his Defense Minister and senior military officers. Our Nic Robertson is live from Tel Aviv for us right now. Nic, what do we know about this operation and how the Israelis pulled it off?",

They were waiting for the right opportunity. The task force, the special forces went in, literally 1They entered the building where the two hostages were being held on the second floor, the IDF says the forces engaged in an intense fire- fight with Hamas. Indeed, they say that a couple of the special forces literally threw themselves on the hostages to protect them. Then one minute later, the Israeli Air Force began airstrikes in the same area. We understand from the Palestinian Red Crescent that about the same time there were airstrikes, they say that about 100 people, civilians, many of them according to the Palestinian Red Crescent were killed and injured women and children among them. It's not immediately clear whether this was the -- these strikes were the same ones as this rescue operation. But they were at the same time in the same area. Then we understand that the IDF using this covering fire that was going on were able to extract the two hostages out of the building. This has taken literally, about a -- in a space about a minute's time, taken them from the building to a safe place. They gave them a very quick medical check in this safe place, taking them out under fire they said, and then put them on helicopters and flew them to this hospital just outside of Tel Aviv here. They got here about 3 O'clock in the morning according to medical officials at the hospital. And I just talked to a couple of the relatives of the two men, and they told me that they literally got a phone call at 3:30 in the morning, saying your loved ones are at the hospital, come here. And I talked to the niece of Fernando Marman, and this is how she described his condition. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

When he was in power, he threatened to pull the U.S. out of NATO. He called it obsolete, but it never actually happened.And we have seen with President Biden that, that unity within NATO, especially after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, has been far more tight. Now what we've heard is from the Secretary-General Jen Stoltenberg of NATO, saying that this would put European and American soldiers at risk. We've heard also from the European Council President saying it is reckless. It serves only Putin's interests. Now, there is great concern among many leaders of what a potential President Trump's second presidency could entail. Now, whether or not those within the Republican Party support this idea or at least tacitly ignore this idea, there are leaders around the world that do question whether or not there would be support from President Trump for an alliance with their country. Certainly, given what happened the first time around when many of those traditional alliances were tested to the very core. Now NATO itself, part of article 5, is that if one member state is attacked, then it is like all member states are attacked. All member states would come to the defense of that one country. Now, what Trump is saying is that he simply would not do that. So, this is the very core of the idea of NATO that is being questioned at this point. Now, we don't know if it was rhetorical. We don't know whether it was something he said at a rally. It's certainly an election period, so that could have some bearing on what politicians say at this point. But it does concern many around the world that they may not have the support that they believe they have at the moment from the United States, especially when it comes to NATO. Jessica?",
