The speech on Monday where he said that it is up to Hamas to make the concession.So despite the immense pressure on him at this point, he is digging in and saying he will not change his mind. Now what he has said is that there needs to be Israeli military stationed on the border between Egypt and Gaza, the Philadelphi corridor, saying that would prevent Hamas re-arming and smuggling arms in. It is something that has created difficulties within his own cabinet, his defense minister even saying this is not necessary. Sources close to these negotiations say that he is changing conditions when it comes to this particular deal. And we know that it is something that Hamas will not agree to. So despite the immense pressure that is building inside Israel, as well as outside the Israeli prime minister is really doubling down at this point. Now, we've also heard the U.S. President Joe Biden criticizing him fairly publicly when asked whether or not it was believed that he was doing enough Netanyahu to get this deal done. The president said simply, no one word speaking, 1,000 volumes there. The frustration from the Biden administration has been very clear when it comes to the Israeli prime minister and the lack of this hostage ceasefire deal. The Bide administration is still continuing to try to get this deal done. We know that discussions have been ongoing. There have been meetings with the U.S. president and his security officials in the Situation Room on Monday to try and hammer out what they are calling a final proposal, a final deal that they will put to both Israel and Hamas in the hope of getting a deal done -- Paula.",

And she can't afford to lose very many  votes, just like Trump can't afford to lose very many Republican votes. And these voters and usually swing Democratic and so this kind of ad that they're playing is kind of playing towards the fact that she is -- her administration, they have kind of backed Israel. They have been supportive of Israel and this is playing into that, trying to get these people not to show up. You saw the -- Michigan is also state where you had a huge block of uncommitted voters when Biden first ran, when Biden was originally running to the primary. And a lot of that uncommitted vote was because of his stance on the Israel-Hamas war. So that's kind of what we're seeing is Republicans playing into this and trying to get these voters, this voter block just not, not even to vote for Donald Trump, but just not to show out and not to vote.

But really it's been the Biden-Harris administration that has come under criticism from some folks for their approach to the Israel-Hamas war. I also think that this is just continuing to see what reason I both see you on Capitol Hill frequently is that Republicans like to play into this division, this is a well-known division within the Democratic Party where you have staunchly pro-Israel Democrats going up against pro-Palestinian progressives who are really frustrated by the mounting humanitarian deaths in the Gaza Strip. This has been an effective attack line for Republicans because it shows this -- this difference and variation among the Democratic Party. And right now, we're in the final stretch of the elections. I think that Republicans know that this is an effective attack line for them. They've seen that on Capitol Hill, they've seen that on the campaign trail.

But I want you to see what's happening across the Southwest. This is where the heat is going to build too dangerously high levels through the course of this work week, 106 today for Las Vegas, Phoenix at 108. So you can see the contrast between below and above average temperatures across the Western and Eastern half of the country. But we do have the National Weather Service issuing some excessive heat warnings as well as advisories. And this is just away from the coastline across south and central portions of the state of California. And this is just an extraordinary. We know it's hot here. But look at this: we're talking about Los Angeles topping out at 100 degrees by the end of the week. That is well over 20 degrees above average. So that's dangerous heat. We call that extreme heat.
