A new CNN polling just out this hour shows a neck and neck race. The polls conducted just after the end of the Democratic National Convention, and they have Kamala Harris leading Donald Trump in key states like Michigan and Wisconsin, just outside of the margin of error in both of those places. Donald Trump holds an outright lead in Arizona, 49 to 44 percent in that Sun Belt state. Three other battleground states, there is no clear leader, with Harris and Trump in a statistical dead-heat in Nevada and Georgia, a state central to victory in both campaigns. Pennsylvania is a dead even tie. The new polling comes just six days before the next pivotal moment in this campaign, the first presidential debate heat between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris in Pennsylvania, where Vice President Harris rallied union workers earlier this week.

Joining me now to discuss all this, Erin Doherty, political reporter for \"Axios\", and Tia Mitchell, Washington correspondent for \"The Atlanta Journal Constitution\".Good morning to both of you. Thanks so much for being here. So, we've got this new polling in swing states. It's the -- you know it's Labor Day when you're getting a likely voter screen and battleground state polling. Lets see, let's all say, I may be a political nerd heard but it's -- it's very interesting to be able to dig into some of these numbers. And, Tia, our polling team really sort of describes this race that's coming down to Georgia and Pennsylvania because those are the two places. If the map stays largely the same, if Trump wins Georgia and Pennsylvania, that's the ball game for Harris, if she can hold Michigan and Wisconsin, and she can win in Pennsylvania, she'd have to add that little blue dot in Omaha to get there, but that would get her to 270. This is a really close race, which, of course, is a huge change from when Joe Biden was at the top of the ticket. What -- what are these numbers say to you? TIA MITCHELL, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, ATLANTA JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION: Yeah, I think the change in like a month and a half is just astounding and it's proving a lot of the people who, you know that groundswell behind the scenes, and then in front of the scenes to remove Joe Biden, I think a lot of people are feeling vindicated by these poll numbers. I think it does continue to show that Georgia is going to be tight and that's why I think -- Harris also has a bigger ground game right now in all of the battleground states. But it does show that in Georgia, Harris is putting in a lot of work because it is so close and is so tight. But as you mentioned, she does have other pathways.",

      "sentences": "Exactly, and former President Trump is trying to project confidence going into this debate, but also, he sort of acknowledging that he has not shifted his approach with Harris at the top of the Democratic presidential ticket, and obviously he sort of sharpened his attacks against President Biden for he had several months to sort of refine what he was going to say to try to compete with President Biden when he was at the top of the ticket.And now with Harris, there, this is sort of his signal that he is going to be aggressive as we've seen him run in past campaigns. And I expect that during the presidential debate next week, we can expect to see several of the sort of sharp attacks against Kamala Harris unfold. HUNT:  Of course, Tia, the Democratic side, right? One of the criticisms of Harris has been that she has not necessarily delineated her policy views are distinctions from the sitting president in a way that certainly her critics would like to see. James Carville, longtime Democratic strategist, wrote this in an op-ed: To be the certified fresh candidate, Ms. Harris was clearly in decisively break from Mr. Biden on a set of policy priorities she believes would define her presidency. Don't run from your differences with the president. Embrace them, respectfully and honestly. How do you look at that advice and what role does that have to play on the debate stage next week?",

And they don't necessarily feel like people on the ground are clamoring for her to get way into the weeds on policy, but that's different than what she's going to have to accomplish on the debate stage. And quite frankly, there will be tens of millions of Americans possibly watching the debate.And that's when she is going to have to drill down. She is going to have to be clear about the contrast. She's also going to have to be clear about her own evolutions just personally on some of these issues like fracking or border policy. So that's where the debate stage, but I think they believe that they -- that voters that they're trying to make sure turnout for them aren't necessarily asking for those specifics. They want that broader message.",

As Tia mentioned, Vice President Harris is sort of trying to invoke this message of joy and optimism.And I think that were also seeing, we saw last week during the CNN interview that Harris is not really making her gender or her race a centerpiece of her presidential campaign. When she was specifically asked about some of the offensive comments that former President Trump made about her, she very pointedly said, next question. I think by not saying much about her gender or her race and sort of the history making nature of what her presidency would be if she's elected in November, she is sort of signaling that she would obviously be a historic candidate if she won, but she is focusing on the policy issues and again, these sort of centrist policy issues to appeal to a broad range of the electorate.",

It's deemed that its considered that Dmytro Kuleba, who is very well known to the international community, who is the foreign minister who's extremely effective messenger for Ukraine's diplomatic and military posture and its -- and its needs. It's assumed that he will remain somewhere. We can't be 100 percent sure. We did talk to him. I did yesterday before this announcement.

So that's why they cause a lot of deaths and injury.But I did also speak to other seniors here in Kyiv and they do believe that their own system, that general system of production, of self- sufficiency , of really ramping up their own defense establishment has to begin in earnest, just begun, but it has to continue in earnest as well as trying to get as much weaponry from the United States and other allies -- Kasie.",
