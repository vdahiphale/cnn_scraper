So it was significant that on Wednesday he was there in the room as she recounted the impact that all of this has had on her.But Trump and his lawyer engaged in some contentious exchanges with the judge over the rules of the court. Trump was disruptive during Carroll's testimony, which prompted pushback from the judge and his attorney, Alina Habba, did not follow the basic rules of evidence when trying to introduce certain pieces of evidence during cross examination. This too prompted contentious exchanges with the judge. It all appeared to be sort of manufactured courtroom drama to help amplify Trump's message that he is the victim of an unfair judicial system.

In this case, according to U.S. officials, the U.S. used Tomahawk missiles launched from Navy surface vessels, as well as a guided missile submarine, to go after approximately 14 different missile launch locations used by the Houthis to launch both anti-ship cruise missiles and anti-ship ballistic missiles.The frequency with which the U.S. has been attacking here over the past week is significant. And that's because for weeks here, ever since the Houthis started targeting international shipping lanes in mid-November, the U.S. tried to avoid targeting Yemen itself as they sought to avoid a regional escalation here. But now after repeated attacks and warnings, both from the U.S. and from the international community, the U.S. feeling compelled to act again, carrying out a fourth series of strikes in Yemen over the course of the past weeks here. Meanwhile, the Houthis have refused to back down here. They have continued to target commercial vessels they say are in some way linked to Israel, but they've also called U.S. and U.K. assets legitimate targets. Twice this week, on Monday and on Wednesday, according to U.S. Central Command, the Houthis successfully struck U.S.-owned and operated vessels in the Gulf of Aden. In both cases, the ships suffered minor damage and were able to continue on their way. But it shows the sort of back and forth that we're seeing play out quite violently in and around Yemen here, the U.S. continuing to warn that if the Houthis keep attacking international shipping lanes, the U.S. military could continue to act.

There were no injuries and there was some damage to the ship, but it was able to continue.Tuesday, they managed to hit a Malta flagged boat. Again, no injuries, but there was damage to the ship. And then on Wednesday, a second U.S. vessel was hit. So, it really is begging the question, is this not a wider conflict? Does this not represent an uptick in the -- in the violence and in the concerns? Now, what we're seeing from the U.S. side is that they are carrying out more airstrikes against Yemeni targets, against Houthi targets, I should say, in Yemen. But they admitted that even what they did last Thursday with the U.S. and U.K. navies overnight Thursday into Friday, where they hit more than 60 targets, they only managed to take out, they think, less than a third of the weapons capabilities of the Houthis. So that just demonstrates how difficult this task is. The Houthis had plenty of time to disperse their assets and their launching sites to make sure that it was a difficult task to be able to put them out of business. And they have shown again Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday with these launches, with these hits, these direct hits on vessels going through the Red Sea that they are in no way contained.
