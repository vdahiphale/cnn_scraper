My friend and colleague, Boris Sanchez, is in Washington.And tonight, Vice President Kamala Harris will be delivering the most important speech of her political career, attempting to reintroduce herself to the American people while accepting her party's nomination for president, becoming the first black woman and woman of South Asian descent to lead a major party ticket. We have CNN's Priscilla Alvarez with some new details on some of the policy points that Harris will try to hit tonight during her speech. First though, I do want to go to CNN's MJ Lee, who is here at the United Center. MJ, this is the grand finale after three days of what have really been electrifying speeches. This crowd has been so engaged on these evenings. What should we expect to hear tonight?",

And we know that there's no question. This is the biggest speech that the Vice President has given so far in her career. And you'll notice that her public schedule today and yesterday were clear so that she could spend as much time as she would have wanted finalizing those preparations to deliver this speech.And a campaign official tells us that there are really three major things that she would like to accomplish with this speech. First and foremost is just giving that introduction to the American people tuning in about the Kamala Harris story. We know that she plans on talking about her middle class upbringing, her relationship with her mom, and the influence that she had in her career, and the decision that she made to become a prosecutor. We also know that there's going to be a portion of the speech that really gets into that contrast with Donald Trump and particularly Project 2025. I suspect that this is going to be the piece that will really lean heavily into some of the policy decisions and positions that she has taken and what she envisions in a Harris-Walz administration. And finally, we are told that she is going to say that underlying all of this, what is fueling all of this, including her candidacy, is going to be a sense of patriotic duty. She will say, unlike Donald Trump, she wants to be president for all Americans. She has been working on the speech for weeks, so we suspect that really, most of the speech is written, and what is going to be happening in the final hours is practicing delivery, making those final tweaks and edits. And as one advisor put it to me, as she has been practicing, what she has really been thinking about is how every sentence is going to land and is going to be received by people tuning in. That, of course, includes everybody here in the United Center, but also millions of Americans that are going to be tuning in from their homes.",

And Elizabeth Warren, of course, represents a leader of the progressive movement. She was Harris' former colleague in the Senate, and ran against Harris back in 2020. That was the presidential campaign that I covered four years ago.When Warren was on with Dana, earlier today, Brianna, I noticed she was sort of reflecting on the past eight years. You know, she noted that back in 2016, a woman was nominated for the presidency. In 2020, so many women actually ended up running for the presidency. Of course, all of them were not successful. Joe Biden ended up winning that primary. And she said, look, even in the last four years, we have had a woman serving as vice president, Kamala Harris. The intention there seemed to be sort of a reminder for any woman that was watching that there has been sort of this arc of progress that women may not necessarily always feel like they have everything that they want, but that it was important to keep in mind the progress that we are seeing on display, and particularly, of course, will be on display tonight as Kamala Harris is trying to become the first woman, the first black and South Asian woman, to win the presidency, Brianna.",

She's really preferred to stay on policy.Now what I'm told is this speech is going to really lean in much more into her biography. You are going to hear the story about her mom. You're going to hear the story about how her mom's dream was to cure cancer. You're going to have Maya Harris, her sister, introduce her. They are, you know, as hundreds of millions of dollars are being spent on T.V. right now trying to, quote unquote, define Kamala Harris from both sides, you are going to really see them lean into her biography in a way they haven't before. Now, in terms of immigration, you're going to see Senator Mark Kelly speak tonight. Arizona border state has been critical the Biden administration. They're going to talk about that border bill. Now, of course, part of the problem is that they didn't really do much on the border, spend much political capital trying to pass a bill the first three years. So how do they thread that needle?

And so the problem, and the reason it's been so hard, I think, for Trump to distance himself, is that you've got former administration officials actually writing it, and the groups that are out there selling it happen to be groups that are putting a lot of money into the Trump election.

It wasn't clear whether that was going to be his name and people on the left, or it was going to be, you know, his craziness and people on the right. It looks like he's gone for the craziness on the right.But I -- I think in the end, it will have very little impact. What's going to have impact in Michigan is enthusiasm and turnout. We've worked hard to get no abs -- no excuse absentee balloting, which actually starts the end of September. We've worked hard to get nine days of early voting. I mean, pep -- we are laser focused on getting people out. And don't underestimate, and I'm sure you don't. But, you know, the craziness and the hatefulness of Donald Trump versus the joy and moving forward in this hall. Donald Trump was in Michigan yesterday. He's had around him in Michigan, white supremacists carrying signs that say, we love Hitler. We love Trump. People are exhausted. We don't want more of that. I mean, it's awful. So this is the place that's going to bring joy.",
