CNN teams on the ground say they saw missiles and heard explosions. Those air raid sirens sounded, and then there's this dramatic video from Thursday. Have a look. Now this video posted on social media is from the Luhansk region, which is occupied by Russia. A local telegram channel suggests an ammunition depot may have been hit. Neither Russian nor Ukrainian officials have commented on that. Now to the north, the mayor of Kharkiv reports Russian forces attacked critical infrastructure. Authorities say Russian rockets hit a warehouse with no connection to the military, and two people were killed in the recently liberated city of Kherson. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE (through translator): During another Russian shelling of Kherson today, a shell hit the Red Cross aid station. A woman, a paramedic, a volunteer was killed. My condolences to the family. Only since the beginning of this day Russia has already shelled Kherson more than 16 times in just one day.

From there, that is likely to be where this operation will commence. And we heard a spokesman from the Pentagon's air -- air force unit say that this training will include live fire exercises followed by squad platoon, and company level training that will then culminate, of course in battalion level maneuver training. So, scaling up there the ability of the Ukrainians to continue to defend their country against this battery of attacks that they're facing that has significantly increased as we hear there from Will and others on the scene as we head into the dead of a really frigid winter in Ukraine. I must add that this is U.S. official say a continuation of an existing U.S. policy that's being re-energized. Remember that the U.S. has continued to have joint training exercises with Ukrainian forces sporadically ever since 2014 when Crimea was annexed from Ukraine by Russia. But this again, yes, another a culmination of important U.S. and Ukrainian military announcements to look forward to the new year to try and see if this can help Ukraine defend itself from those attacks on its critical infrastructure at this critical time of the year.

Now there's concern more interest rate hikes will cause a recession, which is already looming in Britain. Regulators say more increases are likely because inflation is still too far high.

Inflation has been high for a while. Wages haven't kept up with inflation. We've got a cost-of- living crisis. We've got fuel bills increasing. We've also, in the UK had quite a long period really going back to the aftermath of the credit crisis in the late 2000s of austerity of restrictions in expenditure on public services by government.

Certainly, in the case of nurses, nurses are a pretty popular group in this country. They, you know, many people have experience of being looked after by nurses. They feel that they deserve a fair deal. So, if popularity holds up, then it may be difficult for the -- for the conservative government to gain this one. But even if the popularity of the strikes does decline, even if people do get fed up with the strikes, it doesn't necessarily mean they're going to like the government.
