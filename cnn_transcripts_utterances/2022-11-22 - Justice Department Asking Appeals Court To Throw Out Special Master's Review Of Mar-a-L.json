Arguments are under way as prosecutors try to convince this three-judge panel to get rid of the so-called special master. This is this third-party review of materials seized at the former president's Mar-a-Lago home back in August.But this is also a big day because this is the first hearing since the appointment of special counsel, Jack Smith. He's not here today. He's not arguing in court. But he has approved the arguments that are being made. And it was really interesting to hear the first few questions from this panel. The first question really asked, is this kind of special master traditionally put in place when a search has not been determined to be unlawful? The answer was no. Also another question about whether, if you have a former president, get a special master, if that request is granted, if every criminal defendant is then going to want this kind of third-party review. So, so far, it sounds like this could be favorable for the prosecution. Now, this court has previously granted prosecutors a carve-out from this requirement for a special master and said, look, you can look at, you can investigate classified materials. And prosecutors got some good news early this morning when they found out two of the three judges that made that decision were going to be on today's panel. We are not expected, though, to get a decision today. That will likely come in the coming weeks. But this is all about how quickly they can move this investigation along, Victor. A lot of concerns about how far this will extend into the 2024 presidential race. And as we know, the former president, for decades, has been very successful at using delay tactics in ongoing litigation and investigations.",

We had very qualified individuals that have a career and a resume that show that they were ready to take on this role and lead Georgia in the Senate. So it has been a difficult process.

But I think that it's, one, Governor Kemp came out strong Saturday in support of Herschel Walker, which he's done well. But also Donald Trump failed in his announcement. It just seems like a national dud. And if it would have been a success and talk of the town, I think that you would have seen Herschel Walker may have had a tougher time keeping it as close as it is. But another interesting statistic, 54-39 is Independents in that same poll for Warnock. And I think this is a turnout game. If we can get folks to turn out -- and I've been critical throughout the whole process. I just felt like Herschel Walker had a hard time getting my attention.

The juxtapose is, if you tell Trump to stay away and you ask Ron DeSantis and likeminded individuals to show up, you put them at odds with each other at a national stage. But that is what needed to happen. So I think two of the three calls probably were made. I'm not in the war room with those guys. It does feel like Donald Trump has stayed away, although he did include in his speech, when he announced that he was going to run for president, he included Herschel Walker and showing up for him. Governor Kemp has shown up and offered some of his support from his team. But it doesn't feel like anybody from Ron DeSantis' camp will be here and attach their political wagon to Herschel Walker.",
