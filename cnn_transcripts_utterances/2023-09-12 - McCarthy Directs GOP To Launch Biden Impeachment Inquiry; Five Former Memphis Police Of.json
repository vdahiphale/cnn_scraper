But the response from their counterparts in the Senate has been muted. Here was Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell just moments ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): We've got our hands full here trying to get through the appropriations process and not have an omnibus. And I don't have any advice to give to the House. They've got a totally different set of challenges than we do. And so I think the best advice for the Senate is to do our job and we'll see how this plays out later. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Meanwhile, in the House of Representatives, the big news today, of course, is this announcement from McCarthy that he is formally launching an impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden. Now, he talked to reporters just a few minutes ago and he did make clear that he acknowledges that there is still more information that has to be found. And he said that that's the difference between an impeachment inquiry and moving forward with impeachment formally. So that is the very delicate tightrope that the House Speaker is trying to walk right now. But just mere moments after he made his announcement around 11 AM this morning, you saw Matt Gaetz go down to the House floor and give his own speech. He was threatening to try and oust the Speaker if he doesn't give in to a series of demands, including demands on spending. Here's what Matt Gaetz said. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL): Moments ago, Speaker McCarthy endorsed an impeachment inquiry. This is a baby step following weeks of pressure from House conservatives to do more. We must move faster.

The House Speaker is really trying to deal with a series of crises.

They'll have to make some showing, but courts are generallydeferential to the House, so I do think that they could use this as a way of getting more records. Obviously, critics are going to argue that that's an abuse of that power because that's not typically the purpose for which impeachment inquiry is launched. Usually it's because there's evidence of high crimes or misdemeanors that have already been uncovered, but that debate will continue.",

It's something I think it's fair to say that the individuals who framed and drafted our Constitution did not anticipate.

Now, the sister testified that Cavalcante told her he didn't know if the woman was dead or alive. The prosecutor asked, \"Was he calm? Was he angry? Was he sad? How would you describe his demeanor?\" The sister responds, \"I couldn't really identify because he always had a calm demeanor. He seemed okay to me.\" The prosecutor then goes on, \"So his demeanor was the same during this phone call that it has always been with you?\" Cavalcante's sister replies, \"Yes.\" Let's take you now to Chester County, Pennsylvania with CNN's Danny Freeman, who's been following the story from the very beginning.

That's one thing that police have continued to be confident about throughout this manhunt, that when they establish a perimeter, they believe that Cavalcante is inside of it.Of course, the most recent time they set up a perimeter before this time, he was able to slip out. But after those two sightings last night, police are displaying confidence that they are closing in on him. And as you can see right here, we're at the intersection of State Route 23 and 100 on the northeastern most side of this perimeter. A lot of police activity right in this intersection. We've been seeing armored vehicles coming in as late as into this afternoon and a lot of troopers standing out here making sure to check every car before it tries to go into this perimeter. Now, Boris, I want to go over some of the things that we did learn in this press conference earlier today about these two sightings. The first one happening around 8 PM when police say a woman who was driving in the area where Cavalcante ditched that dairy van that he stole over the weekend, she said she believed she saw him crouching down on the road, police came. They didn't find Cavalcante, but they did find footprints in the mud and ultimately his prison issued sneakers. Then a couple of hour - or rather, I should say, less than two hours later at around 10 in the evening, police responded to an incident at an open garage and that's what you described earlier where Cavalcante was said to have stolen that rifle that had a scope on it, also a flashlight on it. And that resident who owned the House inside the garage returned fire - I should say - shot at Cavalcante. But Cavalcante was still able to get away with that gun. Take a listen to what Lt. Col. George Bivens said about his own mindset now that Cavalcante has this weapon. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. COL.

I think there's a more high likelihood that it could get broken up there.But what's at stake for Google is that this could be a major distraction. Oftentimes when tech companies are sued by the government or taken to court, they become more cautious around things like innovation and it's happening at a time when Google is already fighting to compete for search dominance with AI. Microsoft, of course, being its big competitor there, of course, there's the irony because the Google's - the Microsoft case in 1998 sort of hampered their innovation, which is what gave rise to Google.",

And so it's really hard to argue that consumers are being hard by the dominance that Google has in search, essentially, what the DOJ is arguing is that the consumer doesn't have enough choice when they go onto their phone, whether it's an Apple phone or another, the default browser is Google because of agreements that Google makes with those companies and so the consumer doesn't even know that they're lacking competition.",

My guess is this is a real reward for Kim for munitions and other things he's probably already provided. He certainly already committed to providing them or he wouldn't be having a meeting.
