      "sentences": "So today's a big day for Kamala Harris and her quest for the White House. She has faced near constant criticism from Republicans that she has been policy light, has been slow to roll out policy proposals and plans, hasn't yet faced questions about her change on other policy positions from the past.Today, that changes itself. Harris is set to roll out her economic vision in a now much anticipated speech in North Carolina. This morning, we have new reporting on some of what she's going to say, including proposing tax cuts for middle and low income earners. That includes expanded tax cuts for parents and frontline workers. She also wants to keep generous subsidies for health insurance premiums under Obamacare. Harris is going to roll out this -- also roll out a plan to tackle the cost of living, plans to drive down costs on groceries and also housing. Harris' pitch comes with just days to go until the DNC kicks off in Chicago. And as polls show, the economy remains the top issue and top priority for voters. CNN's Isaac Dovere joins us right now with much more on this. Isaac, what more are you learning about the speech? EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER:  Yes, Katie, it's going to be full of some specific proposals, a number of which you just mentioned, $25,000 credit for first time house buyers, an expansion and renewal of the child tax credit that was there for a couple years in the early years of the Biden administration expansion of the earned income tax credit. So, it's that sort of stuff as well as a crackdown on price gouging in supermarkets. It's a lot of proposals. We don't know exactly how many of these she would be able to get through or the details of what they would actually look like. That's what governing would be like were she to win. But this is the stage of the presidential campaign that we usually get much earlier, of course, when candidates are starting much earlier. Now, three and a half weeks into her campaign, she is starting to roll out what her economic vision would be.",

But it says I think a lot about the way that Harris looks at what policy should do, which is to not talk about things in big terms and macroeconomics, things like Bidenomics that you heard from the current president when he was running, but to talk really about how it's going to affect people's lives and what it does in the dollars in their bank account directly.It's Harris trying to show also that she feels the pain, feels the connection to people who have been complaining for the last couple of years, that inflation has been hitting them hard and that their costs have been going up. Obviously, Donald Trump was talking about that yesterday himself. That's how the candidates are trying to prosecute this case here.",

But that soon shifted to more of these personal attacks, especially when he took questions from reporters. And in fact, our colleague, Alayna Treen, asked Trump what he made of Republicans saying his strategy isn't working and that he needed to stop with the personal attacks, take a listen to what he said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I'm very angry at her that she'd weaponized the justice system against me and other people. I'm very angry at her. I think I'm entitled to personal attacks. I don't have a lot of respect for her. I don't have a lot of respect for her intelligence. Whether the personal attacks are good, bad, I mean, she certainly attacks me personally. She actually called me weird. He's weird. It was just a sound bite. And she called J.D. and I weird.

It's 250 pages long, so it was quite expansive. Let me go through some of what we found.Interestingly, a vast majority of his wealth is tied up in the $115 million shares in the company that owns Truth Social, the social media website he started. Those are worth about $2.7 billion. He also made more than $500 million from his golf clubs and resorts over the last year. The disclosures also include the liabilities in, quote, excess of $50 million dollars for the various judgments against him in New York in the E. Jean Carroll defamation lawsuit. We also found that he's got about $7.2 million for selling digital NFTs, that's non fungible tokens, those trading cards with Trump on them. He got $300,000 from the Greenwood Bible that he now sells for $60. He also has about one to $5 million in cryptocurrency, Ethereum, and, interestingly, six figure investment in gold bars, Sara.",

So, there's been a building boom of apartments in America and all of that new supply has made it harder for landlords to fill units. So, yet, they've been forced to throw in some incentives to get people to sign leases, like free parking, weeks or even months of free rent. Zillow found that one in three units on their platform are offering incentives. That is up from one in four units a year ago and one in five two years ago.Here's how one Zillow comments put it to me. He said landlords are basically in a race right now to get tenants. So, they're throwing in a bunch of deals and perks to sweeten the pot. I spoke to a grad student in Arizona who told me that every single apartment that her and her boyfriend looked at was offering concessions. She ended up getting half a rent -- half of a month off rent free. Another woman, a teacher, also in Arizona, said she got the whole month for free. And you don't need to live in Arizona. Zillow said that in six cities right now, you're finding a lot of apartments with concessions, Raleigh, Charlotte, Atlanta, Salt Lake City, Nashville and Austin. All of them have more than half of the apartments that are on the market right now with incentives. So, look, there's always this balance of power between tenants and landlords. And right now, tenants have some negotiating power.",

So, you got to use that to your advantage. It's like my mother-in-law always says, you don't know if you don't ask.And, look, one last point here, mortgage rates. They're coming down because the Fed is preparing to start cutting interest rates. That could actually help renters, too, because some people who might otherwise be renting are going to go into the housing market, because they've been waiting to get in, and that could help everyone else who is still renting.",
