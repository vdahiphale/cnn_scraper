Are we going to go to the next hour? Oh, we're going to go to the top of the hour. Thank you for staying with us. You are live at the CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington. As I was saying a few moments ago, I thought we might be going to a break, but we're not. We have got a lot of moving parts this morning. We're going to begin this hour with the disaster unfolding right now in Baltimore. A massive 1.6-mile interstate bridge has collapsed, as we have been telling you all morning long. This is the moment that the Francis Scott Key Bridge plunged into the Patapsco River in Baltimore piece by piece, taking with it a number of vehicles and people. Six people are missing at this hour after a huge container ship slammed into a column supporting the bridge. A short time ago, Maryland officials said the crew warned it was having power issues before the collision. Two people have been rescued from the 48-degree water, one person seriously injured. This is the emergency dispatch call to the first responders as they were en route. Take a listen. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "All right, CNN's Brian Todd and Pete Muntean join me now.Brian, I know it's been about nine-and-a-half-hours since the collision. Where are you right now? It looks like you might be on a boat somewhere near the collapsed bridge. Can you tell us, where do things stand right now in terms of the search operations. BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Right, Jim. We have been able to get to a vantage point that we think is a little less than 2,000 yards away from the vessel itself. I'm going to just have our photojournalist Andrew Crispin (ph) go right past me. We have a second camera here operated by Joe Merkel (ph). He's going to train in his camera in as close as he can as well. There, you get probably the best view that we're going to have of this thing for a while now. This is the nearly 1,000-foot-long-cargo vessel, the Dali, that collided with the bridge. And you can see the entire middle section of the Francis Scott Key Bridge there has basically collapsed into the Baltimore Harbor. You can see remnants of the bridge to the side of the boat. And if you can see just over the bow of the boat, there to your right, there's part of the bridge that is lying across the bow. What we can tell you is that there are dive teams that have been going into the water for the last several hours, but the conditions for the dive teams are very treacherous. Our weather people say that the water temperature here is 46 to 48 degrees Fahrenheit. That is not a safe condition for divers to be in for any length of time. So they are in some dangerous conditions as they look for the possibility of finding some people in the water. What we can tell you about that is that there were eight people -- according to officials, eight people on the bridge working construction at the time of the collapse. Two of them have been rescued. One of them is hurt. One of them is unhurt, six people unaccounted for as of now. And, as I think Jim, you just mentioned a positive part of this is that, according to the governor, Wes Moore, they were able to -- the people operating the vessel were able to get a mayday signal out in the minutes before this incident occurred, and they were able to stop traffic from getting onto the bridge. There were a few cars that were on the bridge at the time.Unclear at this point. If there was anyone actually in those cars when they went into the water. So you do have vehicles that are in the water, a few of them, but not clear whether anyone was actually in those cars or not, six people now unaccounted for. And, again, we're just going to -- we're going to show you, as I kind of describe the scene here. Look at that. The entire middle section of the bridge there is gone. And you can see remnants of the bridge there. It's going to take -- I talked to a person who was involved in some of the excavation that's going to be taking place here over the next couple of days. He said it's going to take at least two or three days just to get floating cranes and other excavation equipment here to remove some of this. And this is outside of the rescue operations that are going on right now, Jim. And, as we pan to our left here, I'm going to show -- Andrew Crispin is going to show you the Port of Baltimore, as we kind of pan down here. That's a -- that green vessel over there to your -- now to your right, that is a -- that's a car. That's a vessel that carries cars in and out of the Baltimore Harbor. All of these vessels are now trapped in the harbor. Nothing can get in and out. It's only one way in, one way out of the Baltimore Harbor. You have got however many vessels -- we don't even know yet -- are trapped inside the Baltimore Harbor. So this is a huge disruption of commerce that could extend into the billions of dollars in the next few days, Jim.",

Jim, no vessel traffic aside from rescue vessels and recovery vessels, and you can see one on the other side of that bridge, so nothing coming in and out of here. And you're right, this bridge very, very important for interstate commerce and traffic, and also hazmat transportation going north and south. So that has completely stopped. Again, the disruption economically here, you can't even really fathom it at this point, because they're just kind of trying to assess now how long it's going to take some of the recovery and salvage equipment just to get here. That's going to take days. So -- but of course, what we have to think about right now is the recovery of people in the water. We know that there are six people now unaccounted for. That's where the dive teams are working over my right shoulder over there. You can kind of see them in the distance there, or at least some of the vessels that they're operating from, Jim.",

For more on this, I want to go to meteorologist Derek Van Dam. He joins me now, along with Brian Todd, who is on a boat near the damaged ship near that bridge that collapsed. Brian, we will get to you in just a second. Derek, let me go to you first, because I was talking with the Baltimore fire chief about this in the previous hour. And he was talking about what they had to go through in terms of a rescue operation overnight. He was saying that they mainly were focusing on a surface rescue operation. I suppose that's because they were just looking for heads poking out of the water at that hour. But tell us a little bit more about what people might have been going through during all of this.",

Here's the 695 Corridor. There's the Key Bridge that collapsed overnight roughly about 1:30. We're entering into, I believe, about the 10th hour since this event occurred last night. And when we look at the reality of this situation, humans susceptible to this type of water temperature can only sustain motor functions for so long. And survivability is roughly between one to three hours in water temperatures between 40 to 50 degrees. Your heart rate starts to increase, your breathing starts to increase. You can have a heart attack. These are the conditions that perhaps people are experiencing. Now, in terms of the rescue, search-and-rescue operations that are still ongoing, they're also being complicated not only below the surface of the water, where we talked about how difficult conditions are in there, but the changing tides and the changing currents across the Chesapeake Bay and into the Patapsco River region just outside of Baltimore. This is creating dangerous rip currents, for instance. This change in tide means that the potential here exists for just kind of difficult conditions trying to get those search-and-rescue boats into a safe place in and around the collapsed bridge. We are approaching low tide at about 3:10 this evening, and then we will start that high tide cycle once again as we get into the overnight period. And then to further complicate this, Jim, we have got an approaching cold front, which means that winds will start to pick up in advance of this, so it could make conditions along the waterways there even more choppy. So, interesting to see what Brian Todd is experiencing out there as well.",

You can see it right there. I mean, I'm guessing we're about 1,000 yards away from it, maybe a little bit more, but we can see a lot of boats coming back and forth. These are rescue boats. These are recovery boats. There's no ship traffic, as you mentioned. That part of it is quiet. There's no heavy vessel traffic coming in and out of here, and there may not be for days, but I can kind of describe to you basically what you're looking at. The entire middle section of that bridge is collapsed and in the water. You can see remnants of it there. As we get a little closer, our cameras can train in to not only the police and other rescue boats that are buzzing around the ship, but you can see the bow of the vessel there to the right, and that is part of the bridge that is actually lying across the bow of the vessel there, and you can see the damage on the side of the vessel. And that's partly probably bridge damage as well. This was a complete calamity at about 1:30 this morning. As we have been mentioning, the fortunate part is that whoever was operating the boat at the time was able to get a mayday signal out, so they were able to stop vehicle traffic and other traffic from getting on to the bridge. That's very fortunate. That could have saved many lives. Right now, as we know, six people unaccounted for. And, again, we can show you the rescue operations going on over my right shoulder here. We can train some of our cameras in, a lot of boats coming in and out that way. But these are smaller vessels, of course. Dive teams have been in the water here for several hours. You just heard Derek mention, though, these are not healthy conditions for divers or anyone else in the water for very long, so they have got to monitor that as well. The disruption to commerce is significant, because one other thing we can tell you about this bridge, this is one of the venues where hazmat material can travel up and down the East Coast. They do not allow hazmat material to go into Baltimore's tunnels, which is where a lot of the other vehicle traffic goes in and out, of course, as they move around Baltimore. But hazmat material can go over this bridge. And it's unclear whether there's going to be another avenue for that material to travel up and down the East Coast. So, again, it's a real point of disruption here. Some of the other vessels, you can see over there. We have a Coast Guard vessel here that it's just to your left, my right. We can kind of pan over. Our photojournalist Andrew Crispin is going to give you a shot of that. And Andrew can also, I think, show you this green vessel over here. What we're told is that that is a large container vessel for vehicles, for cars coming in and out of the point -- the Port of Baltimore. It would have been getting ready to leave and pick up cars from another port, but it cannot move. That's -- these are some of the main shipping terminals in the Port of Baltimore that basically have come to a standstill. And there are other terminals over there toward the city of Baltimore, as we can show you, that are basically at a standstill. So, everything that is in this harbor right now, Jim, is trapped. It cannot get in or out. So that is a huge disruption at this point.",
