It could be, too, that they could use some of their algorithmic tools to down rank certain kinds of content, that's another tool that was quite controversial but is used by all the major platforms.

Now, it's decided it take the easy way out by giving people, like Donald Trump and his enablers, free rein to continue to lie without consequence about the 2020 elections.

The problem is, is when it starts to feed and fuel extremism.And so, you know, I agree with the statement in principle, but I do think there are some uses to allowing the free speech to flow about this.

It's very, very strange. Very strange.TIRRELL (voiceover):  Ferguson is one of many patients taking drugs like Ozempic for weight loss who say they've lost interest in some addictive behaviors. Doctors told CNN that patients most commonly report an effect on alcohol use. It may be because these drugs in a class known as GLP-1s have an affect not just in the gut, but also in the brain. It's something being studies at the National Institutes of Health, where researchers just published a paper showing Semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic, reduced what they called binge-like alcohol drinking in rodents. DR. LORENZO LEGGIO, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH RESEARCHER:  We believe that at least one of the mechanisms how these drugs reduce alcohol drinking is by reducing the rewarding effects of alcohol such as those related to a neurotransmitter in our brain, which is dopamine. So, these medications are likely to make alcohol less rewarding. TIRRELL (voiceover):  And it's not just alcohol and nicotine, patients have even told \"The Atlantic\" it had effects on behaviors like nail- biting and online shopping. DR. LEGGIO:  There is a lot of overlap on the neurobiological mechanism that regulate addictive behaviors in general. So, it's possible that medications like Semaglutide, by acting on this specific mechanism in the brain, they may help people with a variety of addictive behaviors. TIRRELL (voiceover):  Clinical trials in humans are needed to prove that. One said is underway at the University of North Carolina, looking at Semaglutide's effect on alcohol and tobacco use. Cheri Ferguson says Ozempic has helped her lose 38 pounds. Even better, she says, is how it's made her feel.",

This traditionally hasn't been a market that's been appealing to pharmaceutical companies because drugs really haven't been successful in selling well, although doctors emphasize there is a huge unmet medical need here. Alcohol use disorder effects almost 30 million Americans and only 5 percent currently receive treatment.

But this is not a problem that's relegated only to Phoenix. The southwest has been dealing with these droughts. And I know we had a really wet winter out here, but what we have learned from scientists is that the periods between these really wet years is becoming longer as we're seeing these more extended periods of drought, and that is why many of these municipalities and these states are looking for ways to make sure that they have water, especially since many of these states rely on the Colorado River Basin for their water, and they are now agreeing to use less of that water, seeing as the drought has been impacting that water supply there.
