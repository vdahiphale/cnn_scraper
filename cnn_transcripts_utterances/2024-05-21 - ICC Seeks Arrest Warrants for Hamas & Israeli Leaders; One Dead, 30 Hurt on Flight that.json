But, Becky this also comes against the backdrop of tense relations between the U.S. and Israel as Israel continues to wage its war on Hamas in Gaza. The two leaders have had frank phone calls over the last several months, the president going so far as to put conditions on offensive weapons that he would provide Israel if they are to continue with their major ground operation in Rafah, that area of southern Gaza where more than a million Palestinians are displaced. And also here in Washington, the president is having to navigate the politics of all of this as he continues to receive fierce pushback from his Democratic allies, who say he's not doing enough to rein Israel in, particularly as we continue to see the worsening situation in Gaza.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KARA SCANNELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): After four weeks of testimony, prosecutors rested their case in Former President Donald Trump's criminal trial just after their star witness Trump's former fixer Michael Cohen concluded more than 17 hours of dramatic testimony over four days. Trump's Attorney Todd Lynch intensely attacked Cohen's credibility over multiple days trying to paint him as a liar who's motivated by money. MICHAEL COHEN, DONALD TRUMP'S FORMER LAWYER AND FIXER: I just want to get through this so that I can start my own life again. SCANNELL (voice-over): Blanch got Cohen to admit that he stole from the Trump Organization. Cohen confirmed he paid a tech company $20,000 instead of the $50,000 that was owed by Trump, but Cohen asked Trump to be repaid the full amount which was doubled to cover taxes. Ultimately, Cohen admitted he kept around $60,000 for himself. Blanche asked, so you stole from the Trump Organization? Yes, sir Cohen replied. Cohen said he was angry about getting a low annual bonus. Earlier in the trial Cohen told prosecutors he requested the full reimbursement because that's what was owed. And I didn't feel Mr. Trump deserves the benefit of the difference. On Monday, Cohen admitted it was wrong to have taken the money.

In fact, he just ramped up tariffs, and the Peterson Institute estimates that the new Biden tariffs are going to cost the typical middle income family about $30 a year that is pretty small, relative to the estimate of $1,700 a year for these Trump tariff proposals. But just to remind people, just last week, the Biden administration did just raise tariffs on Chinese goods, everything from computer chips and electric cars, solar panels, aluminum and steel. The big difference, though, is this scale, right. The Biden Administration targeting $18 billion of goods from China, the Trump administration or the Trump proposal is for tariffs on $3 trillion of imports. So one of them is taking a surgical targeted approach, the other one is basically a sledgehammer. But I think when you zoom out one of the other big takeaways here is that no matter who wins in November, tariffs are not going anywhere, right? Tariffs are in. Republicans or Democrats, they don't agree on much. But they do agree on using tariffs to hold China accountable, and to really send a message to voters that they're tough on China.

It's sort of a quasi-dystopian film about the relationship between technology and humans. So Monday evening Open AI or Monday morning, I should say Open AI announced that it would be pausing the use of this voice because of some of the criticism that it had received. But Monday evening, we get this statement from Scarlett Johansson, which sort of suggested that their decision to pause may have had more to do with \"Her\". She said that Open AI CEO Sam Altman approached her in September asking if she would voice the new ChatGPT, she declined for personal reasons. Then just two days before the launch, he again approached her agent and asked her to be involved asked her to reconsider, and they didn't get a chance to discuss it and Open AI went ahead and launched it anyways. Johansson said that she had her lawyer sent two letters to Open AI asking them questions about where this voice came from. And that then the company decided to pull the use of the voice. Now, Open AI does say that this is not Scarlett Johansson's voice. Altman said in a statement that it was never intended to resemble hers. It was created with a different actress, but that the company decided to pause, the use of sky out of respect for Mrs. Johansson. Now, it's interesting this timing because there are so many concerns that creative could have their likeness, their work used by AI, recreated by AI and that AI companies then would profit from that without any compensation for those creative, so not a great look for Open AI here, even if it wasn't actually created with Johansson's voice.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, it's a really good question, Becky. Look, the criticism of sky went beyond the comparisons to Johansson users said it was weirdlyflirtatious, it was giggly. At one point, the voice told an Open AI developer that it was -- that he was making her blush just kind of weird. And I think this does get at the question of what happens when you have technology being created by a group of people that don't necessarily reflect the broader world. Developers could think that sounds really good and personal, and then you get it out into the world and users think it sounds kind of creepy. This also again really gets at this question of how AI companies are getting permission from and crediting the creators whose work is used to train these AI models. This is a huge question in Hollywood among writers and authors. Just last week, we saw another lawsuit from two voice actors complaining that a different AI firm had used their voices to create AI clones and profited from them, so a huge question for this entire industry, Becky.",
