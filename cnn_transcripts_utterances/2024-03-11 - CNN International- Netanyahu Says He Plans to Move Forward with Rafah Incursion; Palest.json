Max has the day off, kind of.It's Monday, March 11th, 8 a.m. here in London, 10 a.m. in Gaza, where Palestinians are marking the start of the holy Muslim month of Ramadan as the threat of an expanded Israeli offensive looms. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he plans to push ahead with a military ground incursion into Rafah, the southern Gaza city where more than a million people are sheltering. This comes just days after talks on a temporary ceasefire and hostage release failed to reach a deal. Israel had warned that it would launch the next phase of its war against Hamas if a deal wasn't reached by Ramadan. But U.S. officials say the Biden administration isn't expecting Israeli forces to imminently expand operations. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is in Washington with those details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

And that has been a looming concern as negotiators worked around the clock to try to reach a ceasefire deal. That deal would include a six-week temporary ceasefire as well as the release of hostages, particularly the most vulnerable. Now, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that regardless of a deal, he plans to expand his military operation into this area, Rafah. President Biden, on the other hand, saying that that would be a red line. So it's unclear where this deal is headed, whether they can reach a ceasefire deal.

Look, it seems like the friction that we've been hearing about between President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu is starting to spill out into the open ever more publicly. You had this interview that President Biden gave to MSNBC on Saturday where he said that going into Rafah, the Israelis moving into Rafah militarily, would be a red line for him.He also couched it, though, by saying that he'll never leave Israel, never cut off all weapons to them. And clearly that was not perceived as much of a threat to Benjamin Netanyahu or Israel's security. And so he made very clear in an interview yesterday with Politico and the German outlet BILD that his red line is October 7th and making sure it doesn't happen again. And he will go ahead with an incursion into Rafah despite President Biden's talk of that being a red line. He said that that kind of an operation could last two months to root out Hamas there, perhaps even less despite -- and of course, this is despite the humanitarian situation taking place right there. And what the Americans have said is a situation where, you know, they question whether it's even possible to evacuate more than a million people sheltering there in advance of any kind of military operations. You also had President Biden in that interview saying that Netanyahu's actions are hurting Israel more than they're helping. This was the prime minister's response to that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "So, Bianca, where we are with talks at this stage is, well, there frankly are none. There's none scheduled, at least that we know of. You had Hamas walking away from talks in Cairo on Thursday to try to reach some kind of a ceasefire agreement. The Israelis were never there at all because they say that Hamas has not addressed their demands.And Hamas is pretty firm in what they're saying. We heard from its chief, Ismail Haniyeh, yesterday, as saying that any kind of a ceasefire agreed to by the Israelis needs to be a permanent one and IDF troops need to be completely withdrawn from Gaza and that no hostages will be turned over until that happens. And while you don't have the Israelis imminently looking to go into Gaza, of course, all of that hangs over this as we now move into Ramadan. And one other thing that Prime Minister Netanyahu said in that interview that I think is very important to mention is he left open the possibility of an expanded military operation against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, pointing to the fact that so many Israelis in the northern part of the country had been forced to evacuate their homes because of the back-and-forth fire between the Israelis and Hezbollah. And he says that, look, people will be able to go back to their homes if they can make a deal to make it safe for them diplomatically, they'll do it. But otherwise, they'll do it militarily one way or the other. And this is pretty serious talk from the prime minister, considering that a new full-scale front with Lebanon would be really uncharted territory when they're also fighting in Gaza. Hezbollah is a much, much, much more formidable fighting force than Hamas. The Israelis say that there are hundreds, maybe even thousands of rockets in private homes near the Israeli border within firing range of Israel. And Hezbollah also claims to have reservists in the number of some 100,000. So that could be a very serious escalation if the prime minister makes good on his promise.",

The picture also included a message from her, thanking the public for its support while also marking Mother's Day in the United Kingdom. Now, CNN has conducted its own initial review of the image and identified at least two areas which appear to show some evidence of potential manipulation. If you look closely, the first area includes some potential altering of Princess Charlotte's sleeve cuff, and the second area, under scrutiny, is a zipper on the left-hand side of the jacket the princess is wearing. There's also quite a few others, for example, the patterning on Prince Louis's jumper. You can see bends and peculiarities with the tiles underneath the family as well, not to mention several more.

It is a very unsociable hour where you are, so thank you so much for taking the time.Let's begin with the Princess of Wales. Now, I was quite staggered by this. Obviously, it's not unusual at all for high-profile figures to have some element of touch-ups done to their photographs. But the sheer number of discrepancies here it's quite staggering and only adds fuel to the online speculation about what's really going on. SANDRO MONETTI, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, HOLLYWOOD INTERNATIONAL FILMMAKER MAGAZINE: Not even wearing her wedding ring in this photo. Now, in this era of AI, the photo agencies have built-in safeguards to look for manipulated photos. What you don't expect is for the palace to be the source of these manipulations. What a shambles, what an embarrassment. This leads to key questions for Royal Communications, which is the new name for the press office, to answer. Question one, who ordered this manipulation? Question two, who did the manipulation? And question three, the most important question of all, why?",

So this is a real question that's got to be answered. I mean, all the reports saying, oh, people have tried to get comments from the palace, but the media office is closed on weekends. What?

And think, ah, well, because she's not wearing a wedding ring, maybe there's problems, you know, over the marriage.Now, it's quite simple. You know, I think that the press office needs to sort of explain what they were doing because they're losing trust. This would never have happened under the Queen. Now, when she was running the firm, she had the policy, never complain, never explain. They just would have had total media blackout and silence.

Now, Sandro, please stay right there, because I also want to get your thoughts on the Oscars. Of course, Hollywood has wrapped up its biggest night celebrating the best achievements in filmmaking in 2023 at the 96th Academy Awards. Awards darling \"Oppenheimer\" dominated the competition, winning seven Oscars out of 30 nominations, including awards for cinematography, original score, best director, best actor in both leading and supporting roles, and the top honor of the night, best picture. Not far behind with the genre defying comedy, \"Poor Things,\" earning Emma Stone her second Oscar for best actress in a leading role. And she was in good company. Here's what the winners of the top acting categories had to say during their acceptance speeches. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CILLIAN MURPHY, ACTOR, \"OPPENHEIMER\": We made a film about the man who created the atomic bomb. And for better or for worse, we're all living in Oppenheimer's world. So I would really like to dedicate this to the peacemakers everywhere. EMMA STONE, ACTOR, \"POOR THINGS\": I am so deeply honored to share this with every cast member, with every crew member, with every single person who poured their love and their care and their brilliance into the making of this film. And Yorgos, thank you for the gift of a lifetime in Bella Baxter. ROBERT DOWNEY JR., ACTOR, \"OPPENHEIMER\": I'd like to thank my terrible childhood and the Academy in that order.

It does not take kindly to any sort of suggestions that put the two sides on an equal footing in any kind of negotiating.

There might be a peace summit coming up in Switzerland. We don't know an exact date for that. But this also plays into the sort of Russian propaganda line as well, which is that Ukraine is getting in the way of any negotiations, that it's Ukraine. And by extension, it's Western allies that are standing in the way of peace. But this has, as we've seen on multiple fronts at the moment, also rallied some European support. The Latvian president coming out and saying one must not capitulate in the face of evil comments of support from the Polish foreign minister.

They're at about one point two million. Now, it's not directly comparable because we know that Russia has always fired orders of magnitude, more artillery shells on the front line than Ukraine, partly because Russian shells were traditionally less accurate than the high quality shells that Ukraine was getting from its Western allies. But it is unnerving given the situation that we're in.
