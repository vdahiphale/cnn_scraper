Of course, all is on the line for both of them, perhaps more for Ron DeSantis who has invested so much time, so much money here in the state. There is no doubt, Nikki Haley is already looking ahead to New Hampshire but it depends how she finishes in Iowa tonight. And, of course, Donald Trump, he's been on the phone all day, I'm told, with some of his precinct caucus captains. They are the people who will be his volunteers essentially at all of the locations trying to make sure their supporters come. So, how this is going to unfold is in 1,657 precincts across Iowa from one corner to the other, in about 730 locations in schools, in libraries, in churches. So, in just a few hours, those Republicans are going to show up, wait in line, and go through the doors at 7:00 in Iowa, 8:00 Eastern Time, and begin giving their preference. But the big question, the big wildcard in this is still the weather. The temperature, for sure but road conditions. In 28 of Iowa's 99 counties, there is just one caucus locations. So, some of these supporters and voters will have to drive for miles over snow-covered, ice covered roads. So, the question is turnout. How many of them are going to turn out? So, that's why the campaigns, right now are trying to work through their list, trying to get their supporters to the polls, offering everything from rides in warm vans, to jumpstart if they need them. But, Erin, this is one true wildcard. For all the precision that goes into planning, the weather here, mother nature, may have her own verdict to say on this as well. You can feel the anticipation.

He has only mildly criticized Donald Trump during this process.But, you know, as to why Trump was doing so well? I talked to an adviser who said if you look at the poll numbers, and this was talked about in \"The New York Times\" today, college educated Republicans have come back to Donald Trump, which is an astonishing development. He really hemorrhaged support in that department after January 6. They went to Ron DeSantis for a little while but now they have come back, and that's a big reason why he is way in front.",

It has changed the minds of some college-educated voters to say, okay, we are going to give Donald Trump a shot because he is being victimized by these corrupt institutions.So, these are voters that he did not have that he has now. One other thing I'd like to say about Donald Trump which is so fascinating to me. Ron DeSantis has gone to every county in the state. Nikki Haley is out there 10 times a day talking to audiences. Donald Trump flies in, gives a speech, does not interact at all with the audience except may be to deliver pizzas or whatever. Doesn't take questions, and flies out. And that's okay for some reason. That is fine. And these are people, like in all the early states who pride themselves on getting to know the candidates. It is clearly a sense that they know Donald Trump, they know who he is. It does not matter. He does not have to play by the other roles. He is worried about his supporters being complacent but he has not been there as much as the other folks and he has not interacted.",

Last night, I was with him at an event just outside of Des Moines, and we really saw him zero in on the former president, on Donald Trump, really going after him. I mean, he only mentioned Nikki Haley once by name but really directly going after the former president. And, look, you said it. Nobody has more on the line here in Iowa than Governor DeSantis. He has put so much time and resources into this state, really hoping that at the end of it, he would emerge as the Trump alternative. We have seen Nikki Haley with that momentum and we are watching the battle likely, likely, no one's voted yet, for second place play out. But it means a lot to the DeSantis campaign if he comes in second. That's one thing. If he comes in third, what does that mean going forward as you move into New Hampshire where Nikki Haley is polling well against the former president? So, those are some of the questions. But as for the mood inside the headquarters, I stopped by earlier today, Wolf. There were people on the phone. He was there doing television interviews.

The question has always been, are there enough Republicans left who would actually nominate sort of pre-Trump era Republican or are we too far past that point? If you look at the national poll, CBS this weekend, Trump's at 69 percent nationally, although we are covering this race tonight and trying to pick it apart, it's sort of hard for me to imagine that a party that has someone sitting at 69 right now would not be that party's nominee when there is nothing new to learn about the guy sitting on top.

It's his party now. So, it's his party now. So, let's use the past, or your three places I'm going to be watching tonight. I'll circle them first and then I'll tell you why.It would come in here and we go out here. So why am I -- why am I picking these places? Well, let's turn this off. Let's go back to 2016. Ted Cruz won Iowa but just barely 28 percent to 24 percent. Let me start out here in the west in Sioux City and Woodbury County. This is one of the places Donald Trump won not by a lot, but by four points over Ted Cruz. One question tonight is in these conservative places, Sioux City, Woodbury County, that's Nebraska, that South Dakota, you're in the western part of the state, conservative country, does Trump build on what he did in 2016? Has he solidified the voters who are for crews are for Rubio last time, how much has he grown? That's a big question for me tonight. Then we come into the middle of the state, look at these counties here. Those are counties won by Marco Rubio, your traditional Republican, your George W. Bush type Republican. He won here. He won in Story County, which is where Ames is, not by a lot, but he won. He won in Polk County. If Nikki Haley's going to surprise us tonight, it's going to come from the Rubio places, the suburbs that have been growing since then. So that's at one place I'll be watching tonight. One last place I want to come over to the eastern part of the state and Scott County. Jim Acosta mentioned this a bit earlier. Can Donald Trump rebuild his shattered support amongst suburbanites? To do that, you have to start with Republicans. Trump, Rubio, won Scott County, Davenport, and the suburbs around it. In 2016, Trump came at a very close second. We know in 2018, 2020.2022, that's where Donald Trump suffered in the suburbs. Do we see any seeds tonight of a comeback for Trump in these critical places? It's another thing to look for.",

His name is John Palmer, and he had committed to a caucusing for DeSantis. He actually went to the debate last week, the CNN debate with Jake and Dana, he personally prayed with DeSantis ahead of that. He now has changed his mind and he says he's going to caucus tonight for Nikki Haley. He says, quote, I believe the competency factor in Governor Haley is stronger and her ability to bring people together. And he continued to say Ron DeSantis is a good man. He simply doesn't excite or inspire him. What do you say to that?

He said that the IDF has been in touch with the families of two of the hostages who were depicted in the video. And he said as well that the IDF was concerned about their welfare at this time.But that's -- that that was the extent of the details that we got from Rear Admiral Hagari on that twin ramming attack in that affluent central Israeli city today. That involved two men, Palestinians from Hebron, about 100 miles away from the side of the attack early afternoon. A twin attacks synchronize. So they both using stolen cars, according to the IDF, drove into groups of people in that city. Many of them was standing the bus stop.
