Quote, \"Echoing the grotesque rhetoric of fascist and violent white supremacists and threatening to oppress those who disagree with the government are dangerous attacks on the dignity and rights of all Americans on our democracy and on public safety. It is the opposite of everything we stand for as Americans.\" This White House statement following that of the campaign just yesterday where they invoked, as you mentioned earlier, Adolf Hitler, Kim Jong un and Vladimir Putin. So making very clear here the campaign stance, the White House stance when it comes to the former president and what he's saying on immigration. And it's not the first time that they have done this. In fact, the president released a statement through his campaign for the first time this month, and he did so to criticize his predecessor's travel ban. That's something that he did in the first days of his presidency years ago. He says, this being former president Donald Trump, that he would go forward with the travel ban again. And so this month, the president took to the campaign to criticize that and condemn those actions. And again, it was the first time the president had done through the campaign. So it just goes to underscore where they stand on this issue. But of course, Fred, what's also clear here is that immigration is a delicate political issue for this White House. And so this is not the last of the attacks that they'll see on this front.",

Because Republicans have said the border must be dealt with first before they'll agree to greenlighting billions of dollars in more aid to Ukraine as well as aid to Israel which is why so much focus is on these talks that are happening in the Senate. There's already blowback, some from the right who are concerned that Republicans are giving away too much, not pushing for enough restrictive policies. And then a growing number of critics on the left worried about Joe Biden giving away too much. Some flatly warning that it could cost him at the ballot box. Why do you think the president is struggling so much with Hispanic voters compared to last time? SEN. ALEX PADILLA (D-CA): I'm not as worried about that yet. I think if he does go too far in the Trump direction when it comes to this, it's going to be felt at the ballot box next year, no doubt about it. SEN.

He has always been approving of Putin right from the beginning of his presidency. That was something that he and I had regular arguments about going all the way back to 2017. The fact is that Vladimir Putin as an expert on democracy, this is a guy who doesn't even know what democracy is and, quite frankly, has spent most of his life trying to undercut democracy all over the world. Donald Trump citing him as his expert witness, that he's being persecuted and is innocent. Look, this is a guy who just believes woe is me, woe is me. I can't believe I got caught. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

In fact, just the opposite. So why is Donald Trump doing this?I would look at two data points. One is this debate we're having over to whether the U.S. taxpayers and Congress should continue funding Ukraine and to what tune. And the other is Donald Trump's election status. Don't forget, even though we're treating this like it's a general election, it is not. He's still competing for his party's nomination, and the first of this contest now less than a month away with the Iowa caucuses. And so I think part of what we're seeing here is Donald Trump trying to motivate the base, a base quite frankly on some level responds much more to (INAUDIBLE) like strength than they do to talking about how great American democracy is, even though they're not being sort of posed (ph) a contest between American democracy and the alternative. So I think what you're seeing here is in part political primary contest, and in part Trump trying to shape the debate on Capitol Hill here by kind of changing the parameters of what's really at stake.",

I mean Trump himself has already painted himself as a wannabe dictator and we already hearing the comments from the White House as such.But has this moment now just helped reshape Biden's re-election campaign? SABRINA SIDDIQUI, WHITE HOUSE REPORTER, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Well, I think that this is absolutely the kind of moment where the Biden campaign is going to try and draw a contrast with former president Trump. And also underscore what they believe is at stake which is this notion that Trump poses a threat to democracy and he would be even more emboldened if he is allowed to return to the White House once again. You know, as we said, this isn't really new from Trump. I mean think about his record as president. He often praised Vladimir Putin and sided with Putin over U.S. intelligence on the question of whether Russia had meddled in the 2016 election. He praised Kim Jong-un and was unusually friendly with the North Korean leader during his time in office. But it wasn't just his affinity for these types of authoritarian leaders. What we also saw here in the U.S. under a Trump presidency was this effort to undermine faith in institutions, attacks on press freedom and a presidency that culminated, I think most significantly, in an effort to overturn the 2020 election. So that is absolutely the kind of contrast that you're going to see the Biden campaign and Democrats put forward. I think the bigger question though is because most Republicans, I mean Chris Christie is an anomaly, most Republicans have declined to distance themselves from Trump or really criticize him outright. So it does reinforce I think what has been normalized or become more mainstream within the Republican Party, you know, how much does it actually weigh in on the minds of independent or persuadable voters? Or does it motivate Democrats to turn out? I think that's really what the Biden campaign is going to hope as they try and draw this contrast more clearly.",

And that's that he makes these incendiary comments. And most Republicans want to look the other way and ignore it, not really have address the elephant in the room.And then you have a small chorus like Chris Christie who is willing to condemn. And I think, you know, the majority not really wanting to more forcefully take on Trump whether it's Nikki Haley or Ron DeSantis, Vivek Ramaswamy. In fact, some of them have actually echoed Trump's rhetoric just to a certain degree. I mean that was back to this idea of what was once on the fringes of the Republican Party in terms of rhetoric or posture on immigration, that has become much more mainstream because of someone like Trump. So you know, it's not just I think enabling. It's actually reshaped the Republican Party in Trump's image. Now, the problem is that Chris Christie as I said is an outlier. And you have not just Christie but Nikki Haley, Ron DeSantis, Vivek Ramaswamy and all these other non- Trump candidates effectively splitting the non-Trump vote. So if there's going to be any real concerted effort to stop Trump from once again getting the Republican nomination, especially when you look at the kind of commanding lead that he has over the field, then what's going to be necessary is for these non-Trump candidates to coalesce around one clear alternative. And we just don't see signs of that happening. And I think, if anything, there's still this, you know, idea that if Trump locks up the nomination, most of these Republicans are willing to support him. So I think, you know, we've seen in two previous elections what we're seeing unfold once again right now, that this is absolutely Donald Trump's Republican Party. And it's just not clear that there's, you know, many more Chris Christies who is willing to stop that from being the case.",
