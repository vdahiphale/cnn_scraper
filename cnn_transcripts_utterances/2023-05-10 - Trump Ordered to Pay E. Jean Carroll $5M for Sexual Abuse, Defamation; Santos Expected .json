You're seeing scenes like this of people sleeping on the streets. And those that we've spoken to here say that this started in the last week. City officials I've spoken to are really worried that this number could increase. So that's why they say they're working with buses, airlines, as well as federal agencies to try to get migrants onto their next destination. They're also working with NGOs to try to create space for these migrants. But look, these NGOs, they're overwhelmed here. They're at capacity, taking in about 700 migrants per day. And just really quickly here, I've been speaking to a lot of these nationals, Venezuelan nationals who are coming across here in recent days. And I ask them if they're aware of Title 42 ending. Some of them are. Most of them aren't. But those that were don't really understand what it means. They think that Title 42 ending means that the border is going to shut down entirely. So one Venezuelan national I spoke to yesterday told me that he rushed to get here, thinking that the border would be closed. He says many others followed in suit -- Phil.",
