OUTFRONT tonight, Trump lashing out, slamming the Department of Justice after Attorney General Merrick Garland announced he's appointing a special counsel to oversee two federal investigations involving former President Trump. Now, Trump is saying that he will make a public statement tonight. And earlier, he told FOX News in part, quote, I hope the Republicans have the courage to fight this. I'm not going to partake in it. I'm not going to partake in this. He doesn't have much say in the matter, but this comes after Garland said this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They appointed Jack Smith because you have these two investigations that are ongoing. And by the way, now we know certainly from the announcement that the attorney general made today that at least with regard to the January 6th investigation, the effort to impede the transfer of power, Donald Trump is at the center of that. We've known obviously that he was being investigated for the mishandling or the alleged mishandling of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago. Now, Smith is going to be taking over an investigation that's already well under way. We don't know whether this means charges are very near, but one thing he did say in a statement, he said that the pace of investigations will not pause or flag under my watch.

That anger has just continued.Now, if this statement is anything like what we saw in that Fox digital interview, it will be a lot of ranting, talking about how this is political. Talking about how he is the victim. And when it comes to that statement, there were members of his inner circle and more than one who I called and they were asking me what I was talking about when they learned about this statement that he was making. Many of his advisors do not believe this is a good idea. One person familiar with the thinking said this is more likely to be a rant than any kind of actual statement. One thing to really pay attention to here is that this is not entirely shocking to Trump or his team. Both his legal team and his campaign were prepared for this to possibly happen, for the prospect of a special counsel. He was warned by advisors that he would not be protected even though he was announcing a 2024 presidential bid. So, this was not completely out of left field.

You know, nothing frustrates me more when I see my peers on a news program or in social media just yelling and complaining and negative and all of this. Part of the job of leadership is not all rainbows and unicorns, but you got to bring something to the table to hopefully inspire the next generation, inspire the independent voter, inspire that individual that has been marginalized to be part of something that is frankly bigger than ourselves. This is -- when I'm governor, this isn't about me, right? It's so much bigger than me. So we have to bring that attitude to the table and be engaging and be accessible.

If you look at the list of participants and see some people in the clip that we've been showing, it's the foreign minister. It's the head of foreign intelligence. It's the defense minister, as well. So, a pretty big meeting designed to show Vladimir Putin holds the reigns of Russia security apparatus in the face of Russia's war in Ukraine. There had been questions about that especially after Vladimir Putin stayed largely silent after Russia with drew from Kherson, from the Kherson region. You recall it was the defense minister talking and the general in charge talking but Putin pretty much going to a different event. Not even being associated with that military loss that the Russians suffered there. So, now, it seems like the Russians believe that enough time has passed that Vladimir Putin needs to show he's in control of that once again and the Russians also believe that they have some momentum going on on the battle field, as well and it's a bit awkward because the thing they're really putting out there is the fact that the Russians are hitting Ukraine's key infrastructure. One of the things that we heard from the military is they once again said they hit some Ukrainian command infrastructure, but also fuel and energy infrastructure. The Russians also putting that out there, on Kremlin controlled media as well, by the way. Where after course, we know from the Ukrainians it's actually a lot of civilians being killed and hurt in those attacks that are taking place by the Russians. One other thing we picked up on today, Erin, I thought was important is that the Kremlin spokesperson said about a possible dialogue with the West as a possible bridge towards talks between Ukraine and Russia, as well.

It's protection grade is four plus at best and no one is even testing whether it's bulletproof or not. RUSSIAN SOLDIER (through translator):  They did. RUSSIAN SOLDIER (through translator):  They did. RUSSIAN SOLDIER (through translator):  They did? How did that go? RUSSIAN SOLDIER (through translator):  The bullet pierced it.
