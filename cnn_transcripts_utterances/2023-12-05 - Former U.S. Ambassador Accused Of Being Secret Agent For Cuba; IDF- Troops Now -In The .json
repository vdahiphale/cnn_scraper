Now, this morning, we're learning more about 70 -- what 73-year-old man Manuel Rocha allegedly told federal agents in the undercover sting that exposed him. Rocha was U.S. Ambassador to Bolivia in the early 2000s. And now, is accused of betraying the United States for decades. Here's Attorney General Merrick Garland in announcing the charges yesterday.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MERRICK GARLAND, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: This action exposes one of the highest-reaching and longest-lasting infiltrations of the U.S. government by a foreign agent. Specifically, the criminal complaint alleges that for over 40 years, Rocha acted as a covert agent of the Cuban government. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I mean when you hear the Attorney General there, kind of laying out how far this went, how long this went on, about how much damage could Rocha have done? ROBERT \"BOB\" BAER, FORMER CIA OFFICER: Well, exactly, Kate, it's not about a time he spied for the Cubans. It's where that information went, which was no doubt to Russia. Eventually, the Cubans have a very close relationship with the KGB. But more than that was the access this man had and that the White House or Southern Command the Pentagon, he probably saw about every intercept capability we have. And this is not to mention all the backchannels he knew about between the White House and various governments around the world. He was in a position to help the Russians and the Cubans defeat us in South America, and in other parts of the world. This is a spy disaster, which we haven't seen in modern times. I mean, this is much worse than Hanssen, the FBI agent, or Ames, the CIA agent.",

And if he comes up with a confession, he'll describe why he passed the Cubans. And only then will they know.I assume the worst is that he simply copied documents from -- that came across his desk, which is absolutely devastating. It's -- you know, as an ambassador, he saw intelligence that most foreign service officers and CIA people don't see. This is why it's so disastrous. We're going to be looking at the damage of this for years and years.",

According to a recording of a meeting cited in the court documents surrounding all this, this is what he allegedly said. I always told myself, the only thing that can put everything we have done in danger is someone's betrayal, someone who may have met me, someone who may have known something at some point.That's allegedly what Rocha told undercover agents. DOJ says that they were first operating on a tip that led them to him. Add this all up. What do you think it -- what does it indicate to you?",

We've also seen satellite images from Southern Gaza that appear to show Israeli tank and armored vehicle formations. I can push in to show you what one looks like right there. There are at least three setups like this in -- sorry. In this one satellite image here, you can see them situated right here, right here, and right here.All right, with me now is CNN military analyst, retired Air Force Colonel Cedric Leighton. Let's talk about Khan Younis. Israeli troops said to be in this very populous southern Gaza City, Cedric. What is it do you think they're doing right now? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes. So, good morning, John. The biggest thing that they're doing is rooting out as many of the Hamas fighters that they can. I -- the -- Khan Younis is seen as one of the big strongholds of Hamas. And they're going door to door, house to house, building to building, and rooting them out. They're using a lot of different elements of their power, including those tanks that you just showed in those satellite images. So, the tanks are moving forward. They're basically kind of a protective measure for them. But they're also using air as well as naval forces in order to actually achieve some of the goals that they have, which basically break down to capturing as many terrorists or killing as many of them as possible. So, that's basically what they're doing. They're still bent on destroying Hamas in a -- in an operational sense. And Khan Younis is the basic next target for them. And like you said, they're already in there.",

At least in the beginning part of the Israeli invasion into Gaza, they were told to move south. And then on December 2, they were told to move out of this area in southern Gaza. And then just on December 3 and 4, they were told to move out of Khan Younis, that area in red, right there.Can you conduct war like this? Is this something that is possible where Israel can tell people to move from this sector one day to another sector one day, and then again and again and again? Is that sustainable?",

One of the problems though, that you have, John, is the fact that the communication systems are at best somewhat haphazard in Gaza right now. And in many cases, the internet is down. So, one of the things the Israelis did was issue this map with about 2000 or so different districts on it, that had digital codes associated with them.And that was supposed to be the basis for the Israelis to send out information, telling people to either leave certain areas or go to certain areas. I'm not sure that that specific aspect has been successful. But the basic idea is that the Israelis are moving in a dynamic fashion throughout all of Gaza. And so, the civilian population is basically subjected to all of these different moves. In essence, what we're seeing is the movement of their military forces from north to south. And that then means the areas that were once set aside in kind of a haphazard way for civilian refugees, those areas are now combat zones or rapidly becoming combat zones.",
