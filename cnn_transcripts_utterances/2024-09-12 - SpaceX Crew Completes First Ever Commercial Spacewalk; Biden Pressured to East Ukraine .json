Powerful words from billionaire CEO Jared Isaacman, the first private citizen ever to perform aspacewalk, describing his view from 700 kilometers above the Earth. Isaacman, who helped finance the groundbreaking SpaceX mission, and a second crew member, Sarah Gillis, exited their Crew Dragon spacecraft for about 20 minutes earlier today. Two other crew members stayed inside, though they were exposed to the vacuum of space the entire time since the capsule does not have an airlock. Well, this historic spacewalk was meant to test the capabilities of SpaceX's newly designed spacesuits. CNN's space and defense correspondent Kristin Fisher covering the very latest for us on what was this groundbreaking mission. And we have seen spacewalks in the past, financed by governments. NASA has been doing them for decades. Why is this one so important? KRISTIN FISHER, CNN SPACE &amp; DEFENSE CORRESPONDENT:  Because it's the first one that's ever been conducted by private, nonprofessional astronauts outside of a spacecraft designed by a private company and also wearing brand-new spacesuits that were also designed and manufactured by a private company. As you said, Becky, this is all part of a movement that's been happening for a few decades now, the privatization of space flight and then ultimately the democratization of spaceflight so that spaceflight is no longer something that is just the privy of an elite few government astronauts or an elite few powerful nations. You know, when you're, when you're making history, Becky, you want to have some words to meet the moment, right? I mean, Neil Armstrong had, \"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.\" But what did Jared Isaacman decide to say when he became one of the very first people, first commercial spacewalkers in history? Here's what he said. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)",

And, Jared, the commander of the mission, also the person who financed the mission, one of two spacewalkers there, Becky. The other one was Sarah Gillis. She is a SpaceX employee. She became, along with her fellow Polaris Dawn crew member, Anna Menon, the first SpaceX employees to ever fly in space on a spacecraft, SpaceX vehicle. And the reason Sarah Gillis flying in space is so important, Becky, is because she is SpaceX's lead astronaut trainer. So she trains all of the NASA astronauts, all of the private astronauts that fly on a SpaceX Crew Dragon. And so the commander, Jared Isaacman, said, as he was picking this crew, it makes perfect sense. Like of all the people, the person who trains the astronauts should have that firsthand experience of flying in space. And so that's what she did there. Becky.",

They're also going to be testing out some space-to-space Starlink communication using lasers in space, a new way for the Starlink internet terminals to communicate in orbit. And then they also have a surprise, Becky, that they're not ready to make public but I have a hint about what it may be. And if it is what I think it is, it's going to be pretty cool.

In a single incident, six UNRWA workers were among 18 people killed when Israel's military hit a now closed School on Wednesday.

The U.N. of course, is at various levels outraged and that's being framed in diplomatic terms. The U.N. Secretary General has tweeted that these violations of international law must stop. Philip Lazzarini, the head of UNWRA for Gaza and the surrounding area, has said very clearly as well that, if there is a continuation of these blatant and unabated strikes on U.N. premises and workers. If they can -- if they are allowed to continue, they will essentially erode the Geneva Conventions and the international rules of law. It is very, very strong language coming from the U.N. There is frustration and desperation coming from those residents in Gaza, who use these schools and these premises. And there were 12,000 of these people inside the school when it was hit. Frustration for their part about where they can go to be safe. This is what they're saying. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  Most people sought refuge in schools but the schools were bombed and the majority of the martyrs were children and women. Where can the people go? They fled to the Mawasi area, which was also bombed, and then to the schools, which were targeted as well. What are we supposed to do? Where can we go?

CNN Politics senior reporter Stephen Collinson back with us today. Good to have you, sir. On the potential for Trump agreeing to a second debate, because that is out there, you say, one, on the one hand, he may have little incentive to show up again, given that he was widely seen to have suffered a drubbing on Tuesday.

You've seen how she's created revenues, for example, for the NFL since she started showing up to games to watch her boyfriend, Travis Kelce. She has put fractions of a percent of growth on the GDP of certain countries when she goes to do a concert. I think -- will she be an active participant in this campaign? Is she going to do more to get young voters to register and vote for Harris? I think that is the question that the Democrats have been falling back a bit on their registration among younger voters. Those voters are very difficult to get to the polls. If they could somehow accelerate that, it could have a tangible impact. College students could be very important in places like Wisconsin where a race could be decided by 10,000 votes. On that issue, I think also Democrats are really worried that there could be a resurgence of those campus protests by pro-Palestinian demonstrators. So the college issue this year is actually a very interesting one to watch, not just with regard to Swift but also those campus protests.",

Normally what they would do is assign one helicopter, one fixed wing aircraft to a blaze. They can't do that. They're flying them around these different fires because there's just not enough to go around to drop fire retardant, to drop water. And just to show you how quickly things have moved, this fire started on Sunday afternoon where I'm standing here in the San Gabriel Mountains. This fire started, it was about 4,000 acres; within a 24 hour period it exploded to 30,000 acres. And right now, they're saying that it's burned through close to 50,000 acres. I talked to one fire official, who told me this area where I'm standing now, as you can see, there's no more vegetation here right now. He says, this was basically an inferno. Everything was here was here was on fire, even the power lines, the poles that hold them up are also burned through.
