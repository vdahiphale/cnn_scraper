We begin on the presidential campaign trail now, just about a month away from the election and both campaigns meeting with voters and key battleground states during this final critical stretch of the race voting already underway across several states and poll show. Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump locked in a dead heat. Their campaigns now navigating several big news stories that could shape the outcome of this election from the war in the Middle East to the devastating aftermath of Helene and a surprising jobs report more on all of that coming up. But today, the former president is returning to the scene of his first assassination attempt in battleground Pennsylvania. Trump is set to hold a rally in just a few hours from now in Butler. That's in the Western part of the state. He narrowly survived an attempt on his life, as you recall, on July 13th at that location the exact one, as a matter of fact, when a gunman opened fire and a bullet grazed his ear. One attendee at the rally died, two others were injured. And CNN's Alayna Treene joins us now live from Butler, Pennsylvania. Alayna, I know you were there that day. You went through all of that. And you're learning more about some of the security precautions for today's event and how things are going to be a little different this time around.",

      "sentences": "That's exactly right, Jim. I can say that the security apparatus around this particular rally is very different from what they had back in July during that first assassination attempt. One change is that Donald Trump is going to be surrounded by bulletproof glass while he is on that stage behind me. I've seen just far more snipers on all of the roofs around this era than there were back in July.One thing we know that the shots when we were here last time the shots came from this direction. The AGR buildings where the Thomas Crooks, the attempted assassin was on the roof where he fired those gunshots. That view to those buildings is completely blocked off. They have placed trailers there in that line of sight. There's far more secret service and law enforcement on the ground. But I also just spoke with a U.S. Secret Service communications director who confirmed that to me. Another thing, local law enforcement and Secret Service are going to be operating in one command center today. That's a big difference from last time. Yes, last time they argued that they weren't communicating well, they weren't speaking on the radio as they were supposed to be. So they fixed that as well today. And then also they have a better counter drone system in place. So again, much more high-end security. Now as for how the rally will be different, look, when I talked to Trump's campaign leading up to this, they said that this won't be a traditional political rally, though I'm sure you're going to hear a lot of that campaign rhetoric that we have become accustomed to. Instead they really are trying to focus on this community and particularly the victims who were affected by those gunshots, especially the man who died, Corey Comperatore. His family is going to be here today. Donald trump is going to be sitting here to them about them as well as some of the other victims who were shot. So, a pretty heavy day here. But I will say just the vibe from the crowd right now, people are excited to be here and they're ready to kind of try to change the narrative around what had happened in Butler and make this more of something that they feel is, what one person, what one woman told me, is redemption.",

Here in the center of Israel, it's only a thousand people that are allowed to gather outside because it's just deemed too dangerous. Now that's only come into effect since the tensions really ratcheted up with both Hezbollah and with Iran, but really with Iran.And we've just heard from the organizers of one of the big memorial commemorations here in Tel Aviv on Monday evening for October the 7th, and they're saying, look to all those of you general public who bought tickets, who signed up for tickets to come to this event, we're really sorry that we're going to have to ask you to stay away. So, you know, the tensions about when Israel might respond and when Iran might respond to that or if they would respond are really having that knock on effect.

They admitted to doing so, doing it in that mansion in Beverly Hills back in 1989. The question is, should they be serving a life sentence? And their attorney does not think so, which is why he has been pushing for this sentence and this conviction to be vacated and also pushing for review who of this evidence, he says, because the evidence proves the sexual abuse allegations. And this all especially after so much interest in this case thanks to social media, thanks to documentaries, thanks to that Netflix docu- drama. A lot of people talking about this case and also talking about the sexual abuse allegations in this case. Because that is the central argument of the defense. They say that these two brothers killed their father because he was sexually abusing them. So part of the new evidence that the defense team is putting forward, they say proves that sexual abuse. One of the things is a letter that they say they have written by Erik to a cousin and they say this letter details that sexual abuse before the murder. The other thing that they're reviewing is an allegation from a member of the boyband, Menudo. And he says he, too, was sexually abused by these -- by the brothers' father, Jose Menendez. And so that's why the district attorney now says, yes, he will review these. He has not made a decision. And remember, George Gascon is currently running for reelection here in Los Angeles. So this is in the midst of all of this.

And, you know, I have increasingly became concerned that it was critical that we review the new evidence that has been presented, as well as evidenced that have been suppressed during the second trial. This is a case of hung the first time around when the jury was given information about sexual molestation. And then the prosecution, in the second time around, suppressed much of that evidence.

We have a photocopy of a letter that allegedly one of the brothers sent would cause him talking about molestation. We have the evidence that came out a couple of years ago about the Menudo band member talking about his molestation.You know, we have done about 300 re-sentencing cases since I've been in office and only four have re-offended. And the reason that I attribute to that is we're very careful about looking at all the circumstances in the case. The reason why we have become more public is because, after the documentary, we began to get, you know, many, many requests from media and others about where was the case? The case is actually schedule for a hearing on November 29th, and but for the documentary, quite frankly, we would probably not be talking about this point. We may be talking later. But that certainly has increased the impatience by the public and that's why we're being public about where we are.",

We also -- I think, it has been clearly established that both men and women can be sexually assault or boys and girls. I think 35 years ago, cultural norms where a little different. So I do agree with you and Camila kind of raised that issue. But there's no question that a jury today would look at this case probably very differently than a jury did 35 years ago. But even 35 years ago, when some of this evidence was presented, there was certainly doubt as to their -- whether they were guilty of first- degree murder, right? Again, there's no question that they committed the killing. The question is, to what degree of culpability should they be held accountable to, given the totality of the circumstances.",

Helene is already the second-deadliest hurricane to strike the U.S. mainland in the past 50 years following Hurricane Katrina, which killed more than 1,800 people in 2205. Earlier, we heard from Buncombe County officials in North Carolina, one of the hardest-hit areas in the southeast, and also where Asheville is located. They said that more than 74,000 customers remain without power and as many people remain without running water. They're also urging the population to re-use water as much as they can, even when there are several flood and water -- I should sort of food and water distribution centers.

We are now facing the prospect of potentially having it be a man occupy that role in Doug Emhoff.And so it caused us to take a deeper look at what this role actually is. I think it often gets overlooked. Understandably, people are often more focused on the West Wing than they are the East Wing, as you know, as a former White House correspondent. But it's often a very influential role, certainly on the president of the United States. Countless leaders before have talked about how they depended on their spouse when making big decisions. But this roll, in and of itself, it's almost one of those, damned if you do, damned if you don't. It's ill-defined. There's no job description. It's unpaid. And the person is unelected. They are basically put in that office by a result of their spouse being elected. And so we took a deeper look at Melania's time as first lady. What that could look like if she returns to the White House. And of course, we dug into what was happening during one of those most memorable moments, obviously, of her husband's presidency, which was January 6, 2021. And I spoke to Kate Bennett, CNN's former White House correspondent, who has written a book on Melania Trump about what it was exactly that the former first lady was doing on that day?

Some experts on her don't think that she actually ultimately will. We also take a look at Doug Emhoff, given he would be the first man to ever occupy that role. What that would look like, not just in terms of, in this Smithsonian exhibit, they have all of the inaugural gowns that former first ladies wore the day of their husbands inauguration. What does it look like if it's Doug Emhoff in his tux in there? But also what does that role looked like? How does he define it? We've seen he's had some experience as second gentleman in this position fighting anti-Semitism, certainly out there campaigning on behalf of his wife.
