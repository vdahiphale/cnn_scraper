Chances are you know someone who's been affected by this disease. It's the most common neuro-degenerative condition in the world. For decades, researchers have tried and failed to come up with a way to effectively treat Alzheimer's, leaving patients and families with few options. But there are some new signs of hope. Groundbreaking research shows in some cases Alzheimer's can be slowed, prevented, and even reversed in some people. And it doesn't mean using expensive or experimental drugs. CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta has spent the last five years investigating and documenting how to fight Alzheimer's. And in this next hour, he'll show us a new way to battle this disease. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CICI ZERBE, ALZHEIMER'S PATIENT: I could use a strong cup of coffee. DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This is Cici Zerbe and her husband John back in 2019. C. ZERBE: Will you come say Grandma?",
