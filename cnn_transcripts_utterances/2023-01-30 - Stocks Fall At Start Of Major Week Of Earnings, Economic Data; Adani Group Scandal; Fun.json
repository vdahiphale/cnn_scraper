Remember, the notion that inflation could be transitory. Now, simply because we benefited from a warmer winter in Europe, people got carried away. We have growth headwinds, and we have the likelihood of sticky inflation. I think is going to be a bumpy journey. The big question is, will it be a better destination?

You pointed out, the Fed had one of its biggest year of rate increases, it could have spread that out over two years, it wouldn't have had to go as far. But they started late.

The suspected attack targeting a police compound in Pakistan's northwestern City of Peshawar. The victims likely mostly law enforcement, caught off guard in a place of worship. HAJI SHAHHAWAZ, EYEWITNESS (through translator):   We took out the injured and sent them to hospital. The dead bodies should all be inside the mosque, buried under the rubble. WATSON (voice over):   Dozens are confirmed dead, Pakistani Police say with more than 150 injured. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned what he is calling a suicide blasts saying: \"The brutal killing of Muslims prostrating before Allah is against the teachings of the Quran. Terrorists want to create fear by targeting those who perform the duty of defending Pakistan.\" The Pakistani Taliban known as Tehrik-e Taliban or TTP has claimed responsibility for the blast, calling it revenge for a targeted IED attack against one of the group's founding members last August. CNN cannot independently verify the group's claims. For years, Islamist militant groups including the TTP, which is a US- designated terrorist organization have periodically carried out attacks in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province, where Peshawar is located. But Monday's blast was the worst the city has seen since March of last year, when a suicide bombing that ISIS later claimed responsibility for killed at least 61 at a Shiite mosque during Friday prayers. Leaders of Pakistan's rival political parties condemned the latest mosque bombing, a country with a long history of deadly political violence, now bracing for the threat of more possible suicide attacks.

First of all, he appointed Suella Braverman as the Home Secretary a week after she was sacked for a security breach.

There are so many social media platforms out there that many young kids and teens are on all day all night long. It's not just TikTok, TikTok is obviously the most popular, so they're going to really, you know, get hit pretty hard. But this is definitely I think, a phenomenon that goes beyond TikTok.",

You would have to think that there would be a big uproar even if you tried telling some of these people well, we're doing this for your own good because the Chinese government might be compromising your data. I don't -- I think a lot of social media stars might not care all that much.
