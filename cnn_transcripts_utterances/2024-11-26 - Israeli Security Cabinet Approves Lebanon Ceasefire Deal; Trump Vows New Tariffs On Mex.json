In just the last two hours, the Israeli security cabinet voted to approve what is a U.S.-backed proposal which aims to stop the fighting for 60 days. The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the nation, explaining its decision after following the vote. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator):  So why doing ceasefire now? There are three main reasons. First, focusing on the Iranian threat and I will not expand on that. Two, refreshing the military forces and our equipment. The third reason for ceasefire detaching the front of the war from Hamas.

A senior Hezbollah official tells \"Reuters\" that group will remain active after the war ends. By helping the many who were displaced return home and rebuild.

      "sentences": "Well, I think President Biden would chalk this up to one word, and that is diplomacy.U.S. officials have been working for months in trying to secure this ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. There have been many fits and starts in the process. You'll remember back in September that the U.S. and allies had announced that they were supportive of a 21-day cease fire, something that they had really viewed as a potential breakthrough in this fighting in Lebanon, only to have Israel pour cold water on that proposal. But still, in recent weeks, you have seen a senior White House officials really led by Amos Hochstein shuttling between the U.S. and Israel and Beirut trying to get this type of deal across the finish line. Of course, he's been communicating with Israeli counterparts and then working through Lebanese officials, which acted as the mediator towards Hezbollah. But for President Biden, this ceasefire that's expected to be announced between Israel and Hezbollah really helps him try to show that he's achieving one of the aims of his foreign policy agenda, and that is trying to bring the fighting to a close in at least one front of this war in the Middle East. Of course, this has dogged President Biden for the better part of the last year, as he has tried to get some type of agreement between Israel and Hamas, then also looking towards this agreement with Israel and Hezbollah across the finish line. It's also interesting when you take into consideration that former -- President-elect Donald Trump will be coming into the White House in just less than two months. The ceasefire is expected to last for 60 days, with the hopes that there would then be a movement towards a permanent ceasefire. But our understanding is that Trump team had indicated to U.S. and Israeli officials that they weren't going to try to upend these negotiations. It's clear that this is not something that Trump himself also wanted to have to address in his second term, come January. So it's been interesting to see what those conversations have been like between the Trump side and the current administration. But for President Biden, he is likely to talk about how this is just another sign of American diplomacy in action. Of course, there is still that push to try to get some type of a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas that really right now there's been such little traction on, but something that Biden still wants to try to see done, though it could be unlikely before he leaves office.",

So be it the Houthis in Yemen, the various Iranian sponsored militias in Syria and Iraq, and then Hezbollah, the crown jewel of Iran. And the first line of defense for the regime, should it come under attack from Israel in Lebanon.And so Hezbollah now has been diminished enough, demoralized enough particularly the will to fight amongst the Lebanese population, which really did not want to be dragged into this war from the first place that I do not, I do not see that Hezbollah will in fact, rejoin this fight on behalf of Hamas.

Iran is very vulnerable right now, and then again, Hezbollah being the first and most formidable line of defense, that proxy group sitting right there on Israel's northern border to defend the regime should it come under attack, that is also down right now and on its back foot.So there are many who are looking around and saying, you know what, in the coming months, if Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu really wanted to take it to Iran's nuclear program -- well, he's got an open window right now, and there's a good chance that he might act. Or at a very minimum, he's going to want to try and keep Hezbollah down, keep Iranian defenses down to extend that period of time in which he can act against its nuclear program. Of course, there's a role for diplomacy, but we'll have to see if there will be backroom diplomacy here when the Trump administration comes in.",

There are isolationists and then there are hawks -- foreign policy hawks who are very, very anti-Iranian and very much would like to see Iran being dealt a blow. And President Trump and his style likes to listen to both these camps and then make the decision on his own.And so, I really do think that we saw Elon Musk meet with the Iranian ambassador to the United Nations not too long ago. I really do think that the Trump administration is going to go at diplomacy with Iran. They're going to give him an opportunity to come in to try and iron out some kind of new arrangement for a new -- a much more diminished Iran in the region. But that fail if that fails, I do think that the hawks will get the upper hand. And there would be an argument for doing something, or at least allowing the Israelis to do something.",

But there certainly could be an envoy. Brian Hook, for example, is somebody who might come back into the new Trump administration. He was the previous envoy for Iran with the first Trump presidency. So there are capable figures. It is, you know, it's beyond me why Elon Musk was the person to meet with that Iranian ambassador.

      "sentences": "We know the president-elect likes to use tariffs as a weapon. It's who are they weaponized against. And that's what it comes down to, Jim. And what you're alluding to, I think, is that ultimately the consumer pays the price the way that tariffs work, the tariff is paid by an American business on a good that it imports from somewhere else, in this case China, Mexico or Canada. They then have to somehow offset that cost. They then try and not -- but they end up doing passing on those costs to the consumer.So that's how it works. And we've seen this work all the way along. Now, businesses do try and substitute -- perhaps change their supply chains, perhaps manufacture in the United States. But that takes time. So I think the automatic assumption you can make when anyone's talking about tariffs is that there will be some kind of tit for tat, three out of four times when you're in an active tariff, another country does the same thing or similar, and you see prices go up. So this is not good news if he decides to do it. China I think to be expected, most analysts out there were saying, look, the first thing that president-elect is going to do when he comes in, ultimately is going to hit China with more tariffs. Canada, Mexico, a little bit different. Let me show you what our key imports from these nations are, just to give you a sense of where we might see prices rise. For Canada, some of the big oil imports, the biggest one, of course, would be energy oil imports that we import from Canada. So you have to expect perhaps we would see prices rising there. The United States can't replace that if they tariff and raise prices on Canada oil in any way or shape or form in the short term, minerals, cement, wood paper goods. Mexico is another one car, car parts is a great example, agricultural products as well. And if you look at some of the big U.S. automakers and actually the Mexican president, Jim, has said this today, some of the biggest American carmakers import manufacture in the united -- in Mexico and import into the United States. Their share prices are down because they know its going to be bad for them, and bad for American consumers. And the final one with Mexico, grocery prices, we import lots of groceries from Mexico, Jim. So the one thing that people said going into this presidential election that had hurt them was food price inflation, he's risking higher prices on groceries, not a great idea.",

These guys represent Nike, Crocs, Under Armour, Walmart. And their statements are very clear: Look, we hope President-elect Trump rethinks these tariffs as they relate to footwear.

So there's a pretty good legal argument that the statute has been told, and that statute of limitations would not be an impediment. But that's an open question.

And therefore, because of these countervailing interests, the need for accountability versus the desire to ensure that the executive can go about his business without impediment, it does, in effect, place him for some period of time above the law. Not -- maybe not forever. Maybe there's a scenario by which he could have been charged before. He could be charged again. That remains to be seen.

And also, President-elect Donald Trump had indicated that he didn't want there to be wars here in the region. So I think some of it is that. The prime minister also said that part of this had to do with the fact that he wanted to give troops a chance to recuperate and restock the military hardware and he said as well that that Hezbollah are delinked from its war with Hamas in Gaza. They'd always said all along that each strike was in support of those in Gaza, although there was an indication that it was subsequently learned about that Hassan Nasrallah before Israel began upping the -- upping the strikes against Hezbollah in the middle of September, that Hezbollah had actually agreed to that. Hassan Nasrallah had said they were prepared to de- link, that's come to light subsequently. So it does seem to give put the prime minister in a better place with an incoming administration. And I would just point to what the defense minister said yesterday about the occupied West Bank.

The numbers are so intense that statistically if we've degraded them 70 percent, 80 percent, and that sounds like a lot. That 20 percent that they still have left is twice as much of what Hamas had before they started the war of October 7th, 2023.And I say that because, as mentioned before President Biden was talking is that Iran, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, continue to arm Hezbollah, sending the weapons pretty much have an open route. So that the big issue here is that they won't be able to rearm. But the achievements are significant it was notable in Netanyahu's comments that he said part -- in part to explain this deal, that more advanced weaponry -- weaponry is coming. It seemed to be a reference to the incoming U.S. administration that might not put or put fewer restrictions. Let's be frank, because, of course, there's been a lot of criticism in this country of the Biden administration for not putting restrictions on some of the weapons shipments. But is it your impression that President-elect Trump will give Netanyahu even more leeway to go after well, not just Hezbollah and Lebanon but Hamas and Gaza and perhaps even Iranian targets. Contrary to what you just asked, Jim, I don't feel here that the United States administration, this one, President Biden, has really put, you know, the possibilities that we won't be able to fight this war. As President Biden stated before and as I was listening to him, I wanted to nod the whole time. Essentially, I heard different things than what you heard. But he -- they did send in, they did help out. They helped out at that first stage when it wasn't clear, both Hamas and Hezbollah.",
