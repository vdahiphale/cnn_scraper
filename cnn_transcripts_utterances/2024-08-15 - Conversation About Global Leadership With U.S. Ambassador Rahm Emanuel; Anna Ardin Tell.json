It is yet another dark marker in this war, and with more than 100 Israeli hostages, still not returned to their families, the focus is firmly on high-level talks in Doha today. Without a ceasefire, hostage deal, America's global leadership is being solely tested. And in this presidential election year, the stakes are extremely high, with war in Ukraine and strengthening relations between Russia and China, presenting major challenges ahead. To get a feel for what's waiting out there for the next American president, we checked in with Ambassador Rahm Emanuel, the Biden administration's envoy to Japan, at the heart of the vital Asia-Pacific Alliance. He's a former congressman, White House Chief of Staff, and Mayor of Chicago, and I spoke with him from Tokyo today. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

They went from one percent to two percent of defense spending on GDP. They acquired 400-plus counterstrike capabilities. They lifted the export restrictions on defense equipment to countries that are not in conflict. They opened up a trilateral relationship with Korea that's been now normalized to a level that is not even news anymore. And fifth, they rewrote their national security documents, and our documents are so parallel in complementary to each other. They help facilitate a cooperation, a collaboration that the United States and Japan have not seen in 60 years. So the change has been momentous. And most importantly, the United States and Japan that for years were focused on what I call alliance protection. Now, as true partners, is focused on alliance projection into the region. And it is the stability of the United States and Japan's relationship that has brought stability to this region.",

Those were the early days when we were beginning to just scratch out this lattice work architecture. There hadn't been yet a trilateral with Korea. There hadn't yet been even the concept of the trilateral of the Philippines. So she has put what I would call sweat equity into something right now that's standing the test of time. Just two weeks ago, Canada, the United States, Australia, the Philippines did a naval exercise in the islands. That is coalition building, China isolated, Philippines standing with allies, Canada, Australia, and the United States. And she was an early, literally shaper of that clay, shaper of the strategy, and came in and traveled her many times and put the miles. You've got to keep investing in it and strengthening it.

But I will just say, when you look at this region, President Biden has accomplished a great deal. In this region, the United States is not going to be able to achieve anything without our allies. They are a force multiplier for the United States. You cannot do anything in the region as a deterrent to China without allies. Impossible. This is an away game for us. And so here in Japan, they have significantly increased their defense budget. That's the same of Korea that has made significant investments. So I, again, President Trump 2.0 can say what he wants, but I just know from a strategic game plan that the isolated party in the region is China. Making your allies feel more insecure makes our position all that more vulnerable. And that's all I'll say. You can draw whatever conclusion you want from that.",

And I'll give you a classic example. I mean, China today constantly is engaged in economic espionage. Now the system that China doesn't like is a system based on rules and laws. They want one where economic coercion is the norm. They want one where you can engage in economic espionage, intellectual property theft.

I think, you know, in the United States, through Democratic Republic administrations, we're telling NATO-based countries the consequences of what Russia was doing. Russia finally proved what we've been saying for decades, true. I do think that the threat to Ukraine, if something were to happen to Ukraine, President Putin would not stop. He would not stop in Georgia. He would not stop at Moldova. He would not stop. Now, we are not exactly pure on that as a country. We've had our own violations, and so we're not -- we're kind of have a glass house that we live in. That said, Ukraine's sovereignty, Ukraine's independence, Ukraine's desire to be as a people repeatedly have gone to the streets to be part of the West. They're aspirations to be part of something, the economic opportunity, the freedom that the -- that the West offers as a political principle is something that people have sacrificed, not only on the military battles, but also on the political battles. They see a future that's more promising to the West. They've also seen, when Poland joined the West, how much economic prosperity has happened to Poland as opposed to what's happened to Ukraine. They want to be a part of that, and that's worth defending. We have defended that repeatedly in our history. It would be walking away from our own history not to stand by a country that's willing to fight for their freedom and be part of a -- the house of freedom.",

You wrote a pretty stiff op-ed or article after October 7th atrocities, in which you were very shocked by the intelligence failures that were partly enabling what happened on October 7th.

There are three tracks. And the reason the United States is for a negotiated agreement. You look at the history of Israel, there's three tracks as it relates. Israel has tried a negotiated track. You've seen that with Egypt. You've seen it with Jordan. You've seen it with the Abraha Accords. The negotiated track has delivered both security, as well as an acceptance for Israel into the right of region. And those peace agreements with those three, Egypt in the late '70s, Jordan in the early '90s, under President Clinton, the Abraham Accords, under President Trump, have delivered security, delivered economic opportunity, and delivered a regional acceptance. The other option Israel's tried is unilateral, both in Lebanon and in Gaza, and that's led to Hamas and Hezbollah. The other option, the third option, which is divorce, which they've tried with the West Bank. There's only one option that's delivered security and opportunity and a regional acceptance.

Now, I can understand, when you have on the heels of Oslo, bus is blowing up in Tel Aviv, why you get very, very cynical that negotiations won't work. But, you know, the late Yitzhak Rabin once said, you fight terror as if there's no peace and you make peace as if there's no terror. And to me, that is still a truism. And the president's commitment to not only a two-state solution, but to a negotiated process, is because it has stemmed, it has stood the test of time for Israel's own security. What I find now, which is most promising, and I don't think -- I'm not an optimist, usually, I'm kind of cold, kind of pragmatist about this, is that there are many forces now for stability and for regional security that didn't exist. Gulf countries and neighbors to Israel in the Arab Israeli border. They want stability because it's important for their own economic development. Instability, mainly driven by Iran and their surrogates, is the force here. But Israel, for the first time, has partners and allies who are seeking quiet, they're seeking stability, seeking kind of overall strategic alignment. So economic growth and political growth can happen. That's a big difference. And one that I think accrues to Israel's historic interests is not only economic growth, but political acceptance in the region.",

Some players get more nervous when they're bluffing. Some players get more nervous when they have a strong hand. And they end up trying to win a huge pot. So we have some maybe semantic vocabulary deep in our brains that we develop over time, but it has to be practiced. Intuition provides us with data if we know how to correlate that with behavioral traits. I mean, another person, you know, Nancy Pelosi talked about her intuition with Ezra Klein for understanding how the democratic caucus behaves. And I believe in her intuition. She understands like nobody else, how Democrats think. Maybe not swing voters, but Democrats. Democratic legislators for sure. But it's a matter of practice and skill. It's a matter of not just trusting your gut because you're being lazy and don't want to think through a problem, but when you actually have thousands of hours of experience with it, then it can be helpful.",

And game theory is what evolves when both you and your opponent are playing strategically androughly rational, roughly optimal in your decision-making. In the United States, both parties win elections roughly half the time because they do adapt. I mean, Donald Trump understood that maybe there were opportunities among white working class voters that were being neglected by the, you know, Mitt Romney, Paul Ryan types of candidates. Recently though, I think there's a risk that both parties had caught up in their own bubble and don't give the other side credit for adapting intelligently. I think this was, you know, most obviously the case with the Trump campaigns and ability to foresee Democrats switching their candidate, which was the right strategic moves. So I think if you -- you know, assume your opponent's playing their hand well and play your hand as best you can, given that, that's reciprocity. Sometimes you get lucky and your opponent makes a mistake, but that's easy to win. Most of the time, it's hard to actually make good bets. It's a competitive market. It's a competitive economy. And so give your opponent's credit and then adapt from there.",
