If you want it to be critical, you say that Biden still looked frail, that he displayed a distinct lack of awareness of the urgency of this situation. Biden's down to Trump nationally and he's down to Trump in virtually every swing state; 72 percent of Americans, 72 percent say that Biden isn't (INAUDIBLE) or mentally equipped to be president. I think the problem for Biden is that Americans can't unsee what they saw at last weeks debate.

But where I do think Biden has erred very severely is in his post-debate spin. Messaging really matters and I think he and his staff have turned in sort of one excuse after another that hasn't really reassured Americans as well as lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Saying that he had a cold, that he had jet-lag 11 days after he returned to D.C. But he's OK between the hours of 10:00 am to 4:00 pm and just needs to get more sleep.

Now really if you're a Democratic donor, there's only one vehicle through which to get to the White House right now. That's Biden's one game in town. So I'm not entirely convinced that all the money is just going to flow out. And that's what's going to stop Biden's campaign.

And if that's the starting approach, it means that he's open to negotiations in seeing what can be achieved with the West. The Iranian relations with the West, the conclusion of a nuclear deal was possible under a moderate President Rouhani. It was not possible under radical Iranians. And also Western countries will find engaging Pezeshkian much more easy than engaging Jalili. So I think Pezeshkian has some room to actually engage the U.S., engage Europeans in a positive way to see what is possible. So that's not radical change on Iran's foreign policy. But it is welcome change for many Iranians because, even certain degree of improvement of relations with the West will have an impact on their daily lives. It will deescalate tensions. It might remove fear of war and it might actually give certain sanctions in exchange for some things that Pezeshkian will push the regime and push the supreme leader to agree to.",

He says it's time for President Biden to undergo detailed cognitive and neurological testing and share his results. Here's more now from Sanjay. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, obviously it's certainly up to the president and frankly, any patient, whether or not they want to have this sort of testing. But I should point out that the testing shouldn't be thought of as something that would embarrass or malign but rather maybe provide some answers to what is driving some of the signs and symptoms we've seen with President Biden and maybe even provide an opportunity for some early treatment. It could provide a baseline, something that can be tracked and followed over time so that you could find early signs of any kind of deficit, maybe even before the person themselves recognized it. Or sometimes it's testing just provides peace of mind. There is nothing to worry about. I should also point out that, in the United States, there is a cognitive exam that is usually recommended for anyone over the age of 65 as part of their annual wellness checkup. Anyone over the age of 65 going through about an hour's worth of cognitive testing, physical exam, patient history to try and figure out, are there cognitive deficits that can be addressed early. What I think has been driving some of the concerns since the debate among my many of my colleagues in medicine was some of the things they saw for a sustained and projected time during the debate: the differences in speech, the halting of speech, the confused, rambling sometimes that occurred. But also what they saw when President Biden seem to not have any facial expression, I think it's why so many people have said cognitive testing as well as movement disorder testing could be potentially beneficial. As you've certainly heard by now, the White House said, look, it was a bad night. That's basically what it was. It was a bad night. He was jet-lagged to some extent. He had had not been getting enough sleep and he had a cold. And those things certainly can cause episodes like we saw. But again, the question is, is this episodic or is this reflective of something that is more significant? We do know finally that he did have a fairly complete exam back in February. But a cognitive test was not part of that exam. They ruled out things like stroke, like multiple sclerosis and they made note that he did not have Parkinson's disease. But there are other things that can cause Parkinsonism besides Parkinson's disease. And they didn't really mention that. So I think there are still a lot of unanswered questions but, again, it is up to the president, and any patient, whether or not they want to have this sort of testing. But there are many reasons it could be beneficial. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

At the same time, they are preparing potential contingencies in the extraordinary event that the president of the United States decides ultimately not to run for President after all. They have been poring over briefing books, looking at some of the potential Democratic contenders who may emerge as a replacement for Joe Biden, including Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and California Governor Gavin Newsom. At the same time, we're seeing a bit of a strategy change from the Trump campaign and his allies when it comes to Vice President Kamala Harris. Both the Trump campaign and an aligned Super PAC, called MAGA Inc., have attacked Harris in recent days. They are suggesting that she would carry as much of the burden from the past 4 years as Joe Biden would and they would attack her equally on crime, inflation and immigration. We've also heard an interesting line of attack from a Trump advisor who said that they would probably try to knock Harris down by suggesting that she was hiding information from the public about Joe Biden's mental acuity and his physical decline -- Steve Contorno, St. Petersburg, Florida, CNN.

A statement from the Lebanese militant group says they discussed the potential ceasefire as well as a hostage deal on the table with Israel. And they reaffirmed their commitment to achieving their objectives elsewhere in the region. The Palestine Red Crescent says an Israeli military operation in the West Bank killed seven Palestinians. The IDF says the operation was targeting terrorists it holds responsible for the killing of an Israeli soldier in the city of Jenin last week. Meanwhile, Israel continues operations in several parts of Gaza, including Shejaiya in the north and Rafah in the south. The IDF says it has killed 100, quote, \"terrorists\" in Shejaiya as it tries to prevent Hamas from reestablishing itself there. Now the fresh fighting comes as hundreds of protesters joined a mothers' march in Tel Aviv on Friday to demand the release of hostages held in Gaza. Israel says gaps still remain in a proposed ceasefire and hostage deal with Hamas. An Israeli delegation is set to return to Doha next week after meeting with mediators in Qatar on Friday.

For months now they have been negotiating, trying to reach that framework and a senior administration official in Washington now saying that it appears that there is indeed a framework agreement in place. And so now they're entering this phase of detailed negotiations, Barnea traveling to Doha, Qatar, on Friday but an Israeli negotiating team will head back next week to continue those negotiations, a positive sign that there is momentum behind this. Now these detailed negotiations are going to focus on the implementation of the ceasefire agreement, the sequencing of the release of the hostages and the Palestinian prisoners, as. Well, as the identities of those Palestinian prisoners. These are all very thorny issues. And so it should be stated that, even as it appears that Israel and Hamas are further along now in these negotiations than they have been since the last truce collapsed at the beginning of last December, it should be noted that the outcome of these detailed negotiations, which are expected to take several weeks, is far from assured. The devil will certainly be in the details as Israel and Hamas appear to be trying to now close out a deal, as the White House has said -- Jeremy Diamond, CNN, Jerusalem. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
