And tonight, we hear from the parents of one of those soldiers. Plus, Trump's new target, tearing into the president of the United Autoworkers, calling him a weapon of mass destruction and a dope for backing Biden. Tonight, the president of the UAW, Shawn Fain, is OUTFRONT to respond. And inside Kim Jong-un's inner circle. Women are elevated there now and the powerful men who posed a threat to him, especially relatives, are ending up dead. Let's go OUTFRONT. And a good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, retaliation. President Biden meeting with his national security team vowing to respond after three American soldiers were killed by an Iranian-backed drone strike in Jordan. Forty more were injured and, of those eight are still in the hospital, suffering from their injuries. It is an attack in which we now know three were killed. Forty-six-year-old Sergeant William Rivers, 23-year-old Specialist Breonna Moffett, and 24-year-old Specialist Kennedy Sanders. In a moment, I'm going to speak to Specialist Sanders' parents. CNN is learning that the three were killed after air defenses failed to recognize the enemy drone, which was honing in on its target, at the same time an American drone was returning to the small U.S. outpost that is known as Tower 22 in the north of Jordan, near that Syrian border. It is the deadliest attack on American forces since the withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021. And it follows months of strikes by the Iranian-backed Houthi militants in the Red Sea, that have targeted American troops and commercial ships. And tonight, Secretary of State Antony Blinken warning of a situation in the region saying it is now the most dangerous moment in more than 50 years. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

A U.S. official saying that things are now fundamentally different after the death of three U.S. servicemembers and the decision, Erin, is so complicated in large part because the White House has been so insistent that they do not want things to further escalate in the region, but at the same time after Sunday, the president has shown a real desire to respond with real force, again because now we have lives of three U.S. servicemembers that have been lost.

And she called us while we were at brunch with her friends in the background to tell me that she was going against my wishes to purchase a motorcycle. And I told her she knows I was against and I told her that she was strictly prohibited from purchasing a motorcycle and she just said, prohibited? You know, as if to say, you know, I'm 24 years old.

She was always laughing about everything. So I just want people to remember that, you know, even though her time was short on Earth, she lived her life to the fullest and she enjoyed her life. In any situation that she was in, she made it enjoyable, even being deployed. She found different things to do to pass her time. She was trying to learn a new language.

MITT ROMNEY (R-UT): The fact that he would communicate to Republican senators and Congress people that he doesn't want us to solve the border problem because he wants to blame Biden for is -- it's really appalling. SEN. JAMES LANKFORD (R-OK): When we're finally getting to the end, oh, just kidding, I actually don't want a change in law because of the presidential election year. (END VIDEO CLIPS)",

You said to abandon Ukraine would set off a negative change of events for U.S. interest domestically and abroad. You continue to say some in the Republican Party have lost their moral compass on foreign policy. In fact, some of those who are pounding the table now to bomb Iran are saying that we don't need Ukraine funding. What do you say to them now?",
