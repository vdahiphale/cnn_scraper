It's really a reflection of, in the beginning, they said, you face the death penalty. I think that was more of an indication of what they think he should face. But then they had to correct the record and bring him back because he is under 18 and you cannot sentence someone to death who is under 18. So he informed him that he instead is facing life in prison.",

It certainly appears that if they did have that red flag law, that perhaps the red flag would also apply to the father who purchased this gun.And they would this would not have happened. That being said, since the child illegally possessed this gun because he's underage and wasn't allowed to, it's unclear whether the father would have been included in this red flag, given what we now know. But it's just -- all the facts continue to develop. And as we learn more, we will be able to talk about it more and know more what was going on. But, certainly, there were so many indications here of just failed red flags, if you will, including the fact that this kid and his threats were on the radar of the FBI.

Also new this morning, the U.S. State Department says it is urgently gathering information the death of an American activist in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The U.S. ambassador to Israel is identifying her as Aysenur Eygi. She was 26 years old, held dual U.S.- Turkish citizenship. She and others were protesting near an Israeli settlement not far from Nablus. Eyewitnesses say Israel's military fired tear gas and stunned grenades toward the protesters and that a soldier then fired the live round that wound up killing her. CNN has asked the Israel Defense Forces for comments. We have not received an answer yet. Also today, and this is new, Israel's military has withdrawn from the West Bank city of Jenin after nine days of intense military operations there. The devastation is widespread. Infrastructure is in ruins and drinking water and electricity are cut off. The United Nations says this has been the deadliest period of the West Bank in at least eight months. CNN international diplomatic editor Nic Robertson is joining us right now from Tel Aviv. Nic, you and your team were among the first to arrive in Jenin to see the aftermath of these raids. How extensive is the damage?",

It was also the first time they had an opportunity for a lot of funerals. According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, 39 people were killed. They say, of those, eight were children and they say two of them were elderly. We went to the funeral of one of those elderly people, an 87-year-old man. I talked to his sons. And his sons said: \"Look, why was he shot? We don't understand. He was old. He could barely walk. He hadn't been able to get food. He'd gone out. And why was he killed?\" He said -- his son told me he wasn't a threat to anyone. We also saw some militants being killed. There were quite a number of gunmen at that funeral. The IDF says they killed 14 terrorists during those operations. And I actually spoke to one of the commanders of one of those units, one of those militant units the people -- the IDF calls terrorists. He was the Jenin brigade commander of Palestinian Islamic Jihad. And he told me: \"Look, we will admit our losses, but Israel should admit their losses.\" (CROSSTALK)",

He was there, sitting in there today in that courtroom. He didn't have to be. He chose to be. He has chosen to make in some cases the courtroom part of the campaign trail. In some cases, it had to be because he was forced to be in court, for example, with the hush money trial there in New York. But it was pretty predictable that this is what he was going to do to come out and attack all of the justice system in general. And just to be very clear, as we have reported time and time again, the case with E. Jean Carroll is a civil case. It is not involved with the Justice Department. The case in Atlanta was brought by Fani Willis, not by the Justice Department. But part of what we have seen with Donald Trump and with his campaign, particularly amid all of these ongoing legal investigations and trials, is the fact that Donald Trump has aimed to make this political, to tie this to the current administration, and now, of course, will tie this to Kamala Harris as part of the current administration, saying that he is being politically persecuted, essentially having this line that is, they're coming after you, but I'm just standing in the way, when instead he just -- they just are alleging that he committed crimes. So what we know today is that this was the first time that he and E. Jean Carroll were in that courtroom. This was him seeking a new trial. His legal team has said that they believe there were issues with the evidence, that the judge shouldn't have let in certain evidence, and that's why they are appealing. And, again, we don't expect any decision this today or possibly even before the election, but you can tell here he is obviously using this -- he is angry. He's always angry when he comes out of these legal cases, but he's also using this as an opportunity for himself to paint this as political.",

He was convicted of sexually abusing her and defaming her, fined some $5 million. He says there was an extremely hostile judge, that certain evidence that was admitted should never have been admitted.He's going on and on and on, railing against her, saying he doesn't know her, never met her, has no idea who she is, only that she's making up all of these stories. I want to bring in Karen Friedman Agnifilo, our legal analyst, to assess this. There was a trial. He actually didn't want to attend and didn't testify. If he's that innocent, why didn't he make his case in front of the court?",

Jean Carroll trial that he did attend, and he did testify and he did put on a defense there. So he chose not to in this case, and he is stuck with that decision.This was an appellate argument. This is him trying to appeal his -- the finding of liability that this nine-person jury found against him and found that he had sexually abused -- he is guilty essentially of sexually abusing E. Jean Carroll, in addition to defaming her. And so that is what he's complaining about here is, he almost wants to do- over. You can't do that on appeal. On appeal, the judges look at the record, and that's it. They don't listen to your defense or anything else that you have to say, but that's what he's trying to do today in his press conference. One of the things I was listening for is, did he defame her again? And will E. Jean Carroll bring additional defamation charges against him from this press conference? Because every time he denies ever meeting her or knowing her and denies that this happened, that could be another charge of defamation. So it'll be interesting to see if the lawyers bring more defamation charges against him.",
