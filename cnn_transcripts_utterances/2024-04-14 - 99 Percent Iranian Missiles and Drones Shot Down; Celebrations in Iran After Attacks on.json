And the IDF says it had a 99 percent success rate in shooting down Iranian drones and missiles launched at Israel. This is what it all looked like a few hours ago, before the attacks apparently subsided. Middle of the night, above Israel. Here's what we know so far. The IDF says more than 300 missiles and drones were fired on Israel overnight. Those few that got through hit an airbase in Southern Israel, causing minor damage. Israel says that the U.S., Britain and France also acted during the strikes, and that some of the missiles were fire from Iraq and Yemen. Tehran says the attack was in response to an Israeli strike on Iran's embassy in Damascus earlier this month and that the matter can be regarded as \"concluded.\" And Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has spoken on the phone with the U.S. President Joe Biden. He told Mr. Netanyahu that these attacks were largely unsuccessful, which Biden says was a win for Israel. CNN's MJ Lee has learned the president told Mr. Netanyahu the U.S. will not take part in any offensive operation against Iran. Meanwhile, Mr. Netanyahu reacted on social media, saying, we have intercepted, we have contained, we shall win. Israel and Jordan have now reopened their airspace which had been closed for much of the past 24 hours. Well, airlines continue to avoid Iraqi and Iranian airspace as frequent travelers know that air route over Iraq and Iran is a vital corridor for global commercial travel. Meanwhile, inside Iran, celebrations broke out on the streets of Tehran after word of the attack got out. CNN covering this story from all angles. Nic Robertson is standing by in Jerusalem. Paula Hancocks is with me here in Abu Dhabi. Let's start with you, Nic. Is this it? The Iranians have certainly said this is an attack that is concluded, an operation that is conclude.

Israel didn't claim responsibility, but Tehran certainly holds them responsible.And we heard from the supreme leader saying that an attack on their consulate in Syrian is effectively an attack on their home soil on Iran itself. And so, this is what they say was self-defense. It was a direct retaliation for what had happened on April 1st. Now, we've got a couple of front pages here from Iranian newspapers. This is the Iran, and it says the start of the punishment. That's the main headline. You can see the image there. That's the image of what state media calls an Israeli-affiliated container ship being taken by Revolutionary Guards and directed into Iranian waters as well. They say, Iran's answer is legitimate and strong. Just to show you one more, this also has a very similar sentiment saying it's start of revenge. But what we're hearing from the Iranian side is that this is legitimate. They have criticized the U.N. Security Council for not having responded when they say Israel carried out that strike, and they said that they have had to respond themselves. Becky.",

Nobody around this region wants this escalating in any way. To both of you, thank you. Well, U.S. forces intercepted more than 70 one-way attack drones and at least three ballistic missiles according to two U.S. officials familiar with the matter. Those missiles were intercepted by U.S. Navy warships in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. U.S. fighter jets were also part of the western response to Iran's attack on Saturday. Shooting down drones launched towards Israel according, to another U.S. official. The U.S. forces do not appear to have been targeted in Iran's attack on Israel.

We know that U.S. aid, for example, has said the north of Gaza is in or on the verge of famine.Given what has gone on now for the past, what, 72, maybe 96 hours, the telegraphing of an imminent attack by Tehran on Israeli assets. That is now over the Iranian said has concluded. We await to see what the Israelis do next. But should they do nothing in an offensive posture? Surely now the focus needs to be back on Gaza. And to that point, we are just reporting now that Israel says that Hamas has rejected the outline of a ceasefire and hostage release deal with Hamas repeating its original demands, a permanent ceasefire, and all Israeli assets out of Gaza.

We had seen Hamas starting to make some moves towards rejecting that permanent ceasefire in the outset, they were suggesting they would be willing to negotiate that later in a further phase. And we were seeing the Israeli side as well, showing some flexibility on some of their demands.So, there was a sense, at least at certain points, that there was perhaps a window for a ceasefire, at least a temporary one, to be reached. And now, to see Hamas going back to these original demands, which Israel said, what was a no-go is likely to be seen as a really big drawback by the United States, which has been so involved in these negotiations. And as you point out, Becky, there was so much pressure by the U.S. on the Israelis in recent days and weeks about the ongoing offensive in Gaza. We have seen the administration ratcheting up its rhetorical pressure on Israel, and that really came to a head after that deadly strike on the World Central Kitchen convoy a couple of weeks ago, where we saw the president come out really strongly against Prime Minister Netanyahu and say, you need to change your conduct here. You need to protect civilians. You need to get more humanitarian aid in, or there will be changes in U.S. policy. So, it will be really interesting to watch and see whether that comes back to the fore after this Iranian counterstrike, Becky.",

He also said France remains committed to Israel's security. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak condemned Iran's \"reckless attack against Israel\" and said the U.K. will continue to support Israel's security along with that of regional partners Jordan and Iraq. In the Netherlands, the Dutch prime minister said the attack is very concerning and warned against further escalation towards Israel. Meantime, Saudi Arabia. expressing concern over, and I quote them here, \"the recent military escalations in the region.\" In a statement, the Saudi Foreign Ministry urged restraint, warning of dire consequences if the situation worsens. Qatar, also releasing a statement a short while ago, expressing \"deep concern \"over the \"developments\" in the region and has called on all parties to cease escalation, calm tensions, and exercise maximum restraint.

So, I would expect Prime Minister Netanyahu to be now more listening and obeying to the American administration after we were practically saved, partly by the United States.The question is if Israel can just ignore this, and, you know, again, as usual in Israel, the domestic arena is the major one, and Israelis, as usual, will ask for revenge for this attack, which may be deserves a revenge, but will lead us to a horrible reality.",

And, you know, many times, Israel is acting without thinking about the day after. That's a very good example.

      "sentences": "Becky, look, let's be clear. In 45 years since the Islamic Republic and the antagonism between Israel and Iran, there has never been an attack by Iran inside Israel.So, this does actually cross a threshold, and the actual future right now rests on whether Israel will listen to the United States and not retaliate for the retaliation. It was a massive aerial attack in terms of hundreds of drones, cruise missiles, and other surface-to-surface missiles that flew from Iran over various other territories, including apparently some from Yemen, some from Hezbollah, et cetera. It appears, according to reports, that Israel has responded in Lebanon on Hezbollah targets, if that is confirmed, and we will see whether there's any further retaliation. The United States has said since October 7th that while it stands with Israel and its right to defend from what happened on October 7, it had really implored, in fact, pleaded, begged, and sent all its officials, military, diplomatic, CIA, the president himself, to warn Israel not to escalate, because there had been no intelligence supporting any claim that Iran had anything to do with October 7th. So, what you have right now is having taken the action it did in Damascus early April, for we don't know why, they obviously don't say that they did, except that then they say that Israel believes it struck a military building of Quds forces. Iran says it was also a diplomatic base, and it was wrongly struck. Obviously, that would be Iran's position. At the United Nations, Iran, in its statement last night, said that it was abiding by the provisions for self-defense from so-called Article 51. And as you've mentioned, as you've reported, it says, this is -- this matter should now be considered concluded, but if Israel \"makes a mistake,\" again, Iran will react even more strongly. Those are the words of Iran and said that Iran is telling the United States in big capital letters, you know, must stay away from this. I think in terms of the defense, Israel has hugely sophisticated anti- missile defense, the Iron Dome, all sorts of other things that the United States has provided it with over decades. And if you see what -- you know, what Ukraine can do with barrage of Russian and Iranian drones and Russian missiles and crews, Ukraine has been able to knock down the majority of those. It is not surprising that Israel and the United They were able to intercept the vast majority and that damage according to Israel has been very, very limited.",

Not only Joe Biden has filed to influence the decision of Netanyahu and his war cabinet, in fact, Netanyahu has played Joe Biden, has outmaneuvered Joe Biden.
