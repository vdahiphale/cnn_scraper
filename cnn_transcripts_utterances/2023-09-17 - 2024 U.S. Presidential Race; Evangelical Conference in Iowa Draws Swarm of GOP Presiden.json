Her death sparked months of unprecedented protests. Followed by a brutal crackdown by the government, in which more than 500 people were killed, according to the human rights group, human rights activist's news agency. A year on, there were some daring acts of defiance. Like this couple chanting women, life, freedom in the streets of Tehran as drivers honk their horns in support. Or these protesters blocking traffic in a Kurdish city, just a few hours away from Amini's hometown.

And the air force is speculating that it might have hit a flock of birds. The airport says, they have not determined decisively the cause of the crash but that is the speculation at the moment. The crash happened within the perimeter of the airport, which means the jet failed within the fence of the airport.
