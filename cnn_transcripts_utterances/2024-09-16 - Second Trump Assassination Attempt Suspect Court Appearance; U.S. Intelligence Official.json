I think you've seen a heightened number of Americans feel a sense of purposelessness.And I think if you were to ask Republican voters who support Trump some of their views on the other side, they'd probably say these folks are perhaps a threat to my existence, a way of life. And I think if you were to ask folks who are Democrats, there may be some folks who point to reproductive rights being changed and say this is a threat to my life and existence. And so, what you're seeing is that people in the country are looking at others as literally wanting to erase their existence. And so, I'm not surprised that when you see political rhetoric that you would typically normally see during heightened political times of turning into people wanting to actualize their anger, their fear, their anxieties by attempting to cause harm to political leaders, it certainly worries me. And at some point, you have to imagine that this is likely going to get worse as we get closer to November. And the former president, thank God, was lucky these both times. But what happens if someone actually is able to take out this act, whether it's against him or someone on the other side? Imagine what that's going to do to the country.",

Trump was saying in this, my resolve is only stronger after another attempt on my life. I will never slow down. I will never give up. I'll never surrender. I thank God every day for having supporters like you on my side.I mean, very much, you know, there's no amping up of the rhetoric there.

Thank God the guy wasn't able to get any shots. off when the former president got closer. So, that's a good thing. But I think he needs to really speak to the American people about, yes, this is a divisive moment because this is a political contest, but the contest should be based upon the intellectual exchange of ideas not this -- what appears to be our innate abilities to have anger and resentment and disgust for people who we believe don't see the world the way we believe it should be ran or should be led or should exist.I think the former president should probably talk to the American people about the importance of reaching across the aisle to people who may be different and say, look, maybe you view the world a little differently, but figure out ways to agree on some things that really do impact all of us, whether it's our children, or maybe it's the fact that we need to figure out ways to improve our infrastructure, or maybe it's the fact that we need to come together so that our standing across the globe that resolve we once had, Jim, is still recognized by our allies.

I've seen posts to the comments that you just made, and it goes to the very point that I was making in my initial comments of people viewing others as an existential threat to their existence.And when you view individuals through that lens, it does not surprise me that we find ourselves in this particular moment in time where people are angry at the other side, where people believe if things don't go their way, they question what does the future look like for them, for their families, for their interests.

As part of this broader persistent threat stream that U.S. intelligence officials have been tracking for several months now, but they've brought this new evidence to the table. to the Trump campaign and warning them that there is -- are signs that that threat could be escalating.And, you know, it's notable, Jim, because this take -- this briefing took place prior to, again, the second attempted assassination of Donald Trump. And yet, a second person in as many months was still able to get as close as they did to the former president, really reigniting those same concerns that happened on July 13th about the security protocol and the security posture around Donald Trump, not just as it relates to domestic threats, but also foreign ones. We know that Iran has been behind attempted assassination plots of Donald Trump and other former and current U.S. officials in the past. We know that there was recently actually an arrest in a case stemming from 3rd -- or July 13th rally Iranian assassination plot. So, this threat still persists. U.S. intelligence officials remain concerned about the ability of the Secret Service to protect Donald Trump. And this is just the latest indication of that threat coming from Iran.",

That did land Donald Trump and several of his top administration officials on a hit list of swords. Iran continues to vow retribution for the killing of Soleimani.But also, more recently, we've seen U.S. officials warn that Iran is trying to undermine and actively influence the 2024 election outcome and undermine Donald Trump's candidacy specifically. So, clearly linking Donald Trump as the candidate that's not in their best national security interest and doing everything they can to keep him out of the White House.

      "sentences": "Yes, Jim. So, as we speak, actually, attorneys for TikTok creators are now making the argument in front of the judge as to why TikTok should not be banned. TikTok attorney has already spoken now. They only had about half an hour for each side. But that stretches out because judges later ask questions, then there might be rebuttals.But the reason that there is such a tight timeframe is because if you remember that law that was passed that sets up this potential ban of TikTok, says that any legal challenge had to bypass Federal district court and go straight to where it's now being argued in the U.S. Court of Appeals in D.C. within a very tight timeframe. There is a very tight timeframe here because this law that was passed sets TikTok up to potentially be banned if it's not sold off from its Chinese ownership by mid-January. So, we're just talking about not only a tight timeline right now in court, but also a tight timeline in general. We're just months away from this potential ban. So, right now, as we speak, there is a three-judge panel. There's no jury. It's just a three-judge panel that's taking -- that's right now asking questions to the lawyers for some of these TikTok creators who are also arguing against this ban. They're also going to hear from the U.S. government and their argument and ask questions from those attorneys as well. Now, what exactly is this law? If you remember, this law was a bipartisan law that passed very, very quickly through Congress. It was signed by President Biden. And what it says is that this -- as TikTok can still exist, but it cannot be under Chinese ownership. And the U.S. is arguing that because -- it's because of mostly national security concerns to say that the government of China could be collecting sensitive data on the users. They're also worried about propaganda use. And some of their reasonings are actually sealed. And so, we can't see them, but the judges can see them. TikTok is saying this is a First Amendment violation and it's a constitutional overreach and that these securities concerns are speculative concerns. Now, whoever loses will likely appeal. The Supreme Court is expected to hear this case and it will likely decide before this ban could take effect in January, Jim.",
