And yesterday in Gaza we saw gunmen with rifles slung over their shoulders hand over an 84- year-old woman in a wheelchair as a crowd cheered and recorded with their cellphones.

Everyone seems to have coalesced around the idea that there will be an extension, but it's really not certain until they have a formal agreement. And so far we have not gotten word of that. Part of that I think is because Israel said they wanted to make sure they got through day six, which, of course, is today as we are now just hours away from this expiring before they agreed to an extension to see how tonight goes, because it has been very day by day.But really the big question here right now is what happens on day seven. Is there going to be a continuation in the pause, and how long could that go on for? I've heard from Israeli officials that they do believe when it comes to women and children, there are still enough being held that this part of the agreement could go on for several more days. But we know from our sources that there was a meeting in Doha yesterday, including the CIA director, about what this next deal could potentially look like. And Israel said we are not ready to come to an agreement until we finish this part of the agreement for women and children, which of course, we know has not been fulfilled he yet. But what they are talking about, and what the CIA director in particular was pushing for was broadening the category to include elderly men, other men who are being held, and potentially IDF soldiers, though it is essentially the consensus here that IDF soldiers would be a much higher price than what they have had to do for women and children. Whether that's a question of how many more Palestinian prisoners they have to release in order to get that, those are all still outstanding issues that we do not have the firm details on. But of course, all of this, all these negotiations, every single turn that they take, it is of grave importance to these families here who are waiting for word on what is going to happen to their loved ones. And we have heard from the Bibas family, and they say that yes, they told me that 10-month-old Kfir Bibas and four-year-old Ariel Bibas, including their parents, are not on the list of hostages to be released today on day six. And just to speak to the anguish that these families are feeling. Every day when they get that call that it's not going be their loved ones who are on the list, I want you to listen to a cousin of the Bibas family, Eylon Keshet, in this interview, an incredibly emotional interview that he had with me yesterday.

He was not even eating solid foods when he was kidnapped by Hamas, and they are worried that he could starve to death, even if he is being taken care of.And I got a statement from Eylon overnight, and I want to read it to you, because it's important. And he said that they officially know that they will not be a part of this release on day six today. He said, quote, \"We want to make sure that everyone understand that they are in dire conditions and are in real danger to develop irreversible damage in this state. We demand the Red Cross to do its duty, fight for its right to access, provide emergency health support, and report that their status. We also want to send a message to President Biden. Please speak with us, and help save their lives.\" Now, these are typically two people, two children, certainly, at least, we also know their mother is being held, that would be a part of this group that is supposed to be being able to be released. But here's the concern, and that is that the IDF says that Hamas has said they don't have them in their control, they are in control of another group in Gaza.

These are their citizens. And they want them home as well. So Hamas saying one thing. I think the Mossad chief is trying to pushin Qatar that Hamas does know how to get in touch with Islamic Jihad or whatever other groups are holding these children and they are not pushing enough to get their release sooner because they think this is leverage for them. And of course, it's inhumane. It's inhumane when you are thinking about an 11-month-old. What does he have anything to do with this? And you see the condition that some of these other hostages have come home. How do you even take care of a 10 or 11- month-old in tunnels for over 50 days?",

More than a dozen calls with Prime Minister Netanyahu, the Emir of Qatar, President El-Sisi in Egypt. And to some agree I think the administration feels like they are not getting credit for the fact they are in the middle of a truce, that there have been hostage releases, and that there's been a surge of humanitarian aid. Do you think that's fair? Or do you think that there are there other things they auto should be doing here? JOSH BARRO, WRITER, \"VERY SERIOUS\" NEWSLETTERgive them credit for it. I think that -- I'm sure that the president and the administration didn't create this situation. I think they feel overall this basically this external event happened and it's caused this big domestic political problem for there, and that there is very little that they can do about that given the way that it splits the Democratic Party. And I think that's true. Obviously, it's true that the hostage releases are a more favorable story than pretty much anything we have seen out of there for several weeks going at this point. But as you note, the nature of this stuff is that it has to be behind closed doors. And it's never completely clear from the outside exactly who it was that drove whatever diplomatic outcome we got. So I think it's hard to prove exactly the extent to which the U.S. was a prime mover behind these multiparty conversations.",

Joining us now is Dr. Majed Al-Ansari, who is the spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry of Qatar, which has played a central role in mediating these negotiations.

MAJED AL-ANSARI, QATARI MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS SPOKESPERSON: Good morning, Kaitlan, thank you for having me. Of course, we are right now in the middle of these negotiations. As you might imagine, our teams on the ground, whether they be in Tel Aviv or here in Doha, in the operations room, are working with all sides to ensure we get all the information in real-time. At the same time we are working on the release for today, which is, as your report rightly mentioned, it's the last day of the extension of the truth. We are hopeful that within a couple of hours, we will have the release of the final batch, but also, we will also be able to announce an extension. We are working on an extension that would be guaranteed by the same provision that guaranteed the previous two days, which is that every day we'd have to include at least ten hostages coming out and 30 hostages, 33rd prisoners from the Israeli prisons, and we're very optimistic that we would have good news to share today.",

Obviously, we don't have people on the ground. We get the information on the hostages from Hamas day by day, according to the list agreed between both sides.

Obviously, we are talking about the war zone. The situation in the red zone, as all of you have seen and your folks have shown very clearly, is that of a war zone with a lot of complications on the ground, a lot of logistical complications.

However, we are working with what we have, so, the discussions started with a humanitarian part for four days, and now the extension for two days has ended and we are working towards, or is about to end, and we are working towards another extension. But parallel to that, we are always having discussions on how we can reach a situation where we can have a longer truth. And that truth could lead to a ceasefire within a longer and more robust negotiation over the Holistic issue, not only of the hostages but of the situation as a whole.
