And the outcome could have huge ramifications for Russia's war in Ukraine. U.S. officials are saying that Beijing is considering arming Vladimir Putin's forces with drones and ammunition. And it's a move that the Biden administration thinks would prolong the war and up the death toll significantly. The CIA says there's no evidence that China has yet sent any of this lethal equipment. But the White House promises major consequences if it does. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAKE SULLIVAN, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER:  Beijing will have to make its own decisions about how it proceeds and whether it provides military assistance. But if it goes down that road, it will come at real cost to China. And I think China's leaders are weighing that as they make their decisions. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And I think part of the issues that you have heard from U.S. officials is the belief that the final decision has not been made yet. But, as they have laid out some of this intelligence to allies, as they have made public, some of their concerns at this point, it underscores the scale of the concern at stake here. And they have also made very clear to the Chinese the stakes that are at play. Take a listen to how Jake Sullivan framed things. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

PHILLIP:  Yes, it really has echoes of how the administration dealt with the Russian invasion of Ukraine in the first place, trying to very publicly warn China, even to the point of releasing some intelligence about all of this. Phil Mattingly, thank you very much. And there are even more complications for the Washington-Beijing relationship. A new classified report concludes that COVID-19 likely first leaked from a lab in China. That's the assessment of the Department of Energy. But -- and this is critical -- it is far from the final word on this question of how COVID-19 originated. Sources say that it is designated, this assessment is designated as low confidence, which adds to a divide that is continuing within the intelligence community about the pandemic's origin. CNN's Natasha Bertrand is covering all of this. So, Natasha, this report says that the lab leak is the likely originator of where this virus came from. But it's a low-confidence conclusion. And there have been other conclusions by other agencies within the government. Can you walk us through where we are on all of this?",

And here now to discuss the broader issue of these rising tensions with China is CNN military analyst retired Major General Dana Pittard and \"Washington Post\" columnist Max Boot. So, Max, I want to start with you on this question of China potentially providing lethal aid to Russia in this Ukraine war. Why would China do this?",

      "sentences": "That's a great question.I mean, if China does this, it's essentially throwing in its lot with Russia to a much greater extent than has been the case up until now. I am somewhat skeptical that they're actually going to do this. But, clearly, there is a debate occurring in Beijing. And what you're seeing now is that U.S. officials are using their classified intelligence for public messaging purposes, much in the way they did early on in the war to try to dissuade Putin from invading. Now they are declassifying some of their information to try to dissuade Beijing from helping Russia, which would be, as they know, a real game-changer. That would really allow Russia to make up for a lot of its equipment losses. But it would also be a very costly move for China, because, remember, China is the world's number one exporter. They are the largest trading nation in the world. Their economy is very vulnerable to pressure from the U.S. and Europe, which is why you see Xi Jinping trying to improve relations with the U.S. and Europe in recent months. And this would be a major blow to those hopes. So I think there are good reasons for China to avoid doing more to enable the Russian war effort.",

Yes, the prospect of Chinese aggression vis-a-vis Taiwan is really what a lot of people are looking at here.But, Max, I want to come back to this question of what the U.S. is calling the real costs that could face China if they were to take this step. It strikes me -- I mean, you were saying China doesn't really want to be, for example, sanctioned. But it also strikes me that the West -- sanctioning China could have profound effects on the U.S. economy, on the European economy. What do you think that those costs actually look like in practice? And does the U.S. and Europe really have the kind of backbone that it would take to levy those against China at this moment?",

And they haven't led to an economic meltdown, but they are inflicting real costs on Russia. And I think China understands that they are much more engaged in the global economy than Russia is. They are much more reliant on export markets than Russia is. So I don't think they necessarily want to test this and find out what happens, because, clearly, this would lead to a worsening of the tensions which already exist, and it would come with economic costs for both sides. But, remember, China right now is trying to recover from the COVID lockdown. They are trying -- their economy is in a very delicate state right now. There's been unrest. There have been demonstrations against Xi Jinping's zero COVID policy. So I'm not sure that this is the moment when Xi is going to put all his chips on Russia and risk the economic backlash that could come from that.",

These homes are torn up cars toppled. In parts of Texas, strong winds even whipped up a dust storm. And this tornado was caught on camera in Southern Illinois. Nearly 200,000 homes and businesses are still without power across several states right now. And another system is right behind it. Nine Western states are under a winter weather alert. So we have got full coverage with CNN's Ed Lavandera in Norman, Oklahoma, for us and meteorologist Derek Van Dam in the CNN Weather Center. Let's start with you, Ed.

      "sentences": "Yes, certainly.So, Abby, the storms that moved through where Ed is located across Norman in Central Oklahoma, they actually moved through at a cool 95 miles per hour. That is just incredible, so much energy associated with it. It spawned off nine tornadoes. And then that same storm system now moving across the Midwest in the Ohio River Valley. This is the threat as it stands right now. We have a level two of five from the Storm Prediction Center. Look at the big cities here, Indianapolis, Columbus, Cincinnati, even Louisville on the outskirts of that stronger threat level today. You can see the low pressure kind of wrapping in on itself. And there is a threat of tornadoes today. But we can't forget the fact that these storms have produced, as Ed talked about, 74 mile-per-hour wind gusts in excess, even in places like Central Oklahoma and Texas. Here's a look at the latest tornado watch that's in effect. Check this out. This is actually just new just coming to the CNN Weather Center. That is a severe thunderstorm warning for the greater Indianapolis metropolitan. So, that area needs to prepare for severe weather as we speak. There's a tornado warning just to the north. And you can see the threat level here. We have a 5 percent chance of any one singular point here within a 20-mile radius of that point seeing a tornado through the course of the day today. Now, flipping gears, because this storm system is going to encounter a lot of cold air. So you know how you haven't had much snow in New York City, only a half-an-inch so far? Well, that's going to change today and into the day on Tuesday, as three to five inches of snow is anticipated, heavier amounts across the Catskills, as well as the I-95 Corridor. Providence, Rhode Island, you could pick up 10 inches of snow from the same storm system. And Abby was mentioning that another storm starting to impact the Western U.S. Look at the blizzard warnings across the Sierra Nevada range, certainly going to build up a very, very healthy snowpack as we enter into the end of the meteorological winter -- Abby.",

Those pills are in more than half of abortions. And they're oftenprescribed to help women recover from miscarriages as well. CNN's Jessica Schneider is following all of this. So, Jessica, this is pretty extraordinary, not only because it could be nationwide, but because this is a drug that's been approved for more than 20 years.",

      "sentences": "Yes, it's been a long time, and it suddenly could get halted for its use. That is the expectation here as we wait for this ruling at any point.So both sides of this abortion debate, they're really prepping for what could be this big decision from just one federal judge in Texas with nationwide implications. So what this judge is asked to do is, he's asked to block access to medication abortion nationwide. And given that he is a Trump-appointed judge with a long history of anti- abortion activism before he became a judge, all sides do anticipate that he will block the use of this drug. So this abortion pill in question, it's mifepristone. It's been approved by the FDA, as you mentioned, for more than 20 years. And right now, medication abortion does make up the majority of abortions nationwide. So, if the challengers to this drug win, as is expected, it would actually mean that women in states where abortion has been virtually halted already, they wouldn't have this drug as another option. And even in states where abortion still legal, it would mean that women would not have this medication abortion option. And that could really create some major delays and backlogs at abortion clinics that are still in existence. So, Abby, this really is the biggest court decision since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June. Abortion rights advocates, they have been criticizing actually the group that brought this lawsuit, because they're saying that they specifically chose this particular federal court in Amarillo, Texas, because it does just have this one federal judge, Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk. He was very vocal against abortion before he became a judge. And now, of course, he could issue this ruling with nationwide impact at any moment. Of course, though, this forum shopping does happen, where they pick a particular court or judge. It happens on both sides here. But now, with this ruling upcoming, it's really gotten even more criticism and traction than ever before -- Abby.",
