Americans with different perspectives aren't talking to each other, but here, they do. (END VIDEOTAPE) PHILLIP (on camera): Good evening. I'm Abby Phillip in New York. Let's get right to what America is talking about, letting Trump take the wheel. Tonight, the system that Donald Trump wants to break, will it fight back or will the president-elect walk over a Washington with no checks, no balances? Here is one example, Matt Gaetz and whether the Senate will ultimately consent to him running the Justice Department. Tonight, President Trump, who is the president-elect, is announcing his intent to make the Florida Congressman the Chief Law Enforcement Officer of the United States. It is, to put it mildly, a novel pick, because Gaetz was recently under federal investigation and under congressional ethics investigation. It's ironic, also, because Gaetz publicly reviles the very system that he would be tasked with leading. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL): They lie about me because I tell the truth about them and I'm not going to stop. So, when you see the leaks and the lies and the falsehoods, know this, they aren't really coming for me. They're coming for you. I'm just in the way. I'm a marked man in Congress. I'm a canceled man in some corners of the internet. I might be a wanted man by the deep state. We either get this government back on our side, or we defund and get rid of, abolish the FBI, CDC, ATF, DOJ, every last one of them, if they do not come to heel. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Here are some quotes from some Republican Congress people. Murkowski says, he's an unserious candidate. I think we can take her off the list of people who will vote for a Matt Gaetz. Susan Collins was shocked. Tuberville loves Matt Gaetz. Hawley says he'll support the president's nominees. It's going to be a fight because they have only a couple of seats of a majority. HILL HARPER (D), FORMER U.S. SENATE CANDIDATE FOR MICHIGAN: I don't read that's the question though because I don't think that it's going to come to a vote I think that once Donald Trump got the Senate majority leader to agree to recess appointments. The first Senate recess is usually around president's holiday in February. You look, that's three weeks after confirmation. He does these recess appointments, and that means Gaetz would be in that role until basically the end of 2025 without having to go through the hearing process or any type of confirmation process. So, therefore, it's kind of lining up for what Donald Trump said he wanted to do, which is hit the ground running very quickly, have retribution. He's not going to bring on an attorney general that you would want someone to focus on justice, but that's not exactly what he wants out of the gate, or Gaetz, so to speak. And so when we think about it, we have to think about, I think, in that lens. And from a political standpoint, there is a shrewdness here. Why? Because number one, it satisfies a few things.

He went in, in 2017, it was a very different government despite having one party control.

And first, I just want to say, I don't know what mandate some of your panelists think that Donald Trump had or received from winning. The exit polls indicated that people were most concerned about immigration, most concerned about the economy. I do not think there's a mandate to dismantle our democracy, to undermine our constitution, to destroy the FBI, all things that Matt Gaetz has advocated for. But the reality is that recess appointment has not been locked in or guaranteed. And the only way that can happen is if the Senate majority leader, John Thune, bucks tradition in the Senate and decides to allow a recess to go a full ten days rather than have a pro forma session, which is the custom of the Senate to do regardless of what party the majority is in and regardless of what party the administration is in.
