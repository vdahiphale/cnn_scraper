The holy Muslim month is expected to fall on the second week of March.His words coming after Israel's prime minister said the release of hostages can be achieved through tough negotiations and, quote, \"strong military action.\" Meanwhile, video obtained by CNN shows some of that action, people digging through rubble in central Gaza, where a spokesperson for al- Aqsa Martyrs Hospital says at least 18 people were killed in an Israeli airstrike on Sunday. Palestinian health officials say many of those killed and wounded were children. CNN cannot independently verify the number of casualties. To the South near Khan Yunis, the WHO in the Hamas-controlled Gaza Health Ministry say Israeli forces have put the NASA medical complex, quote, \"completely out of service.\" A ministry spokesperson says only about two dozen medical staff remained but aren't able to handle critical cases. CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment. Joining me now is Dr. Irfan Galaria, a plastic and reconstructive surgeon who was a volunteer position in Gaza and saw Israel's bombardment there firsthand. Doctor, you wrote an incredibly powerful piece in \"The Los Angeles Times\" about your experience. I just want to read a line from it. You said, \"What I witnessed during ten days in Gaza was not war. It was annihilation.\" What -- what struck you most about conditions there? DR. IRFAN GALARIA, PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGEON: Thank you, Michael. Thank you for having me on your show. You know, what I still find very hard to comprehend was just how quickly my reality changed once they crossed into the Rafah border. You know, as soon as the gate shut behind me and I'd officially entered Gaza, I could feel immediately like I was trapped in a nightmare. The sounds, the smells were overwhelming. I heard drones that were buzzing, and the smells of, if you can imagine, one million people living in close proximity with poor sanitation, was just overwhelming and awful. And there were tents everywhere, everywhere you looked. Wherever there was space on this site and sidewalks, you know, roundabouts and intersections in the middle of intersections and open fields. It was really an overwhelming, you know, experience to take that all in at once.",

Second, is that the hospital systems, the physicians, they were just drowning in the sheer volume of the number of cases that they have at to deal with. And the capacity of the healthcare system to take care of them was incredibly flimsy.

He refused to abandon his patients. So he was very inspirational to me and to the other people of Gaza.

Sanctions were meant to dent oil paying for war. But instead, India has stepped in and is now buying 13 times more Russian crude oil than before the war, worth $37 billion last year, says one estimate, exclusively given to CNN. India buying Russian crude isn't sanctioned but is buying so much, Russia might need to dodge some sanctions to ship it all. We asked an artificial intelligence firm, Winwood, to analyze all global shipping last year for direct shipments between Russia and India. And they found a huge 588.

Now, this doesn't mean that people weren't spending money over the lunar new year holiday. In fact, a lot of people actually went to see movies. But there are some key differences in some very crucial areas. For example, the price of pork, which is a big staple of the Chinese consumer and a reflection of how the consumer is thinking, pork prices were still week. And the property sector, which has been struggling, continued on this downward spiral over this holiday period. You know, the numbers may say one thing, but the one thing they cannot tell: exactly what the Chinese consumer is thinking. And there is still a lot of hesitation, still a lot of trepidation.
