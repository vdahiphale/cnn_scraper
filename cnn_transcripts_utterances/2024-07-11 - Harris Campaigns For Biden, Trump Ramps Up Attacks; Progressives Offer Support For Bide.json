And so, if they were going to make a change, they need every minute they have to try and figure out how this works.I mean, another open question would be should Biden set aside, what does he tell all his pledge delegates? Does he endorse a -- some kind -- some kind of mini or quickie primary process? Does he say they should be with his vice president? That is I think another thing that people -- I mean, obviously, again, it's all entirely hypothetical right now. But certainly, yes.

If you're a person who is looking to figure out how I'm going to vote in this election, there's a question there. What did -- what is everyone else hiding, right? I mean, one of the big pushbacks against the media writ large was how did you guys miss this? How did we only find out about this at the debate?
