So, one of Aretha Franklin's nieces in 2019 she found two wills that you mentioned. One in 2010 that she allegedly wrote and one in 2014. So this is over two sons versus one son wanting a jury to decide which will was valid.So the jury deliberated for just about an hour and they have decided the 2014 will that was signed by Aretha Franklin is indeed valid and it showed intent. And something that was very interesting is it was signed with her signature that had a little smiley face on it, and that was very common as to how Aretha Franklin would sign her name. But this was not notarized, right, it was found in her couch under a cushion. So there was a lot of debate over this. And look, Aretha Franklin -- you might be thinking to yourself, wow, I mean, this person is so famous and millions of dollars and a huge estate, how could they not have a will? But look -- look at Prince, look at Bob Marly. So many famous people they end up dying perhaps too soon and never having gotten their will and their affairs in order. So, it's definitely a cautionary tale and obviously a resolution in the favor of two of Aretha Franklin's sons that her 2014 will stands. So it'll be interesting to see how all the assets and everything are divided up and when that will happen. But again, there is a decision finally.",

Intent with respect to what the person who provides for the will, how they want to distribute their assets, their income, et cetera, anything that comes in. And so, normally, yes, right, you would think of a will as a document prepared very professionally by lawyers perhaps with appendixes and indexes and exhibits, right, with respect to any distribution. But at the end of the day I think the jury simply made a determination, that listen, this was written by Aretha Franklin. When you write something you have to be intentional and purposeful about it. It was ultimately signed by her with the signature smiley face and they found that persuasive with respect with evidencing the intent that she wished in terms of the distribution of her assets.And so, the other learning tale is while you should see a lawyer and certainly you want to get your affairs together (INAUDIBLE) if there's a dispute, at the end of the day if the jury finds intent, that's exactly what they will do, they will give it value and that's what happened here, Brianna.",
