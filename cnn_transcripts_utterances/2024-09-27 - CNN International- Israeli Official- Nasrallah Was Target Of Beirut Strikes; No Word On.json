Rescue workers have begun sifting through the rubble of massive Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon's capital city. You see the pictures there. The Lebanese government says, those strikes killed at least two injured, some 76. We expect those numbers to rise as this recovery effort gets underway and continues. Israel says the strikes targeted the leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah. We do not know yet if he was struck among the dead or injured but let's take a listen to the moment that these massive strikes hit their targets. (VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)",

He is -- he has said, we are ready for offensive or defensive operations. So the military is postured to respond to whatever comes next than the anticipation would be that in some way that Hezbollah will respond to the events of this evening in Beirut. But at the moment, there is nothing to indicate. One way or another whether Hassan Nasrallah was killed, whether he was in the building, who may have been killed with him. Of course, that information would be expected to come soon as that battle damage assessment, which includes not only looking at what's happened on the ground, but also using other intelligence assets to review this scenario and also, of course, being aware of conversations within Hezbollah and what they have to say about the situation.

Do they go all in and compare their efforts to what Israel has done, or do they decide to de-escalate?

And this is what the Israelis have learned in Palestine and in south Lebanon. So no, I don't think a large occupation underground, they might send them I think commando units with air backup to attack specific sites. What we've learned now, which is different from 2006 is the Israeli intelligence has obviously with American and British assistance has generated a lot more information about Hezbollah's facilities, their ability to target leaders in their home and killed some of them. Hezbollah presumably has learned these lessons and it will take precautionary measures to stop that. What we haven't seen are Hezbollah's capabilities. We know they have rockets that can reach Tel Aviv. There has been rockets launched to Tel Aviv from Yemen. The Iraqis today, one of the Iraqi militias close to Iran and Hezbollah said they're going to launch rockets against northern Israel.

President Biden, on the tarmac in Dover, Delaware, told reporters the United States had no knowledge of and did not participate in this operation. U.S. officials have said Israel only notified the U.S. after the operation was already underway, and Israel had its jets in the air. CNN's MJ Lee joins me now from the White House.

The president himself said that technically there wasn't a heads up, but what we had reported earlier today was that the U.S. did get a heads- up moments before the strikes actually happened. And in fact, what a U.S. official told me was that the heads-up was given essentially after the military operation was already underway, and that Israel had planes already sort of up in the air.So, all of this was already underway, and I think what the president clearly meant was that the specifics of this operation was not something that the U.S. would have been made aware of ahead of time. Now, as we are obviously waiting to learn the answer to the big question of whether the target, the main target of these strikes had been taken out, this is Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, of course, we are sort of waiting to find out what all of this will eventually mean for what had already been escalating, tensions hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah across the Lebanon border. I mean, you mentioned yourself, this is only coming just really days after the U.S. tried to put forward this proposal that was put together by the U.S. and other nations to put in place a 21-day ceasefire. That was already looking like it was not really headed anywhere, at least in the immediate aftermath of that announcement, when the prime minister, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came out and basically threw cold water on it. So I think that is really the space to watch is how bad is the damage?

The problem is, the stakes are getting higher. The attacks are getting wider. And Hezbollah has its own capabilities and its own abilities to wreak havoc and retaliating ways the Iranians might not be willing to.

It did so in 1992, killing former leader Mousavi, who was replaced in 24 hours by Hassan Nasrallah.And, of course, this will be a major setback for Iran for Hezbollah, if Nasrallah is indeed killed. But at the end of the day, the Iranians do not want to allow Israel, which is the much stronger military power here, to dictate the course of events, and to decide on the degree and level of escalation for the Iranians, because they believe that Israel has a relatively open hand in the next six weeks in the run-up to the U.S. elections, and they want to be careful not to fall into an Israeli trap.",

We've talked about this extensively earlier in this hour here, the view from the U.S. side is that Israel at least did not sufficiently of invest in U.S.-led ceasefire efforts in Gaza, and now with Lebanon, but may very well have stood in the way of those efforts here. And U.S. leaders have been loath to allow a broader war to escalate in the region. Has the U.S. lost its ability to influence Netanyahu's decisions, at least until the election?",

But now that we're very close to that prospect, its really appears that its a case of complete failure of us policy in influencing one of his closest allies who depend on U.S. material support for being able to continue the war in Gaza and to also expand it.And the risk of regional conflagration is now higher than ever in a way that it threatens American lives. There are U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria who could be once again targeted by Iranian backed allies and again, the United States might once again be dragged into another dangerous and devastating war in the Middle East, which simply would have no winners",

This is why Israel has not invaded despite the fact that Hezbollah is in such a weakened position.But eventually, Jim, this is really important to understand that even if Israel manages to do what it has done to Hamas, to Hezbollah, which is two completely neutralize its ability to mount a serious military threats to Israel, which again, were far from that point it appears, with all the setbacks considered, but if that happens, then I believe is real creates a bigger problem for itself, because by diminishing Iran's regional deterrence, Israel would automatically push Iran towards the ultimate deterrence which are nuclear weapons.
