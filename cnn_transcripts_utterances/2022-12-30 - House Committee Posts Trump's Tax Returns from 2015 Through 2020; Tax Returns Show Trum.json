      "sentences": "Just about everything surrounding former President Trump is unprecedented. And now to the unprecedented move by Congress in the name of presidential transparency.House Democrats just released six years of Donald Trump's tax returns, which he had refused to do since 2015, unlike every other president since Gerald Ford. In its pursuit of getting his returns, the committee found the IRS failed to do mandatory audits of his taxes while he was president. The returns show Trump reported tens of millions of dollars in losses and that he held foreign bank accounts while in office. Let me go to CNN national correspondent, Kristen Holmes. Kristen, let's start with those foreign accounts. What are you learning about those?",

Joining me now, so I don't have to go through it and do the math, Dorothy Brown, a tax law professor at Georgetown University Law. And CNN political analyst, Margaret Talev, is back. Thank you, both. Dorothy, I wanted to ask you, there's a lot here. You know, you're quite familiar with tax returns as many of us are. But you've got the drop on it. How have you seen what has been released to the public so far, anything stand out?",

Is it Donald Trump because he has his losses and his businesses over here, he then brings into his tax returns, reducing the amount he's legally obligated to pay.Is it the American taxpayer who don't have these businesses who they can use to reduce the taxes that they pay? Making it the -- the American taxpayer pay their fair share while Donald Trump doesn't seem to be paying his fair share. And then Melania Trump, who signed a joint return for her husband, if he's found to owe extra taxes, she's on the hook for it. When I think of who the biggest loser is, I think it's the American taxpayers. The Trump tax returns show the unfairness of a system designed for those with the most to pay the least.",

      "sentences": "I want to follow up with you there. Donald Trump, it shows, paid more in foreign taxes than he did U.S. taxes in one of those years, in 2017.And in response to criticism, he said this is -- you know, the tax returns show he was, quote, \"able to use depreciation and various other tax deductions as an incentive for creating thousands of jobs,\" and as he put it, \"magnificent structures and enterprises.\" Is this simply a case of Donald Trump using the loopholes that exist in the tax code to get an advantage? BROWN: Well, first of all, all of these losses are not attributable to depreciation. But more importantly, taxpayers have the burden of proof. He's said he has all of these losses, but there's no paper trail or no evidence that he can sustain his burden of proof. For example, what Kristen said in the segment a few minutes ago, there's an example where the item -- the income is exactly equal to the deductions. That's just not plausible. But if it were, he would have records to prove it. So I don't believe he can prove that he's eligible for all these losses that he then used to lower the taxes to.",

Minutes ago, the Republicans have sent out a dissent, pointing out Democrats did not need to release Trump's returns to change the problems with the presidential audit program. We talked about the fact that he had not initially been audited as is per normal. That didn't happen until someone from the Democratic Party pointed out that they wanted to see those audits and then the audit was done several years into his presidency. Is this a valid point from the Republicans, that this needed to be put out to the public?",

On top of that, a ton of confetti will fall on revelers here tomorrow night. We are expecting to see big crowds. The past two years, they've had restrictions for COVID. All of those will be lifted. No restrictions or requirements for anyone coming here tomorrow. Mayor Eric Adams just held a briefing a short time ago, along with law enforcement officials here, talking about the public safety aspect of this event. This is a massive operation, thousands of people, as I said, in what is a really, really tight space. But public safety is the priority and they have a plan in place. Just listen to the mayor talking a little bit about tomorrow's operation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR ERIC ADAMS (D-NEW YORK CITY): The NYPD and our other local public safety apparatus, they're going to have a visible presence. But at the same time, they're going to be among the crowd so that people don't know exactly who is present and who is here. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
