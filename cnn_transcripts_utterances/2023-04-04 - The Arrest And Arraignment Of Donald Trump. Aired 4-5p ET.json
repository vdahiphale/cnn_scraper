One is a $150,000 payment made from the \"National Enquirer\" parent company AMI to Karen McDougal, a former Playboy playmate of the month, who also had alleged relationship with Donald Trump. And then third, a payment from AMI to a doorman of for a claim he was making that AMI later determined to be false.Do you dispute those three actions? Which, I'm not sure -- I mean, I suspect that the district attorney is alleging that these are violations of federal election laws, even though I don't think they go after the president, the former president for those laws. But do you -- do you dispute these assertions that these three actions happened?",

Never mind the fact that it's a personal political persecution when it comes to announcing target first and trying to string together evidence later.But that's what it goes to. You know, when you have a guy that runs for office, saying, I will get Donald Trump, it shouldn't be a surprise that he will string together a flimsy case because he feels like, hey, this is how I got here.

You've got an entire fund set up for congressional NDAs based on harassment. So it's not illegal to have it. Nobody's disputing whether there was a nondisclosure agreement. The Ninth Circuit just found out who violated it and has to pay attorney's costs. The issue is the credibility in terms of deciphering some sort of intent, looping some sort of federal felony into the case, and it's just not going to come together. It was a political promise that Alvin Bragg made and he's run through. And if I wanted to point to a particular document, the significant, it would be the federal case against him. You know, they had an interest in trying to make it into a federal prosecution. Nobody would ever accuse the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan of being afraid of going after Donald Trump. They set it up in his plea with the federal election violation is one of the charges, with all the other stuff that that Cohen had been involved in. And then he failed as a cooperator. And they couldn't even give him the 5K departure. They couldn't even give him the credit for being an honest cooperator, and that case fell apart. So, Alvin Bragg is picking up the trash that the U.S. attorney's office wouldn't touch, that his predecessor wouldn't touch that he wouldn't even touch the first time. But now, for whatever back reason, you know, back channel reason, I will be really interested in pushing for information about how he made this decision. Now we've got this case.

But I know that, you know, the attorneys will get their heads together and figure out if there's a way to try to push this earlier.

And when those three defense attorneys came out, including the newest member of the team, Todd Blanche, who spoke first as you saw when he came out and he was speaking there with reporters.Excuse me, Jake. Obviously we're sitting right outside the courthouse. It's a little bit loud over here. Todd Blanche came out and he was arguing that he believed it was boilerplate language in this indictment that nothing really surprised him. But the conversation quickly turned into questions to those attorneys to the four presidents, social media posts about this case, which we know they spent time on with the judge there in the room behind closed doors because Trump is posted in recent days about the judge himself claiming in all caps, letters that he hates him criticizing, of course, of how he presided over Allen Weisselberg case. That was the chief financial officer for the Trump Organization. He has also obviously gone after the district attorney in this case, Alvin Bragg, calling him an animal, calling him a racist attacking him at length. And also, there was the question about that post that Trump had posted on Truth Social, which included a link to a photo of Alvin Bragg next to a photo of Trump holding a baseball bat, and a photo from his time at the White House. And it was just remarkable to see those three Trump attorneys spending a lengthy amount of time right after they got out of the courthouse where their client just pleaded not guilty defending his social media post. You heard Joe Tacopina, saying he wasn't swinging the baseball bat in that picture, saying, we're not social media consultants, we're not P.R. consultants, we're attorneys, but we are seeing how those two things are colliding here because those social media posts by the former president were brought up there inside the courtroom when it came to what he has said about Alvin Bragg and about the case at large. And just a remarkable moment there to see how that has affected this, and Trump attorneys have kind of struggled with this, saying they believe some of them were ill, ill advised, saying, that's not really their purview, but certainly when you're a Trump attorney what he does post on social media, especially when it's about a case.",

It's not just relying on Michael Cohen. And he was very clear to emphasize that the crime that bumps this up from a misdemeanor to a felony includes at least two New York state crimes, in addition to a federal crime because one of the criticisms that has been -- that has been given to the D.A.'s office and the theory here is how could you possibly use a federal election crime since this is a federal election to bump up in New York state crime.Now, it should be noted that that has been done before under Cy Vance and Robert Morgenthau. There were several falsifying business records, cases that were brought under theories such as this. One of which was a big bank case that involved a lot of money in asset forfeiture, and the bank pled guilty, so it was never tested in court. But it's certainly a theory that's not novel that's been relied on in the past, but Alvin Bragg, I think wanted to make very clear that that this here also relies on New York state crimes to kind of take that out of the conversation, take that out of the motion practice because that is clearly was anticipated to be one of the big weaknesses in the case. It was a legal weakness, as opposed to a factual weakness. And obviously, another criticism of the case has been that there's been factual weaknesses in the case because it relied on storm -- on Michael Cohen. And Michael Cohen, as we know is somebody who not only has been convicted for lying to Congress but also convicted of crimes relating to this hush money scheme, as well as other crimes that he himself committed involving taxi medallions and things that had nothing to do with Donald Trump.

It's not a state crime.So how did they get here to state charges? They're relying on a state law that makes it in the first instance a misdemeanor to falsify business records. These are the repayments to Michael Cohen that were falsely logged within the Trump organization as legal fees, when they were not legal fees. One of the complicated legal questions here is in order to bump that up from a misdemeanor to a felony, you have to show that those records were falsified to commit some other crime, some second crime. Now the indictment does not specify what that second crime is. You heard the defense lawyers, I think, rightly complaining about that. The whole purpose of an indictment is to serve notice on the defendant of what exactly you're charged with, and what exactly, you're going to be defending yourself against. Now, D.A. Bragg, again who was a former colleague of mine, just clarified that a bit. He said federal campaign laws, there's going to be a legal question there, he said state campaign laws -- I'm not sure how violations related to a presidential election would count as state campaign laws. There may be some creative argument there. And he did say in passing, and it's mentioned one time in the statement of facts, tax fraud. Now there's no indication that they actually claimed a deduction. In fact, I believe they did not claim a deduction on this, but perhaps the theory is this was the plan. In terms of the evidence, it is clear that Michael Cohen is the star witness. He has referred to over and over again in the statement of facts. He is quoted at length in the statement of facts from him -- during his prior -- his prior prosecution, federally. David Pecker is an important -- important witness, too. He's mentioned here. He was actually an interesting mention, that he was invited to the White House after the inauguration, and the purpose there is to show this was campaign related, according to the D.A.

Then they're waiting about eight months to have the second hearing on it, and by the way, it's going to fall two months before the Republican primary.

They're going to lean into the fact that, you know, he has decided to downgrade sub felony offenses to misdemeanors, things like marijuana, things like trespassing.

I can say there is no basis in the statutory language to say that Trump's behavior forms either a contribution or an expenditure under federal law. The two key definitions and issue here. If it did, it would mean that every single expenditure a candidate made could be taken to have something to do with his campaign. Do I buy a $1 comb to comb my hair or $10 comb to comb my hair? If you can construe the statute to cover this behavior, then I think it violates the First Amendment because you're deeply into territory that that makes this statute absolutely, federal statute too vague for enforcement. And I just what I understood the district attorney to say that he thinks there's a New York election law involved here. All I can say is the Federal Election Campaign Act absolutely preempts any state or local law to the contrary. How could it be otherwise? You've got one law governing corporate finance and a presidential election.
