When I say big hospital, 1,100-bed hospitals but totally not functioning anymore -- totally damaged by the earthquake. So all these people who need medical care -- they can no longer go to the biggest hospital in the area. And that's why this series of tents was essentially set up in the parking lot of this hospital to take care of people. It's a remarkable situation. The tone there, Don, is very much still search and rescue, and patients are still coming in, many of whom need a lot of aid. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) GUPTA (voice-over):  The skies over Turkey are continuously pierced with the sound of helicopter blades still performing crucial search and rescue but also delivering people and goods to places hard to access and now near isolated from the rest of the world, like Antakya in Hatay Province. Look what the earthquake did in just minutes here. So many buildings razed to the ground. More than eight days later too many people still going without even basic supplies. GUPTA (on camera):  Donations continue to pour in from all over the world. To give you an idea they have things like baby formula. These are safety hard hats over here. These are the types of things that are coming in. Over here you have bread, so they have all sorts of dry foods that are coming in. These are donations that are coming from individuals. Things like blankets and warm clothes. And really, just as far as the eye can see there is all sorts of supplies that are now trying to get from this airstrip to the people who desperately need them. GUPTA (voice-over):  Over and over again spontaneous supply lines like this one formed and within minutes dozens and dozens of tents are loaded onto the helicopter. Today's mission, to provide cover and protection in Hatay, a province that has lost both. From the sky it is easy to see why they are so necessary. A group of men can be seen waiting earnestly for their temporary new homes. They quickly unload the helicopter, struggling against the whir of the blades which never stop. GUPTA (on camera):  So they've just unloaded the tents here in Hatay. This is one of the hardest-hit areas in the quake zone. GUPTA (voice-over):  Off in the distance a floating hospital -- a near necessity after natural disasters like this. After all, as with most other buildings, the hospitals often don't survive either.
