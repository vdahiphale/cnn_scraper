The grim task of burying 1000s of flood victims in Libya, as a team of scientists warned conditions on Earth may be moving outside the safe operating space for humanity. How this handshake could impact the battlefield in Ukraine, satellites, and space, and much more in between? Reaction to the Kim- Putin meeting in a live report. Plus, tech Titans go to Washington with artificial intelligence on the mind. They all agree it shouldn't be regulated, the question is how. And we do begin once again in Libya, where time is running out to find survivors from the catastrophic flooding, which has now claimed more than 6,000 lives. Search and rescue crews from around the world are arriving to help with the grim task of recovering bodies. The U.N. estimates more than 30,000 people have been displaced. Many of the images in these stories that we're about to show you our graphic. Hospitals are too overwhelmed to treat all the victims, morgues are overflowing with dead bodies lined up on the streets outside. There is no access to clean water or sanitation. And all that is leading to fears that waterborne diseases will start to spread, making this disaster even worse. Meantime, a report published last year warned that the two dams that collapse in the hardest hit city of Derna at a high potential for flood risk. More now from CNN senior international correspondent Ben Wedeman. And again, to warn you, his report does mean -- does contain some graphic content. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): The bodies are everywhere. Dozens, dozens of the dead covered in blankets, awaiting identification and burial. The dead number in the thousands. But so far, no one really knows how many were taken by Storm Daniel. Survivors are finding more and more bodies. Rescue workers and volunteers have retrieved the body of a boy wrapped in a blanket and prepared to put him in a body bag. When his father arrives, overcome with emotion. Doctors fear so many dead left in the open could lead to an outbreak of disease. We aren't able to identify all the bodies and bury them, says this woman identified as Dr. Aishah (PH). We want to provide a humane place, freezers, where loved ones can then identify them. Access to Derna remains difficult. The flood destroyed many roads and bridges leading to the city. This port in Eastern Libya has been transformed into a waste land of mud, rubble, and ruin. The ranging waters that tore through the city spared no one and nothing. Ben Wedeman, CNN, Rome.

If you'd like to contribute, you can find a list of vetted charities and other resources at cnn.com/impact.Now, conditions like those devastating floods, extreme storms, and oppressive heat waves show that human actions have pushed the Earth into a danger zone outside the, \"safe operating space for humanity\". And that's according to a new report from some 29 scientists in eight countries. The researchers analyzed nine connected planetary boundaries or threats thresholds that the world must stay within in order to ensure that the earth is stable, and here is the key, livable. The boundaries include climate change, biodiversity, freshwater and land use, and the impact of aerosols, and synthetic chemicals. The report says human activities have indeed breached the safe levels of the six of those thresholds. OK, there is some good news here. Thanks to international efforts to phase out ozone depleting chemicals. The ozone layer is on track to completely recover. [02:05:00] But critics say the planetary boundaries model is too simplistic and not useful for managing environmental problems. Those environmental problems, in fact, those natural disasters and extreme weather events have taken as we have shown you here 1000s of lives, and that is just in this month. Now, the U.N. wants to change that and save lives by making sure every person on the planet is covered by an early warning system. Within the next few years. Johan Stander is the director of the services at the World Meteorological Organization, and he joins us now from Geneva, Switzerland.

Secretary-General Guterres, requested that everybody should be protected by early warning systems in five years, and that was now last year.And we're already in 2023. So, we've actually got four years and a couple of months left. He said, it now forces U.N. agencies to actually work together towards a common goal. And that was the first goal. So, between the WMO the World Meteorological Organization and the UNDRR, we are co-leading this effort with other U.N. agencies, like the ITU, (INAUDIBLE), UNESCO, and others. We also working with big tech companies like Microsoft and Google. And also, then, the funding agencies like sustainable observation finance facility, the Climate Risk and Early Warning Systems and the Green Climate Fund, The World Bank, to name a few. Now, in this entire process, the idea then is to make sure that there is a standard system put in place in countries to make sure that, number one, they understand the risk. And all of this is built around the multi hazard early warning system, but it's a people centric, multi hazard early warning system, based on the four pillars. Need to understand the risk, and those people at risk, making sure that there's sufficient observation data available, and dissemination with the production of weather forecasts and warnings. And then, making sure that, that warning gets to the people. And last but not least, working with disaster management agencies, by getting the people on the ground to understand what the impact will be in a particular area, or what they need to do to make sure that they are protected.",

That will limit fake news to start off with. And then, that national meteorological and hydrological service through these national workshops, which we are conducting, are then working with disaster management agencies to make sure that when this message is sent in a common alert, practical method, it's then taken by the media in that particular country and or worldwide. And then, the message is automatically disseminated on the mobile phone using either the mobile tablets or going through media, or if the cell phone towers are off, we working with satellite providers to make sure that the message can still be received by the individual on the phone.",

But to get those community leaders to understand if they do get this message, what to do, the protection of the little property at the moment is not that important, the protection of their lives are both important.

At the end of the day, it's the government that needs to buy into the system. And that's what we tried to foster when we have these national workshops in countries where there might be a little bit instability. And I can tell you that we are making good progress.

We're now watching and waiting to see where Kim will head next. According to President Putin and Russian state media, the North Korean leader will be visiting several military sites, and that includes as you're seeing on your map there, Vladivostok and the Eastern Federal University. Now, the West fears these deepening ties will result in a fresh supply of weapons for Russia to use in Ukraine, but without providing any evidence. Ukraine's defense intelligence said that North Korea is already supplying Russia with ammunition. CNN cannot verify that allegation. CNN's Katie Polglase is with us in London.

And clearly, when Putin was pressed about whether there is any possibility of military cooperation, he said, there are prospects, it is something we can discuss. And really that is enough to confirm the fears of Ukraine and also the U.S. officials that have been warning for weeks that there may be an arms deal on the table. And, in fact, as you mentioned, earlier, Ukraine's defense intelligence is saying that this is not news to them, actually, that they actually already have intelligence, saying that North Korea is delivering ammunition to Russia. Now, we cannot independently verify that that is not what the Western officials are currently saying. But certainly, very interesting that, that indicates Ukraine is actively monitoring this situation. They believe that Russia has been receiving projectiles for artillery and projectiles for MLRS, those are the multiple launch rocket systems that have had devastating impact in some of this conflict in Ukraine, including impact on civilians. Now, look, in the broader context of this counter offensive that Ukraine is continuing, if we remember, just yesterday, there was a major attack on Sevastopol by Ukraine. It is held by Russia, 24 people injured as a result. Clearly, Ukraine, still has confidence to progress with this counter offensive. It still has its backers. But at the same time, while we're also seeing this up further north on the frontline, we're seeing 1,000s of Ukrainians evacuated from Kupiansk, an area in the Kharkiv region. And that is because of Russian attacks in that area. Clearly, both sides are progressing with this war, continuing to attack, and it shows that this war is really dragging on at this point. And it becomes a question of supply lines. Who has the biggest backers, who has the supply of ammunition, who has the supply of weaponry? And if Russia is going to gain more ammunition, more supply for their side of this war, clearly that is something Ukraine is going to be very concerned about.",

      "sentences": "It's been stuck off the east coast of Greenland since  Monday, sitting on a bed of sand and mud, according to the Danish Armed Forces. Initial attempts by the cruise ship to refloat itself at high tide have failed, as did a tug from a fishing research vessel owned by Greenland on Wednesday.Help is on the way, but it could take a while. According to Denmark's Joint Arctic Command, a Royal Danish Naval Ship is en route. But it is taking time. It's hit some bad weather, and currently, it's expected to arrive on Friday evening. Troops from a Danish Military Dog Sled Patrol are also in the area in the event of an emergency. They actually boarded the vessel on Tuesday and said everyone was doing well. The Australian cruise operator of the ship, Aurora Expeditions, released a statement saying all passengers, the expedition team and crew onboard are safe and well. Importantly, there is no immediate danger to themselves, the vessel, or the surrounding environment. Hopefully, that continues. An extended stop at the coast of Greenland wasn't the plan, but perhaps passengers can enjoy the luxury cruise ship's hot tubs, its gym, its spa, and the views don't look too bad either.
