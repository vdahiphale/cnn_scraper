      "sentences": "Hello, I'm John Vause at CNN in Atlanta.We begin with breaking news from Gaza where Israel says military operations have resumed after a deadline to extend a seven day long truce expired an hour ago, dashing hopes for the release of more hostages being held by Hamas. According to the IDF, Hamas violated the truce by firing a rocket towards Israeli territory an hour before the deadline, it was intercepted by Israeli air defenses. Hamas officials in Gaza report Israeli aircraft now over Gaza with the sound of artillery fire in the north. The operational pause was extended on Thursday after last minute deal, and despite Israel's demand for 10 hostages released daily, Hamas released eight. According to an Israeli official, two women were set free initially followed by another six just hours later, who were being held in a separate location in Gaza. Also Thursday, another 30 Palestinian women and children were released from Israeli prisons as part of the agreement with Hamas. Many had been held under administrative detention and had never officially been charged. There is also new reporting from the \"New York Times\" that Israel knew a year ago about how Hamas plan to carry out its deadly attack. While the actual date was not known, details in the intelligence report was stunningly accurate, but ultimately dismissed by Israeli officials as aspirational and not operational. CNN's Jeremy Diamond joins us live from Ashkelon in southern Israel with the very latest. So, what do we know about the ongoing military offensive in Gaza by the Israelis? And is there any word on what Hamas is doing in response?",

      "sentences": "-- the war between Israel and Hamas appears to be very much back on reports of Israeli airstrikes in northern and southern Gaza as well as rocket fire from Hamas air -- targeting areas of southern Israel. In the last several minutes we have seen multiple rocket sirens sounding in different parts of southern Israel, including the town of Sderot as well as areas further south, excuse me, closer to the Kerem Shalom crossing where of course over the last week we have seen as over 100 hostages have been, freed many of them through that very border crossing. We have seen, of course, that this deal has not only seen the release of hostages, but it's also seen hundreds of trucks of aid per day enter the Gaza Strip, and a much needed pause in the fighting and a much needed respite from the relentless bombardment of the Gaza Strip for civilians living in Gaza. All of that appears to now be over, as the Israeli military says that Hamas violated the operational pause by firing rockets before that 07And now the question is will this war widen even beyond what we have seen already so far? For weeks now, Israeli military and political leaders have signaled very strongly that the next phase of this war would involve pushing ground operations further south, into the southern part of the Gaza Strip. Until now, while the Israeli military has been bombing across all parts of Gaza, the ground component has really been focused on the northern half of the Gaza Strip, but we could see that escalate now. And we know that both Israel and Hamas had made clear that if this -- if and when rather this pause in fighting ended, that both sides would very much return to the fight.",

They're not done there yet. And they will stay there for some period of time before moving into southern Israel. And that's when it gets really tricky. Because we've heard from the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who was in the region on Thursday, he spoke with Netanyahu.He then also talked to reporters afterwards about this plan about civilian protection zones. I think we have the sound from the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, this is what he told -- we do? No, we do not. He basically told Benjamin Netanyahu that before they begin this next phase of the operation, they want civilian protection plans put in place, they do not want to repeat of the first seven weeks of this war, which ended up with a death toll of mostly civilians, somewhere around 15,000, with every second home in Gaza, pretty much destroyed.

Is it -- once this fighting ramps up, is it possible, I guess, to just call it, you know, to ramp it down again and back off? I mean, is this sort of maybe this is a false start, we could be into this for a couple of hours, possibly, and then they could go back to this temporary pause in fighting?

So I think that it's very possible that we may see something of a pause in the action in the next few hours or the next day or so, that is definitely possible.The other course, of course, is that it couldn't be, you know, something that, you know, is irretrievably broken, and that things will go into a very bad spiral.

And so there's all this, it's -- you know, that's what would be in everybody's best interest, I guess, at this point, especially for the hostages, because while the fighting is ongoing there will be no release of any more hostages from Gaza.I want to ask you about this report from \"New York Times,\" which came out a couple of hours ago that Israel knew pretty much every detail, every battle plan about -- every detail about this attack on October 7 that Hamas was planning. And they knew it a year ago, a year before the attack happened. They didn't know the date, but the details was stunningly accurate from this 40 page document, which was put together by intelligence officials. So it wasn't an intelligence failure, it's more of a failure to, you know, connect the dots, if you like. I raised this because if they go into the second stage of this war, other concerns that, you know, they've underestimated Hamas, you know, in some kind of way once they're on this ground offensive. Because that's why it is so important that Israel works out where it went wrong in the initial stage and why that October 7 attack happened, because now they're involved in a very dangerous and potentially costly ground war in Gaza, which could go on for quite some time.",

And it's very clear from what happened on the seventh of October that Hamas is undergone a lot of preparation, their execution of their plan was very good. I and it was, you know, from a military standpoint, and it was something that they did with precision, they did it, you know, by their standards very professionally, and it was highly organized. So, that indicates that there is a degree of discipline within the Hamas fighters that perhaps the Israelis haven't counted on. And that could, that could present some difficulties, especially if they move into other areas of Gaza.Now, of course, no plan is, you know, always successful, you know, in warfare, and it's very possible that their discipline that they exhibited on the seventh of October will fall apart once they actually make a lot of contact with IDF forces. But the Israelis have to be at least prepared for a more disciplined foe, and that is something that could change the equation in some tactical engagements. I think Israel would still prevail in a force on force type scenario. But this war is more about the ideology, and in essence, the popular sentiment as opposed to a actual force on force type issues.",

      "sentences": "Well, we're told that the negotiations are continuing that they will continue despite what we're seeing tonight, in terms of an official Israeli declaration of a resumption in the fighting. We haven't seen, John, any kind of official statement from any of the parties involved that talks have officially broken down. And so, what it looks like now is that rather than going into an eighth day of pause and an eighth day of hostage release, Israel appears to have decided that Hamas has come up short. Remember that over the course of the past seven days, and it's really quite remarkable that it has lasted this long, Hamas had agreed to release at least 10 hostages per day, they actually ended up releasing more than that. But for whatever reason, and we're still trying to figure that out, Hamas did not offer up a list of 10 people that Israel appears to have found acceptable.And so now, we see this resumption of the fighting. Of course, earlier in the night and early local time, we did see a rocket flying out of Gaza towards Israel that was intercepted. So, John, the question had been at what point would this pause and it now does appear to have ended after a week. But the Biden administration and other parties involved in these hostage talks had said that those new negotiations would continue. So even amid the fighting, now we're essentially back to a pre pause situation where the fighting will continue. We of course, don't know how aggressive it's going to be, how widespread it's going to be. But the expectation is that the conversations will continue over these hostages, mediated by Egypt and Qatar, who are in touch with Hamas.

Alex, we heard from the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken who was in the region on Thursday, and, you know, the other half of these humanitarian pauses or operation pauses, whatever you call them, was the entry of humanitarian assistance into Gaza, which is so desperately needed right now. Blinken was talking about, you know, ramping that -- those aid convoys up to get more help to the people of Gaza because right now they're basically boiling rocks for soup, if they're lucky. If this fighting then ramps up, that obviously then makes getting humanitarian assistance into Gaza a whole lot harder. So where do things stand with that?",

Now the U.S. is saying that regardless of what happens or had said before this outbreak in the fighting, renewed outbreak and the fighting, that regardless of what happened that the aid would continue and that they had assurances from Israel that this aid would continue. So the expectation is that food, fuel, medicine, water will continue going into the Gaza strip from the Rafah crossing in Egypt. But John with fighting, it's obviously going to be extremely difficult not just to get in but to be distributed. So that is the big concern here. But the top line is that the U.S. sought assurances from Israel, that regardless of what happened with the hostages and with the fighting that this aid would continue, which is so desperately needed. You have the majority of the Gazan population that is now displaced. They have been getting aid in during this pause in the fighting, but everybody you talk to on the ground whether it's a regular citizen or an aid worker will tell you that it's not nearly enough, so much more is needed.",
