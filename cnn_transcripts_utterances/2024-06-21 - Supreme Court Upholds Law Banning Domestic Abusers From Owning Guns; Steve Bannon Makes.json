The U.S. Supreme Court is upholding a federal law that bans domestic abusers from owning a firearm. The Major Second Amendment ruling was nearly unanimous eight to one decision only Justice Clarence Thomas dissented. In the majority opinion the Chief Justice John Roberts said the court had, quote, no trouble upholding the law arguing and once again, I'm quoting, our tradition of firearm regulation allows the government to disarm individuals who present a credible threat to the physical safety of others, close quote.Our chief legal affairs correspondent Paula Reid is here with me in the CNN Newsroom.

      "sentences": "It is. It's one of the key decisions that we're watching for this term. And here the Supreme Court holds that the Second Amendment like other rights has limits. And here they're focused on domestic violence offenders and banning them from owning firearms. And it's interesting that the Chief Justice said they, quote, had no trouble reaching this decision, because he also acknowledges that some recent decisions that they've made expanding Second Amendment rights have caused confusion in the lower courts.He writes, quote, some courts have misunderstood the methodology of our recent Second Amendment cases. These precedents were not meant to suggest a law trapped in amber. As we explained in a different gun case, Heller, for example, the reach of the Second Amendment is not limited only to those arms that were in existence at the founding. So this is one of the questions that has come back up to the Supreme Court since they expanded the definition of the Second Amendment. But here, this is a big win for gun, those who want to limit people from having guns if they pose a threat to others. In the oral arguments, the Solicitor General pointed to the fact that someone who lives with someone and they are a survivor of domestic violence from that individual is five times more likely to die if that person has a gun. And of course, there was a dissent from Justice Clarence Thomas, who writes, quote, the court and the government do not point to a single historical law, revoking a citizen Second Amendment right, based on possible interpersonal violence. Now, he also notes that this is based on a protective order, not a conviction. That's something that he really focused on. And he said in the interest of ensuring the government can regulate one subset of society, today's decision puts at risk the Second Amendment rights of many more, which is why he dissented.",

And I have to say, you know, I was just in the courtroom where the Chief Justice laid out his reasoning and read it from the bench, with many people there watching waiting for this case that had been argued on November 7th. So even though it was predictable that they were going to uphold this law that certainly is targeted at dangerous people, there was a question of how they would.And I think it's really important for people to understand that the 2022 decision that's now the baseline for any kind of gun regulations, when they expanded Second Amendment rights, they have not further clarified exactly how that should play out for other kinds of gun regulations. We noted in this case, Chief Justice John Roberts stressed that this man, you know, posed a very credible threat, and that our history and tradition of gun regulations, targeting people who pose that kind of threat and who are a menace to use a word back from two centuries ago, a menace to society. That kind of regulation could be upheld. But Wolf fear something important, the Chief Justice rights for a majority, eight to one, as Paula said, but a majority of other justices break off to explain their idea of how gun regulations should be assessed. Justice Sotomayor, joined by Elena Kagan wrote separately, Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, Amy Coney Barrett and Justice Jackson all wrote separately to put in their two cents about how to weigh gun regulations coming up from other kinds of cases that would be unlike just this one that specifically targeted individuals who are subjected to domestic violence restraining orders.

Now, we all may know of a high profile individual who's charged under that statute, that's Hunter Biden. And I would think that a challenge is coming to the appeals courts and maybe even the Supreme Court on the section of it that he was charged with as well. So that's one thing.Two, I want to pick up where Joan left off on the 2022 opinion, Bruin is the name of the opinion and the mess, quite frankly, that the Supreme Court left with that case, setting aside the morality of what we think of firearms, how the Supreme Court crafted the scheme of how we regulate and the court will adjudicate them. It's very complicated. The language he -- Chief Justice Roberts use today is consistent with our nation's tradition of firearms regulation. That's -- if something is consistent with our tradition, OK. If it seems not, not OK. Now, the question is, how do you assess that? And I think the justices today are grappling with, does something need to be the historical twin of a regulation that existed in 1780 or whatever else? Or does it need to be an analogue sort of similar enough that it passes muster? And I assure you, the court is going to struggle with this for years, if not decades to come because of and I'll say it again, the mess that they created an opening masked in (ph) Bruin.",

I think that his lawyers, if they have enough resources, resources have been a big question right now, in the Hunter Biden camp, they will likely try to appeal that and possibly bring it back up to the Supreme Court trying to sort of seize on some of the concerns that were raised by the justices about just how far this extends. They'll try to differentiate him from someone who has a protective order, argue that his use of illicit drugs alleges, they would say, is different.

That was a regulatory question.It was a very important one. And there the court split six to three to say that, no, the way the federal prohibition dating back to the 1930s on machine guns was written, it should not encompass bump stocks, a very controversial decision there but not having to do with the Second Amendment. Whereas here, this really is the kind of case that's going to have reverberations for the other sorts of incidents we're talking about for federal and state gun regulations, just how to assess whether they encroach on a person's right to bear arms.

Now another former Trump adviser, Peter Navarro, had tried a similar move in front of the Supreme Court to pause his own conviction.And the Supreme Court rejected that. So we'll see if they do the same with Steve Bannon's case or if they see it somewhat differently. All of this comes after late last night. An appeals court said it was not going to press pause on Steve Bannon's sentence. Now there was one judge who dissented in that opinion that's giving the Bannon team a little bit of hope when it comes to the Supreme Court. But, look, this is not a long time coming. Steve Bannon was convicted two years ago of contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over documents or provide testimony to the House Committee that investigated January 6ath.
