He's been rumored to be a potential Trump vice presidential pick, and he's here in the studio with us. Congressman, why does former President Trump keep repeating those statistics that are very easy to fact check and are not true? REP. BYRON DONALDS (R-FL): Well, a couple of things, Abby. First, it's good to be with you. Now, let me say this. It is without question, whether you're black, brown, white, doesn't matter, we were all doing better under Donald Trump.

A lot of people probably don't know that about you. But one of the interesting things that's come up is that you have this bill that you support that addresses crime in D.C.

No other states in the country does that. No other jurisdiction does that. So, all we did in the nation's capital is say you're going to treat D.C. offenders 18 and younger as minors, like everybody else does. That's what we did.

This time he's claiming that his relationship with Putin could secure the release of wrongfully detained \"Wall Street Journal\" reporter Evan Gershkovich. He's facing espionage charges, and Gershkovich has been detained in Russia since last March.Now, Trump insists that Gershkovich and his release would happen immediately after the election, saying that Putin would do it for him. The Kremlin denies that, for whatever that's worth. And as my next guest will show, Putin didn't do it in the past. American Marine Trevor Reed was detained in Russia for nearly three years. Half of that time was during Trump's presidency. Trevor was released in a prisoner swap in April of 2022 through efforts by the Biden administration. His father, Joey Reed, joins me now. Joey, thank you for being here. I wonder, what went through your mind when you hear that Trump is essentially tying his own election win to the release of someone else who is wrongfully detained in Russia?",

He didn't bring any home that I know of from North Korea, China, or Russia. But he did bring home several people that, in many of those cases, people didn't really hear about.I don't believe it's a priority for him, or he would have brought home my son and Paul Whelan. The Detroit Press had an Insider article in 2022 that said that it was an offer for Paul Whelan back during his administration, and Trump turned down that deal. We know that there was offers to trade Paul Whelan and my son, Trevor Reed, for Victor Boot and possibly for Yaroshenko. And that was turned down by the Biden administration and possibly by the Trump administration also. And then, of course, later, Victor Boot was traded in a sole trade for Brittney Griner. And at that point, the Russians had decided not to trade for Paul Whelan because they understand our politics, which is what's driving most of these deals, is our internal politics, Republicans against Democrats and vice versa. And it's not so much about the international part of it. They're using us, are infighting to make their moves with using Americans as pawns.",

The Louisville Police Department released this video from a fixed pole camera that's across the street from where the incident occurred. And it shows some of last Friday's interaction between Scheffler and police.While the original police reports claim that the golfer, quote, \"dragged the arresting officer to the ground with his car,\" it's not clear in this video that that actually happened. That arresting officer is also now in trouble for not recording the incident on his body camera. Scheffler faces a felony and lesser charges for allegedly ignoring police instructions in the wake of an earlier incident, Scheffler says he didn't know about. Joining me now is senior media reporter at \"Axios\" Sara Fischer. Sara, I didn't have on my bingo card that golf would be the place where we would be talking about whether police narratives as they are given are actually true. But that's actually what's been happening here is that people are like, did this actually happen the way that it was purported to have gone down?",
