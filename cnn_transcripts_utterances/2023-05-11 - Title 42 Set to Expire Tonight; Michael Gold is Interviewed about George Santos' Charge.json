Others thought that Title 42 ending meant that the border would be shut down entirely. So, there's a bit of misunderstanding about this policy, which has led to the numbers that we're seeing waiting on the other side in Mexico.And you talked about the border patrol chief in the intro sort of downplaying, thinking that we're right in the middle of this already. And that's kind of what we're hearing from team Brownsville here at this respite center. They're under the impression that the last two weeks they've been dealing with this so-called surge and they're not sure how much worse it can get but they are prepared and bracing for that to happen.

This has 150-mile range which allows it to strike, as you said, Poppy, deep into Russian-held territory in eastern Ukraine. Also in Crimea.As you mentioned, part of the agreement here is that Ukrainian forces have agreed not to target Russian territory proper. But as this comes just in advance of a highly anticipated Ukrainian counter offensive, it tended to regain some of that Russian or all of that Russian territory in the view of Ukrainian officials. It's an enormous step forward in terms of capability for the forces. And I should note, it's a kind of system that the U.S. has refused to give Ukraine due to concerns that that range might make Russia skittish, in effect, and spark retaliation. I should note, a western official is telling me this morning, quote, the U.K. has previously said that it will supply Ukraine with long- range weapons. This will now include a number of Storm Shadow missiles. The British government has been clear that this is only in response to Russia's deliberate targeting of civilian national infrastructure and is a proportionate response. But I don't think we can underestimate what effect this will have in terms of how far Ukraine can strike and timing is key here because they are about, by all - you know, perhaps you might say the worst kept secret, right, in national security circles that they are planning and preparing for a counter offensive to take back a lot of that Russian territory.",
