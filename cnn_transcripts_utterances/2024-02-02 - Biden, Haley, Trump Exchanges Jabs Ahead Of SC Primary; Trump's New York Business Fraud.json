In the last few days, the campaign, all of them, have turned into a stream of name-calling from each candidate, albeit some of it behind closed doors.Donald Trump says Joe Biden is the worst president in the history of our country. Nikki Haley calls Donald Trump too old and too tantrum- prone to be president. And Politico reporting today that behind closed doors, Joe Biden reportedly said Donald Trump was a sick effort. I'm joined now by CNN political commentator and former South Carolina State Representative Bakari Sellers and Republican strategist, Maura Gillespie. All right, I'm going to start with you, Maura, because of these numbers that have come out. They are almost shockingly strong. They are not what was predicted by the experts that watch this economy. How are the Republicans going to deal with this because it can't be a point necessarily on the trail for too much longer?",

And, you know, if these numbers continue to trend the way they are, that's a net positive for Joe Biden. Because I think there are a lot of people who perhaps don't enjoy Trump's inability to control himself and his comments and truly his juvenile behavior.But they can't continue to support or will -- won't support a Joe Biden and Kamala Harris president -- administration because of the way things are right now with the border, with the economy, and how they're not feeling it in their pockets right now. So, I think there's a real opportunity there for Joe Biden to capitalize on this for sure.",

The highest being under Ronald Reagan.The -- for the first time in American history for a full year, the black unemployment rate was under six percent. The lowest in history was under Joe Biden, right? And so, these numbers really matter. What has to happen, though, and I hope the White House is listening clearly, the numbers are telling the truth about the economy, but people still necessarily are not filling it in their pockets.

But if she wants to take -- I mean, it's true. The blessing of Nikki Haley right now is that she's telling the truth about Donald Trump with conservative bona fides. Like she is a conservative governor. She was a -- she is a tried-and- true conservative. She's actually more conservative than Donald Trump. But she's telling the truth about the person who will be the nominee.

Judge Arthur Engoron, who is still deliberating is considering the attorney general's argument that Trump and his company should pay $370 million for fraudulent claims.Now in the meantime, Allen Weisselberg, the man who spent decades as Trump's chief financial officer in his real estate empire is on the verge of pleading guilty for the second time. CNN's Katelyn Polantz is with us now. Katelyn, let's start with the timing here from Judge Arthur Engoron, who initially told us all probably January 31, you'd have a verdict. KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME &amp; JUSTICE REPORTER: John, it takes some time to write a verdict. We are waiting for this written opinion from Judge Engoron who heard this trial, this trial Well, that went on for months in the fall and into December. They closed the trial about three weeks ago and the judge had said publicly, he was hoping to come to a decision on the damages that the Trump organization should face by the end of January. That obviously didn't happen. Now, we're into February. And now, a court spokesperson is saying publicly it might not be until mid-February. A couple other weeks, things could change still for when there may be a final decision from the judge on what should happen here to the Trump company, what they should be facing for the result of this suit from the attorney general's office in New York, accusing Trump and his organization of civil fraud and asking for $370 million in a reward there to the state and additional punishment for Trump and the company. But there is a long arm here. We're not just waiting for the judge's decision on damages here. We are also watching to see exactly how quickly. Because a court- appointed monitor looking at the company say -- is saying there are inconsistencies. There needs to be corrections in this business and the way they're doing reporting. And then in top of -- on top of that, as you mentioned, the former CFO Allen Weisselberg of the Trump organization already serving a jail sentence for unrelated tax fraud charges. He is potentially getting the squeeze from Manhattan district attorney prosecutors as they look to take Trump to trial for his business practices as well, that there is a possibility of new charges against Allen Weisselberg.
