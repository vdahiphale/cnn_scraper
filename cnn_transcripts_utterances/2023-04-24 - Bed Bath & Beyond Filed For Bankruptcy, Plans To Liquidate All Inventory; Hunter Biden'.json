      "sentences": "It really has. Yes, this has been a long time coming, Boris. So, quite a few reasons for why Bed Bath &amp; Beyond's sales had been slumping for years. In fact, sales had peaked about 2014, and they have slumped since then. So, one reason is, of course, the rise of ecommerce. Ecommerce players also offer convenience but they offer low prices, so they were undercut there.The rise of stiff competition from the likes of the Walmart's of the world, the Targets of the world. And then, Boris, the pandemic also really hurt Bed Bath &amp; Beyond quite significantly. Now, I should say, the company had been trying to turn itself around in recent years. It had a management shakeup at the top. It had closed hundreds of stores even before this announcement. And we had even heard some reporting last summer that certain stores were trying to cut back on utility expenses by cutting back on A/C expenses in the middle of the summer. So, the company had been trying to prevent this from happening for quite some time, but ultimately making this announcement on Sunday. So, what does this mean for consumers? If you shopped there or if you plan to shop there, well, the company says that if you have a coupon, you need to move fast. You have until Wednesday to use those. If you have a gift card, you have a little bit longer, through May 8th. And if you have a return, you have about a month, until May 24th. One analyst saying in a research note today, Boris, management refused to go down without a fight. New comments coming from Neil Saunders, and explored every option to avoid bankruptcy, but they simply could not defy gravity forever.",

And we expect another round of layoffs from Disney according to the company before the summer begins.All told, we're expecting about 7,000 Disney workers. And we can show you within the Disney company who we expect to be impacted. ESPN, Disney Parks Entertainment. I should say that frontline workers at the resorts, at the theme parks, they are not expected to be impacted. But Boris, Disney and other media companies, of course, have found themselves really victim to a slowing advertising environment, as companies prepare for the potential for a recession. So, you know, it's one of these interesting realities that even if we are not necessarily in a recession yet, companies are already starting to prepare for that likelihood and starting to pull back on their advertising dollars.

He's now launching a new legal barrage in an aggressive strategy to strike back. In a letter, Hunter Biden's attorneys are asking the Treasury Department's inspector general and the Office of Congressional Ethics to launch inquiries into some Republicans pushing for investigations into their client, him. Among them, they want a review of former Donald Trump aide GarrettZiegler, who allegedly acquired and published online financial activities of Hunter Biden. And they're also asking for an ethics review of Georgia Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene. Saying that she has made, quote, continuous verbal attacks, defamatory statements, publication of personal photos and data, and promotion of conspiracy theories about and against Robert Hunter Biden. Sound and read like schoolyard insults rather than the work of a member of Congress. We have CNN legal analyst and former federal prosecutor Elliott Williams here with us now on this.

Engineers are evaluating surrounding structures now.Also, look at this heart-pounding video. A skier helmet camera captured his sudden and his unstoppable slide into a deep crevice, this in the French Alps. You can see he managed to use his skis to slow his descent, ultimately coming to a stop. He saved his own life, it seems. And if you love French fries like I do, you're not loving this story. A new study finds that eating fried food, specifically fried potatoes, could raise your risk of anxiety and depression. Researchers in China say it might be due to a chemical found in fries. Outside experts, however, say the results are just preliminary. They claim people who are already anxious or depressed may be seeking out those foods.

Fortunately, the plane landed safely, and the FAA says it's now investigating.

American Airlines says the plane returned to the gate and takeoff was canceled after passengers saw that. Also, remember the Southwest Airlines meltdown over the holidays?
