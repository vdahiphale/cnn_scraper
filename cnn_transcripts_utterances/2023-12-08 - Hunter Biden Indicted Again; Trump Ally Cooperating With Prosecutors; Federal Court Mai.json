The Justice Department said that he could get up to 17 years in prison if he's found guilty of these latest charges. Three of them are felonies. In a 56-page indictment, special counsel David Weiss accuses Hunter Biden of evading $1.4 million in taxes over a four-year period despite the fact that he had the money. And even when he did pay, one year, prosecutors say he used false business deductions. This is Hunter Biden's second indictment since his plea agreement with federal prosecutors fell apart in July. In that first indictment, he was charged with several low-level gun offenses. CNN senior justice correspondent Evan Perez is here following this for us. This indictment goes into pretty spectacular detail.",

He was making millions of dollars in his business dealings in Ukraine and China and, because of his own personal issues, did not pay these taxes. I mean, we're talking about, you know, $2,700 paid on pornography, $188,000 that they counted used on adult entertainment, things that they say instead he could have been doing to make -- , you know, -- have his business be, you know, pay its taxes that were due. Right. We heard from Hunter Biden's attorney who says that this is all a political indictment. I'll read you just a part of what he says. He says Hunter's last name was anything other than Biden. The charges in Delaware, which is the gun charges, and now in California, would not have been brought. And, of course, you know, the politics of this, we cannot escape, obviously. We know the campaign is now in full swing. And the president's son makes clear what he believes, Republicans are trying to do by going after him. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HUNTER BIDEN, SON OF U.S. PRESIDENT: They are trying to, in their most illegitimate way, but rational way, they're trying to destroy a presidency. And so, it's not about me. In their most base way, what they're trying to do is they're trying to kill me, knowing that it will be a pain greater than my father could be able to handle. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "We want to dig deeper now with Democratic Congressman Robert Garcia of California. He's a member of the House Oversight Committee. Congressman, thank you so much for sharing part of your afternoon with us. These nine new charges, they're far more serious than what was in that plea deal that Hunter originally agreed to, the one that fell apart over the summer. Republicans are arguing that this is happening because IRS whistleblowers came forward saying the DOJ was taking it easy on Hunter. Do you think these new charges are proof that the Justice Department was trying to give the president's son a sweetheart deal.REP. ROBERT GARCIA (D-CA): Well, look, I think a couple of things are really important to note. I think first, look, Hunter is going to be held accountable by the courts, by a judge, and he will be held accountable for all of these charges so that he's a private citizen and he will go through the judicial process. It's also very clear that the accusations of the Republicans and saying that somehow President Biden controls or is weaponizing the Justice Department is absolutely false. I mean, they're literally taking Hunter through a judicial process for all these indictments. But what's happening right now is Republicans are trying to turn all of this, particularly around Hunter Biden, into a huge political sham and impeachment where there's been absolutely zero evidence. Republicans have said so. Republicans in Congress continue to admit that there's been zero evidence linking the president to any of Hunter Biden's business dealings. In what you all just discussed right now in the document that's been presented, to the court as well, there's zero evidence of the president doing anything that connects him to his business dealings. And so, what this is, is essentially just a big political sham that Republicans and James Comer are trying to impose on President Biden because they want to damage him and they want to get Donald Trump re- elected. That's what this is all about, is it's political. And the Oversight Committee, we want Hunter Biden to come in and talk to us publicly, but Republicans refuse.",

He actually echoed claims from IRS whistleblowers that investigators weren't allowed to follow evidence that they felt might lead them to President Biden. So you say there is no evidence. These IRS whistleblowers are saying potentially there is, but they weren't allowed to pursue it. That's why Republicans say they want a formal vote on an impeachment inquiry. Your response?R. GARCIA: I mean, look, what's really important in all these proceedings, is that we allow the Justice Department to do its job. The Justice Department has and should treat every person with the same level of due diligence, with the same level of inquiry. And they are doing that right now with Hunter Biden, who is a private citizen. And so as far as James Comer, every single investigation that James Comer has brought before the Oversight Committee, of which I sit on, has been completely political. He's brought forward witnesses who ended up being spies. He's brought forward witnesses that end up having zero evidence linking the president to anything. And so, I think what's really important is that us as members of Congress should not be trying to get involved in the Justice Department's process. Our job is oversight. We present information. The Justice Department oftentimes works with committee members, as well as with committee staff, to pass along information that we're able to give. But at the end of the day, the Justice Department has got to make those decisions. And James Comer should get out of trying to be the judge and the jury on Hunter Biden, and certainly on President Biden.",

Do Republicans have the vote?R. GARCIA: I mean, look, we don't know. But what we do know is this is an extreme political stunt. I mean, Marjorie Taylor Greene and other extremists in Congress have been trying to impeach President Biden from day one, before he was barely just taking office. And so their entire goal here is to damage President Biden and not actually work and focus on what matters for the American public. We have a war in Ukraine. that needs our serious attention. We have a budget that needs to get passed so we can actually fund the government if they want to spend their time on this kind of sham impeachment inquiry. There will be a vote. Whether it passes or not is going to be up to Republicans. Democrats are united in actually trying to get to work and do the work for the American people. What we do know is that there is zero evidence to open up an impeachment inquiry. This has been repeated by Republican members in Congress, witnesses that we have that have been deposed, and also, I think, by anyone that actually is following this case understands that this is all political.",

And Republicans want some concessions from Democrats on border security, potentially changes to immigration policy. Have you gotten a sense of how much it would take to get House Republicans to back whatever deal comes out of this? The Senate when it comes to immigration?R. GARCIA: Well, first of all, we know that House Republicans want to pass the most extreme anti-immigrant, anti-asylum laws around immigration in this country. I mean, things that demonize immigrants, that demonize people that are here working, that are serving, that are students, that are just here trying to be part of this country. We know that that's already the Republican proposal. And so, this idea that we're going to politicize funding for Ukraine, for Israel, for humanitarian aid in Gaza, and tie that to extremist policies across around the border, I think is crazy. And so, what Democrats are trying to do is be very clear that we are ready to pass a package that includes foreign aid, but to tie it to extreme Republican proposals around the border is absolutely wrong. And I think we're standing up and saying that is not acceptable to us. And we're hopeful that both the White House, our Senate partners, and certainly Democrats in the House stick to those principles.",

And this news, Brianna, is the first time that word has emerged, the first indication of a criminal investigation in Wisconsin.That means that there are now criminal state investigations in six of the seven states where the Trump campaign tried to pull off this caper. Three of those investigations have led to criminal charges, most famously in Georgia with the sweeping racketeering case that went all the way to the top with Donald Trump. Chesebro pleaded guilty there, is cooperating there. Earlier this week, Nevada announced criminal charges against the six fake electors there. Chesebro cooperated but wasn't charged in that probe. And then Michigan was the first to announce criminal charges back in July against the fake electors there.

How do you square that seeming disparity between the rhetoric against immigrants and growing support for Trump among Latinos?D. GARCIA: I think. It's important that we not let Trump get away with it or any other politician when they start playing the fear mongering game, the scapegoating, the fear of the other, which unfortunately, it appears that that's primarily what the Trump campaign is doing. I think a lot of Latino voters are concerned about immigration on the border for the especially those Latinos in the border areas. I've been in Eagle Pass and El Paso, and they want something to be legally established, an orderly procession of immigration, as opposed to some of the chaos we're seeing now, as well as support and assistance.
