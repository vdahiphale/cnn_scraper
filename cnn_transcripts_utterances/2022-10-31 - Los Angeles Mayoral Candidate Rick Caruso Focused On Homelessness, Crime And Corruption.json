The alleged violent intruder, David DePape, is now facing federal charges, for breaking into the Pelosis' home, and beating Paul Pelosi, with a hammer, early Friday morning. The federal criminal complaint, released today, reveals that the suspect, who trafficked online, in far-right conspiracy theories, about COVID, and the 2020 election, and Holocaust denialism, quote, \"Stated that he was going to hold Nancy hostage and talk to her. If Nancy were to tell DEPAPE the 'truth,' he would let her go, and if she 'lied,' he was going to break 'her kneecaps.'\" DePape also explained that \"By breaking Nancy's kneecaps, she would then have to be wheeled into Congress, which would show other Members of Congress there were consequences to actions,\" unquote.

To his 8.7 million Twitter followers, Donald Trump Jr. shared an image of a hammer and a pair of underwear that had the caption, \"Got my Paul Pelosi Halloween costume ready.\" He also posted something else, which he quickly deleted, a South Park-esque cartoon image, supposedly of Pelosi, and the guy, who hit him in the head with a hammer, having sex. You know what? When some sick moron, sent a white powder, to the home of Donald Trump Jr., in 2018, sending his then-wife Vanessa, to the hospital, as a precaution? That was awful. Why is this, happening to Paul Pelosi, not the same thing, even worse? It's hard to fathom the kind of mind that hears of a tragedy, like what happened to 82-year-old Paul Pelosi, and decides to traffic in this filth. But sadly, Donald Trump Jr. is hardly alone. Former Republican congressman, and Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Devin Nunes, who now runs Trump's social media company, Truth Social, shared this Halloween image, with the words, \"At least this guy has his clothes on.\" Nunes also reposted this meme, using a poster, for the gay romantic comedy, \"Bros,\" twisting it into a smear of Paul Pelosi, and again, the man, who tried to bash Pelosi's head, in with a hammer. Words fail! Republican congressman Clay Higgins of Louisiana tweeted, then deleted this, which was captured by Voice of America's Steve Herman, a photo of Nancy Pelosi, with the words, quote, \"That moment you realize the nudist hippie male prostitute LSD guy was the reason your husband didn't make it to your fundraiser.\" I mean, what is wrong with these people? There's more. But you get the point. In addition to being an inhuman and inhumane response to a tragedy, it's a lie!

I have been spending and so focused on what's happening here, in Los Angeles, I'm not really focused on what's happening, nationally. I know the focus on being around every corner of the city is about homelessness, and crime and corruption. And that's what I'm talking to residents about. So, we're going to stay focused for the next seven days or eight days on that. And we'll see what the rest of the country does, down the road. But, L.A. is a very unique place, right now.

No matter what the discussions, we're leading, today, you could easily read O'Connor's opinion, and it is not no hard sunset. It's trying to hope for the better of America. And we actually hoped that we would be there, in 25 years.But racial inequality persists in so many different ways, especially in our K-12 systems. And we're not going to be quite there yet, as the attorneys, for the University, shared today. But we do know what that endpoint is. We do know that that endpoint is when that they're able to achieve the educational benefits of diversity that the universities set for themselves, right? That's wholly within their responsibility, and rights, is to identify what those goals are. They are measuring their progress towards those goals. And, in the meantime, once they identify, a race-neutral alternative, some other mechanism, like a percentage plan, or a mixture of recruitment, and scholarships, and the like, where they don't have to consider someone's race, as just one factor among several? Then, that's the end point that will happen. It's going to happen on a case-by-case basis. Every university sets their own goals. They have measurements. And those measurements can be challenged. They weren't challenged, in this case, by the petitioner. Most of the arguments the petitioners raised, frankly, are in their briefs, but they're not in the evidentiary record, back at the Court of Appeals or the District Court.",
