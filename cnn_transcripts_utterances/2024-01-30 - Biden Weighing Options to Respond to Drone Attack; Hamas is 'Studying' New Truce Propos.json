But one that the U.S. is unlikely to take, we are told, is to strike directly inside Iran.

But the response that we see, it could be, according to Secretary of State Antony Blinken, multi-leveled, come in stages, and it might not all happen in one day. It could be sustained over time. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BERTRAND (voice-over): A powerful response from President Biden is expected after a drone attack in Jordan killed three U.S. service members and injured dozens more. ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: This is an incredibly volatile time in the Middle East. I would argue that we have not seen a situation as dangerous as the one we're facing now across the region since at least 1973.

Natasha, thank you for that reporting.And joining us now, former director of communications for U.S. national intelligence, Shawn Turner is here, along with our military analyst, Major General \"Spider\" Marks. Good morning to both of you. Just devastation for these families of these three service members. You heard from some of them right there. And now major questions about how this happened. Spider, to you first. The fact that it was -- whether it was intentional or inadvertently, this drone following a U.S. drone. And as I understand it, flying pretty low. That made it hard to detect, and then there was confusion so a slowed response. Does that track with what you would expect here? JAMES \"SPIDER\" MARKS, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: It does. And clearly, in circumstances like this, there will always be a -- probably a delay in response. Look, there is a human in the loop. You know, in operations like this. This is not necessarily a completely hands-free type of environment where a device detects a device and then launches based on a preset criteria. There's too much that going on. So with the human in the loop, you're going to have delays like this. But I don't want to speak into the details of what might have occurred until it becomes absolutely certain how this occurred, you know, what the circumstances were. If it was following another drone, then you would expect that there would be an uplink to that enemy drone. There have been a downlink. That probably could have been intercepted, and that's probably what was about to happen before it engaged.",

      "sentences": "Shawn, when we talk about response, you hear things like proportionate. You hear, you know, calibration, a lot of buzz words that don't necessarily explain how there have been 160-plus attacks, there have been dozens of U.S. troops and personnel that have been injured even before the three that were killed. What is on the table that could stop this from a deterrence perspective?SHAWN TURNER, FORMER COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR FOR U.S. NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE: Yes. Yes, well, you know, the administration likes to say that all options are on the table. But it's important to remember that not all options are equal. What the purpose of a retaliation here has to be to exact a cost on those who attacked us. And for that cost to be so high that when they -- should they ever think about attacking us again, they stop and think twice. But the real challenge for the administration right now is striking the balance between deterrence and escalation. We've seen a lot of reporting about the potential of striking inside Iran or the potential of striking Iranian-backed proxies. And we've also seen the possibility of economic sanctions. And when you look at all of those things, the fact of the matter is, is that what people want to see in the aftermath of the death of three U.S. service members is an attack that's decisive. It's unlikely that we would see something that's non-kinetic. So what I think we're looking at here is we're most likely looking at an attack against Iranian-backed proxies. But the administration has a lot to think about here to avoid escalating this into a larger regional conflict. That's not something that we want -- that the United States wants to get into right now. HARLOW: General Marks, former allied -- supreme allied commander of NATO, Wesley Clark, said this, disagreeing with how the administration is handling this so far. He posted, \"The U.S. should stop saying we don't want to escalate. This invites the attack on us. Stop calling our attacks retaliation. This is reactive. Take out their capabilities and strike hard at the source: Iran.\" Is there any part of that statement, whether it's, you know, the words that this administration is using talking about it, or his suggestion of strike the source, meaning Iran, that you agree with?",

      "sentences": "Well, I certainly agree that it has to be a very punishing blow. It has to be sustained over time. I would not recommend a strike into Iran.But also bear in mind, we are very reactive here. The initiative entirely belongs to Iran. We have to get off our back heels. How do you do that? Well, we talk about deterrence. Deterrence is a strategic condition, a priority that establishes, you know, levels of behavior and forms of behavior that are accepted. And when you get beyond those forms, those described boundaries, if you will, then something is going to happen. There will be some punishment, and there will be some pain. I mean, we've worked with deterrence before. We've had that definition, where you can have at the very stop strategic level definitions that describe what's acceptable down below. Then you hold them accountable. And in this particular case, there must be an incredibly punishing blow. We have an array of options. There are things we can do in the gulf. Right now, Iran is pumping about 3.2 million barrels of oil a day. Their economics are fine. They're selling that to China. They're selling that to India. We can try to shut that down. We can make it that much more painful for them. So all of government needs to be engaged. And I would expect to see this. And Phil, I would also suggest, if I can, don't use the word \"buzz word.\" In terms of proportionality, in terms of levels of engagement. These are military terms that describe doctrinal engagements, and they're legal in their nature. And it's how we grew up. So it kind of gets beyond that.",

Because I feel like it has become so shorthand in this moment, because there have been so many back-and- forths that it's difficult to understand that underneath it there are clear thresholds, there are kind of lines that people are following based on history, based on conflicts that have driven U.S. force posture for decades, if not longer.And does that complicate this to some degree right now?

On both sides.What's the consequence to Iran for their activities? What's the consequence for the United States to say there's proportionality? Well, if there's proportionality and we're still losing American soldiers, then maybe we need to redefine what proportionality looks like, maybe stretch it a little bit. And what I'm suggesting is I would hope that those kinds of options are on the table right now that this administration is about to embrace.",

      "sentences": "Yes, it looks like these talks in Paris were really focused on getting Israeli, Egyptian, Qatari, and American officials on the same page, in order to then present what they are calling a broad framework that was agreed to on Sunday to Hamas for their review. Now, the details of this framework, according to officials, wouldinvolve the release of civilian hostages first over an initial period of about six weeks, with that same ratio that we saw in the previous agreement of three Palestinian prisoners for every one civilian hostage release. And then the second phase of that would involve the Israeli soldiers who are being held hostage by Hamas, as well as the bodies of some 28 Israeli hostages that Hamas is also holding as bargaining chips. And as part of that, we would see a longer pause that would likely happen, as well as a higher ratio of Palestinian prisoners being released. When you put this all together, you could see something like a two-month ceasefire being put into effect if, indeed, Hamas agrees to these terms. But Hamas, for its part, has insisted throughout this process that it wants to see Israeli soldiers leave the Gaza Strip altogether and an end to this war. And in a statement this morning, they are saying that they are reviewing this proposal. And they say, quote, that they are \"in the process of studying it and submitting its response to it on the basis that the priority is to stop the aggression, the brutal attack on Gaza and the complete withdrawal of the occupation forces from the Strip.\" They also say in that statement that Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh has been invited to Egypt to further study and discuss this proposal. It's clear that ultimately there will be a lot of details to work out, even if they can get to an agreement, including implementation details that will be key to seeing if this deal can actually go forward -- Poppy.",

But, you know, Mayorkas is already firing back, saying that the immigration system was broken long before he came into office. He's going to continue doing the job that he was given. And he plans to not be spooked by these Republican actions. He also says if House Republicans are really serious about fixing the immigration system, they could move ahead with the emerging border deal in the United States Senate, something that a lot of Republicans have already rejected out of hand. Meanwhile, there's a question, Phil, as you noted. There are a lot of Republicans falling in line, but they have a narrow two-seat majority. Once this gets out of the committee, which we expect it will, then there's a question of whether or not House Republican leadership has the votes it needs to put it on the floor. Now, Tom Emmer, the Republican whip, has signaled they're going to begin the process of whipping this once it already moves out of the committee. That is something that a lot of resistant Republicans have started saying that they want to see this get out of committee, and then they will take a closer look at it. Here was one of those Republicans who had questions about whether these were impeachable offenses back in November, Tom McClintock. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. TOM MCCLINTOCK (R-CA): Mayorkas is guilty of maladministration, neglective duties, malfeasance in office, but these are not impeachable offenses. So if Greene and her friends are successful in redefining impeachment, well, then the next time the Democrats have the majority, I think we can expect this definition to be turned against the conservatives on the Supreme Court and any future Republican administration.
