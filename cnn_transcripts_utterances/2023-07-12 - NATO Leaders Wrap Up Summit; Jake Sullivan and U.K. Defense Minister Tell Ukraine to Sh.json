Now, it's been a packed day in Lithuania where NATO leaders are wrapping up a key summit. Russia's war against Ukraine has topped the agenda in Vilnius. Ukraine's president met with a list of foreign leaders today including U.S. President Joe Biden. This after a tense statement from Volodymyr Zelenskyy saying it was absurd the allies were dragging their feet when it came to offering Ukraine NATO membership. That was followed by grumblings by some U.S. and British officials that Ukraine needed to be grateful for the support it's received. But they appear to have patched up their differences. There still isn't a solid timeline for Ukraine to enter the alliance, but Mr. Zelenskyy heads back to Kyiv with security guarantees from the G7 and NATO members. And he says he's confident Ukraine will be able to join the alliance eventually. Well, Russia is watching the events in neighboring Lithuania, and isn't happy. The summit ends with Sweden on its way to being the next alliance member, turning the Baltic Sea into what's been called a NATO Lake. But the Kremlin is warning security guarantees for Ukraine could lead to extremely negative consequences. Well, President Biden spoke earlier at Vilnius University. He said if Russia thinks the U.S. will drop its support for Ukraine, it meant wrong. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

A statement of resolve that the West will continue to back Ukraine, now that it's blatantly obvious to everyone, including Russian President Vladimir Putin that this war could keep lasting a long time on top of the year-and-a-half we've already seen it. So what do these security guarantees include? Take a look at this graphic. It's essentially a step-by-step, beginning with ensuring a sustainable force capable of defending Ukraine. So, that's a statement about continuing to provide the military support we've seen from the U.S. and others, strengthen Ukraine's economic stability and resilience, that perhaps more a long-term goal for rebuilding and recovering when that becomes more possible. And then providing technical and financial support for Ukraine's immediate needs. So, you see how these kind of breakdown into the short term, medium and long term with that western-backing for Ukraine. Now, there hasn't been any broad, NATO military aid package announced or anything like that, but Zelenskyy did say a few countries had agreed to provide more aid including Germany, which he says will provide another Patriot missile battery. Ukraine has used that very effectively against Russian aerial attacks. Australia, he also says will provide another aid package, the U.K. announced their own aid package which would include ammo and more combat vehicles. And Christina, of course, that comes on top of the U.S. announcement of sending cluster munitions which came just a few days ago.",

That was really the message he was trying to drive home during that -- those remarks is that, this is not just a fight that we are experiencing with Ukraine, and just between Ukraine and Russia inside Ukraine's territorial borders. This is actually a broader fight between freedom and democracy and authoritarianism. And he has sought to draw that distinction before. He has sought to rally the world in those terms before basically saying that the U.S. and the western alliance and democratic and free countries are really the world's best hope here in terms of a good future. And so, that was the message that he was sending. It was the message that he spoke with world leaders about during his meetings today in Vilnius. But he didn't mention really NATO and Ukraine, and that was notable omission. I think he wanted to let the day's events speak for itself. But he did not revisit the issue there. And I think that will probably give some Ukrainians a little bit of heartburn especially given the slip-up that he had earlier in the speech where he said that NATO had 33 members, in fact, it only has 31, soon to be 32 with Sweden. Ukraine has said repeatedly that it wants to be the 33rd member. So, clearly, a little bit of a slip there that Ukrainians would definitely have noticed, Christina.",

And while it was two dozen organizations overall spanning the private sector and government, we only know from our reporting of two U.S. federal executive agencies that have been breached in this activity. The State Department was one of them, we were confirmed -- we confirmed earlier today. And another agency we believe targeted was in -- on Capitol Hill, one of the legislative branch agencies. So, this is very targeted spying, it's not -- they know what they're looking for, they know that they're looking for information that might help the Chinese government, according to U.S. officials in their intelligence-gathering. And they're very good at doing this, so, they had a month, had starred on the U.S. government in terms of their access to some of these e-mails before they were discovered. It's unclassified e-mail systems where you can still clean a lot on what someone is doing in terms of who they're contacting, and perhaps their location based on this data, so it's another challenge in terms of how the Biden administration tries to ward off some of this Chinese cyber espionage. And I should point out that Beijing denies a lot of these allegations and they in turn accuse Washington of conducting their own cyber attacks on Chinese organizations.

We travel tothe state a lot for other unrelated stories that have to do with climate change, for example. The water issues are a really big problem in Arizona. It relies on water from the Colorado River. And there's simply less of it to go around. So a lot of farmers are being forced to close up shop, to end their businesses effectively, because they don't have enough water to farm here. In terms of the city there is actually an unincorporated residential area close to Scottsdale, close to Phoenix where we are right now, that has completely run out of water. What those folks are doing in these weather conditions, I don't know. I probably should check up on them and do a follow-up story.",

You'll see it on the cover of every newspaper for the last several days. It's been like that, in part, because it was, basically, an open secret about who these allegations were referring to. The name was widely circulated online. Now we have confirmation from Huw Edward's wife, that it is in fact him. Also because of the seriousness of the initial allegations, even though the evidence that \"The Sun\" actually presented when they initially made these allegations was extremely thin. Now you have the Metropolitan Police in London, whom the BBC had asked to investigate, quickly turning around and saying that there is no evidence of criminal activity. I'll read you part of their statement. They said that the special -- The Met specialist crime command have now concluded their assessment and have determined that there's no information to indicate that a criminal offense has been committed. They've spoken to a number of parties, including the BBC, the alleged complainant and the complainant's family, both by another police force. There is no further police action. So basically, they're saying the BBC can go ahead and carry on with its internal investigation. But it raises the question for the tabloids in this country and also for the broader British press about what precisely the wrongdoing is that's being alleged. There is no evidence that anything has been criminal thus far. Perhaps immoral; we don't know. We need to know more, based on what the BBC will find, more allegations that will come out. But it is remarkable how quickly this story has grown into a frenzy, with all of the speculation about who and what was done. Now here we are with more of a varied picture. One point about Huw Edwards' mental health. The wife rightly points out, this has been well documented in the media house, his struggles. In fact, he said that, at one point, things got so bad that he couldn't even get himself out of bed.",
