Very shortly, Republican senators will vote, and someone other than Mitch McConnell will win the top spot in the Senate for the first time in nearly 20 years. Also this morning, Donald Trump will visit the White House at theinvitation of President Biden. Now, Trump did not extend that invitation four years ago when he lost to Biden by 7 million votes. He has still not conceded the 2020 election, but it is an understatement to say that Biden is taking a different approach this time. Let's get right to CNN's Kristen Holmes standing by in Washington where Donald Trump will arrive, oh, in about an hour or so. As I said, it's a big day. A lot going on, Kristen.",

Of course, we are seeing the policies that are forming. But this is the beginning of the peaceful transfer of power. And again, as you said, not something that was awarded to Joe Biden when he came into office in 2020.So first I want to start with the TikTok of what we're expecting for the day. Donald Trump lands. He will then go to a hotel on the Hill where he is going to meet with the House conference Speaker Mike Johnson. After that, he is going to go to the White House to meet with Joe Biden. We expect at some point to see a spray or some video of the meeting, both with Joe Biden and the House conference. After that, we know that he's going to go back to Mar-a-Lago in Florida. In that time period somewhere in the schedule, he is going to meet with the new Senate majority leader. Donald Trump has not weighed in on that race. We know a lot of his allies have. They are pushing for Florida Senator Rick Scott, but he himself has steered clear overall. The one thing to point out here, and there's so much that goes into this trip, is this is a completely different Washington than Donald Trump left in 2020. It's also a completely different Washington than he arrived to in 2016. If you look at 2016, yes, Donald Trump still had power, control over the Senate, Republicans did, as well as the House, same as now. But the difference is that Donald Trump didn't have a lot of allies in the Senate. The House wasn't full of people who were aiming to please the former president, now president-elect. What we have talked about over the last six years, we are seeing the culmination of that today, which is Donald Trump's takeover of the Republican Party and the shift in Washington. 2020, he essentially stormed out of the White House, never to greet Biden, never to have a conversation, and certainly did not participate in the peaceful transfer of power. So what you're seeing right now is a completely different world, particularly here in Washington, than what we have seen in the past when Donald Trump has been here.",

      "sentences": "Absolutely. Joining us right now, CNN military analyst, Lieutenant General Mark Hertling. It's great to see you. Thank you so much for being here. Let's talk first about some of the flurry of the job announcements that Donald Trump has made in the last 24 hours. Maybe the most surprising is his pick for defense secretary, which is FOX News host Pete Hegseth. To remind viewers of your service, you served for 37 years in the U.S. Army. You retired in 2013 as the commanding general of the U.S. Army Europe and the Seventh Army. Coming from your experience, what is your reaction to this pick as Donald Trump's defense secretary?LT. GENERAL MARK HERTLING (RET), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Well, Kate, from the very beginning -- first of all, good morning. From the very beginning I said there's a couple of key players in any government, but especially ours that deal with national security. And that is the Sec State, CIA director, NSA. Having said all that, those are all tough positions. The military does not make it a habit to comment on the credentials of different appointees or nominees. That's what Congress is for. Thats what the Senate does in terms of their oversight. But the military does support, as best they can, whoever is nominated and tries to contribute to their success. Now that's the party line. But having said that, the Department of Defense, the biggest federal agency, has a lot of requirements, 3 million people, $800 billion budget. There are right now, Kate, 180 soldiers deployed to overseas locations, 100 ships that are preventing, or helping with freedom of navigation. You have the requirement for the secretary to go with Congress to understand -- have them understand what's going on in the defense community, message to the American people, contribute to decision-making in terms of crises. So yes, it's a big job. So the person who is placed in that job should have some really good credentials in terms of both national security and governmental actions as well as caring for the 3 million people that are part of the department.",

He served overseas in Afghanistan and Iraq, and during his military service he was awarded two Bronze Stars and a combat infantry badge. From what you -- does that -- are those the kind of credentials you think would be setting the department up for success?",

What I've just described to you is an individual that needs to understand how to run a large bureaucracy and a big business. I give him kudos for serving in the military and having two deployments as a lieutenant and then a captain on his record. But the question will be -- and people will watch and the Congress and Senate will ask, how are you going to run this organization? What are your feelings on national security? What are your engagement techniques?He's following a guy, Four-Star General Lloyd Austin, who many people said shouldn't be the defense secretary because he was recently in the military, who has done masterful things in terms of pulling together different organizations in Ramstein for the support of Ukraine, has dealt with world leaders and contributed to their capabilities in terms of engaging and building their military. So again, I go back to the statement. The military doesn't comment on their credentials. All we try to do is support whoever is nominated and contribute to their success. I know that's not a great answer from an old military guy, but that's what the military does.",

In \"The Wall Street Journal's\" reporting that the Trump transition is considering a draft executive order, which obviously on its face means this is not finalized, but still the draft executive orders would establish a warrior board of retired senior military personnel with the power to review three and four star officers and to recommend removals of any deemed unfit for leadership. What do you think -- some of my questions are, and I have a lot of them on this, what do you think that isn't happening that they're trying to fix with this that doesn't already exist within military structure?

Now, Merrick Garland, the attorney general now has said he plans to release that report. He wants to release it to Congress, and a version of this would be made public. But how we get there is part of the discussion right now, behind-the-scenes, between the special counsel, his team, and the attorney general. Here's how it would work, right? They have to wind down these cases, and how that is done is still something that they're working out. According to the special counsel, they're going to update the federal courts on December 2nd of how they want to do that. So then, the other question remains whether he has to submit his report to the intelligence community for them to clear it to be released to the public. Now, a lot of this stuff that is in -- that Jack Smith gathered for his investigation is already cleared by the intelligence community, because they are going to use it on a trial, which, of course, will never happen. So, that's part of what the discussions are behind the scenes, whether he has to submit that report to the intelligence community -- Kate.",

I looked at all the House Majorities that started Congresses going back to when we had 50 states. Remember, Alaska and Hawaii were the last two added, 222 which is the amount they lead in right now, would tie for the lowest. But of course, we haven't called all of those 222. I was looking at a few races in California, where Republicans lead that might go the other way. If we get down to 221, that would be the lowest ever going back to since we had 50 states, and of course, it could drop even lower, given that Donald Trump has decided to pluck a few folks from the House for his Cabinet. Stefanik and Waltz of course, so, the bottom line is, we are talking razor, razor, razor- thin at this particular point, looking at what the House might look like come January.",

I'm not sure that that seat is necessarily safe.But Waltz's seat most definitely is. Because I would just want to look at special House elections in 2017 and 2018. In the median district, in the median election, the Democrats outran Clinton's margin by 15 points, including flipping a seat in Southwest Pennsylvania that Donald Trump won by 20 points.
