You know, you were just talking about two important states tomorrow that will be voting that will ultimately determine who controls the United States Senate, both Ohio and Pennsylvania. They're part of a slew of states that will really tell the picture in the United States Senate.Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, New Hampshire, as we said, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Let's, let's leave aside Ohio and Pennsylvania and zoom in on some of these other important key Senate races. So, let's start in Arizona where the incumbent Mark Kelly is facing a very tough matchup against Blake Masters. Keep in mind, Arizona, a state that Joe Biden won in 2020 by the small sub margins has traditionally been Republican. The question is, are voters in the southwest going to go back to the Republican roots, or are they perhaps going to stick with Mark Kelly? We don't know yet. We'll see when all the votes come in. And the other part of the country, let's go to the southeast where we have this very interesting matchup between Senator Raphael Warnock, the incumbent Democrat versus Herschel Walker, the Republican. Remember, Warnock won his Senate seat in a runoff election back in January of 2021. There's a possibility that we could get another runoff here because there's a libertarian candidate, and remember, in the state of Georgia, you need at least a majority of the vote to win on election day. It could be the case that neither of these two get a majority, and then we have a runoff come December to ultimately determine Senate control. We'll have to wait and see on that. Let's go back to the southwest and talk about Nevada. Senator Catherine Cortez Masto facing Adam Laxalt who is the former attorney General in that state. I'm kind of interested to see does Arizona go one way and Nevada go another way? They're both in the southwest, heavily Hispanic population. We'll see what ultimately occurs there. Then sort of a late breaking Senate race in New Hampshire. Senator Maggie Hassan, facing off against Don Bolduc who, of course won that primary with a slew of money actually coming from the Democrats supporting his campaign, or at least a third party supporting his campaign. This is a late breaking race. This is a state that Joe Biden won easily eclipsing Hillary Clinton's margin, but that was a state that went Democratic in 2016 as well by a very small margin. Will it go back to that where we have a very tight margin? We'll see what happens. Finally, in the state of Wisconsin where Mandela Barnes is taking on Senator Rob Johnson, the Republican incumbent, perhaps the most endangered Republican incumbent. There's also a gubernatorial race there that's very, very tight. Will those two vote together? Will they vote separately? We're just going to have to wait and see, but of course, Wisconsin an ultimate swing state. Back to you guys.",

It's up to a judge to be able to decide the severity of the crime, whether the person is harmed to the community or shut the community. And so it's not unheard of. But I actually had a chance to speak to Mandela Barnes today on my Sirius XM show, and I asked him about these ads. Because I was really wondering about the notion, how did he take it? How did he perceive this sort of thing? And here was his response. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MANDELA BARNES (D), WISCONSIN SENATORIAL CANDIDATE:  The thing is, I'm not personally offended, right?

I think that's why the best campaigns are working at the grassroots close to people, and not just talking to them, but listening to them. I've been working through an organization called Bridge Together, which is providing funds to local existing grassroots groups so they can build up their organizing and community building capacity all year round. And I'd like to see us do that in all 50 states, because I think that is how we lay a claim, not an assumption, but really make a case to every single voter for the importance of supporting the policies that we are driving.

So, it's gone down.So, you, have such an interesting perspective as a Democrat who won in a Trump district. So, what do you think is going on? REP. CHERI BUSTOS (D-IL):  Well, I think it's, what women in the suburbs and families are paying every time they go to the grocery store. And, frankly, as Democrats we need to be disciplined and we need to be relentless, and we need to tell our own story that we're just not telling. If you just take a look at the policies, the legislation that we have passed as Democrats in some cases without any help from our colleagues across the aisle, we are just not telling that story loudly enough, a loudly enough and enough. Period. And so what happens is you go to the grocery store, you're paying way too much for a slab of bacon, way too much for a dozen eggs. And people are looking for somebody to blame. And because we have not told our story loudly enough about the Inflation Reduction Act. Or that we are doing our best to try to address this worldwide problem of paying too much at the -- at the gas pump. And so, if you look back to 2018, I would argue that part of the reason that we won back the majority then is we were very disciplined in our message. We made a decision that we weren't going to stay focused on Donald Trump, but we were going to stay focused on bringing down the cost of things when you went to the grocery store and you bought something.",
