The CSX Railway company says at least 16 cars jumped the tracks on Wednesday afternoon. Two cars contained molten sulfur, which spilled and is burning. The fear is that that could lead to the release of sulfur dioxide. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control says the chemical can cause irritation and breathing difficulties. And the railway has sent air-monitoring equipment to that area. The other thing we are watching today, all eyes on Qatar, because the deal or the truce between Israel and Hamas was delayed. It was meant to happen today. It's apparently happening tomorrow. We're waiting for confirmation from Qatar. So you'll have more on that in the coming hour. Thank you for joining me here, Max Foster.

We've been hearing time and time again about how doctors have been embarking on surgeries without anesthesia, even on some of the amputations, some of the harrowing stories. And then international agencies are saying they're running out of water and running out of food. One of the important parts of this deal is, of course, getting fuel into Gaza, which we know since November the 21st. We have seen some fuel entering Gaza to keep those generators on for the hospitals to keep on running. Of course, that is one of the sensitive topics here, in terms of the breakthroughs in negotiations, because the IDF have time and time again said that, if fuel enters Gaza and enters into the hands of Hamas, that is a big risk.

While they haven't been a part of the negotiations at all, they did help facilitate the release of the other hostages earlier this -- last month. So this is an important distinction here, that in terms of what we're seeing on the negotiating front. We know the Qataris, Israel, Hamas and the Egyptians are very involved in what we've seen coming through over the last few days. The aid organizations have said they're not really sure about the amount of aid that's going to be entering, where it's going to go, what kind of safety routes are going to be created. And now this big news on the potential of the Red Cross being able to visit hostages would really be a big move, a big move in the right direction for the hostages that have been trapped inside of Gaza. And frankly, we haven't heard much news about their status, their health, whether they require medicine. But hopefully, we will be getting more on that.

Information like age and nationality and gender. That's the information that we have been working with so far. What we don't know, critically, though, is whether any of the three Americans that we've been talking about would be among the first released on the first day. So that includes 3-year-old Abigail Edan. Now, we are also told that the first two days is being seen as sort of a testing period. They want to see if everything can be implemented, if the hostage release can go correctly. And then by around day three, that is when negotiations and talks are expected to pick up again to see who could be released after the women and children are out of Gaza. So we're talking about elderly men, foreign national men. And then, of course, the soldiers that are being held hostage in Gaza.

Good to see you this morning, Colonel. I wonder if you could clear up some confusion on a couple of different fronts here. The prime minister had also said on Wednesday that the Red Cross would be allowed in to visit hostages, to bring in any needed medications. The Red Cross now saying that it has not -- and I'm quoting here -- \"been made aware of any agreement to allow the Red Cross in to visit with hostages.\" Is there an agreement in place, and has anyone spoken to the Red Cross? LT. COL. PETER LERNER, IDF SPOKESMAN: So from our -- I would like to say that the expectation is, indeed, is that the International Committee of the Red Cross would be engaged in supplying assistance and adjusting and assisting the well-being of the hostages. We've been saying that now for seven weeks, and that is what needs to be done. And they also need to be part of the process of the release and of the assessment of the well-being of those not being released.

Of course, after the revelations -- and CNN broadcasted it extensively over the last couple of days but even more so last night, with a huge tunnel system beneath the hospital, beneath the Shifa Hospital.
