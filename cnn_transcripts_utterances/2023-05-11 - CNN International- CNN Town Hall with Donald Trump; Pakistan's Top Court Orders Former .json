And we'll take a look at some of the key moments from CNN's town hall with 2024 U.S. Republican Presidential candidates and Former President Donald Trump. A third day of strikes by Israel into Gaza has killed 3 more people and injured 7 that are according to the Gaza Ministry of Health. The Islamic Jihad confirms one of the dead is the head of a missile unit. At least 25 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza this week, several of them civilians. Israel is now claiming that at least 4 people who died in Gaza were actually killed by Islamic Jihad own rockets, which they fell short of their targets across Israel's border. Islamic Jihad has denied this calling it a lie. In the dramatic escalation, Israel says that over 500 rockets have been fired from Gaza toward Israel in the past two days. Journalist Elliott Gotkine is joining me now from Jerusalem. Elliott, is the expectation that this violence is going to continue?",

      "sentences": "For now, Bianca that is the expectations, there were hopes, there were rumors last night that a ceasefire brokered by Egypt was in the works, but ultimately, it came to naught there were about 8.5 hours of quiet overnight. But then Israeli strikes, rockets launched from Islamic Jihad towards Israel resumed.And Israel says that more than 500 rockets have been fired towards Israel since the start of this latest round of fighting. It says that about a fifth of them have fallen short, including in two instances where rockets fell short and killed, uninvolved civilians according to the IDF, among them 3 children and including a 10 year old girl. Now, as you said, as you just mentioned, in your introduction, Islamic Jihad is calling this a lie, and says that Israel is just saying this to cover up what it is doing. But of course, Israel is also saying that of those that say those the number of Palestinians killed since the start of this round of fighting around about half of them were militants. And it also says that the brother and nephew of the head of the rocket unit that was killed in the early hours of the morning. We're probably they're assuming we're probably also members of Islamic Jihad. We've not heard any confirmation of that from the militant group itself. Now, I mentioned that Egypt last night was set to be working on a ceasefire no doubt they are also working behind the scenes continuously to try to do so. Israel is also keeping the United States abreast of developments right now. Israel's Defense Minister, Yoav Gallant speaking with his counterpart, Secretary of Defense, Lloyd Austin, last night. And despite Yoav Gallant's mother passing away overnight as well. He remains very much in control of this operation. There are still hopes for a ceasefire, but for now, the violence continues and there is no sign of it ending, Bianca.",

Pakistan Supreme court has ordered Former Prime Minister Imran Khan to appear in court, as his legal team challenges his arrest on multiple corruption charges. Several Senior Leaders of Khan's party is also under arrest now. At least 8 people have been killed and hundreds detained as Khan Supporters took to the streets to protest his arrest. The Army has been called in to quell this unrest. CNN Sophia Saifi joins me now live from Islamabad.

When it does happen, the head of Ukraine's Nuclear Energy Agency says Ukrainian forces will have to go around this Zaporizhzhia power plant to avoid damaging the facility.

And he is re asserting that. We should point out the voting here in the U.S. does not begin in the Republican primary for at least seven months. But he acted and seemed as though he is the presumptive Republican nominee. But he said so many things that if he would become the nominee, could be problematic for him in the general election, on the debt ceiling, on abortion on so many other matters there. But I think his biggest motivation of all he likes the platform. He likes the audience, those Republican voters who are applauding there in that audience, are his people, if you will, so he's certainly wanted to show that he's back.

More Republicans would find a better a road here to be comparing, himself and drawing a contrast with the current President and the policies of this administration. But he simply has one act, and it works for at least about 47 percent of the country. The question is can he expand any of that a little bit more. But I think last night reminded many voters here in America, that this is not a fait accompli if this is a rematch between Joe Biden and Donald Trump, once again.
