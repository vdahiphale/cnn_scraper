One senior administration official telling me, \"It is just really horrible.\" When I asked about the security incident that unfolded at the former president's rally. Now, the president, of course did address the nation in which he condemned political violence, and told reporters that he has been trying to get in touch with the former president. Now, those remarks, I'm also being told were decided by the president himself. Of course, when this all unfolded, the president was at church again in Delaware. And it was only after he left that he was -- that he was briefed on what had occurred. And it was in that moment, a source tells me that the president said that he wanted to address the nation. And that is indeed what he did this evening. Now, of course, the Biden campaign is also changing their posturing. After huddling tonight, they have decided to pause their outbound communications and pull down all T.V. ads, a memo also going out to staff telling them to refrain from commenting on social media. So, a lot of movement both within the White House and within the Biden campaign tonight, as they have just been shocked by what they have seen.

And in counterterror, and with the Secret Service, you know that they have foiled, prevented, probably long before it gets to this point. Countless plots against pres -- some of which we hear about there's one going back to President Obama in 2011.It's a difficult job, and there are threats everywhere, and you know about only their failures, very rarely their successes. In terms of where we are today. And this is another thing in the wake of this you want to be worried about where political fire is directed now, right? Is it the there's an incendiary quality to the political discourse, that no matter what happens, there is in our side, your side kind of view of things and lens. FBI is taking over this investigation, as you know, the FBI itself has been the target of armed attacks, you know, particularly and threats in the wake of, for instance, the raid on Mar-a-Lago of classified documents. You know, in each case, if any organization institution is seen as being on the opposite side of the ramparts, you know, politically, it becomes a target of attacks. And I think -- and that's one reason why in the wake of this, all of these statements are so important. So many of them have that phrase, political violence has no place in our society from Biden, from Republican lawmakers, Democratic lawmakers. I saw Martin Luther King Jr. of course, who knows better than him, he says exactly that. And we're hearing it from international leaders as well, saying very similar because they look at the states with concern, although we should say -- we should note that violent political discourse is not confined to this country. You know, as I'm watching, you know, the Israeli Prime Minister comments on this, of course, they lost a prime minister to assassination Yitzhak Rabin. As I'm watching the Japanese Prime Minister comment, they lost a former prime minister and Shinzo Abe to a political assassination. U.K. had an M.P. assassinated. So, you know, this is a quality of political discourse that is sadly becoming quite common.",

That means elements of the search group including a BAU, one that behavioral profilers will be involved, significant parts of the counterterrorism division and the Joint Terrorism Task Force will join the Criminal Division. Why the FBI and not the Secret Service, because that's actually normal. The Secret Service's job is to protect their protectee, in this case, the former president, stop any assassination attempt to take out the potential assassin. But after that happens, they are part and parcel but the FBI is going to be operating under the federal law that makes it a federal crime to attempt to assault or kill a federal officer or a former president of the United States or any official under the protection of the Secret Service. And that means figuring out who is he. Right now, Anderson, and I've been talking to sources all over the government, we're not certain that they are certain that they have the identity of the gunman. I know they're trying to confirm that. Secondly, they're going to need to know where is he from, is he local or does he travel far and wide to get here for this event? And then they're going to want to know, is he a left-wing violent extremist? Is he an accelerationist? Or is he and this is not out of the question, one of these people who are just hearing his own voices in his head, at what point we may learn the motive is something that just makes no sense to us. We've seen that before. But they are in the very early stages of trying to figure out, do they know who this person is? And how do they start down that road?",

So, I think she's saying the overhead map raises all kinds of issues for investigators to pursue.But to be clear, the FBI's job now is not to find out -- not to find faults with whatever the Secret Service did or didn't do. Their job is very simple. They want to know everything there is that can be known about the shooter, who they are, where they're from, how they got there, who they might have worked with, or been directed by or conspired with or been aided by, that's job number one. And exposing those facts will greatly inform any kind of inquiry that the Secret Service conducts later, to figure out if there were things that they could have or should have done differently. I think the location of that of the shooter's position opens up all kinds of possibilities. I agree with the likely case this positioning long in advance, which would lead you to believe that the manufacturing company that owns that cluster of buildings, whether or not they have any video surveillance in the area, that people have ever seen this person or a vehicle that's ultimately attributed to him in the area. So, there's all kinds of investigative avenues that simply that position opens up. Of course, once they identify where he's from, and what vehicles he's connected to. There'll be search warrants executed at all of those locations on all those properties. They'll speak to every one of his relatives, work associates, anyone who knows him, they'll take every piece of electronics that he owns, or has touched or been near, and they'll download those things. They'll get onto his social media to look at who he was talking to online, searches that he may have been making online. So, this is a very complicated and vast process. I am confident that the full weight of the FBI counterterrorism division, and all of its supporting assets like SURG and the Evidence Response Teams, they are working tonight, they'll be deployed to the scene, they will be going 24/7 on this case for quite some time.",

But I think it's just interesting to note that he was very excited, you know, sort of very happy to be in Pennsylvania. I think he recognizes the importance of the state and the importance of this rally this whole going to Wisconsin.And so, I was in the bumper, the bumper is that area where journalists go, that is sort of surrounds the stage with the -- with the audience behind you and the president in front of you. So, I was just speaking from him. We had just moved to his left. Myself and two photographers from the Washington Examiner, we were just through his -- I think it was his left. And I heard the pop, pop, pop, and saw the president go down. You could see this little streak of red on his face. And then there were three more shots after that. I don't know, I haven't seen much reporting because there really had was no service out there afterwards. But, you know, I saw him go down. And I don't think he fell down from my vantage point. I was maybe three feet from him. I don't think he fell down. I think that he went down to take cover. And immediately you saw law enforcement around him on all sides. And he gets back up and I can hear him say two things. Something about I need my shoes. And I see him lift his fist up and people were cheering him and then he kept saying fight, fight, fight. And then -- and then the advanced man from the Trump campaign. Really interesting, he weighed on top of us and kept us -- kept saying, stay down, stay down, don't move. And then they brought the president right past us, his hat fell down right in front of us. And then they took him off.",

I don't know if I'm using the right term, but you feel distracted or not distracted, just detached. That's what I'm trying to say. Detached from it. And I suspect the emotion will kick in, in a day or two. But right now, I just feel very detached about it. And, you know, obviously, I -- and we were in such -- so they took -- there was about five, maybe seven of us journalists that were in that bumper. And they immediately rescinded, they took the president out, they grabbed us and took us back in a holding. And I think they're always the advanced people were concerned that we were OK, because we were right there. We could not have been closer. And so, and there was also no cell service out there. So, I don't know, any news that has happened. I just walked into my home. I live about an hour and a half from Butler. And so, you know, I don't -- I haven't been able to process any of the particulars that -- you know, that has come out and it's happened. We were just sequestered out. But what was fascinating to me is once they brought us out. What I saw Anderson was really sad. You saw this -- you know, when I went in, the last thing that I saw were -- you know, 20, 30, 40,000 people? I don't know, there were a lot of people there. All on a farm field. That was the last sort of images I had seen when I looked backwards. You go outside and you saw people had left their bags. I saw someone had left their wheelchair. Someone had dropped their phone, you know, you know that there was an evacuation there. That was you know that something happened, right? And people went -- when people leave things behind, you know, they felt the need to leave. They felt, the pre -- you know, the pressure of the moment.",

And then you hear the shots ring out.And then, you hear the description, the witnesses describing how the counter snipers from the Secret Service, we now know that they are the ones that fired the shots that killed the suspected gunman who fired the shots in the direction of the former president. So, what you're hearing in that video, again, is the -- is a harrowing detail. The chaos, really, as people clearly saw, even as this was about to happen, and we're trying to figure out like trying to draw attention. And obviously none of that could prevent those initial shots from coming from the suspected shooter. The Secret Service obviously took action very, very quickly and killed him before the former president could be -- could be injured. Unfortunately, it appears that there were other injuries and other person died there at the scene. So, Wolf, this is an investigation that now is going to be focused on that scene right there in that building, which is just again about a football field and a half distance from where the former President Donald Trump was speaking, Wolf.",
