Now, in the last 48 hours, James Cleverley has been in Estonia as the British foreign minister,taking the opportunity to stand on the deck of HMS Albion, a British warship, and tell the Estonians and the rest of the world that as far as Britain is concerned, Ukraine has the right of self-defense and therefore the right to attack targets inside Russia. More broadly, NATO partners, possibly including, probably including Britain, are anxious that the weapons that they give to Ukraine are not used to do that. That doesn't mean necessarily that the Ukrainians can't use their own home-grown, home-made weaponry to take the war into Russian territory. But it's a very important signal coming from the British there, who have really been some of the main, probably the principal cheerleaders of the Ukrainian cause in the international community alongside the United States, which has been the biggest donor to set the tone for this meeting, essentially saying that as far as the Brits are concerned, this is a perfectly legitimate activity so long as it's kept to military targets and so long as they don't use the kit that NATO has given them.",

All right, demonstrators are gathering once again in northern Kosovo in the same townwhere clashes erupted earlier this week. Ethnic Serbs spread a huge flag outside City Hall in Zvecan. But so far today, protests have remained peaceful. On Monday, violence broke out in Zvecan when a crowd tried to block newly- elected mayors from taking office following a disputed election in April. NATO says it's deploying hundreds of additional troops after 30 members of its peacekeeping force were injured in that unrest. The U.S., meantime, has announced it is cancelling Kosovo's participation in American-led NATO exercises over what it calls an unnecessary crisis. CNN's Scott McLean is covering all of these developments. He joins us live now from London. So, Scott, the U.S. is blaming Kosovo for sending police in, in the first place.

He also said that there's not a lot of enthusiasm in the U.S. for any high- level visits, either to Kosovo or to Washington, and that there's also not a lot of enthusiasm for the U.S. to lobby on Kosovo's behalf for countries that have not recognized its independence. And he suggested that there may well be more consequences for Kosovo to come for their failure to de-escalate in their view. And so, the ambassador says that this is, as you said, something that, I'll just read you the quote from the ambassador, he said, this was a crisis that from our perspective was unnecessary. The operation that took place on Friday to obtain access to municipal buildings through forcible means was not coordinated with the United States. When we became aware of it, we advised strongly against it because we anticipated consequences that we are seeing right now. Now, the U.S. wants Kosovo to do two things. It wants to have the mayors work from alternate sites, not the town halls, and it wants the Kosovo police that are at the town halls to be withdrawn. But the prime minister of Kosovo said last night on CNN that despite pressure from E.U. and the U.S., he is holding firm. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

This follows the U.S. military's accusation that a Chinese fighter aggressively intercepted one of its jets, causing turbulence.

And so, the message that the U.S. has been putting out there over the last several days since this incident occurred is this is why it's so important for the U.S. to have this military to military communication with the Chinese in order to prevent this kind of incident from creating a crisis that essentially spirals out of control.

So, that obviously created a lot of concern within the U.S. about why the Chinese are apparently becoming more provocative in their actions here in that airspace, which the Chinese say is their airspace, something that the U.S. does not recognize as this airspace as international. And they say that they were conducting and have been conducting routine missions here. But the Department of Defense has requested dozens of meetings over the last couple of months with Chinese leaders, with Chinese officials, to re- open these lines of communication that have been closed essentially since last year.

Now, some technology experts are warning thatwe could add, we should add rather, artificial intelligence to the list of things that could bring about our extinction. In a short but alarming letter, 300 of the world's leading researchers and executives in the AI industry said controlling their technology should be a global priority. They add that AI presents a societal scale risks similar to pandemics or nuclear war. Among those signing the letter was the head of Google's AI research division and the CEO of OpenAI, the company that of course produces ChatGPT. Let's talk more about the AI threat with one of the leading figures in the tech industry. Roger McNamee was an early investor in Facebook who later warned about the societal risks of social media. He is also the Co-Founder of the venture cap firm, Elevation Partners. Roger, thank you so much for being with us. People are already talking about this sort of AI arms race that we're entering into this idea that companies are prioritizing, sort of building these systems, the development and sort of the power of these systems over their safety. Is it too late at this point to slow things down? ROGER MCNAMEE, CO-FOUNDER, ELEVATION PARTNERS: Not at all. The first thing to understand, Zane, is that this letter and the ones that preceded are all attempts to deflect responsibility. They are trying to make it appear that AI is somehow this inevitable force, that it is something beyond human control. And that is completely ridiculous. The 350 people who signed this thing are making automation software. That is what they do. They can stop it. They could control themselves and not do harm. AI can do great good. There are applications, for example, in drug discovery, where they carefully curate the training set in order to make new drugs. That's a really valuable use of AI, but that is not what these people are doing. What these people are doing is they're going out there and they are stealing content from the web, basically taking copyrighted material and any junk they may find in order to create these humongous data sets, then to create clever, fun apps that do enormous harm. And the issue we should be worried about is not extinction, but rather all the harms that are being done every single day in the form of discrimination in predictive policing, discrimination in mortgages, discrimination in jobs. All these things are early versions of the same kind of automation that we're talking about here. And the current one, ChatGPT, is in the process of essentially undermining what little credibility remains on the internet by filling it with junk.",

And there's a number of Republicans who don't think that the cuts go far enough, and they don't like that this extends ceiling all the way into 2025, which is longer than they would like. But despite that, GOP leadership and Democratic leadership have been working behind the scenes to sell this deal to their members, to whip this deal. And ultimately, it is going to come down to a coalition of members in the middle. Republicans are expected to be able to put up somewhere around 150 votes. And Democrats are saying they will be able to make up the difference. So, we are expecting to pass the House, then it goes over to the Senate, where they also say they're going to be able to pass this, it's just going to take some time, because the Senate can move a little bit slower.

Just explain to us if the South African government is truly aware of what they're risking in terms of jeopardizing their relationship, their financial and economic relationship with the U.S. and the E.U. if this BRICS summit was to take place with Vladimir Putin attending without him being arrested?",

And we're very aware of the fact that there's difference of opinions. We maintain that we're actively in the line. We do not take any sides in this war, doesn't mean that we are agnostic about the human rights abuses. We understand, we have an analysis of what NATO may or may not have done definitely to prevent this war, but we do not condone the unlawful use of force by Russia and we've made that very clear. We do see it as an illegal war and we're focusing our attentions and our efforts at the moment on building peace between Russia and Ukraine. So, over the next couple of weeks, six African heads of states will be visiting both Ukraine and Russia to look at whether we could get them around the table to at least get the ceasefire in place so that negotiations towards, you know, peace can continue. That is what we engage in with the U.S. on, we engage in with the E.U. and the G7 on, because I think it's in the interest of the globe that we have peace in Europe. You know, this conflict could escalate into one that could be catastrophic for the entire world, as it does involve nuclear powers.",

And what Imean by that is, obviously, South Africa has entertained Sergey Lavrov who has visited, of course. But on top of that, it's the sort of joint military exercises between South Africa and Russia, for example, the fact that South Africa has been accused by the U.S. embassy of sending weaponry to Moscow. Can you see why many people would question whether or not South Africa was truly neutral situation when it comes to the war between Russia and Ukraine?",

There's a set of facts that our defense ministries put forward, and that, you know, from our defense ministry, is that no arms was given to Russia, because if any arms was given to Russia to break our own domestic laws, that's why the president has set up a commission of inquiry led by a retired judge to investigate what actually happened to see what, you know, what set of facts prevail. So, as soon as we get the kind of evidence from the U.S. and they have promised to give it to us, certain actions will be taken if it is found that our domestic laws have been broken. The military exercises with Russia and China, you know, when we engage with the State Department and the Pentagon and others, they did not have an in principle opposition to us having these kinds of military exercises because we do the same with the U.S. and others. I think for them, and we agree with them on this, is that the timing of this was unfortunate. And it could give an impression that we may be, you know, biased towards Russia. But as the government, we very firmly stand that we are actively non-aligned. We do not condone the unlawful use of force. We're very concerned about the loss of life of Ukrainians and Russians, but it's Ukrainian civilians that are feeling the brunt of this war and we are quite keen to see that peace prevails.",

So, SnapScan started in 2013 as a way for businesses to accept card payments via a QR code. A customer can scan and pay without the merchant having to stop what they're doing. And so that checkout and that kind of sale interaction becomes really seamless and really self-service for the customer. Since then, we've opened up to provide e-commerce capabilities so merchants can trade online as well as providing a SnapStore pro-card device so that the businesses can accept card payments at their point of sale.",
