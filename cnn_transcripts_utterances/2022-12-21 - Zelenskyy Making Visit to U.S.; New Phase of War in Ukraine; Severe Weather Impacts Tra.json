      "sentences": "A very good Wednesday morning to you. I'm Jim Sciutto.We are following several major stories this morning. There's lots of news. Right now, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, is en route to Washington for his first foreign trip since Russia invaded the country nearly ten months ago. Zelenskyy expected to meet with President Biden at the White House this afternoon, and later deliver critical remarks to a joint session of Congress on Capitol Hill. That is quite an honor. The visit ties the U.S. and Ukraine together more indelibly than ever. They are now very public allies. The war in Ukraine, superpower versus superpower. We'll discuss ahead. Plus, across this country, governors are activating emergency plans ahead of the massive winter storm crossing central and midwestern states. An arctic blast bringing bitterly cold temperatures to much of the U.S. by the end of the week. A so-called bomb cyclone set to bring blizzard conditions as well. We're going to have more on what you need to expect. And, former President Donald Trump's tax returns will be made public in just days. This after the House Ways and Means Committee, on a party line vote, decided to make public six years' worth of returns, claiming the IRS failed to properly audit Trump while he was in office. We begin, though, in Washington where preparations are underway at both the White House and on Capitol Hill for the visit from the Ukrainian President Zelenskyy. Let's begin with CNN's senior White House correspondent MJ Lee. This was quite an announcement yesterday. What more are we learning about what's expected to be accomplished beyond the grand symbolism in Zelenskyy's meeting with Biden? MJ LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Jim, in just a matter of hours, we do expect to see Volodymyr Zelenskyy on U.S. soil. This is the wartime president who really more than anybody else has come to singularly represent the Ukrainian resistance to Russian aggression. And this really marks the first time that the Ukrainian president has left his country since that invasion began back in February. And what we learned overnight is that the planning has been underway for this secret visit for the last ten days or so, that the two sides have been really working together to make sure that certain security parameters that Zelenskyy thought were necessary were met. And CNN reported this morning that a U.S. military aircraft was used to bring Zelenskyy to Washington and that the U.S. really was closely involved in both getting him out of Ukraine and will be involved in getting him eventually back to Ukraine this evening. And he's really not going to be staying long, Jim. He comes to the White House this afternoon. And then, in the evening, he heads over to Capitol Hill to deliver an address to U.S. lawmakers. And I just want you to take a listen to what NSE Spokesperson John Kirby said on our air this morning about the overall purpose and timing of this visit. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Jim, within hours of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy tweeting that he was on his way to the United States, air raid sirens sounded across Ukraine. Now, that's pretty much commonplace every single day here in this war-torn country. But what makes today different is it's the first time Zelenskyy has left Ukraine since the start of the full scale invasion on February 24th.Now, the conversation here is supportive of Zelenskyy's visit to Washington at a time that the U.S. president, Joe Biden, is set to announce billions more in defense spending, including the coveted patriot missile defense system that Ukraine has been asking for - not even for months, but for years. Zelenskyy will be there meeting with lawmakers, holding bilateral meetings and then that prime time address with Congress where he's expected to make his case for Ukraine's support for the long haul. See, he faces a bit of a quandary going into 2023, analysts say. There is pressure from the west, from the United States and NATO, at least some -- some factions in the U.S. and NATO to try to find a resolution to this conflict, to end the conflict next year, to start having peace talks with Russian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who he has met with face-to-face before in Paris, for example. However, in the Ukrainian population, people here feel like they have invested so much in terms of blood and sweat and tears and sacrifice for this war. They will not be satisfied unless there is a return to pre-2014 boundaries. In other words, all of the territory that Russia took before 2014, including illegally annex Crimea, the Ukrainians say they must retake before they're willing to see this war come to an end. Now, that might be different from the view held by some U.S. lawmakers and other western leaders. And so that is going to be Zelenskyy's challenge as a negotiator to try to convince Washington that support for Ukraine needs to include an end to the war on Ukraine's terms, even though it was Russia that started this.

SUSAN PAGE, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, \"USA TODAY\": Yes. Well, I think the terrain is going to get more complicated in Washington when it comes to aid to Ukraine once Republicans take over the House. I mean, remember, 57 House Republicans voted against the May aid package to Ukraine. That number would be bigger, we think, in the new Congress. You know, this -- but this visit can help get over the finish line that giant spending bill which includes $45 billion in aid to Ukraine. That needs to pass by Friday to keep the government open. And support for this aid package, military assistance that the president is expected to announce at his meeting at the White House today, I mean he -- I think one reason that Democrats have been so eager to get this additional aid on its way, approved, is because they know it's going to be harder in the new year to get this kind of massive amounts of aid approved, Jim.",

And the assumption by American officials is that if you're going to end a war, you're going to make some compromises, even if the war wasn't your fault to begin with. That is a very hard message for President Zelenskyy to deliver to the Ukrainian people. But, yes, this -- the United States does not want this war to go on forever. We've been surprised, in fact, that it's gone on for these 300 days that the Ukrainians have managed to hold the Russians at bay this long.

That program is, you know, really centralized within IRS. Are there other audits that could have been going on? I don't think that that's what the Ways and Means Committee is referring to here. But what their argument is, they needed Trump's tax returns because they needed to understand whether or not that mandatory audit program was working efficiency. And what the chairman of the committee is saying is that it was not really working how it was supposed to. And that the first two years of his presidency, that program never audited the former president's tax returns.In fact, what Neal argued in that report last night that was released was that instead they did not begin that process of auditing the returns until 2019, when Neal sent a letter to Treasury requesting six years of the former president's tax returns and asking for them because he said he needed to understand if the mandatory audit program was working effectively and efficiently. That, obviously, was not occurring, according to House Democrats. There's also just going to be a lot more fallout from this. Like you've said, it's going to take a couple of days to do the redactions needed to release the tax returns in their raw form.

And, interestingly, Trump's Save America political action committee funded Passantino, and his law firm, including paying for his representation of Hutchinson. Now, in a statement to CNN, Passantino said he did not advice Hutchinson to mislead the committee, saying, quote, I represented Ms. Hutchinson honorably, ethically and fully consistent with her sole interests as she communicated them to me. Now, before her public testimony, she dropped him as -- and got a new lawyer. And she wound up being, of course, a blockbuster witness for the committee. Now, two sources familiar with the situation tell CNN that Hutchinson has discussed this episode with the Justice Department.
