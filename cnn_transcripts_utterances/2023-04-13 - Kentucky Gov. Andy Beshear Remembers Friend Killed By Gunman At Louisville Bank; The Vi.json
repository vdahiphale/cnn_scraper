And so the lack of a social safety net in the United States and a lot of the reporting that you'll hear around a failing mental health system, and the lack of access and affordability is also an underlying factor here. But we can't discount the fact the United States has six to seven times its share of mass shootings per capita than what it should have and a common factor here is access to firearms.Here's the key thing. When somebody is in a mental health crisis, when they are changing behavior from baseline and you know that baseline -- you know what this person is like and then all of a sudden you're seeing some warning signs of increased aggression or agitation, or losing touch with reality, or depression and hopelessness, that's not the time now to then be selling them a firearm. And if you know that you've got somebody in your life that's never really expressed an interest in buying a gun or owning a gun, and then all of a sudden goes out and buys one while they've got these other challenges going, that's your big red flag. And the other thing in our research we see as well is mass shooters study other mass shooters. They often draw inspiration from them. So that's another big warning sign. If you're purchasing weapons and also unhealthily obsessed with mass shootings that's really where we should be concerned.",
