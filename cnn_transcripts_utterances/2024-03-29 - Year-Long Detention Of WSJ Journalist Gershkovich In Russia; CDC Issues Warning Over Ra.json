So, the fact that we're seeing an uptick here, the CDC wants health providers to know to be on the lookout for it and also the fact that it is a little bit different than we typically see.Now, in terms of the main symptoms of meningococcal disease, it typically presents either as meningitis, which is an infection of the lining in the brain or the spinal cord, or as a bloodstream infection. Things like fever, headaches, stiff neck, nausea, or light sensitivity, or if it's a bloodstream infection, which is actually what we're seeing more of here, fever and chills, fatigue, cold hands and feet, severe aches and pains, rapid breathing. Also later, in the stages of the infection, a dark rash appearing on the skin. Now, what we are seeing -- we can show you a graph here from the CDC, just to show you how big of a spike we're seeing, but it's really important to put this in context. The green line is what you want to be looking at there, the serogroup Y, this is one specific type of this bacteria. We are seeing that spike go up between 2022 and 2023, but we are talking about just more than 400 cases in 2023. So, it is very rare, but that is the highest we have been seeing of these infections since 2014. And the CDC said so far this year, we're off to an even faster start.

And the best way to protect yourself, according to the CDC, is to get vaccinated. The current recommendations are for kids who are 11 or 12 to get a dose of this and a booster at age 16. Also, those who have medical conditions get a primary series and then boost every three to five years. Alisyn.",
