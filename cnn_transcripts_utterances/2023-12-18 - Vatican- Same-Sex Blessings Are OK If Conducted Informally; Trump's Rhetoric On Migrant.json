I think what it's trying to do is, on the one hand, maintain what the church is always taught about marriage, but at the same time offer a welcome and to be more inclusive to same sex couples, to LGBTQ Catholics, many of whom have felt excluded and marginalized by the church. And Pope Francis throughout his pontificate has tried to offer a more inclusive approach on this matter. And this, I think, is in keeping with that long running approach the Pope has had for the last 10 years of his pontificate.",

So at a recent rally, Trump used the phrase poisoning the blood in reference to immigrants crossing the border and said that they are immigrants who are coming from mental institutions, causing crimes. And really, I think he meant, I guess it's hard to say what he meant, just poisoning the blood of the American people and culture.Here's the thing about it, though. That is a phrase that Hitler used in Mein Kampf to say that non-Aryans were being poisoned or the blood of non-Aryans were being poisoned by other races. And this isn't very -- this isn't the first time Trump has invoked phrases used by the Nazis before to gin up his base, to sort of argue against anything less than the most hardcore immigration policies. And yet we haven't seen any movement, any real condemnation from his supporters or the Republican Party at large that you would expect from any other Republican in the field today, which really just shows the level of impunity President Trump knows he enjoys within the party over anything he says.

And they sort of shrugged it off and said, well, I like what he's done for Israel. I like that he moved the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem.And so they sort of shrugged it off. It's pretty amazing.

Not just something that, you know, everybody deals with during pregnancy. It can really be dangerous.What they've really honed in on here is this hormone, GDF-15. Which, as you said, circulates in the body during times of non-pregnancy. But they did find in this study that higher levels of this hormone during pregnancy is associated with higher levels of nausea and vomiting. And another interesting finding they found is that people who've been exposed to this hormone before pregnancy seem to develop sort of a tolerance to it. So that when they had higher levels during pregnancy, they didn't actually feel quite as sick. So there's hope that these understandings about this hormone may lead to better ways to treat or prevent these kinds of severe morning sickness -- guys.",

One is called metformin, which seemed to increase levels of this hormone. So, that medicine is already out there. And so the question is, you know, if somebody had already had this kind of extreme morning sickness in a previous pregnancy, would they know that and try to prevent it by building up this tolerance before they go through pregnancy again? So that could be one potential approach.Another way could be a treatment during pregnancy where you're actually trying to block the effects of this hormone. Of course, these things have to be studied extensively. So it would be a little bit of some time before we figure out whether there could be one of these ways forward. But, of course, it's very exciting to actually find out some more of the scientific underpinnings here.",

This case was the tip of the spear, too. It wasn't just about Meadows. Whatever happened to Meadows could have been picked up by Trump and others in this case. It's a losing battle.
