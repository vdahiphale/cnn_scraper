The breaking developments at this hour, the death toll rising as the sound of sirens and explosions can be heard across southern and central Israel after a surprise attack by Hamas. An Israeli official says at least 300 Israelis have been killed. The former prime minister of Israel Naftali Bennett telling me that the ultimate death toll will be, quote, \"much higher.\" And tonight there are reports that gun battles are still taking place nearly 24 hours after militants first entered Israel by land and sea and air, firing 2200 rockets according to Israel. And this new video, which I'm going to show you right now shows heavily armed Hamas fighters moving through one neighborhood. You can hear the sound of gunfire and scream as militants try to force their way into homes. These are just people at home. Militants just forcing their way in. I mean, the terror is hard to even comprehend. And tonight there are other horrific scenes emerging of Israelis being kidnapped off the streets. In this video you see a woman. Her face covered in blood as she's taken from the trunk of a jeep and shoved into the back seat. Her arms also appeared to be zip-tied. Now according to Hamas, those captured are, quote, \"present\" in all axis in the Gaza Strip. What happens to the people of the Gaza Strip will happen to them, and beware of miscalculation. Well, of course, the hostage issue complicates Israel's efforts to respond. This enormous and highly coordinated assault was a catastrophic failure of intelligence, and in the words of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, what happened today has never been seen in Israel. And tonight the situation on the verge of exploding into an even deadlier conflict. The military wing of Hamas warning Israel of a, quote, \"earth shattering response\" after Israel responded to this attack, air strikes hitting a group of high rises in Gaza. The buildings as you can see collapsing. Palestinians say at least 230 of their people have been killed since Israel returned fire. Tonight at the White House, President Biden and his administration are closely monitoring the situation and our team of reporters is standing by. Nic Robertson and Hadas Gold are OUTFRONT live in Israel tonight. Kayla Tausche is at the White House and Oren Lieberman is in Washington tonight. I want to begin, though, with Nic just over a mile from the Gaza border. And Nic, obviously, we're 24 hours into this now. You are in the wee hours of the morning here. What is the latest there right now?",

In Gaza City, two high-rise buildings collapsed after an air strike. The unrest continuing late into the night with both sides trading rocket fire. As we touched down at Ben Gurion International Airport outside Tel Aviv, air traffic was halted as sirens wailed and travelers took cover. (On-camera): We literally just got off the plane here at Ben Gurion Airport. The sirens have gone off. People are taking cover. We got off the bus, people are taking cover, and you can hear the intercept missiles banging in the air. Nothing incoming here. But everyone is taking cover. They got down. A lot of concern about what's going to happen here this night. (Voice-over): Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been unwavering in his message that Israel is at war with Hamas. Now Israel rushes to regroup with its allies. Despite the intelligence failure that appeared to lead to the attack, it is clear that the true force of the Israeli government's response is yet to come. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Some are presumed alive, according to video footage, and some are presumed not to be alive. But it's an extremely delicate situation.

Those are the people running, as you can see from the festival. And then the hostages still being held by Hamas, as far as we know.

YONI ASHER, WIFE, DAUGHTERS, MOTHER-IN-LAW TAKEN CAPTIVE BY HAMAS: I have no idea where they are right now. But earlier this morning, they were visited in kibbutz Nir Oz, in my mother-in-law's house on the kibbutz. And they were taken by Hamas to Gaza Strip. My mother-in-law, my wife, my two daughters, which are 5-year-old and 3-year-old, and I lost contact with them about 11:00 a.m. When my wife with me on the phone, she told me that the terrorists of Hamas entered the house. And later on the conversation was disconnected. Later on I managed to track her mobile phone by using Google, and I tracked her mobile phone and I saw that the location is in Gaza Strip, in Gaza, in Khan Yunis. And later on, I saw the video which confirmed that my wife and my daughters were taken, like you see in the video, that is on social media, that everyone saw. And all day long, I talked to press and I tried to talk to officials from the state but no one talked to me yet. I don't even know what is the situation regarding the hostages and the situation is not looking good. My wife and mother-in-law also have German citizenship. So with your permission, I would like to approach the German government, the German prime minister, dear Mr. Olaf Schultz, and the German ambassador, Mr. Steffen Seibert, my wife, Doron, German citizen who was taken with her mother, a German citizen, today by Hamas terrorists to Gaza.

And that's how it is as quickly as it begins, it is over. Those Iron Dome missiles, they are tracking and intercepting those rockets that come from Gaza. They are able to detect where the rockets are flying, then they're fired up, the Iron Dome missiles are fired up and they intercept them in the air. You can just see where the impact bursts were in the sky above us now. Another one being fired up over there, John, if you could see it flying up here and behind us here above Gaza as well. They're flying up. There is another salvo coming in. I'll go quiet. We can listen. That's Israel's Iron Dome defensive system working to protect the people of Israel this evening. Those missiles are coming out of Gaza. Perhaps two-and-a-half -- well Gaza is two and a half miles away. The missiles coming from within Gaza there. For the citizens, the Israeli civilians who live in the towns, Zikim, Ashkelon, Ashdod, who live along the coastline here, these Iron Dome rockets are protecting them and their families and this is very much how the situation is playing out this evening. It is very dynamic. We've heard airstrikes going into Gaza. We've heard helicopter gunships supporting the Israeli Defense Forces on the ground.

They clearly protect some of their missiles. They choose other launch positions for those missiles. They've been doing this for a long time and they continue to do it. And despite the attacks going into Gaza this evening, Hamas still able to fire several salvos out, each time those Iron Dome defense systems kick in, that is in response to another salvo of missiles being fired from Gaza. So I would say in the last 10, 15, 20 minutes, perhaps, we've had at least four significant salvos fired out in this area alone and we were able to see salvos being intercepted further south of us in the direction further down the Gaza Strip in that direction -- Erin.",

He is the former Army Commanding General of Europe and the Seventh Army. He was in Israel dozens of times providing air defense support to their army. He has visited their election collection headquarters as well. Robin Wright is with us, fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center, and Philip Smyth, former Soref fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.

What do you make of this, General, that this is all happening now, and we are 24 hours into this and the IDF itself admits that they have still not yet been able to retain, to gain back control of all of their territory. LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes, a couple of things. First, I'd say what you're seeing and what Nic is seeing in very courageous reporting is a lot of rockets and artillery. That is certainly not unusual coming out of the Gaza. That's what they have done since they established themselves back around early 2000s. What's interesting, though, to me when I woke up this morning when I got a call from CNN that this is happening, what was interesting to me was the other synchronized assaults. Nic mentioned that the naval assault. There had been drones being used. The forces of Hamas going off in different directions, through their gates. The drones that they had been using, the denial of services from cyberattacks. This is a very pretty -- this is a very synchronized assault by Hamas. This is an organization that in the past has only used rockets and artillery, as well as suicide bombers. They have never attacked the way they're attacking right now, capturing prisoners, killing soldiers, dropping drone bombs on tanks. This is very different than it's ever been before and it is going to have quite a different repercussion.",

So, as this plays out, I think there will be a lot of questions about how does Israel protect itself down the road? And can you actually eliminate Hamas as a threat? You may be able to behead it, eliminate some of its leaders, attack a lot or destroy a lot of its equipment, but how will Israel in the long term be able to deal with anything that at the end of the day is really political in nature, and there is no sign of any willingness by either side to compromise. Does that mean that even if this one leads to a ceasefire and a cessation of hostilities, a return of hostages, that the issues that led to this attack are still out there and still dangerous for Israel.",

We're already seeing the first phase of this with the Air Force, I think you're going to see an eventual -- a ground assault. And because they don't have great intelligence about what predicted -- should have predicted this attack, it's going to be much more difficult for them to go through that area that has two million people in it, and have a lot of Israelis safe and secure areas.",

In this case, they started going into some of these military facilities around here, that shows a degree of not only coordination, but confidence. The notion that you're actually going after the areas in this country, that theoretically would be the most prepared to repel any kind of attack. And yet, that seems to be exactly what happened.And then there were the raids on the towns. You were mentioning a little while ago, where in fact, we had these reports of people being taken hostage, people being shot at on the streets, civilian populations. All of this points to exactly what we've been talking about all day here, Erin, the idea that this represents a much more coordinated, deeper, well-planned assault than anybody would have expected in the past.",

Chairman, I really appreciate your time. Obviously, you have been closely monitoring the situation, briefed as much as the information has been coming in. President Biden is very clear, the United States is ready to offer all appropriate means of support. Israel hears that. They are making it very clear, they appreciate that. But what does that mean to you, Chairman? How involved will the United States get? REP. ADAM SMITH (D-WA): Well, I think first of all, the intel sharing piece is the big thing that we'll be involved with upfront. And, you know, part of it is as your analysts have been doing a great job, you know, what went wrong here? How can we shore that up? But then we will look at weapons systems, if there's something we can do to help Israel. This is a profound threat, not just Israel, but I think to US interests, but also to global stability. Clearly, Iran played a role in this. This is an effort to ramp up conflict, to push the terrorists forward and to create a very, very dangerous situation. The US will stand with Israel in any way necessary. BURNETT: So Israel has promised a massive response. Residents in Gaza have been, you know, told to get out. Massive -- we've been told, you know, tremendous that it will be unprecedented in scale as this attack has been unprecedented. For you, Chairman, and as Americans try to understand what's happening here, what the implications may be, is the United States going to back anything that Israel does in response? Does Israel have a blank cheque for lack of a better term from the United States, at least for anything it chooses to do?",
