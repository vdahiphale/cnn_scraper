      "sentences": "OUTFRONT nextBreaking news, Trump says he will no longer try to move his Georgia case to a federal court, meaning his trial will now be on national television, international television. Also tonight, his delayed tactics denied. A court ruling in the New York case that could mean the end of his business, that it is now going to be days away from verdict. Plus, as the nation barrels closer to a shutdown, the Republican Party is melting down, members hurling vulgar insults, and the GOP's own impeachment witness says there's no evidence Biden committed a crime. And the war lord that Putin wants the world to see, why this proof of life video raises more questions about this absolutely crucial Putin ally. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, the breaking news, we are following two major legal developments for Trump. First a surprising move, the former president saying he will no longer push to move his Fulton County election case to federal court. Now, Trump and his team said repeatedly they would try to move the case out of the Atlanta area. A couple of possible reasons for that. One, if they had succeeded in moving it to federal court, there wouldn't be cameras. A second reason, of course -- you know, to be clear, the cameras will be now nationally televised in Georgia. A second reason is that moving the trial out of Fulton County likely would have meant at least in the terms of politics of the jury, a more favorable jury pool, one that's more conservative. But he's giving that up completely, and there's big questions as to why. In the meantime, there are also major developments out of New York tonight. An appeals court rejecting Trump's request to delay his New York fraud case, and that means with all of these cases out there and this whole complicated calendar we have talked about, the case that could spell the beginning of the end for Trump's business empire is actually starting on Monday. On Monday. Security around the courthouse tightened ahead of that. The state attorney general has accused Trump and his sons of committing fraud by inflating their wealth again and again over the span of a decade. They're seeking a quarter billion dollars in damages, and possibly taking away Trump's entire ability to have a business in New York. The Attorney General Letitia James also releasing her witness list which does include all three of Trump's children. Now, the only one who is included on that who is not charged due to the statute of limitations is Ivanka Trump, also a witness. So, the question is since she escaped this by the statute of limitations, what will her testimony be? How damaging could it be for her father and brothers as Trump defends the thing that matters most to him and vaulted him to the White House, his supposed wealth? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We had been anticipating, and as a matter of fact, the former president's lawyers had told the judge in Georgia, Scott McAfee, Judge Scott McAfee, that they were anticipating that they would be filing a request to remove their case to federal court, and just ahead of the deadline, the deadline was tomorrow, they've decided that they are going to leave the case in the state court in Fulton County. There's a couple of things that means.Obviously as you pointed out, Erin, it means we're going to see the trial proceed. This is going to be on camera, which is not the case if it was in federal court. The other thing is the legal filing from the Trump team says that they believe that this judge, Scott McAfee will fully and completely protect the former president's right to a fair trial. So it appears that they feel more comfortable with the judge that they have in Georgia, the judge in federal court, Steve Jones, is an Obama appointee. He's the one that rejected the effort by mark meadows to have his case removed to federal court. Of course, Erin, you know that this is still under appeal, and one of the things that's open to question is whether an appeals court, if the appeals court decides that they can remove Mark Meadows' case, whether the rest of the defendants get to move their cases as well.",

You think he will succeed now that you have had time to think about it? GOODMAN:  I think at the minimum he will succeed in getting the order from the judge, at least temporarily stayed. It does not go into effect, and he gets an opportunity to appeal the judge's decision.

The Congress fails again and again to address America's national debt, $33 trillion. It is growing very quickly. It has grown a trillion dollars in the past three months alone. A trillion dollars of extra spending, and yet, they're calling each other scum bags behind closed doors and going ahead with an impeachment inquiry where the star witness says there's not enough evidence for impeachment.

That's because one of the bills to fund the Agriculture Department includes some antiabortion pill amendments and provisions that moderates are balking at. Leadership is pushing ahead with the vote anyway. But if one or more of these bills fails tonight, it would race serious questions about McCarthy's ability to govern and avoid a shutdown, which is 48 hours away. And, also, Erin, it's probably going to raise pressure on him to work with Democrats. But the problem there is that Kevin McCarthy knows if he works with Democrats, it will trigger a vote to remove him as speaker, a feud and rebellion being led by Matt Gaetz, not only confronting him this morning but also was out with a tweet a few hours ago with a report card giving Kevin McCarthy some poor grades.

Matthew Chance is OUTFRONT. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CHIEF NTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice- over):  Behind the daily strikes and information war is raging, fueling speculation about key Russian figures, forcing the Kremlin to dispel the ruse, like those swirling around hard line Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov now shown on state TV meeting President Putin, after rumors he was gravely ill. Rumors spread by Ukrainian intelligence and that Kadyrov is denied on social media. I strongly advise all those who can't tell the difference between truth and lies on the Internet to go for a walk in the fresh air and put their thoughts in order, he wrote. In recent weeks, Russia has been busy denying Ukrainian claims that a strike on its Black Sea fleet headquarters in Sevastopol killed dozens of Russian naval officers, including the overall commander. Admiral Viktor Sokolov soon appeared in an undated video call with Russian defense officials. His stiff appearance, though, only fueled speculation about his condition. Finally, the admiral is shown handing out medals to the Russian navy soccer team, answering questions, apparently on the attack, although CNN can't verify when the event took place.

And even Russia's defense minister shortly after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year vanished from view for over a week, eventually popping back up on a video conference call with Putin, a sign, perhaps, he was back in favor.

It's the result of an aggressive, illegal war determined to be a war of genocide. Putin himself is under the threat of arrest should he go anywhere outside of Russia, basically.

And if what this does is create incentives for other countries not to commit the kind of illegal aggression that Russia has committed, that's just fine.A lot of hard headed people, Bob Zoellick, the foreign president of the World Bank, Lawrence Summer, the former secretary of the treasury, have looked into this with us, and have concluded that there would not with be a destabilizing effect. There wouldn't be what some people call de-dollarization. In fact, the incentives would be entirely positive. So all of the scare tactics about how this would be destabilizing, they're just not true. What is destabilizing is to have a country for the first time since World War II break the international agreements and simply invade a neighbor, a sovereign neighbor. And private property I'm advocating thinking, it's actually very complicated to take the private yachts of oligarchs, that's all tied up in litigation. But a nation like Russia does not have private property rights. It's a sovereign, and because it's a sovereign nation, it's a matter of international diplomacy. Not a matter of law. That's why Canada, following the examples that we set in this report, is considering not involving the courts and the seizures so that the judicial obstacles to seizing these assets will not be in the way. You know, I studied this for decades, and I think the answer is clear. The power of the executive branch to engage in foreign policy along these lines in order to discourage illegal aggression is very clear, both in the United States and in other G7 countries.",

And I also think this message was for Democrats because there's a lot of talk about how the Democratic base is unenthused. Well, Democrats have to show up at this election too. You don't have to be super excited to know we have to vote to protect our democracy.
