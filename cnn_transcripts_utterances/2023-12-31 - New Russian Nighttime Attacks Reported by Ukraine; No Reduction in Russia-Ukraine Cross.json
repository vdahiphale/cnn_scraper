And really using it to remind Americans of the continued war on the ground there. Saying that Russian President Vladimir Putin's intentions have not changed in the two years since this war broke out.He's also using this as a moment to call on Congress to pass new assistance for Ukraine, and really telling lawmakers that the defensive systems that have been passed already, the Patriot missile batteries of their defensive systems have saved lives on the ground there, including just this week. But that -- if those systems aren't provided in the future, the Ukrainians will essentially be left defenseless. In a statement, the president saying, unless Congress takes urgent action in the new year, we will not be able to continue sending the weapons and vital air defense systems Ukraine needs. We cannot let our allies and partners down. History will judge harshly those who fail to answer freedom's call. But remember, this new funding for Ukraine is tied up in this debate back in Washington between Democrats and Republicans over immigration, over tightening the rules at the border. And it remains to be seen whether this new air assault will do anything to change the minds of skeptical Republicans, who at the end of the day really just don't support new funding for Ukraine. They don't believe that it is in America's best interest. Just this last week, the White House said that it had approved the final amount of money that was left in the existing authorization, $250 million in assistance to Ukraine, but essentially saying that that was the bottom of the barrel. That no new funding would be going forward unless it is passed by Congress. So, President Biden really hoping to use this moment to convince these lawmakers that that assistance is necessary going forward. And as he returns to Washington next week, that will certainly be at the top of his agenda as the war in Ukraine continues to rage on. Kevin Liptack, CNN, traveling with the president in Saint Croix.

Like I mentioned, some of those rain and snow total was not really all that impressive. Even for the spine of some of those highest elevations, only looking at a few inches of snow. So, it leaves you with some pretty quiet conditions as you're headed out for your New Year's in the evening. Not too much rain and snow, pretty much really nationwide. Temperature is kind of seasonal, a little bit on the chilly side going for a temperature at 32 degrees in Minneapolis. Some 30s down to St. Louis. You've got temperatures in the 30s and 40s even up into the northeast. If you're looking for that forecast for Times Square, that ball drop, headed into the upper 30s by midnight with just a few clouds, maybe a flake or two could fly. But for the most part, looking at some dry conditions with a little bit of a breeze, you'll find those wind chills in the middle 30. So, you'll definitely want to bundle up. But upper 30s is kind of seasonal, kind of right where those temperatures usually are for this time of year. When you look at the records, the warmest records for that midnight ball drop in New York City, all those records are in the middle 50s. We actually hit one, the third warmest on record coming into this year, 2023, but that temperature of 54 degrees, 2022 was also top five for record warm. Back in 2018, we were rivaling one of the coldest ball drops on record, we just missed it. Second spot, nine degrees, that was set back in 2018. We're going to keep things quiet going into New Year's Day. Again, not too much in the way of rain or snow, really anywhere in the U.S. Things are staying pretty quiet. Temperatures are seasonal or a little bit below average. Temperature of 49 degrees, I thought it is on a chilly side for Atlanta. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

CNN's Marc Stewart looks at what it can mean for the country's missile program, which has been banned by the U.N. Security Council. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MARC STEWART, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  In a forceful statement, North Korea announced plans to launch three spy satellites in 2024. Experts feel this is significant because this technology could help advance its long-range missile program. The remarks were made during the ruling Workers Party meeting to set state goals for the next year. North Korea successfully launched a spy satellite in recent months after two known failures. This comes as the International Atomic Energy Agency expressed concern after detecting signs of a new reactor operating at the nation's main nuclear complex. That potential raises concern as it could allow North Korea to produce nuclear components at a faster pace. Recently, state media reported that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un instructed the country's army, the weapons industry, and others to accelerate war preparations in response to, \"Confrontation moves by the U.S.\" Some context, these remarks by Kim Jong Un come amid perceptions by North Korea of a strengthening alliance between the United States and South Korea.
