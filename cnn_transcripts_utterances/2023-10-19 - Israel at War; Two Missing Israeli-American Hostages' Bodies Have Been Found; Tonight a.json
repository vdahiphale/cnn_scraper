(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [10:45:00] BERMAN:  President Biden says, he expects aid trucks from Egypt will begin rolling into Gaza as soon as tomorrow. They will enter here through the Rafah Crossing. The president said, a deal for 20 trucks has been agreed to by Israel and Egypt so long as the supplies do not get to Hamas.

But because of what was transpiring in Congress, and at the time, the speaker had been kicked out, of course, there still is no speaker, it's pretty dysfunctional. No matter what he asked for in terms of help for now in the Middle East as well, Israel as well, it's going to be very tricky.But I happened to have at that time the opportunity to sit with Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. And I asked her what the president needed to do to at least make the case for Ukraine, which in the last few weeks has essentially fallen off of the visibility map. Here's what she told me.

You know, as you said, Allen Weisselberg, the former chief financial officer, his son has just taken the stand for the second day today, and they just began questioning by the state attorney general's office. You know, a lot of this has to do when he helped the Trump organization get a loan for one of the buildings, and these loans are at the center of this case.But it's very different mood from yesterday where just before the lunch break, there was a woman who was dressed in professional clothing. She walked up into the gally, the public area of the courtroom where all the reporters are sitting, and approached the court officer who was standing just in from of Former President Trump who was seated on the other side in the well at the defense table. And the woman had spoken with him, it was inaudible to hear what she had said. I was sitting about four rows back from where this happened. And then he, apparently, told her to go sit down, so she walked back down the aisle, sat across the aisle from me. And then another court officer came over and asked her to leave. Now, when they took her outside, there was a heated exchange there. She was ultimately arrested and charged with court disturbance -- contempt of court, disruption of a court proceeding. And we learned that she is a court employee, and has been placed on administrative leave. Now, it seemed that the former president was completely unaware that this had happened because when he was asked about it later, he did not know what had occurred. But, you know, that was the scene yesterday. Today, we're back on the course of just the normal testimony. John.",
