Any moment, state and federal investigators in Long Island, New York, will update the public on the first arrest in their decade-long investigation into the Gilgo Beach murders. This is a case tied to at least ten sets of human remains discovered since 2010 along the shore in suburban Long Island. Earlier this afternoon, a married father of two and a New York City architect named Rex Heuermann was arraigned and pleaded not guilty. Heuermann is connected to the serial murders of three women and is the prime suspect in a fourth. Those three women were part of a group known to law enforcement as the Gilgo four. Their bodies were found near each other, wrapped in burlap, discovered within days of each other in 2010. They were all in their 20s and all of them, according to authorities, offered sex services on Craigslist. Now, as new details from investigators emerge, showing Heuermann used burner phones and a fake email account, the district attorney says a surveillance team used a pizza box that they saw Heuermann throw into the trash and then they matched DNA from a pizza crust to DNA found on one of the victims. Perhaps even more disturbing, prosecutors say Heuermann took at least one of the victims' phones and used the phone to call the families and taunt the families after allegedly killing the women. Our reporters are covering this across the state of New York. CNN's Brynn Gingras is in New York City for us, and CNN's Miguel Marquez is near the suspect's house in Massapequa. Brynn, let me start with you. What are we expecting to hear from authorities when they speak at any moment?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, just more details of how they uncovered this suspect. I want to tell you, though, Jake, in court, the Suffolk County district attorney said that they actually had to stop this investigation early because they say Heuermann was still in contact with sex workers, and they feared for their safety.As you said, this is a 59-year-old family man, married with two children, pretty much flying under the radar. An architect in New York City but had a home in Massapequa, now charged with three of those murders but considered, as you said, the prime suspect in the fourth murder, the Gilgo four. This goes back to 2010 when those four bodies of the women who were sex workers advertising their business on Craigslist, their body were found near each other wrapped in burlap sacks, a couple of them were tied with duct tape, another restrained with belts. And they basically connected those four and then other remains were found. And really, this is a case that's haunted detectives for quite a long time. It picked up more steam in 2022 when there was a new administration, new police commissioner in Suffolk County who came from the NYPD. They created a task force, and that's when really this investigation took off. As you said, so much detail of how they found or connect Heuermann to these crimes. Let me go through it. They issued 300 subpoenas. They had numerous search warrants, and they collected a ton of evidence including burner cell phones that they say Heuermann used to taunt the victims' family members. He used them allegedly to do research about serial killers, about child pornography, about sadistic websites. He had fake emails that were connected to him, as well. And then there is some DNA evidence that they obtained, as well. As you mentioned, there were hairs that were uncovered in those burlap sacks that the DNA matching, they say, that pizza crust that they got from a pizza box that Heuermann discarded. They also found hairs of his wife in the evidence on those bodies of those women. According to authorities, his wife and kids were out of town when these murders were actually done. So, just so much detail and I expect we'll hear more from the district attorney about how they can connect Heuermann to these three cases, the prime suspect in the fourth. But it will be interesting to see if he does talk about the other murders that have haunted this area of Long Island. Is he or is he a prime suspect in those cases, as well?",

In all, there were 11 bodies found in this area of Gilgo Beach. And four of them now, the investigators say they believe they have the person who did it.I want to show what's happening at the house because it's still very much an active investigation here. There are vehicles from both Suffolk County and state troopers out here. We just saw several individual leave from the house with boxes of evidence. Clearly, what they are trying to do now is tie down every possible lead to every one of those deaths along the Gilgo Beach area in the 2010s. They have been here for much of the day, since very early this morning. The arrest was made last night. And they are going to look for everything they cannot only from email and cell phones, but any other physical evidence that might be in his house and possibly in his office. It's been an hour, hour and a half commute to Manhattan from here. He worked in Midtown Manhattan. Once they had that partial DNA and they had him as a possible suspect, they then went to collect DNA from him. They surveilled him, they watched him, eat a piece of pizza, put it in a box, dump it on 5th Avenue in Manhattan. They collected that, and that has so far solved it for them -- Jake.",

And basically, they're even saying this is a sigh of relief, because, Jake, this is a case, again, that's haunted investigators, it's haunted that community. People kind of thought police didn't care, right, because these are sex workers as victims. They thought maybe because of their occupation alone that police really gave up on this. So there is a new energy of this community that maybe this will get solved for all of the victims. But, again, we're still waiting it hear from those four family members who, of course, you can imagine there's just a sigh of relief because they've been waiting so long for just some sort of answer as to who might have done this. I do want to mention, Jake, we did hear from the attorney of Rex Heuermann after he had his court appearance, and he did say apparently to his attorney that I didn't do this, he said he was doing it through tears and seemed distraught about these charges. This is a -- I know we keep talking about he's an architect, a family man. His physical appearance is interesting, too, because that's also something authorities have tied him to. Witnesses for one of the murders say he seemed like an ogre. And if you saw him in court, he is a very big man. And I think we're about to hear from the district attorney.",

He is a New York City architect. He pleaded not guilty today after being charged in connection with the deaths of three of the four women that had been known as the Gilgo four or the Gilgo Beach four. Four women found dead on the beach in Long Island.Heuermann is the prime suspect in the disappearance and death of a fourth member of the group. Let's bring back CNN's Brynn Gingras. Brynn, obviously, a lot, a lot of work by investigators and lots of forensic details that we got and heard about ways that they figured out who in their view is the killer, stuff that police could not have done 10, 20, 30 years ago.

      "sentences": "Yeah, Jake, I think they were so descriptive for two reasons. One, I think because they wanted to tell the public this is every step we took to make this case come to where it is today. And this, again, has haunted police, it's haunted that community. They wanted answers as to who may have committed these murders. So, that's one reason.The second is you heard mitochondrial DNA. Now, actually had an up- close look being solved by the NYPD where mitochondrial DNA was used. If you heard the district attorney there, he said that they got his name, Rex Heuermann basically six weeks into forming the task force. Well, once you have a name the case works backwards. That's what he is describing for everyone. They got this name, Rex Heuermann and then from there, they could go back to the evidence that they collected there at the scenes alongside that beach where the DNA, you know, had been weathered from storms. It wasn't that great. They couldn't put a name at that point. And they can figure out, oh, hey, there's a hair in one of -- in this evidence, that hair belongs to Rex Heuermann's wife, according to him. So they basically work it as a puzzle backwards once they have that name. And then as I said, they were able to then go to the grand jury and start getting those search warrants, those subpoenas, and go forward with the investigation from that point forward which is basically, again, the cell phones, the burner phones, the searches that he was doing, of family members of the victims, the victims' names themselves, the sex workers he was still trying to reach with burner phones, and all of those details that are just so incredible to this investigation. And again, you just heard him say there this was something that was continuing. They believe that he was still contacting sex workers and had to cut the investigation short because they were worried about the safety of others. But I think that is why he is being so detailed because that mitochondrial DNA is a very controversial topic. It is approved in the state of New York. It's done by the New York state police in a lab. But it does come with a lot of controversy. I think they want to hammer home this is why we want this sort of technology because it helps clear cases like this one which has haunted communities for more than a decade.",

But I didn't know that kind of thing actually happened.O'TOOLE:  It does happen. It doesn't happen certainly in every case. But oftentimes when people engage in that kind of behavior, that in and of itself, hearing the fear in the person's voice, if the person receiving the call started to cry said, who are you, why are you doing this, that could be sexually arousing for the person who could be masturbating on the other end of the phone. I don't mean to be too graphic, but we know that's the behavior someone like that would engage in. So wanting to hear the fear in their voices is really to me pretty indicative of sexual sadism which is being sexually aroused by the victim's response to the inflection of physical or emotional pain. So the physical pain was inflicted on the homicide victims. The emotional pain was inflicted on family members.",

What if the suspect's wife is out of town, then why would her hair be there if he's in town and cell tower and other information triangulates him there, et cetera. And so, it's something the prosecutors will use I think with great success.Having said that, Jake, I wish to tell you that at this stage, the press conference seemed to be a victory lap, and it should not be, and here's why -- I don't mean to be the downer here. It's a significant development certainly to that community that someone has been brought to justice who they believe very strongly is the killer. We heard a lot of detailed information and evidence, much more detailed than I would imagine the D.A. would release at this point. But there's a long way to go. This is an indictment. And I just want to be clear about what an indictment is. An indictment is an accusation brought by a grand jury which consists of 23 people from the community, a majority, that's 12, who have to vote on an indictment. It is not proof beyond a reasonable doubt. It is simply an indication that a crime was committed, and the belief is that the suspect here committed it. And so it's very important as they have this victory lap drilling down on all the details and specifics with respect to the evidence they have which is a lot to overcome to be clear, that there's a lot more to go. And this will be challenged in every regard, including the DNA and whether the testing, although DNA is significant, was done properly, whether there was any taint, any contamination. So very good development that they have a suspect and he was indicted, but it's a far cry from a conviction, and that remains to be seen whether they will get it notwithstanding the compelling evidence that seems to be released in that press conference.",

He may have sought treatment at a hospital for a poison ivy infection as part of his job or interests. He has access to or stockpile of burlap sacks, unquote. That is a rather specific profile and if Heuermann is ultimately responsible, incredibly accurate. How did forensic profilers go about making these predictions? Where did the poison ivy thing come from? O'TOOLE:  Well, these are really not predictions. What they've done is they obtained from investigators at the time all investigative reports, all the photographs. They developed all the victimology so they were -- they looked at all the forensic laboratory reports. So from all of that information, that's what gives them the foundation to be able to say this is how we interpret all of this evidence as they put it together like a puzzle.

That means there is no set of bail which would allow for his release. Following that, there will be the exchange of discovery that is of specific information that was released today, to the defense. That will be challenged, and I would presume if there's no plea, there will be a trial. That will take several months, of course. Maybe even a lot longer than that. And then there will be a jury empaneled of 12 who would have to establish beyond a reasonable doubt his guilt. And in the event that that occurs at some point, I believe which will be next year, if we're looking forward, if there's no plea before that, then without question based upon the horrific nature of these circumstances and these deaths, it's a life sentence.",

The technology really didn't exist. So for example, years ago you had to make sure that there was a root on a hair so that you could obtain DNA. Now the technology has advanced. And now they can analyze hairs that don't have roots and obtain DNA. So this technology in terms of the advances that we've seen in hair analysis and DNA have been absolutely tremendous and the kinds of information that we can get that will really hone in on a particular person is absolutely amazing. And these crimes were committed decades ago, so his lens is looking at the forensic evidence, him being the suspect, looking at forensic evidence from ten years ago which probably gave him confidence back then that they could never tie him to these cases. These kinds of offenders don't anticipate that there will be these advances in forensic technology which is going to connect them to the case. So it's pretty amazing.",

Right now, a major union representing 160,000 actors is on strikes, joining the writers who have been on strike with the same studios and streaming services since early May. The main hang-ups between the two sides, actors and writers receive very little compensation with streaming services compared to what they get for reruns airing on network television. There are also major concerns about the future of artificial intelligence and the ability to replace voice actors and writers and even dancers.Hollywood A-listers including George Clooney and Matt Damon are striking, too. But this is not about wealthy actors complaining about being less wealthy. Average actor makes only about $65,000 a year compared to say, George Clooney, and the inflation adjusted salary has dropped 20 percent over the past decade, and more broadly the issues at the center of the strike will change and potentially cripple the entertainment industry as we know it. Most actors, writers, production crews are losing their ability to make a basic living. That has a trickle down effect to other industries outside of Hollywood. And with us now to discuss this, actress Fran Drescher, you might know her from \"The Nanny,\" I first noticed her in \"This is Spinal Tap\". She's president of the Screen Actors Guild, American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, or SAG-AFTRA. Thank you so much for being here, Ms. Drescher. A lot of our viewers might be thinking these Hollywood actors, they make so much money, what's the big deal. Help them understand. FRAN DRESCHER, PRESIDENT, SAG-AFTRA:  Well, 99 percent of our members, the largest entertainment union in the world, are just working people, just trying to make a living, just trying to pay their rent, just trying to put food on the table and get their kids off to school. So, that is an illusion. And everything that you watch that you enjoy, that you're entertained by are scenes filled with people that are not making the big money. There may be one person in the scene that is, and everybody else are journeymen actors. But we don't stand here just for us. We stand here on behalf of workers across America, and around the world because what's happening to us is not unique. It's just we're able to get people like you to listen to us. But it's not just about us, and it's not just about the people in this industry. Everywhere across the nation and around the world, workers are being marginalized and dishonored and disrespected, and they're losing their livelihood, and it's a very dangerous time, and these people that are standing here, they know what that experience is because they are living it. Not entertainment of dystopia, actually living it, and not like the mega rich millionaires and billionaires who are running these companies.
