And we're just getting bits and pieces of information coming in right now, Kaitlan. But I'll tell you what we know. This happened at a school called the Vladislav Ribnikar Elementary School. It is in an upscale neighborhood in Belgrade.This happened according to the Ministry of Internal Affairs around 8:40 in the morning or so. So early on in the school day local time. And they say that a 14-year-old boy, who they say is a seventh grader, they're identifying him only by his initials, K.K., brought his father's gun to school and started firing. As you mentioned, nine people have been killed, eight of them children. One of them was a school security guard. Seven injured, six of them children. One of them was a teacher. We also know that a young girl inside that school is currently inside of a hospital undergoing life-threatening surgery. Police are obviously still on scene. They are looking into the circumstances of what exactly happened. There was also a moment where the 14-year-old boy, who was apprehended in the schoolyard, by the way, was brought out of the school. He had a jacket over his head. He was wearing skinny blue jeans and he was put inside of an unmarked car under arrest by police. There were also children coming out of that school, some of them obviously quite visibly distraught, as you can imagine. I should also mention very quickly that gun laws are obviously much stricter in Serbia than they are in the U.S. Basically, fully automatic weapons, weapons with a concealer, things like that, those are pretty well outright banned. You can get semiautomatic weapons with a permit or a gun license, but there are also plenty of leftover guns from the conflict in the 1990s. We don't know whether this was a legally owned gun or not, but obviously, authorities are going to give an update in the next 45 minutes and we're hoping get more information -- Kaitlan.",

New overnight, we're learning what Tucker Carlson texted that was so worrisome to FOX executives and the board that it reportedly contributed to his firing. \"The New York Times\" reported on the message, which was sent on January 7th, 2021, obviously a pivotal day right after the insurrection, just hours after those riots at the Capitol. And he was talking about a video he saw of Trump supporters beating up, in his words, an Antifa kid.It was redacted in the Dominion lawsuit court filings, but here is what part of \"The Times\" says is the behind that big black box at the bottom, right, of those filings. A quote from Tucker's text, it read, quote, \"It was three against one, at least, jumping a guy like that is dishonorable, obviously. It's not how white men fight. Yet suddenly I found myself rooting for the mob against the man, hoping they'd hit him harder, kill him. \"I really wanted them to hurt the kid. I could taste it. Then somewhere deep in my brain an alarm went off. This isn't good for me. I'm becoming something I don't want to be,\" closed quote. \"The Times\" is only able to unveil the contexts of that text with interviews with peoples who spoke on the condition of anonymity. CNN reached out for comment. FOX declined. Carlson did not immediately respond. Let's talk about this and a lot more with the co-founder and editor- in-chief of Semafor, Ben Smith. Also a perfect person to talk to because you just have this new book out that we're going to talk about as well called \"Traffic: Genius, Rivalry, and Delusion, and the Billion-Dollar Race to Go Viral.\" You write a lot about the rise of right-wing populism online. So we'll get to the book in a minute. But, wow, this Tucker text, do you think that's why this thing didn't go to trial? BEN SMITH, CO-FOUNDER AND EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, SEMAFOR: I mean, this was the thing that I think every reporter was trying to get, and kudos to \"The Times\" for figuring it out. And, you know, the thing with a lot of the reasons people say that Tucker Carlson was fired, I think that there are a lot of viewers who would not be totally shocked to see him say something that racist. But FOX had been somehow, in their own minds, I guess, holding up this line that, you know, all these allegations of racism against Tucker and against FOX were totally false. And I do think this line about this is how white men fight was -- may have been the last straw for them there. Made it harder to pretend anything else. The rest of the text is very dark and reflective, but I think less likely to be the thing that triggered his firing.",

Like Facebook was -- Barack Obama visited Facebook because obviously Facebook is a Democratic institution for college kids that help Barack Obama get out the vote.And I think a lot of people in that early sort of online world thought, well, the election of Barack Obama is like the culmination of this new digital revolution. And I think what -- but when I looked back at like who was building this world, in fact, a lot of these early right-wing figures, Andrew Breitbart, Steve Bannon, were -- you know, were there all along, were very interested, were studying these digital media tools. And as the universe of people on social media grew, you saw these conservatives really make the most of them and channel a lot of the anger that you also see in conservative cable. Just that raw, often racially divisive anger. And take that to really fuel, among other things, the Trump campaign in 2016.

And when it came to this kind of political stuff, you could see, wow, the most divisive stuff, sometimes the most, the stuff that pushes the edge hardest is what attracts people.And Facebook then built this kind of a mechanism, you know, where they were also looking for engagement, looking to see, well, what do people stick to, and what will people comment on?
