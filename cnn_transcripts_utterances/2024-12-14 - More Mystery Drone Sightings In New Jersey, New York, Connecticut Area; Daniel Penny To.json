What is going on with these mysterious sightings of drones flying overhead?Federal officials keep saying they are not a threat to public safety or to National Security, but that has not stopped angry demands for answers as more lawmakers and police report sightings. President-elect Donald Trump has said the public has a right to know or he says it is time to start shooting them out of the sky. Our Gloria Pazmino is joining us now with more on this, and Gloria, this isn't just everyday people demanding answers, although there are plenty of those, elected officials, local officials also sound angry as well, and yet, no one really can say what is going on here.",

It gets a little bit more strange as the day goes on, and as you said, people from governors to local state lawmakers to mayors and other lawmakers are asking for answers. I should say, even though the current president- elect suggested that these things should be shot out from the sky. There is a lot of law enforcement personnel and public officials who have warned against doing exactly that.There is actually quite a bit of bad things that could happen if you actually shoot one of these things out of the sky. Some of them are reported to be quite large and could create fires should they be -- should they happen to fall or certainly injure people when they -- if they come crashing down. Now, here in New York, we have seen several reports of these drones throughout the last several days. The governor, Governor Kathy Hochul here said that last night a local airfield had to shut down its airspace after reported drone sightings over the area. This happened in Orange County, and she too, is calling for federal officials to step in and do more to respond, but specifically to provide the public with some answers about what is going on here. Now, to that end, we heard from some of those federal officials earlier today during a call with officials who are working on their response to these drone sightings and while they tried to say that there is still nothing to worry about, that these do not pose a danger to the public, they said that it is still not known to them whether or not there is a criminal element to these, or if they are actually malicious. I want you to take a listen to a local state official from New Jersey, another state where sightings have been reported, talking about what he has witnessed. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ERIK PETERSON (R), NEW JERSEY ASSEMBLYMAN, DISTRICT 23: They are lying. Now, why? Why would you lie? Either because the reason that this is happening is incredibly embarrassing to the administration, or it is an incredibly high risk -- security risk for the country and they don't want to tell us.

Other people of note at the game in the box with Donald Trump include House Speaker Mike Johnson, incoming Majority Leader of the Senate John Thune, also Daniel Penny. He was the ex-Marine who was acquitted this week on charges related to fatally choking a homeless man to death on the New York Subway. He also was spotted in Trump's box as well.

Also, Devin Nunes, he is the former chair of the House Intelligence Committee who will have a role on the Intelligence Advisory Board. It is an interesting pick because he also has some conflicts of interest, just like many of Trump's choices, he is the current CEO of Truth Social, the social media website that Donald Trump launched after leaving the White House, and now, he will stay in that role and also be advising the president-elect on National Security issues. And then finally, Bill White. He is going to be the ambassador to Belgium. He is a longtime Trump donor, someone who helped fundraise for him not only during this most recent campaign, Jessica, but also after the 2020 election, when Donald Trump was trying to raise money to fight and pay for his legal bills related to trying to overturn the election.",

We appreciate it.As republicans prepare to take control of both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, Democrats are going back to the drawing board, and with that, my next guest believes he has the playbook to lead Democrats out of the political wilderness in which they now find themselves. New York State Senator James Skoufis is vying to become the next chair of the Democratic National Committee, and he joins us now. Thanks so much for being here with us. I just want to start with a simple question of why you? JAMES SKOUFIS (D), NEW YORK STATE SENATOR: Thanks for having me, Jessica. The reason why I am running is because the single most important thing that the next DNC chair must do is throw out the old stale DC playbook where we basically light money on fire, give way too many resources to the DC consultant class, the folks I am referring to is the cocktail circuit in Washington, and the best way to do that is to bring in an outsider who is aggressive and knows how to win. And so I come from a district that Donald Trump just won by 12 percentage points while I was re-elected by 14. I am a fresh perspective, a new generation. I don't have the years' long relationships at the DNC like some of my competitors, but I view that as a positive. I will be able to tell the folks who should have been told no a long time ago that we are going to be doing things differently moving forward.",

We can't just go with another product of a party machine. They realize, given the circumstances here, we need to do things differently within the DNC and the National Democratic Party, so the message has been resonating. Obviously, I am introducing myself to basically anyone who is outside of New York at this point.

I don't know that we needed to be spending hundreds of millions of dollars sending out 15 mailers a day in battleground states to talk about an issue that people know where we all stand on. We should have been using many of those resources to talk about the bread and butter -- affordability, public safety issues that were top of mind for voters that we just weren't leaning as hard into. But make no mistake, I think we have gotten into this, you know, fall into this trap sometimes as Democrats of telling people how to think, telling people how to feel. We spent the majority of the past four years telling folks the economy was doing well, when in fact they go to the supermarket and see for themselves with their own two eyes, in their opinion, it was not. And so we've got to stop pushing these sort of white paper talking points onto folks, do a lot less lecturing and a lot more listening. What it really comes down to, reorienting this National Democratic Party again to focus on the working class, the firefighters, the Teamsters. So many of our traditional allies did not endorse our top of the ticket this past cycle, and the reason for that is we've lost sight of our roots and our roots have always been the middle class and working class.

I would expect that the next batch of pardons would be a similar kind of group, and that we would see more of these pardons as President Biden gets closer to leaving office. Now, there may also be some controversial pardons towards the end, as most presidents do. Sometimes they are friends, sometimes people who have influence with them end up getting pardons at the last minute. They save those pardons to the very end because they know they can be controversial. They know they can get blowback. President Biden doesn't have a lot of friends that have spent time in prison or that have records, but I wouldn't be surprised if you know someone beyond just his son gets a pardon that leads to some controversy, including the idea of preemptive pardons for people who have not even been charged yet, that's something that President Biden is also considering as well.",

And so this idea of the rule of law being something that Democrats campaigned on in 2020 and 2024, and now it seems to be a talking point that they don't have as much ability to make, in part because of the actions of the president that has left a lot of Democrats with a bad taste in their mouth and a lot of agony about the legacy of Joe Biden.",
