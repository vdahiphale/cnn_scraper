Senior Russian officials say a counterterrorism operation has killed more than 70 militants who attack towns and villages in the Belgorod region.One of the militant groups made up of pro-Ukrainian anti-Putin Russian dissidents says the fighting is ongoing and they still control some Russian territory. Neither claim has been independently verified, but two days of fighting force Moscow to order the evacuation of some towns close to the border. Kremlin officials blame Ukraine for the cross-border incursions. More details down from CNN's Matthew Chance. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): It was a bold cross border right. Exposing the weakness of Russian defenses and highlighting the increasingly brazen armed groups who say they're Russians fighting against the Kremlin. Moscow dismisses them as Ukrainian saboteurs who've now been defeated in a barrage of ferocious Russian strikes carried out on its own soil. Defense officials say at least 70 of the fighters, some in U.S. made Humvee armored vehicles have now been killed. But for the Kremlin attacks inside Russia, like a series of damaging train derailments over the past year. Or attacks on crucial fuel storage facilities have become an embarrassing feature of its war. Even the Kremlin itself was targeted with drone strikes with Russia blamed on Ukraine. But Russian groups who say they're fighting against the Kremlin are increasingly emerging from the shadows. CNN made contact with a fighter said to be from the National Republican Army, an anti-Putin group operating inside Russia. His voice and features have been disguised.

For months now, advanced high-tech weapons, battle tanks, armored vehicles, even long-range missiles have been flowing into Ukraine ahead of a major counteroffensive. But many Ukrainian fighters on the front lines have little more than an odd mix match collection of both old and new weapons. Now, CNN's Nic Robertson reports the necessity of war has born some remarkable innovation.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIC ROBERTSON, CNN'S INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voiceover): Everything about this attack is unconventional. A 1950s anti-aircraft gun, fired flat. And the drone operator next to it guiding the shots. Old and new fused as one. The target, a Russian base, a mile away beneath two white towers. Easy for the drone to see, becoming an easier shot for the gunner. We learned how to fire this ancient cast iron gun from hidden positions, callsign Al (ph) says. They broadcast the video on our tablet and we can see where we hit. It allows us to aim very fast and precisely. ROBERTSON (on camera):  Its real shooters scoot stuff, they've been on the position less than five minutes. They're getting out before the Russians could get a bearing on them and fire back. ROBERTSON (voiceover):  Nearby, a smaller gun, more improvisation, more shoot and scoot. For much of Ukraine's long front line, hit and run is how troops probe for Russian weaknesses and an opening for the long-expected counteroffensive. GEORGIY KUPARASHVILI, 3RD ASSAULT BRIGADE OFFICER:  It's not like just they -- hey, we're going. No. It's got to be a specific time where all the situation is good and we have advantage for it.

Meaning smaller attacks can create opportunity. ROBERTSON (on camera):  When the big counteroffensive comes, the Ukrainians will need to muster as much fire as they can, even old equipment like this to pin down the Russians, before they could send their own troops in.
