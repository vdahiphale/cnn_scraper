This risks adding further strain to the already tense U.S.-China relations. And it comes just days before Secretary of State Antony Blinken is due to visit Beijing, a trip notable in and of itself because he's the first American top diplomat to visit there in six years.While there, he is expected to address major issues, including Russia's war in Ukraine, trade. But the families of wrongfully detained Americans are also urging him to make the release of their loved ones a priority. CNN's Kylie Atwood has been covering this. She joins us now. Kylie, what is the State Department saying? Do they expect Blinken to bring up these wrongfully detained Americans while he's sitting down face-to-face with these Chinese officials?",

But now it's double that at $7 million per - we've even seen a jump from 2020. I guess my question to you, Poppy, is, what's your favorite part of watching the Super Bowl?
