And frankly, in in the sort of -- in comparison to some of the aid packages we've seen over the course of the war, it's pretty small. So, look, he was he got some ammunition. He got some air defense missiles. It's what he was asking for.But look, we were expecting this because it was an impossible task. Zelenskyy was put in a situation where he was coming up against U.S. partisan domestic politics going into an election season. And I think it was clear from this all-senators meeting that he emerged from on Tuesday that while he did, it was a sort of relatively warm welcome. He managed to convince some senators that there wouldn't be any corruption issues when U.S. aid was flowing into the country. He managed to talk up some of Ukraine's successes and say that they were, you know, going to continue to be determined and resilient as they have been throughout. That he wasn't going to change any minds when it comes to whether or not to include U.S. border controls in this aid package. Now look, on the democratic side, President Biden did hint in that press conference that his team is looking for compromises with senators. But this was the last week that the Senate and the House in fact are in session before the Christmas holidays. So, it is looking pretty bleak on that side. He's not giving up though, he's carrying on traveling. He's in Norway today, which has been a major donor. So, I think look, he doesn't want to appear defeated in this even though the fact of dwindling U.S. aid is having a serious impact on the battlefield and is a major blow to Ukrainian morale.",

Well, those people are mistaken.(END VIDEOTAPE) FOSTER (on camera): Republican presidential hopeful Ron DeSantis came out swinging against Donald Trump during Tuesday's CNN Town Hall in Iowa, the Florida governor looking to cast himself as the main Republican rival to Trump, who is the party's clear front runner. DeSantis attacked Trump on everything from inflation, abortion and immigration. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RON DESANTIS, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The first three years of the Trump administration, the economy is better than it has been. But that last year, with COVID I think was mishandled dramatically. Shutting down the country was a huge mistake. Printing trillions and trillions of dollars was a huge mistake. That set the foundation for the inflation that we see. One thing in this race that I think is important to point out is Donald Trump flip flopping on the right to life. So, if you look in January of 2020, when he was President, he stood in the March for Life and he gave a speech. And if you read that speech, he said that all life is a gift from God. He compared the unborn child in the mother's womb to being the image of God. He said it was important that we had protections in law. And that's what he was saying in January of 2020. Now he has attacked states that have enacted protections like \"Heartbeat\" bills as being a terrible, terrible thing. And I remember in 2016, I went to the rallies with Donald Trump. He said he was going to build the wall and have Mexico pay for it, and that didn't happen. And why didn't it happen? Well, one, I think he got distracted and he didn't do it on day one, but two, he didn't utilize the levers of power that he had. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
