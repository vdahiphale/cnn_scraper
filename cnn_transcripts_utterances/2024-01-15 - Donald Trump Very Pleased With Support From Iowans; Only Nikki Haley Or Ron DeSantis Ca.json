They're not deciding that. They're deciding how much he owes her. And I think that is what is fueling that attitude that you saw there where he was speaking graciously of his opponents, clearly calling on them to drop out of the race and talking about this notion of uniting the country, which struck me given obviously how polarized the country is at this moment and this idea of uniting liberals and conservatives in that speech.

When in 2016 he came out of Iowa with just 25 percent of the support of Republicans, he went on to consolidate almost all the support in the high 80s, 88 percent in the general election, even more so in 2020 against Trump. Trump has shown that he can bring Republicans back into the fold.

Of course, we haven't called the race definitively in terms of if she will pull out a victory ahead of Ron DeSantis. But it does look like she's closely behind him right now. It's important to note that her campaign has been consistently saying that they want a strong showing in Iowa. They haven't defined what that looks like, of course, and they believe that if she came in second, it would be great because they would have exceeded expectations. But if she came in third, that would have been OK because it would have been altogether damaging for her campaign. But if she does come in third here, what I am hearing from sources close to Haley's camp is that it just puts an incredible amount of pressure on her campaign to do very well in New Hampshire. Of course, we have seen those recent polls where she's closing the gap with former President Trump, but she's going to have to do very well there if she comes in third here, particularly heading then next into South Carolina, which is her home state. They feel good about that, but they haven't really been talking a lot about South Carolina. They've been talking a lot about New Hampshire. So we're waiting here for her to come on down. We're hearing that could be any moment now.

My caution is this, while I do think she'll perform well in New Hampshire, Vivek likely dropping out tonight would end up likely benefiting Donald Trump. I think he's expected to endorse him.

We'll see how well she does particularly with the fact that Democrats and independents undeclared voters can vote in that race. But you know, she's trailing by 20, 30 points in her home state of South Carolina. And I think DeSantis has an even tougher road to run. But given the fact that he's really not competitive in New Hampshire or Nevada, he's talking about South Carolina. South Carolina isn't for another month. So how without another victory does he or even a close finish, how does he stay in the race for another month where the other two candidates, probably Trump, but maybe Nikki Haley are piling up victories and he's waiting in a race where, as you point, Kasie, he's written single digits in South Carolina, it's really a tough row.",
