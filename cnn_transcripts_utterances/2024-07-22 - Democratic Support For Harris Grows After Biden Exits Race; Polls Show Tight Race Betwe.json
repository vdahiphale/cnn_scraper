As you look -- it is Domino's Pizza by the way. You would have thought, they might have actually turned up with a bit of pizza to help ring the closing bell. Look at the way the market has gone. We are up, but we have been up peaks and troughs and valleys and mountains throughout the course of the session, as we come to the close. One, two, that was a wimpy gavel from Domino's Pizza, but a strong day on the markets. Those are the markets and these are the main events of the day. Democratic leaders will soon endorse Kamala Harris, CNN is led to believe. Follow the money: The Harris campaign brings in tens of millions of dollars from donors and likely will inherit any of the Biden remaining funds. And three days after a global tech glitch, most airlines are back in business, but Delta Air Lines is still canceling hundreds of flights. Live from London. It is Monday, it is July the 22nd. I'm Richard Quest and I mean business. Good evening. Right now, Kamala Harris is on her way to meet campaign staff on the first official day of her campaign to be the presidential nominee for her party. She has already secured the support of more than a thousand Democratic delegates, it includes dozens of lawmakers and key party leaders, such as the Clintons and the former Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Multiple sources are now telling us that the Democratic congressional leaders, Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Hakeem Jeffries will also endorse her as soon as later today. Jeffries spoke to reporters earlier. Without giving anything away, he said he was looking forward to sitting down with the vice president. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY): We owe debt of gratitude to President Biden for his tremendous leadership and I am also thankful for the incredible partnership that he has had for the last three-and-a-half years with Vice President Kamala Harris. Vice President Kamala Harris has excited the community. She has excited the House Democratic Caucus and she is exciting the country, and so I am looking forward to sitting down with her in person in short order. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

You know, one of the things I like doing, Richard, is looking underneath the hood of these polls. And I looked looking at the amount of people who have no opinion or are neutral on a candidate and for Vice President Harris, that's near 20 percent of the American electorate, at least according to recent polling data, that's significantly a higher percentage than it is for either Donald Trump or for Joe Biden. And what that means is when we were looking at the Biden-Trump matchups, he didn't see any volatility whatsoever, which is basically a straight line, maybe Trump gained a little bit after the debate, but it was just a consistent small Trump advantage. Now, we've entered a new arena. Now we've entered a race in which you do have a candidate who many voters have not necessarily formed an opinion of. And so you are asking these hypotheticals. Let's see what happens when you actually have to face this decision between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris.

You know, Donald Trump after he was convicted in New York and the day afterwards, a 24-hour period afterwards, raised a little bit more than $50 million and the Trump Campaign then claimed it was a record for a single day, and the Harris Campaign has raised a little bit less than $30 million more than that. So if we are talking about excitement and Democrats are saying that folks are excited for Harris, will have to see how it is among the broad electorate. But when at least it comes to the Democratic base, where there had been a lack of excitement when it comes to Joe Biden, there is a ton of excitement for Kamala Harris and of course, we will just have to wait and see whether or not that translate because at the end of the day, money doesn't vote, people vote.",

So for instance, one of the big questions was if the local law enforcement took a picture of this guy who was acting suspiciously near the magnetometers, had a range finder, and is spotted at different places. And if they knew about this and they were looking for him for about 19 minutes, how is it that, you know, he still managed to get on a roof and be able to fire off these shots. When did he go from being suspicious to actually a threat? And it is not until she was asked about it, probably about the 17th time that she finally said only seconds -- seconds before he fired those shots did they finally realize that he was actually a threat. And so again, those are things that she it could have answered. She also could have answered, did you actually put someone on that roof? The answer is no. The answer is plainly no. Nobody was on the roof because we know the shooter got on that roof and nobody was there to stop him. But she couldn't answer those questions.

She received those donations from the likes of Sheryl Sandberg, but she has also called for tech accountability in some really key areas. She has for example, gone after tech companies for their role in online sexual harassment and revenge porn. She has shown an interest in online data privacy and protection.

The Israeli prime minister will be in Washington this week, where he's set to address Congress and officials say he'll meet with Vice President Kamala Harris and President Joe Biden. President Biden's COVID status may impact the timing of their meeting. At least six people are dead after a gunman opened fire in our home for the elderly in Croatia. Local police have arrested the assailant in a nearby cafe shortly after the attack. Amongst the victims are five nursing home residents and an employee. A Russian American journalist has been sentenced to 6-1/2 years in Russian prison. Alsu Kurmasheva was found guilty of spreading false information about the Russian army. The U.S. government has yet to declare Kurmasheva as wrongly detained. A judge is ordering the Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez to testify as part of an investigation into corruption allegations against his wife. She has not been charged thus far in the case. The prime minister has called the accusations against the unfounded. So, let's return to our top story. Top Democrats are running around Vice President Harris on the first full day of her presidential campaign. She's preparing to contrast her record as a prosecutor with Donald Trump's as a felon.

And obviously a lot of people have responded very much to Donald Trump over the years. But I will tell you in the book that I wrote about the 2020 campaign, one of the things that I had in there was that when Harris was considering jumping into the '20 campaign, she was asked by staff what she would have done. Had she been at that townhall debate in 2016 when Donald Trump was following Hillary Clinton around the stage, sort of stalking behind her. And she told staff then that her response would have been that she'd turn around and say to him, why are you being so weird?
