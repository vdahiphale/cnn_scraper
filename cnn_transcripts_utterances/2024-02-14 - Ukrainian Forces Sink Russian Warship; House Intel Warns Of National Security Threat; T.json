Specifically, they point out a couple of factors. One of them, a snowstorm yesterday in New York when Republicans were really counting on their voters to turn out the day of the election. They argue that they were unable to make up ground for that reason.You also are hearing from some Republicans who are casting blame, pointing fingers at their Republican colleagues who worked to oust George Santos, saying that was a mistake because Santos was a reliable Republican vote. I think one of the key questions moving forward is how does this narrow majority affect legislation? If you look down the pipe, what you have coming up is a spending deadline. That's a bill that Republicans and Democrats are going to have to work together on. But you also have looming questions like what does this mean for Republicans' effort to try and impeach President Biden? This is a very, very narrow majority and you already are seeing a lot of Republicans uncomfortable with the idea of moving forward with something like that. I think that is the question moving ahead. And it certainly is going to be difficult for Republicans to put up controversial issues and then rely on all of their members to be unified. Because as we've seen over the course of the last several months, Republican unity sometimes is really hard to find. It's especially hard. When you have such a thin majority, which Speaker Johnson is working with. Boris.",

One of their options is they could move to quickly dismiss this. That would obviously save them from a drawn-out trial. Certainly Senate Democrats are not looking at an elongated trial that takes up precious floor time in the Senate.But I think there's still a question of how much they want to go down that road. Republicans and Democrats in the Senate have argued that this is largely a waste of time. They know that the secretary is not going to be convicted in their chamber.

And this is just what he actually -- look, all you have to do is say, what is the reaction in our NATO allies? Where it matters.And it's important to remind people, the only time Article 5, which is the mutual defense treaty, was ever invoked by NATO, was for us after 9-11. And it led to a 20-year commitment by NATO to Afghanistan on behalf of the United States to fight terror. So, if you look at what our European allies are saying, this is freaking them out. Not because now they're going to be called to account for their 2%. Europe has actually been drastically increasing defense spending, even at a rate either equal to or greater than the United States. But you look at how this is being celebrated in the Russian media ecosystem, the state-controlled media ecosystem. It's being celebrated. And the only thing that prevents NATO and Russia from going to war is Russia's belief that the Article 5 treaty will be obeyed. And that's the reason he doesn't attack NATO countries. So, this creates a -- you know, people try to pretend that Donald Trump is some anti-war guy. The truth is he is a warmonger.

Nikki Haley asked the question, who's going to vote for someone if they get convicted of any of these felonies and indictments that Donald Trump's accused of? In fact, she's already said out of her own mouth that she would vote for him.And so, you had these people, particularly on the right side of the aisle, who play these political games, who try to mislead or in this case not lead the American public. And it just doesn't work. We know that Donald Trump doesn't have respect for our military. We know he does not have respect. We know he doesn't have respect for POWs. We've seen him insult John McCain. We've seen him insult individuals in military gravesites and burials. We've seen him insult Michael Haley, who's actually deployed overseas. This is not new. In fact, the flippant comments he made about our NATO allies, this is not new. There's nothing that Donald Trump says that will be new or some type of newly inflammatory rhetoric. All of these things, he has beaten that horse to death. But the question is whether or not the American public wants to double back. Whether or not they want to be browbeat by this rhetoric again and again, and this chaos again and again, or if they're exhausted from it, I bet they're exhausted from it and want some of the normalcy that was or is Joe Biden. And so that's kind of what we're looking at. And when you have a great ad like this, the Nikki Haley super PAC put out, all you have to do is look at the candidate and the candidate is still going to vote for Donald Trump.

You literally, everything you have become, you now are willing to put it into to defend a future for people that you don't even know. That is an amazing, incredible sacrifice. And Donald Trump thinks that only losers do that because he's never sacrificed anything a day in his life. We as Americans appreciate, obviously, those that make or are willing to make the ultimate sacrifice. Donald Trump abhors them. I mean, and we even heard about it when he would see people disabled at Walter Reed. He'd be almost disgusted by it or didn't understand it. This is an incredibly low and petulant man.

Of course, you had Tom Suozzi, who had run in, before he had great name ID, but, and a lot of Republicans, I should say, in Congress, as Lauren Fox pointed out earlier, downplaying that and playing up just the dynamics of that race. But look, Donald Trump very much does believe that his endorsement carries a lot of weight, that those who back him are more successful.And then on the other side of that, you have a lot of Republicans who note that in 2022, a lot of Republicans did not win their races, including Trump-backed Republican candidates. And so, I think that is definitely a concern for a lot of people looking forward to this election. If Donald Trump is on the ballot against Joe Biden, of course, his name is going to carry a lot of weight. But as Trump continues to figure out who he's endorsing, and I should note as well here, Boris and Brianna, that he's endorsing a lot fewer candidates this time around. And I'm told that is a strategic decision by his campaign to try and not alienate a lot of voters who he is really focused on. And of course, he's very focused on his campaign as well. But he does believe that those who are more MAGA, those who support him, do better.

This video appearing to show major damage that Ukraine has done to Russia's navy. Ukrainians say that their footage here captures today's sinking of a Russian warship, the Caesar Kunikov, just off of Crimea.The military says the warship and these other vessels are among 26 that Ukraine has taken down, claiming their forces have disabled one- third of Russia's black sea fleet. Today's attack, according to officials, was carried out by sea drone, which have been critical since Ukraine has no navy. No navy, and yet taking out, it says, one- third of the black sea fleet. The Kremlin not commenting on today's incident, and CNN cannot verify Ukraine's account. Let's turn now to retired Army Lieutenant General Mark Hertling. He's a former commander of the U.S. Army Europe in the 7th Army. He is a CNN military analyst as well. Put this into perspective for us, if you would, General. Ukraine saying it's destroyed one-third of the black sea fleet. How significant is that overall when we know that things have really stalled out on the battleground? LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yeah, Brianna, I'll do my best as an Army guy commenting on navy operations, but when we're talking about the black sea fleet, that is the pride of the Russian navy. And as the Ukrainians have said, they've destroyed, I heard 25, you just said 26, but they also said they have put out of action with a need for repair, an additional 15. The black sea fleet has about 80 ships. And since the start of this conflict, the ones that Ukraine has sunk, obviously early on, the Muska, the one today, the Kunikov, the Gormak (ph), the Minsk (ph), all troop-carrying large, very large troop- carrying ships, which are important on the black sea because there are other countries that Russia tries to influence with potential attacks. But they've also sunk the Rostov-on-Don, a submarine, tugboats, missile carriers and cruisers, a corvette. So, these are not small vessels that the Ukrainian, let's call them the Ukrainian navy. They're actually unmanned vehicles, unmanned ships have been sinking. But this is a significant effect. All of these boats and ships are going to cost in the hundreds of millions of dollars. So, they've taken out quite a bit of Russia capability on the black sea.",

      "sentences": "Well, it does a couple of things. First of all, it affects the Russians' ability to resupply in the area. Again, the ship, the Kunikov that was hit this morning, it has a crew of 87, but it also carries things like troop formations, hundreds of troops, vehicles, supplies, equipment. So, if Ukraine can affect the logistics capability of the Russian Navy to resupply by sea, it's a significant advantage.But secondly, it's just screwing with, truthfully, the Russian capability to have effects on land because these ships dock somewhere and they support things. But it's also confounding the Russian Navy in this body of water, what they call their Russian lake. What's interesting, though, is it will affect other countries in the area. When you take a look at the boundaries of the Black Sea, you have Romania, Bulgaria, Moldova, Ukraine, Turkey. And Russia has said that there's a limited number of ships that can come into these waters, not so fast. The other thing is Ukraine is doing this with, as you said, a ship that's a little bit bigger than a jet ski. It's about the size of a sea-dew filled with 500 kilograms of ammunition that can blow a large hole in a ship. Ukrainians are not the first ones to do this, but they have perfected it, adapted it by putting these ships under the control of remotely piloted, capabilities from the shore, traveling a couple of hundred miles to hit these ships. And what's most interesting to me is in many of the cases, the Russian Navy has not attempted to defend themselves against these ships. We see U.S. ships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden defending themselves against Iranian remotely piloted vehicles. It doesn't seem like Russia has been capable of shooting these ships out of the water, which is pretty significant.",

So that's something that the Ukrainians can continue to do. They can continue to ship grain and the like out into the Black Sea. I wonder, though, if this also, -- does this send a message? Maybe it doesn't, but I wonder if this sends a message to allies here in the U.S. as aid for Ukraine. Ukraine is hung up.

But the other thing, I'd say, Brianna, I'd go one step further and to say this is helping Ukraine pause the gap.And what I mean by that is they are trying to bridge when the West is giving them their equipment versus the future and when they might start receiving it again. If there's a delay in continuing to equip the land force, the things that are required for maneuver and to retake ground versus just blow things up at sea, this will be a good strategy to just delay and beg for more space for the time until they get new manufacturing plants up within Ukraine, new ammunition and pieces of equipment from the West.
