I'm Becky Anderson in Abu Dhabi, where the time is just after 7:00 in the evening. Dutch Police have launched a major investigation into multiple incidents of violence on Thursday night. Israeli football fans were attacked in what authorities described as antisemitic attacks after video showed some fans chanting anti-Arab slurs and praising Israeli military attacks in Gaza. And in Gaza, the United Nations has found that nearly 70 percent of Palestinians killed there were women and children in what it describes as systematic violation of international law. We'll speak to one of the organization's highest level officials, who has just returned from the besieged strip. And about 14,000 people in Southern California are currently under evacuation order as wildfires rage in the area. The fast-moving Mountain Fire that you can see here has charred a vast amount of land in a short time and destroyed dozens of homes. Well, President-elect Donald Trump is said to be rolling up his sleeves and getting ready to move on his agenda on that much touted day one. Sources tell us he's going through executive orders and policies that he wants to implement, as well as regulations that he plans to reverse. He's made his first big appointment naming campaign manager Susie Wiles as his chief of staff. One person who is staying put, Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell. He's had a fraught history with Mr. Trump but he says he's not leaving until his term expires in 2026. Now, his comments came after the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates again on Thursday. Well, more staff picks expected within days and job hopefuls aren't going far. CNN's Alayna Treene is in West Palm Beach, and \"FIRST MOVE\" anchor Julia Chatterley is in New York. Alayna, let's start with you. Susie wiles perhaps it shouldn't be a surprise, but she is the first female chief of staff, and Donald Trump certainly touting that and her skills as innovative and exceptional. That is the first. What else is going on behind the scenes?",

We've got another couple of opportunities for the Fed to move ahead of the inauguration on January 20th. So let's just talk about that cut, why that cut now and what might happen next. I also want to talk about the politicization of that key position, the Fed chair and Jerome Powell and what was said yesterday about his position going forward.

December he left the door open for another cut and that was starting to come into question, primarily because, keep that payrolls number aside, that was weaker. The data has been relatively solid and he suggested that in the meeting. Then comes the question of what they can do next year. And this is the real challenge. It's not just about what they can do in terms of what the economy is telling them to do and the data. It's about the wild card which is the policies that the president-elect will choose. Obviously, we know that if he does enact in a worst-case scenario huge limits to immigration, I'm talking illegal and legal, that could push up wages. And he enacts tariffs across many countries around the world, that could be inflationary and raise prices, too. So that could in some respects tie the Fed's hands. What's interesting yesterday, someone asked him whether they could consider raising, not cutting raising interest rates next year. Just listen to what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

In fact, yesterday on a call with Democratic members Hakeem Jeffries and the campaign arm was really trying to inspire their members to remember that nothing is final until it's final.

I think Democrats who are coming from rural places, they're arguing these are messages we have been trying to get the Democratic Party to listen to for years. We always have been warning that the party has been moving too far to the left. We are too focused on some of the social issues. We should be more focused on economic issues. You have other people who are frustrated with the president and the fact that he didn't get out of the race sooner. They feared that because he decided to stay in this race, it didn't give Harris a lot of time. I think, though, the reality is Democrats are going to have to move forward. You can't change what's already happened in the past, and you do hear some Democrats in leadership sort of making that case that we have to go forward. We have to think about how we want to work with Republicans. The bottom line is, in the House of Representatives, legislation is not going to move super easily because whatever majority Republicans have, if indeed they do clinch the majority again, is going to be so narrow that passing government spending bills, ensuring that the country doesn't default on its debt next year, all of that is going to require bipartisan communication, bipartisan support, and that's just going to be the reality. So, yes, Republicans could have the White House, the Senate and the House, but the reality is they don't have a filibuster proof majority in the Senate. They still only are going to have less than 60 seats there. And whatever majority Mike Johnson has, if Republicans end up with it, it's going to be really small.

      "sentences": "Yes, it is, Becky. And there's really this debate within the Democratic Party about what exactlywent wrong for them in this election that ended with the reelection of former president Donald Trump. Many in the party are placing a lot of that blame squarely on President Joe Biden. There are those who are frustrated that he had decided to seek a second term at the age of 80, and at a time when there were many polls showing that Americans and even Democrats within his own party did not want him to run for reelection. People have argued that he stayed in this race too long, which really hampered the ability of any Democratic candidate to run a successful campaign against Donald Trump. But for President Biden's part, so far, he has not engaged in any discussions about what went wrong for Democrats. That is not something you heard from him yesterday as he was in the Rose Garden really conceding this loss to Trump and also trying to stress that he will engage in that peaceful transfer of power. Of course, one of the key lines in his remarks was you can't only love this country when you win. That is a quote that he would often deploy as an attack line against Trump, who did not participate in any type of peaceful transition when Biden was coming into office, and instead he was repurposing it in this speech. But there are so many questions about what Biden's legacy will look like going forward, especially after the outcomes of this election. Biden had run back in 2020 to defeat Trump, to defeat his brand of politics. He won, but then lost after these last four years in office. So that is something that will hang over the president moving forward. Now for his part, he has said that there's still more work to do, that people here at the White House should be proud of their accomplishments. And in his remarks yesterday, Biden stressed that some of the things that they've accomplished, if you think about the Infrastructure Bill or the CHIPS Act, that that will take many, many years to come to fruition. And that is something that has always been a struggle for the Biden administration in this campaign, is that they had some tangible outcomes, some tangible legislation that they've passed that many Americans weren't seeing the immediate effects in their lives. So for President Biden in these final weeks, they're going to try to do more work to try to shore up his legacy, trying to safeguard some of those initiatives that they've put into place. But of course, Trump could come into office and undo many of the things that Biden had set forth in his four years in office.",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MATHEW MILLER, U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESPERSON: We have seen Israel take a number of important steps over the past several weeks, including in just the past few days. They reopened Erez Crossing, as you heard me report before, but they have also informed us that in the coming days, in the next few days, they plan to open an additional new crossing at Kissufim. They have approved additional delivery routes inside Gaza, which is something that is critical because, as you know, the problem has not only been getting humanitarian assistance to the crossings but then getting it out of the crossings and getting it delivered to the people who need them.

We now have reports ofpeople getting these messages in at least two dozen states across the U.S. These texts are personalized, and many of them specifically target black and brown individuals. Some of them children. I want to put one of the texts back up on the screen to talk you through what we're seeing here. If we can get that text up. Several were sent to us, this one included. You can see it's blurred out there, but the text has the person's name at the top of it, and then it references picking cotton as you mentioned. It references slave catchers, plantations. And some of these messages specifically reference President-elect Donald Trump. Now, to be clear, the Trump campaign tells us they have absolutely nothing to do with these messages. They denounce them. But as you know, many people are on edge right now in these days since the election. We have a statement in from the president of the NAACP who said these messages represent an alarming increase in vile and abhorrent rhetoric from racist groups across the country who now feel emboldened to spread hate and stoke the flames of fear that many of us are feeling after Tuesday's election results. So obviously, Becky, a lot of people are on edge right now. The big question here is, who's behind this and we don't have an answer at this point.",

They had teams yesterday, 10 teams going around home by home. They went to about 300 of them. And unfortunately at least 132, they found like the one you see here behind me everything is gone. You know, it's hard to even point out what's left of this home. You can see the entrance here behind me and you can see the chimney still standing but the rest is all gone. So they found 132 structures that are completely destroyed and 88 others that are damaged. And authorities say this work of assessing the damage is not done yet. So that means those numbers could still go up. So the piece of good news is the weather conditions. We had red flag warnings in place in the low and in the high areas. Right now, only the red flag warning is in place for the mountains, and that's going to be in place until about 11:00 a.m. local time. So there is that light at the end of the tunnel. An official saying they're going to try to do everything they can while the weather is cooperating before it changes again. But they also say that there's a lot of unknowns and things that could change and could continue to make this firefighting even more difficult. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
