      "sentences": "OUTFRONT next, live from Israel, breaking news, the U.S. Navy intercepting multiple land attack missiles and drones. Pentagon officials say they potentially are targeting Israel.It comes as Israeli officials say that the army has been given a greenlight to wipe out Hamas. We're going to take you live to the Gaza border tonight. Plus, a new dispatch from inside Gaza OUTFRONT. We're going to hear tonight from the brave CNN journalist who's been documenting what it's like inside Gaza exclusively to OUTFRONT. Tonight, he says air strikes are intensifying where he is, in southern Gaza. And the incredible story, how a group of volunteer Israeli guards took on Hamas and protected and entire community from a massacre. And what they found on the bodies of dead Hamas gunman even more chilling. You'll see their story, let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. Welcome to a special edition of OUTFRONT. I'm Erin Burnett live from Tel Aviv tonight. And OUTFRONT tonight, we begin with breaking news. Shot down, CNN is learning that a U.S. warship stationed in the Red Sea near Yemen has intercepted three land attack cruise missiles, some of them potentially heading towards Israel. According to the Pentagon, all of them were fired by Iranian-backed militants, and heading north along the Red Sea. You can see how far away that is from Israel. This development comes as Israel inches closer to a potential ground invasion of the Gaza Strip. Israel's defense minister today telling forces that are stationed along that Gaza border, we've seen so many of them, there's 350,000 of them, it's impossible to miss them. He goes there and he says, you see Gaza now from a distance, you'll soon see it from inside, the command will come. You will soon see it from the inside -- inside of Gaza, of course, millions of people, more than 2 million people in a 25-mile long tiny strip. The defense minister's words, an ominous sign of possible urban combat, fought not only above ground, Fallujah-style, but below as we've reported Hamas fighters. They have a massive network of tunnels that almost certainly are housing not just militants, but hostages tonight, 203 of them, according to Israel's latest numbers. Israel and Hamas could be locked in a months-long war, which is why tonight, in less than an hour, President Biden will be speaking to the nation. It's only the second time he has a delivered an address from the Oval Office. Biden expected to press Congress for another $100 billion, the majority of that aid for Israel, and, Ukraine. The scene is inextricably tied together by this administration. Tonight's address coming after the president announced this morning that the U.S. had secured a deal with Egypt and Israel to send that critical humanitarian aid into Gaza. I want to show you some new pictures of the aid trucks, because we have some reporters, and even some of those truck drivers talking to CNN, lineup as long as the eye can see. It looks like the border leaving Ukraine did. That's to go into Gaza, supplies. It is unclear when those trucks will actually be allowed to enter. A close counselor of the Prime Minister Netanyahu said that crossing would open tomorrow, but sources tonight tell CNN that the rocket crossing is not expected to open on Friday. And every hour is of the essence. You know, we've been talking to various people inside of Gaza getting just brief clips of it, because you can't get a signal established to have a real conversation with anyone there. American Wafa Elsaka is there. She's a retired art teacher from Florida. She traveled to Gaza to visit family before the war broke out. She's now trapped, but she sent us this audio message of what life is like tonight there. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)",

It may be less. It's still an annex -- an inexplicably horrible number.We have a team of reporters standing by. Oren Liebermann is at the Pentagon. Nic Robertson is live along the Israel-Gaza border, and MJ Lee is at the White House this hour. I want to begin with you, though, Oren, at the Pentagon with this breaking, news disturbing news, that U.S. warship near Yemen, that is -- that is not close, okay? We are not talking about Gaza or Hezbollah. This is all the way in the Red Sea, interjecting -- intercepting multiple projectiles, drones, light attack missiles, what do you know about this?",

The Pentagon says they were launched by the Houthis, Iranian-backed militants in Yemen, who fired them. And they were moving along the Red Sea, towards Israel, and that is likely why the Pentagon says that Israel may have been the target here.It's worth noting there is, of course, the destroyer. The USS Carney intercepted these drones and missiles, but there's also the USS Bataan, this assault ship and the marine expeditionary unit in the Red Sea. So, that perhaps also a potential target. On the Red Sea, there is the Israeli resort city of Eilat, right at the southern tip of Israel, that perhaps is what the Pentagon looks at and seeing these missiles heading north and saying, look, this may have been the target. Either way, Israel and the U.S. are not the only threat they're facing in the region. In Iraq, over the course of the past few days, there have been a wave of drone attacks against U.S. and coalition forces there. So, the U.S. is facing pressure there, even as U.S. officials including, the defense secretary Lloyd Austin, are trying to keep this from becoming a regional conflict, Erin. Austin spoke with Arab and Israeli officials earlier today, to try to make sure that the U.S. has Israel's back, but also to try to keep from spreading. Right now, that seems a very, very tall order.",

We are having -- had some heavy explosions slightly ahead of that. So when we see that here, we watch really carefully. Does it build into something? It's at the beginning of an incursion? Or is it just a little bit of tension along the border fence there?But you go back to 2014 at the time in the last incursion, that is exactly where Israeli forces went into Gaza, in that area. So, that's why we're watching it so closely. And yes, the defense minister today, when he was visiting IDF forces, some really heavy detonations there as well. While he was visiting IDF forces saying, look, it won't be too long before you're in Gaza. We've been hearing from other officials who are saying flatly and clearly, the politicians have given the greenlight to the military, it's down to the military now to decide when to go in.

And advisers tell us that the president believes that there is a powerful message to be said to the rest of the world, but that there is also an important case to be made the U.S. continuing to support Israel and Ukraine is a matter of national security. Now, Erin, of course, this comes at a moment of importance for the White House in trying to shore up public support for both of these conflicts, as you know very well, public support for Ukraine has waned in recent months. We also know that the majority of Americans are sympathetic to the people of Israel, but that when it comes to the question of supporting Israel amid this conflict, that there are mixed views. Now, this speech also comes on the eve of the White House preparing to send a supplemental package request to Capitol Hill, to the tune of some $100 billion. We are told that $60 billion would go towards Ukraine, and ten billion would go towards Israel. , And, Erin, you can very much easily imagine the president sort of hearing the voices of the leaders of Israel, and Ukraine as he has been drafting the speech for the past several days. I was told that he actually worked on this speech with his aides on Air Force One as he was traveling back from Israel yesterday.

So, President Biden is going to be making an argument, I would assume more than just about funding, right? That funding would be an offshoot of a much bigger point about national security and democracy. What is the speech really about do you think? SEN. CHRIS MURPHY (D-CT):  Well, these are big dollars, right? When the American people hear us spending 50, 60, 70 billion dollars overseas, right, they have a high bar in order to prove the efficacy and the need for that money. And the president I think is going to meet that bar tonight because in Israel, we are engaged in a communal fight against terrorism. This country has lost thousands of people to terrorist attacks. Israel has now lost over 1,000, and if you don't fight Hamas alongside Israel, then these groups grow in strength. They start to contemplate attacks against the United States. And Ukraine is a bit of a different case to be made, but it is another leader this time in Russia that is trying to shutter the rules based order, and if you don't beat him in Ukraine, I think it's likely he marches on a NATO ally and its U.S. troops in the fight.

But I think it also has a calming influence on a nation that feels like the world is falling apart a bit.The president can anchor us in a sense of what our role is when it comes to trying to bring order to that chaos. Listen, J.D. is a friend but he is in a minority position. We're not holding one set of aid hostage to another set of aid. We're just acknowledging the fact that right now, there is a majority in the Senate and in the House that supports both Ukraine aid and Israel aid.

Also, CNN's Kayla Tausche at the White House, and CNN's Nic Robertson near the Gaza border. Nic, I understand that you have been hearing some activity down there, what have you been seeing? NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR:  Yeah, Anderson, because we are hearing that the troops have the green light to go in, the defense minister saying that they could be in Gaza soon. We are really watching for any signs of an incursion. We saw in the area over my shoulder here, a little earlier, tank fire. We can see the tracer, the red light, and the red illumination, if you will, on the tank fire. Heavy machine gun fire, flares being fired in that area. Now, that is an area, if there were to be an incursion, it would be a likely place for an incursion. Why? Because in 2014, that is the area in that the IDF went into. Just a few months ago before we came on air, right now, we were hearing quite sustained, small arms fire over my shoulder. And in this direction, there were flares up in that direction, a little earlier as well. This is not saying that there is a ground incursion. This is really, I think, telling us that there are troops down there. They are close to the wire with the fence with Gaza. They have really been on high alert for any indications of Hamas trying to spot them, trying to target them, trying to get ready for their reproach, if and when it comes. So, they are really on, the triggers. Their fingers are on their triggers, and that is what we have been hearing this evening. Where it goes in the coming hours, we don't know. But, this is where we are going to be watching, because if there were an incursion, we would expect, potentially, this to be one of the places, Anderson.",
