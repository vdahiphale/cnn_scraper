Of course, everyone is absorbing what we're seeing on the interest rate front. Of course, the Fed deciding to pause this month. Well, those are the markets and these are the main events. The Fed hits pause, but signals it's not done raising rates just yet. The EU says Google's advertising business should be broken up. And the US secretary of State will head to China this weekend. Live from Dubai, it is Wednesday, June 14th. I'm Eleni Giokos, I'm in for Richard Quest, and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. Tonight, the Federal Reserve is taking a break ending its streak of 10 straight rate hikes. The Fed decided to keep its benchmark rate at five percent and will wait for more data to guide its decision next month. Markets dipping on that announcements. The Dow falling sharply. It is now down around 250 points. The reason is the dot-plot. In March, most of the Fed's policy makers expected rates would peak this year at just over five percent, a few of them thought it might go higher. Now they expect rates will go higher and stay there for longer. The consensus is for rates to go above five-and-a-half percent. One expects rates will end up at over six percent. Jerome Powell is speaking right now. Just moments ago, he told reporters why the Fed is not raising rates today, even as he acknowledged that more rate hikes are to come. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The Fed reacted late, very few people thought that the Fed was going to be able to get inflation down as much as they have without causing a recession. And so far, they've been able to do that. I think the other major point, though, here is that core inflation really hasn't improved as much, right? I mean, headline inflation, yesterday's CPI report showed that, yes, consumer prices are moving at a much slower pace. It's a two-year low. You can see it on that chart. There has been a lot of improvement there on an annual basis, but core inflation really hasn't. Powell made comments a few minutes ago, saying, you know, we're \"not seeing a lot of progress with core inflation.\" He said the goal here is to get inflation back to that two percent level they're targeting while doing as little damage to the economy as they can.

You give something to the doves, which is you don't raise interest rates, but you give something to the hawks, which is you pop up the -- or you let them pop up the dot-plot without any resistance, and that is, of course, what the market is reacting to.

We don't know exactly how this boat capsized, but it was well over capacity. We took a closer look at this particular tragedy. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NADEAU (voice over): Exhausted migrants who survived the shipwreck rest at a rescue center in Greece. The Greek Coast Guard responded to the latest Mediterranean tragedy on Wednesday. They say no one on board was wearing a lifejacket. Scores of people drowned, the death toll continues to rise. Hundreds of migrants crammed onto a boat in Libya hoping to reach Italy or get rescued on the way, but that didn't happen. Their boat sank in the Central Mediterranean, the most dangerous maritime crossing in the world. YANNIS KARVELIS, REGIONAL HEALTH DIRECTOR (through translator): It is indeed a tragic situation, a very difficult situation with a very large number of shipwrecked people, a number that I think we have not faced in the past to such an extent and volume. NADEAU (voice over): This is the deadliest first quarter on record in the Mediterranean since 2017. In February, a migrant boat carrying more than a hundred people broke off the rocks of Calabria in Southern Italy. Ninety- four bodies were recovered. Despite the dangers, the number of undocumented people seeking a better life in Europe has soared in 2023. The Italian government says more than 55,000 people have arrived by boat since January. They're fleeing conflict at home, the climate crisis, and sweeping economic inequality. But European leaders can't seem to agree on how to solve the crisis, which has grown increasingly deadly. Ongoing negotiations with Tunisia and Libya where most of the boats come from have stalled. So the boats keep coming, and the death toll keeps rising. (END VIDEOTAPE) NADEAU (on camera): And you know, Eleni, this is just the story we hear over and over again. In this particular situation, we know that the NGO Alarm Phone signaled to authorities in Malta and Italy about this boat 24 hours before it went down. We don't know if anyone ignored those calls and we don't know exactly the dynamic right now of how that boat went down -- Eleni.",

Of course, the last meeting, the last trip by Secretary Blinken to Beijing was cancelled by the U.S. side back in February because of that Chinese spy balloon that was in that moment crossing the United States. The U.S. saying at the time that it would not have been productive for the Secretary of State to visit Beijing. And in that time, the tension really has gotten only worse, particularly on the military front. In the -- in the past few weeks, we've seen some very close incidents between the Chinese and American Air Forces above the South China Sea. We've seen a Chinese warship cutting off a U.S. Naval destroyer in in the Straits of Taiwan. We've also seen recent reports about Chinese spying that has been taking place over the past few years on spying of the United States from Cuba. So that is the backdrop against which Secretary Blinken is heading to Beijing. Also, the cancellation or rather the refusal by the Chinese for a trip or a meeting between the Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and his Chinese counterpart at a summit in Singapore just a few days ago at which the head of the Chinese defense ministry said mind your own business.

Right? For leisure. So, why can't we replicate what United has in Newark and American has in JFK or Delta has in JFK. You see what I mean? So, I see space for everyone, Richard. I see space for everyone. I mean, yes, of course. I mean -- I mean, the division is -- the GDP vision is growing five to seven percent per year. Every time you get that kind of GDP growth, aviation grows two times. I don't see any reason why in the next 10 years, right? This is not going to be tripled in size.
