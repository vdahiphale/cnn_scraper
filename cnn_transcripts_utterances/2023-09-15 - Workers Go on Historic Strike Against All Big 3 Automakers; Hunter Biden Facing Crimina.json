Breaking overnight, for the first time in history, auto workers now on strike against not one, not two but all of Detroit's Big Three automakers at the same time after the companies failed to reach a deal with the union by midnight. More than 12,000 workers have already walked off the job in three targeted strikes at plants in Michigan, Ohio and Missouri. The United Auto Workers union president tells CNN even more plants will join this strike if their demands for better wages and benefits are not met.

And they heard back at 8 p.m. last night with a counteroffer from the union, but that offer, according to Ford, was just a slight dip in the 40 percent wages that the union was initially asking for. Ford, Poppy and Phil, could not meet those demands. And the union apparently made it very clear to the automaker that, unless their demands were met, they were going to strike. And here we are. Day one of what is expected to be a strike that may go on for a little while, guys. HARLOW: One of the things, Vanessa, I think is so interesting is that the approach here by the union is to maybe strike at more plants without notice.

Arlette, there's the kind of public posture and then there's the behind the scenes here, the work that the White House has been trying to do, deputizing Gene Sperling, a top adviser, to try and work on this over the course of now, I believe, several weeks.Talk to me about what the feeling is inside the West Wing, given both the political and economic repercussions here. ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Phil. Well, certainly, an issue for the White House that they've been watching very closely over the course of the past few months. And President Biden himself had expressed optimism that this would not end in a strike. But now he is waking up this morning, six hours into a United Auto Workers strike as these negotiations failed to produce a contract. Now, in the final hours, President Biden was engaging with the parties on this issue. They are not -- the White House was not direct party to the negotiations, but President Biden did hold calls with the United Auto Workers president, Shawn Fain, as well as the leaders of the auto work -- of the auto companies to try to just check in on the status of these negotiations. You had Gene Sperling, a Michigan native, a top economic adviser to the president, acting as a go-between between these companies and the UAW as these talks were under way. But one of the focuses right now, while we haven't got a direct reaction from the White House since this strike took place, one of their focuses heading into the day will be trying to see if there's a way to blunt any of the economic impacts of this strike. Of course, there are concerns about what this could mean for the supply chain, what this could mean for higher prices. And of course, there is the political challenge to the president, as well, who has touted himself as the most pro-union president, someone who is trying to change -- improve conditions for these auto workers and other unions, as well. So this will all be part of the challenge, the calculus for the president heading forward as a strike continues into the day.",

But what was charged yesterday, what he is indicted for, it's three charges around a gun that he bought from a dealer, a Colt revolver, in 2018 in Wilmington, Delaware. And the charges are about him certifying to that firearms dealer that he was not under the influence of any illegal drugs at the time and he wasn't addicted to any illegal drugs. Now Hunter Biden has said publicly that he was a drug user around that time. And so, what the federal government is doing now, what the Justice Department is doing is that they're saying that it was false, the statements that he was making as he was trying to obtain this weapon. And then also, he should not have been in possession of the gun. So gun control laws that they are enforcing on the books here. Now, that is only a portion of the Hunter Biden investigation. Much of the investigation, for many years, has been around possible tax crimes. And he had been planning to go through the court system, plead guilty or have some sort of deal with the Justice Department that fell apart just a few weeks ago. And those deals were about both this gun situation, as well as tax crimes. And so now we are waiting to see what happens next for Hunter Biden.

And now his son is facing an indictment. Of course, President Biden is incredibly close with his son Hunter. He had him here at the White House, even as some Democrats privately have expressed concern about keeping Hunter so close amid these investigations. But this is also coming just two days after President Biden -- House Speaker Kevin McCarthy announced that he was calling for a formal impeachment inquiry into the president, even though the House committees have not turned up any evidence to show any direct ties between President Biden and his son Hunter Biden's business dealings.

After a fiery three-day return to the Hill from the August recess, House Republicans failed to rally around any government spending bills at all, with just over two weeks before a government shutdown. Speaker Kevin McCarthy, he's now facing renewed threats to his Speakership from those within his own party, as House Freedom Caucus Republicans hold up appropriations bills and demand significant cuts. Cuts dramatically outside an agreement already reached between Speaker McCarthy and President Biden. McCarthy admitting he's, quote, \"not quite sure what they want\" as Freedom Caucus members continue to threaten to oust him, holding hostage government appropriations. And all as a defense spending bill, traditionally the lowest-hanging fruit in the chamber's spending process, couldn't even get to the House floor this week before Republican leaders had to pull it. To be clear, these are not bipartisan bills that would lead to an actual outcome. This was the bare minimum for a majority that they should be able to pass. Not so much. Now, McCarthy says he plans to push forward with a short-term stopgap spending bill to prevent a shutdown, despite those Freedom Caucus threats, reportedly daring his far-right colleagues to, quote, \"move the 'F'-ing motion.\" The key contrast is across the Capitol building, where bipartisan appropriations leaders have shepherded a steady effort to do their work. This week alone, they advanced a three-bill spending package with huge bipartisan votes twice. Now, that's now hung up in procedural issues, but it has been a dramatically different approach. CNN's Lauren Fox has been working behind the scenes, covering all this drama over the course of the last week and, to some degree, years. Lauren, there have been meetings behind closed doors between House Republicans trying to figure out a path forward. What are they considering and is that going to work?",

That means Trump will not be tried next month with two of his lawyers, Sidney Powell and Kenneth Chesebro; likely wouldn't face trial, then, until next year. And then moving to the civil fraud case right here in New York, this is a case brought against Trump, his children and the Trump Organization by the attorney general of New York, Letitia James. A judge has agreed to an emergency request by Trump's lawyers to put that trial temporarily on hold. And that really raises questions about whether it will begin next month as planned. And then new overnight on the federal level, in that federal election interference case, Special Counsel Jack Smith argued against Trump's request that the judge, Tanya Chutkan, recuse herself. He's saying that Trump had taken her comments in the Capitol rioter cases, quote, \"out of context\" in order to manufacture allegations of bias. And also -- this is really interesting -- new overnight, NBC News asked Trump if he had considered pardoning himself in any of the federal cases. Here's what he said.
