It's been really tough, and you know, to think that this contrast between this beautiful, touching video of her family together, the contrast between what we saw when she told us she had cancer in early March, she gave that - - the video, she was sitting alone on a bench, and it was just so sad.

But latest CNN poll of polls, have a look at this, shows Harris at 49 percent to Trump's 47 percent, but that's within the margin of error. The two candidates are taking very different approaches that you'd expect to the debate in Philadelphia. A source tells CNN, part of Harris' plan is to introduce her to undecided voters. Meantime, Donald Trump is threatening to jail election workers and vowing to pardon those convicted of rioting at the U.S. Capitol on January the 6th. Let's get more on all these threats for you. We're joined by CNN politics senior reporter, Stephen Collinson and Kevin Liptak; CNN senior White House reporter. Kevin, good to see you, same to you, Stephen.

You know, Harris was insome of Donald Trump's State of the Union speeches, but that's about as close proximity is they've ever been. And I think it's a moment that they're thinking about a lot, taking very seriously. And it is a study in contrast in how they're both preparing for this, Kamala Harris has been kind of hunkered down in Pittsburgh for a couple of days. That's in the critical battleground state of Pennsylvania, of course. And she has had this key group of advisors around her. She's participating in these mock debates. She has a stand-in for Donald Trump. His name is Philippe Reines, and he actually played Donald Trump in mock debates with Hillary Clinton back in 2016. And he really kind of gets into the part he puts on the red tie, the ill-fitting suits, so, he really does sort of embody the character for Kamala Harris in these debate prep moments. And according to her advisors, the strategy is to really try and keep cool amid what they expect will be an onslaught of insults and lies. She talked about that this morning in a radio interview. But also trying to look for ways to get under Donald Trump's skin, to try and provoke him and try and get him to demonstrate what so many American samples they don't like about him, which is his attitude. And for Donald Trump's part, he doesn't like to say that he's in debate prep, his team doesn't like the word, preparation. In reality, he is talking about the debate with his advisors. They are what they call policy sessions. He's actually brought it on a new phase as well, the former Hawaii Congressman Tulsi Gabbard, who actually shared a debate stage with Kamala Harris when they were both running for the Democratic nomination back in 2019. So, she has some experience, she did land some punches against Kamala Harris back then. And so, it is a study in contrast, but I think both of these teams are looking at this debate is quite a critical moment, because at the end of today, it is the only debate --",

And actually just today, her campaign put a policy page on its website, that had been something that they had been criticized for, for not having that on their website. One of the key areas I think she's going to want to do and it's going to be a balance for her is try and demonstrate where she'll break from President Biden, who of course, is the President she has been serving for the last four years. Obviously, some of President Biden's policies, particularly when it comes to the economy haven't necessarily resonated with the American people and with the American voter. And so, it will be on her to sort of explain what she would do differently from President Biden if she were to become President. But at the end of the day, her team really does view her as the underdog in this debate.

So, he does have the ability to do it for short periods. But I think what that clip shows and the remarks by the former President over the weekend underscores something that has really faded a little in the excitement over the Harris candidate. And this is the argument that Trump would represent a great and grave threat to not just the American electoral system, but the judicial system as well if he becomes President. That is not necessarily the top concern of voters who are more concerned with the economy and immigration and security issues. But that is something that Harris has tried to stress as well. She says that he's a very unserious man who poses an extremely serious threat, and any sort of movement in that direction on Tuesday night, I think risks on behalf of Trump playing into tactics.",

Now, social media video after the strike last night appeared to show multiple secondary explosions. You can even hear the sound of what sounds like missiles whizzing out of this site, even some coming sort of pretty close to the camera by the sounds of it. This seems to indicate that it was potentially a weapons storage or production site. Now, we do know in Lebanon that Israel has been hitting some of Hezbollah's deeply positioned up in the north of Lebanon, some of their weapons storage facilities and the secondary explosions we've seen -- now, those look somewhat similar to the video that we saw coming out of Syria overnight. So, that -- we  know at the moment, 18 people are dead, 37 people are wounded, and Israel, as it always says about strikes in Syria, doesn't comment on international media reports.

Kamala Harris will take the stage in Philadelphia to debate Donald Trump for the first and possibly only time before voters head to the polls in early November. The race is in a virtual dead heat, as we told you at the top of the show. And the importance, of course, of a presidential debate is no longer up for debate. A disastrous debate performance last June mark beginning of the end of President Biden's re-election campaign, if you remember, and pushed Harris to the top of the ticket. Well, let's get more on what we can expect today. What's at stake? Well, joining us is Larry Sabato, the director, University of Virginia Center for Polities, also the editor of \"A Return to Normalcy?: The 2020 Election that Almost Broke America.\" Well known face here on the show. Larry, great to see you. So, this -- as I was just saying to our viewers, this is the first time they're debating their first, it seems, face-to-face meeting. I couldn't believe it when I was reading today. This is the first time they've actually met each other. And it comes as polls show a very tight lead. Are you surprised at all by the tightness of this contest? I mean, she did gain momentum, but doesn't have a commanding edge. Does that surprise you at all, Larry?",

Edmundo Gonzalez said in a statement a couple of hours ago, he presented a letter to the Venezuelan people, thanking the support over the last few weeks, but also giving the idea that he's stepping back from frontline politics and perhaps marking a distance from Corina Machado herself, who instead, in Caracas, continues to show defiance and says that even though their paths have separated, Maria Corina and Edmundo are now on different paths, the commitment remains the same. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MARIA CORINA MACHADO, VENEZUELAN OPPOSITION LEADER (through translator):  If Edmundo leaving would make my situation more dangerous, I don't know.

And she said today that she will remain in Venezuela. Whether she can mount a credible challenge where so many of previous leaders have failed remains to be seen. About Edmundo, we're hearing that he might be meeting the Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, in the coming days. Tomorrow, the Congress in -- the parliament in Spain will discuss a law to move the government to -- not force, but like to push the government to formally declare Edmundo Gonzalez as the electoral -- the -- as the president-elect of Venezuela with, of course, diplomatic consequences. We understand that the government has granted the asylum to Edmundo Gonzalez, but he's not ready to make that step. Edmundo Gonzalez is a former diplomat. He's used to work the phone.

And what was prettyimpressive about the announcement is that it looks like the company has really taken its time with rolling out A.I. Incorporating Apple Intelligence into a lot of the phone from a hardware perspective and actually creating a completely new Silicon chip in order to do that, jumping over the A17 chips. So, they went from A16 straight up to A18 in order to build in a lot of those A.I. features. We saw some demonstrations of Apple Intelligence being used for things like revision of text messages, revision of e-mails. We also saw the application of A.I. in something called visual intelligence. And so, when you're using your camera, you're walking around, perhaps you want to take a photo of a poster and add that event to your calendar, then you can do that in real- time through AI. You can also use the A.I. features in partnership with Siri. So, using Siri, using those voice commands more effectively. This is very much Apple's playbook to sit on the sidelines for a moment and kind of see how everything shakes out regarding incorporating A.I., and then coming in with something that is a little bit more UX focused, a little bit more consumer focused, so consumers can get increasingly excited about A.I. and their day-to-day lives.",

And so, ultimately, you just have to make the chips faster and better in order to facilitate a lot of these features. And it's actually good that you bring that up because, you know, when CNET did a survey of consumers last year about what it takes for them to upgrade a smartphone, A.I. is pretty far down the list in terms of features that would make someone actually shell out more money. The biggest features that people consistently look for are better cameras, better screens, and more storage. And we saw that again in our survey as well. And so, Apple knows exactly what it's doing. The majority of the iPhone 16 rollout was about a new camera shutter button on the side, having more storage, having faster battery life, longer battery. Who doesn't want that built into the device? But they did tease quite a few of these Apple Intelligence features as well in a way that is consumer facing. And if you don't know anything about A.I., then it's OK.
