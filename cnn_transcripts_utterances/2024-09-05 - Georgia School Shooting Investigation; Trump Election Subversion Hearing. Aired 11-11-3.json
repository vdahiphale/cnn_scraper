      "sentences": "Wolf, if it is getting heated inside this federal courthouse. This is a much more combative hearing than what my sources anticipated would be the case today, the judge rebuffing multiple arguments made by the Trump legal team.Look, the Trump legal team walked in today with two goals. The first is to try to delay anything substantive in this case until after the November election. If Trump is reelected, they know this case will likely be dismissed. Now, their second goal is to try to gut this case and get it tossed out by arguing that the Supreme Court's recent opinion presidential immunity means that key pieces of evidence, like conversations he had with then-Vice President Mike Pence, should be tossed, but the judge here making it clear she does not see things their way. They even suggested that she should just toss the indictment completely. And she said, look, that is not what I'm going to do here. And she's really pressing the Trump lawyers on why they are seeking this extended timeline, why they can't do things in a more consolidated manner. But one thing she's made crystal clear here, Wolf, is that she rejects any suggestion that the timing of the election should play a part in how this case proceeds. So it continues, but definitely a pretty intense hearing so far.",

Now they have turned to a separate legal question, which is whether Jack Smith was properly appointed constitutionally as special counsel. Now, you may remember, back in July, the court in the other case, the Florida court, threw out the classified documents case because the judge there said the appointment of Jack Smith as special counsel was unconstitutional. Now Trump's lawyers are taking that to this court in D.C. saying, see, the whole thing's unconstitutional. It's clear Judge Chutkan is not buying that. She has correctly pointed out that a D.C. Court of Appeals considered and rejected the same argument in the Mueller case. So she's essentially saying, why shouldn't I just reject that out of hand? Trump's team is saying, well, there's been some new developments. Judge Chutkan is not buying that. That argument to throw out Jack Smith is not going to succeed in this court.",

There's this case, which is in D.C. we have a hearing now, and then the Florida case.And what Trump's team did is they brought the argument that special counsel was unconstitutional only to the Florida judge, Judge Cannon, and not to this judge until now. And so this judge is saying, why would you only bring it to her, the other judge in Florida? You have had -- they have had nearly a year to bring this case to D.C.

They are suggesting somehow that a lone justice's concurrence has somehow reopened the issue of Smith's appointment.That's from the prosecutor, Thomas Windom.

And so other courts, including the Court of Appeals here in D.C., which is binding on Judge Chutkan, have rejected that argument. They have said there's more than enough basis.",

But as I was saying, this is not the first special counsel that's ever been appointed. In fact, this goes back decades, back to the '90s, where independent counsel and special counsel were appointed and have been appointed by numerous Justice Departments to investigate cases and prosecute them, if necessary, where there might be a conflict of interest, Mueller being also another recent one.",

The most famous or infamous one of those was Ken Starr. In 1999, that law lapsed. It had a legislative sunset. There was such backlash over the Clinton impeachment that Congress just said, let's let it die. In its place in 1999 arose the current set of special counsel regulations. Under those regulations, we have seen Robert Mueller, Jack Smith, Robert Hur, David Weiss, as Karen noted, who's prosecuting Hunter Biden right now. And the challenges, well, regulations -- legal challenge is, regulations aren't enough. There has to be a specific law. But as Karen said, every judge to consider this so far, except for Judge Cannon, has said, no, it's OK, the regulations are justified, they are supported by the general powers of the attorney general. So this is a heavy longshot argument that Trump is making. He made it successfully to Judge Cannon. I think she's going to get reversed. I think that classified documents case is going to get reinstated because of this. And as Judge Chutkan notes, the heavy weight of the legal authority is against Trump on this point.",

And Trump's team is saying, well, let's hold on. Let's not even start that until after the election in December. The prosecutors -- and it seems like the judge is on board with this -- says, well, let's start the process of arguing that immunity issue and briefing it as soon as possible.

Prosecution, you have to now give us more discovery, more evidence, more documents. And what the prosecutor is saying here is, no, we have already given you everything that's relevant.

But after that, a couple months ago, the Supreme Court said, no, much of this indictment is now covered by immunity, meaning much of this indictment now has to come out, including, for example, Trump's conversations with the Justice Department. And so Jack Smith, responding to that last week, came back with a slimmed-down indictment. It keeps the same charges in place.

But the one area of agreement is that the first issue that the judge needs to address is this question of immunity.

She's made it clear that the first issue is going to be immunity. So she's asked to decide how she wants to proceed with that. Then there are going to be these other questions of, how does the Supreme Court's decision about obstruction of justice related to January 6, how does that apply here? She knows that the defense attorneys are going to try to litigate the legitimacy of the special counsel, but it does not appear that she's going to give a lot of weight to that argument. And then there are also these outstanding questions of discovery. So, right now, we're going to start waiting to see what Judge Tanya Chutkan says in terms of next steps. But it's clear, look, she's not going to completely concede to the defense and the way they want to proceed here, but it's really unclear how she's going to lay out this calendar.

There was a spicy banter going on between her and Donald Trump's attorney, John Lauro, about how long it should take for everyone to get together all of the evidence, the briefing, the legal arguments to talk about presidential immunity. Trump's team obviously wanted to slow things down. They were going back and forth very quickly in the courtroom, so much so that the court reporter had to say, hold on, you're talking over one another, Judge and defense attorney. And then John Lauro said, you know there's a very sensitive time in our nation's history, and that's when you could see he lost the judge. Judge Tanya Chutkan sat back in her chair, she sighed, and then she put a finger up, stopped the banter, took a pause and said, let's discuss what the sensitive time is here. The election is not relevant to the timeline. And that just put a different flavor across the courtroom of the discussions about timing here. And she pulled it back to say, we're going to talk about what's actually needed, what I can do here, and how to move this forward. She didn't put a trial date on the calendar, and she didn't put a timeline down yet. She does say she is going to set one up for later today, hopefully, if she can put that out. But what the subtext here, she didn't want that, this is not about the presidential election, Donald Trump running for presidency, and whether or not the Justice Department is able to put forward evidence before November. The other thing I want to point out here, Wolf, is, there was a lightness to this proceeding. Nobody has been in this courtroom before Judge Chutkan since last October. And even Jack Smith, we haven't seen him in a courtroom for some time. He was there today. His beard is a lot longer than the last time I remember seeing him. Judge Chutkan, her hair, it's lighter.
