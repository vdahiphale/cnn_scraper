      "sentences": "Well, welcome back. I'm Becky Anderson coming to you live from our Middle East programming hub here in Abu Dhabi.Israel now confirming it has occupied a village in southern Lebanon. This after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivers an ominous warning. We are live in Tel Aviv, in Tehran and in Washington, D.C. for you this hour. First up, though, I want to get you to Florida, bracing for what forecasters say will be catastrophic impacts from Hurricane Milton. The now Category 4 storm is on track to hit central Florida in the overnight hours. Ahead of that, Milton is expanding in size, as you can see here, and will hit with life-threatening storm surge and devastating winds. By the time it makes landfall, nearly the entire state of Florida will be experiencing some sort of impact. Carlos Suarez is in Fort Myers in Florida, which could experience some of the most severe impacts once that storm reaches land. Just describe where you are and what the expectations are at this point. CARLOS SUAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on-camera): Becky, good morning from Fort Myers, Florida, where the wind has started to pick up and a quick look at the radar shows that we'll start seeing some of the rain move through this part of southwest Florida in the next couple of hours. The big concern for the folks that live here is the flooding that we're going to see because of Hurricane Milton. Right now, the forecast is calling for a storm surge of anywhere between 8 to 12 feet. Now, to give you a sense of that number, two years ago, Hurricane Ian made a direct landfall here in Lee County, and about 10 feet of storm surge pushed off from the Caloosahatchee River here out into the mainland of Fort Myers. And so, everything that you're taking a look at here two years ago was underwater. It was damaged, if not destroyed. The amphitheater behind me was gone. It had to be rebuilt. The convention center to my right also had to be repaired because of what happened here with Hurricane Ian. And so, the folks out here have been preparing for the last couple of days because, again, Hurricane Ian two years ago was a direct hit, and this place was leveled. The damage, the flooding was pretty bad. And now with the forecast that Milton is on, it's tracking a little bit north of where we are. It's supposed to make landfall north of where we are. But even, you know, that fact alone is not enough for these folks because they, again, believe that the storm surge out here is either going to be at the same level, if not higher, than Hurricane Ian.

Now, the Israeli military said it had taken control of an Hezbollah compact -- combat compound. Israel's prime minister had this message for the Lebanese people. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, Mr. Netanyahu is expected to hold a call shortly with U.S. President Joe Biden to discuss a response to Iran's missile attack a coupleof weeks ago on Israel. Look, we've got a lot to unpack this hour. Jeremy Diamond back with us from Tel Aviv, Natasha Bertrand is at the Pentagon, and Fred Pleitgen is in Tehran. Jeremy, let me start with you. The defense minister, Yoav Gallant's trip was delayed to Washington to see the Lloyd Austin, the minister of defense for the U.S., because it was delayed because Mr. Netanyahu wanted to speak to Joe Biden first. Why is that? What do we understand to be going on here? JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT (on-camera): Well, I think there's a lot of different layers to this cancellation by the Israeli prime minister. I mean, first of all, to state the obvious, Netanyahu and his defense minister, Yoav Gallant, have a very tumultuous relationship. And part of that tumultuous relationship stems from policy disagreements between the two men. And Gallant really has become viewed as somewhat of a reliable interlocutor by the United States for engaging in these kinds of discussions. So personal politics may be at play here as part of it. But it goes beyond that, of course. The Israeli Prime Minister seems to have wanted to speak directly with President Biden himself about these Iranian strike options, rather than having his defense minister engage with the U.S. defense secretary and then go from there. But he also, we understand, wants to have a vote in the Israeli cabinet on how Israel will retaliate against Iran before Yoav Gallant, the defense minister, travels to the United States. And part of that may also stem from the fact that, ultimately, Netanyahu doesn't want to be swayed away from certain options. And someone like Gallant, who has a close relationship with his U.S. counterpart, could potentially come back with a very different message than one Netanyahu might want to hear. Now, it is clear, ultimately, that Israel is consulting with the United States on this. They have clearly held off on actually carrying out that response until they can at least attempt or show that they are attempting to get on the same page as the United States. But ultimately, Israeli officials telling me that, look, Israel is an independent state. They're going to make their own decisions at the end of the day about exactly what that strike option looks like against Iran.",

      "sentences": "Yes, OK, Fred, thank you for that. And (INAUDIBLE) with Fred in Tehran are brilliant.I want to bring in Natasha. Natasha, we've been discussing, you know, where the Israelis stand, why it is that this Gallant -- Yoav Gallant meeting has been delayed, at least his trip to Washington. And what might be the body of that conversation that Joe Biden and Bibi Netanyahu will have this evening? What are your sources telling you about what happens next? NATASHA BERTRAND, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (on-camera): Well, look, obviously officials here at the Pentagon are not exactly pleased that Yoav Gallant's visit was canceled because it was going to be a really key opportunity for Secretary of Defense Austin to speak with Gallant about what their plans are for that retaliation against Iran. And Secretary Austin and Gallant, they do have a good relationship. I mean, as Jeremy was saying, Gallant is seen as a generally reliable interlocutor between the U.S. and the Israelis. However, I should note that Secretary Austin has not necessarily been very happy with the Israelis and with Gallant in recent weeks, just given the fact that they have not always given the U.S. heads up ahead of major operations. For example, when it came to the pager attack, when it came to the assassination of Hassan Nasrallah, the heads up that the Israelis gave to the U.S. including to Secretary Austin was -- was a matter of minutes. And so, I think that this would have been an opportunity for the Secretary of Defense to potentially kind of try to patch up the relationship with Gallant, try to reestablish some of that trust before Israel moves forward with a potential retaliation in Iran that could cause things in the region to get even more tense, which would then, of course, in turn, have the United States potentially get involved with its own forces to try to protect U.S. troops in the region and, of course, also defend the Israelis.

That, of course, that we've just been discussing and this storm headed right for Florida at this point. And Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has been giving an update on preparations for Hurricane Milton and this is what he had to say just a short time ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL): Generators have been deployed at shelters and to support sheltering operations. Starlink internet has been deployed across the entire state of Florida. We have surged an additional 600 ambulances and they are currently in operation helping in the effort. The state of Florida has considerable fuel reserves ahead of Milton and it's staged and they will be utilized as needed following the storm. We've already dispatched a lot of fuel in the lead up to this, but we still have on hand 1.6 million gallons of diesel and 1.1 million gallons of gasoline. There is no right now fuel shortage. However, demand has been extraordinarily high, and some gas stations have run out to be able to help ameliorate that. The Florida Highway Patrol has facilitated 106 long distant fuel tanker escorts with sirens, getting through traffic totaling almost a million gallons of gasoline from ports in Tampa, Jacksonville, Everglades and Manatee, and they are continuing with the fuel escorts as we speak. I've been in contact with the ports on the west coast of Florida. We'll see how this storm impacts those. Clearly, there's an opportunity -- there's a chance that you could have a major impact on Port Manatee as well as on Port Tampa Bay. That could interrupt their ability to receive fuel shipments. And so, we're working on contingencies to be able to keep fuel flowing throughout the state of Florida. As we saw this new storm develop, it was clear that a lot of the hardest hit areas on the west coast of Florida from Hurricane Helene had not had major robust debris removal contracts in place or operations in place. Some of these contractors were good. Some of them were not getting the job done. So, you had a major hazard on barrier islands in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota County. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The land temperatures vary quite a bit. You get cold fronts, you get weather systems coming through the oceans though. Those are the natural place that the earth stores carbon, right? That carbon transfer between the atmosphere and the ocean is a natural process. But when we put this extra carbon pollution into the atmosphere, it then gets sunk into the ocean, which heats the ocean itself. So, what we can do with this attribution science, because the ocean has a very long memory, is understand just the temperatures that we're seeing, how far above average they are, and then how much more likely those temperatures are because of that carbon pollution that humans have put into the atmosphere. So, like you said, what we know where Milton developed over the last two weeks has been kind of the hottest climate spot in the entire Gulf of Mexico, and it just so happened that Milton formed right on top of it. And again, that's ocean temperatures that were made 400 (INAUDIBLE) 100 times more likely, which more simply just means that those temperatures are virtually impossible in that part of the Gulf at this time in October without the interference of human caused climate change.",

GIOKOS (voice-over): Back in March, the New York Times reported that Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund has been in talks with venture capital giants Andreessen Horowitz to launch a $40 billion AI fund that would fuel innovation in Saudi Arabia and transform its post oil economy. PWC estimates that at the international level, AI could boost the global economy by $15.7 trillion by 2030. That's more than China and India's current output combined. And here in Saudi Arabia, the kingdom is putting AI at the heart of its post oil strategy, aiming for massive gains. By 2030, this innovative technology could add over $135 billion to the kingdom's economy. That's equivalent to about 12.4 percent of its GDP.",
