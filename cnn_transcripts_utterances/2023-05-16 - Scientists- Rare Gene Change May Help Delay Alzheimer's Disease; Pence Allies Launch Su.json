      "sentences": "A major clue in understanding Alzheimer's disease. Scientists say that a rare gene change could help protect people at risk for this type of dementia.And these are the findings published in a new study and it documents a man diagnosed with the disease, who seemed fated to develop early memory loss, but he kept normal function for decades longer than he should have. With us is CNN chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta. This, Sanjay, is fascinating. Walk us through what the researchers discovered here. DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: It is really fascinating story. Down in Columbia, for 40 years, they have been studying this extended family and some 60,000 family. Most of them got early onset dementia in their 40s, and they tried to find the ones who didn't and find out what is different about them. So that is how they conducted their study. They found among this population of people, most of the people were expected to develop the dementia in their 40s and 50s. And one gentleman did not develop it until he was 72, and progressed quickly after that. And within two years, he actually died from pneumonia. At that point, they looked at his brain. His brain had been donated to science and they were trying to figure out what is different here. And they found evidence of the genetic mutation that led to the protein deposited in one particular area of the brain. Right here, sort of behind the frontal lobe area, an area responsible for the memories and things like that. His brain had plaque and tangles and that sort of thing that you see with Alzheimer's, but in that one area, he seemed protected. And that is why, you know, researchers are so interested in this.",

And so what is the takeaway there?",

Is there something specific in a woman's brain that something changes between the paces of the men and the women. We don't know, but it is somewhat protective, and not as much. But it is going to make the researchers looking at the gender differences when it is coming to Alzheimer's as well, and different origins of the disease as well.",

According to a source, Foxx is undergoing treatment at a physical rehabilitation facility in Chicago where he has been receiving care for the past two weeks. The source did not disclose exactly what Foxx is being treated for but the center does specialize in rehabilitation care for patients with physical impairments, brain or spine injuries. And also, the man charged with attacking two members of Gerry Connolly's staff has been arraigned. That suspect appeared via video camera from the county detention center, was arraigned on four felony charges. He is being held without bond. His next hearing is scheduled for July 17th. Meanwhile, CNN caught up with Congressman Connolly who reflected on the emotions running through his staff in the wake of the violent attack coming out of nowhere. And he said, quote, \"I think the hard part sets in now, the trauma. Even this morning, there was blood all over the rug. My staff cleaning it up.\" Just such a shock. And, Boris, we have seen the violence of lawmakers, and this is one more case of it.",

The company said that the sales fell by 4.5 percent at its stores in the latest quarter. The company is blaming higher interest rates and inflation for taking a toll on home projects, saying that 2023 is going to be a year of moderation for the home improvement market. And also, a years-long abduction case finally coming to a happy ending. A shop owner in Asheville, North Carolina, is credited with alerting police to Kayla, who was 9 years old when she was taken by the non-custodial mother in Illinois back in 2017. The store owner apparently recognized the pair after seeing them featured on the Netflix series \"Unsolved Mysteries.\" The mother is now charged with child abduction. And check this out. A wild scene at a youth baseball game in Jacksonville, Florida. A dust devil coming out of nowhere, swirling around Homeplate as the game was going on. You can see 7-year-old Bauer Zoya playing catcher. The umpire pulling him to safety. Listen to how Bauer described what happened to him. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BAUER ZOYA, 7-YEAR-OLD CATCHER: I could not breathe that much, and so I hurted my breath, and I felt like I could not touch the ground. And so I lifted up a little bit. I didn't know what to do, so I was thinking about something that was happening and not like that. So, so I don't get freaked about. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

In that Iowa trip, it was right there in heart of Trump country, and where Trump won by 80 percent.His people are telling me that DeSantis is making the final preparations to get into the race. I have two sources who say they expect him to make an announcement by the end of the month. DeSantis next week is going to meet with the top donors in south Florida where the message will be to them is it is game time. So, all of the groundwork has been laid at this point. And all that is left to happen is for DeSantis to jump into the race. And when he does, he is going to continue to make these contrasts with the former president. And just like the one you mentioned, he wants to ally himself as a winner against Trump, the guy who lost in 2020. He is a governor who gets stuff done. Trump is a leader who is often distracted and squandered a GOP majority in the first two years in office. DeSantis has an administration where there's not a lot of drama, not a lot of leaks. The Trump White House was often engulfed in palace intrigue. These are the contrasts that DeSantis believes and the team believes will give him a chance to make the case to Republican votes the Trump years, we love them for a lot of reasons, but it's time to move and get a fresh face in there, someone younger, some who is active, someone who can get things done. That is why you are seeing him spending all of the time signing the bills and going around the state and touting his legislative policy victory. Because he wants to enter the race and be able to say, I am a guy who got stuff done, and I will get it done if I am elected president.",
