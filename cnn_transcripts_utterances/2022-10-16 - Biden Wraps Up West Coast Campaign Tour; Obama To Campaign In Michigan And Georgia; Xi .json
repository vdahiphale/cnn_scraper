Much is at stake as Democrats try to hold on in Congress and win key local and state elections. Biden's approval is low across polls, fueling worries that it could weigh down the party at the ballot box.So instead of stumping alongside the most vulnerable candidates, the president is going to Oregon and California and highlighting his achievements and raise millions of dollars from donors.

I mean that sincerely because so much is at stake. If we are able to keep the House and keep the Senate, we can continue to do the things we've been doing, which are really going to make change to the country. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

While the president was both in California and here in Oregon, he talked about ways to lower prices for Americans as inflation remains a top concern for voters heading into these elections.

And yet they claim this island and they have for decades as their own. Only difference is now China has a military that, if it's not capable of doing it, it will be in the very near future. That is one of Xi Jinping's stated goals. So you have this much smaller but vibrant democracy that doesn't have formal diplomatic ties with most of the countries around the world but has friendships with powerful like-minded democracies. Saying what they have consistently have said, that Taiwan will not accept a unilateral reunification with the Mainland because they don't feel it's a reunification; they think it would be a hostile takeover. They say the whole point of having a democracy is that the voters, the majority of the public, decide their future. And poll after poll especially over the last few years since 2019, when people in Taiwan watched the chaos in Hong Kong, watched the freedoms of Hong Kong be taken away under what was supposed to be \"One Country, Two Systems,\" it has made the prospect of any one country, two systems for Taiwan unacceptable. According to the opposition party, the KMT, which is traditionally pro China, does not have any platform that will accept \"One Country, Two Systems.\"  So you have this government saying that Taiwan will never compromise on values of sovereignty, democracy and freedom. We know the national security team of Taiwan is closely monitoring what is transpiring in Beijing as we speak. With Xi Jinping's consolidation of power and his stated intent that, in his generation, Taiwan should be reabsorbed with the Mainland, it is certainly perhaps not the most pressing, urgent concern in that they think it's going to happen tomorrow. But the widely held view is, at some stage, likely during Xi Jinping's rule, China will make a move to bolster its military, improve military training, enhance self-defense capabilities preparing for that day that China decides to try to fulfill the promise that Xi Jinping made today.

It only took two hours for him to deliver this one compared with three hours five years ago at the last party Congress.I think what was also striking was perhaps less of the more strident language we heard five years ago, the more confident language about China moving to the center stage of global affairs. His remarks on Taiwan were still hedged, still talking about assisting with policy of peaceful reunification in spite of those hardline warnings around that as well. And really a sense of caution, talk of the great waves and strong winds that China will be facing in the years ahead. There's every reason for Mr. Xi to feel cautious. And he covered the stringent controls of the virus, which is one reason, battering the economy. He didn't give any promise of ending that. But I think that's going to be something we watch for closely during this Congress, any sign of tweaking in that.",

But the event is particularly important, of course, for leadership changes -- and there are sweeping changes that have already taken place in the buildup to this at the provincial and lower levels of the party hierarchy. This will culminate at the end of the Congress. There will be another, smaller meeting of a new central committee the day after the Congress and that will choose a new politburo -- not a new, the same general secretary, same chief of the armed forces, in other words, Xi Jinping. But it will be a big reshuffle. At least half of the politburo will be changed. A couple, we expect, at least of the politburo standing committee, that's the very apex of power, seven men. So a huge event for China politically and something that they've been gearing up for, with extraordinary intensity for months and months.

We are hearing contrasting accounts of what actually happened within the prison, those images circulating late last night.The videos of the black plumes of smoke rising from the prison complex drew widespread concern from Iran and the international community. This is a prison that houses hundreds of political prisoners, journalists, writers, lawyers, many of them in prison for speaking out against the Iranian regime. This is a huge concern because we have seen demonstrations, protests sparking up across the country. We've heard from a activist group. They've been sharing the video coming out of Iran throughout the protests. In the videos they circulated yesterday, last night, there were sounds of gunfire in the background around these prison -- this prison complex as well as, of course, reports of the Iranian security forces have been deployed to the prison complex. We also heard from the IranWire reporting according to a source they had within the prison that there had been a revolt within the prison complex and that a fire ensued. This stands in contrast expectedly from the government's own line. They say that \"thugs\" had been responsible for riots within the prison and that a fire had ensued in the clothing warehouse on the prison complex. But they were quickly -- quick to assure that the fire was under control and being dealt with by the authorities. We have seen widespread international reaction, concern because this prison houses foreign nationals as well. We heard yesterday from the U.S. State Department, Ned Price, \"We are following reports from Evin prison with urgency and we are in contact with the Swiss as our protecting power. \"Iran is fully responsible for the safety of our wrongfully detained citizens, who should be released immediately.\" We are aware of the U.S. citizen who reimprisoned in the Evin prison complex for at least seven years, wrongfully detained. But this comes on the back of weeks and weeks of demonstrations. Iranian authorities were quick to say this wasn't connected to what they've said were riots. This has raised concern. We've seen a violent crackdown by the Iranian authorities of any signs of dissent, even the prison home to many political prisoners who've been detained there, some of them for years without being able to contact family members, some of them. So this is a real point of concern. We are still seeing protests taking place. We've also seen in the last few days calls on social media, circulating for a national uprising. This has grown far more serious. This has morphed into a total regime change. Kim.",

The band recorded the previously unreleased song for a 1989 album, \"Miracle.\" Brian May and Roger Taylor teased its release in June, describing it as a little gem that they had kind of forgotten about. Mercury died a few years after recording the tune from AIDS-related pneumonia, a struggle he largely faced in private. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
