At least one U.S. warship and one U.S. submarine, the USS Florida, fired Tomahawk missiles.

But this marks the Houthis' second direct hit on a U.S. ship just this week.And just in this hour, another regional escalation with Pakistan striking what it says were terror targets inside Iran, according to a Pakistani security official. Iranian state media reports at least seven people were killed, three women, four children, citing the deputy governor of Sistan and Baluchistan province in southeastern Iran. This comes a day after Tehran launched a strike on Sunni militants inside Pakistan. CNN's Sophia Saifi is following all of this. The U.S. is also following all of this.

Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has only just released a statement calling this operation death to the freedom fighters.They have said in that statement that they have told and shared information with Iran multiple times that there were militants operating within Iran, Iranian territory that were then attacking Pakistan. And they had to then go ahead and do these precision strikes within Iran, which, according to security forces, sorry, security officials, were about seven different targets within Iran itself. So this is definitely an escalation. Pakistan has specifically in that statement also said that, yes, it respects Iran's territorial integrity. However, it has to make sure that Pakistan's security is not violated. It's called by Iran a brotherly nation. And this is something that was expected, considering the fact that these the strikes by Iran happened inside Pakistan very late on Tuesday night. We hadn't heard anything back from the military at all. There was complete silence. We're still not hearing much from the military. It's the government that is making these statements. The Pakistani government, the Pakistani Ministry of Foreign Affairs also recalled the Iranian -- recalled its ambassador from Iran back to Pakistan and asked the Iranian ambassador not to return to Pakistan. It's also suspended all high-level visits between both countries. So, we're just going to have to wait and see whether this is it, whether it's a tit-for-tat for what Iran did on Tuesday night and what has happened, that what Pakistan has done today is going to be an end to this escalation in this part of the region. [00:05:09] I mean, we do know that stuff is happening in the Middle East with regards to Iran, but this is something that's now bleeding into South Asia.

Gaza once again plunged into eerie darkness. Endless tragedies on the ground, obscured by the longest communications blackout imposed on the strip thus far.

Tiny bodies wrapped in shrouds, carried in the arms of bereft parents. Now amongst the more than 10,000 children said to have been killed in a war they had no part in. Those figures, provided by the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza, grow more shocking with each passing day. More than 24,000 people killed in just over three months.

And we should be extremely worried about this.These observations keep confirming and reaffirming the dire situation we're in and that things are actually worse than was previously expected by the scientific models. And, you know, in Greenland, the situation -- we already knew that Greenland had lost ice. The increasing rate of ice loss was about six- fold over the last 30 years. But this new study, the NASA study, basically confirmed that it was even 20 percent more than that by measuring the terminus retreat, the ice, the glacial terminus that were already in the fjords. So it's worse than we thought in Greenland. And you know, the impacts of this are pretty profound when you start thinking about it, that sea -- one is sea level. Sea-level rise has gone up about six to eight to nine inches over the past century. If we get our climate, our carbon act in order, it will continue to go up another two feet or so over this century. But if we don't reduce emissions, it'll go up about seven or eight feet this century. So sea-level rise is a real concern from both the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheet. But a more important issue immediately is the slowing down of these deep ocean conveyor belt currents that drive the global ocean circulation. They ventilate the deep ocean. They -- they help absorb carbon from the atmosphere and heat from the atmosphere. And if these things slow down, which they are -- the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation has been measured to slow about 15 percent. The Antarctic deep water has slowed about 20 -- 15 to 20 percent. That these things slow down, it could actually shut down a lot of this very potent ocean circulations.
