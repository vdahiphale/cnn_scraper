Breaking right now, a U.S. official tells CNN that Russia and the U.S. are carrying out a massive prisoner swap, in which a number of high-profile Americans will be handed over. Amongst those expected to be released are \"The Wall Street Journal\" reporter, Evan Gershkovich, and the former U.S. Marine, Paul Whelan. Now this deal would end a nightmare that has lasted more than five years for Whelan while Gershkovich has been in custody for more than a year. Our sources say the swap comes after months of complicated negotiations between Moscow, Washington and others. Jennifer Hansler is with us from Washington. What exactly do we know at this point? What are your sources telling you?",

      "sentences": "Well, Becky, at this point we only know that this is expected to be a massive swap on a largescale for Evan and Paul. And now of course, as you mentioned, this has been months, if not years in the making. In the case of Paul Whelan, we know the U.S. has been working to get him home ever since he was not included in the deals that brought home Trevor Reed in April 2022 and Brittney Griner in December 2022. Our past reporting indicated that the U.S. was scouring the globe to look for people who Russia might be willing to trade. That could include the Russian assassin, Vadim Krasikov, who is being held in Germany. We know this is someone that the Russians have repeatedly put on the table. The U.S. has been hesitant to offer him as -- given the fact that they do not actually have the ability to offer him. So this is a very complicated diplomatic, behind-the-scenes negotiation that has been going on for months and months here, Becky.",

In the past, when Brittney Griner and Trevor Reed were released, they would go to a third country. The U.S. would fly into that third country. The Russian would fly in there and we would see almost this \"Bridge of Spies\" moment, where the two sides are crossing the tarmac and the Americans are returned to the U.S. side and the Russians are returned to the Russian side. So we do expect to see similar images in this case of this swap. Now from there we expect Paul and Evan to fly back to the United States to be reunited with their loved ones, who have -- they have been waiting more than a year in Evan's case and more than 5.5 years in Paul's case. In terms of timing, we don't know exactly when they might be wheels down here in the United States. But we will be watching to see from there whether they will go on to undertake what is called PISA, which is a program for them to reintegrate into their lives after being detained, after being held in solitary confinement for months and months. So we will be watching very closely to see how these images play out. But if nothing else, Becky, this is a very historic day.",

And as we said, until we see those Americans released and into U.S. custody, the details will continue to be scant.

So unusually, perhaps; the Russians are maintaining the line on this. They're not briefing behind the scenes or I'm not aware of it. And on the other hand, here there are others. That are the Turks, the United States are to some extent as well. Now I don't know what that really says, except that this is a deal that is being taken extremely seriously, of course, everywhere, but in Russia as well. It's been the culmination of months if not years of very painful negotiations between Washington and Moscow. And I think that talks to some of the timing as well. The fact that there's a U.S. presidency -- a presidential election on horizon. A new president is going to be in place in the White House. Neither the White House nor the Kremlin wanted to have to rehash this deal. And they have seem to have both taken this chance to get their nationals back.",

And these negotiations between the security services are very fragile. They're very delicate. A new president in the U.S. may not, may not see it in the same way. I mean, who knows?

Now, Donald Trump had said that he was going to be the one to bring Evan Gershkovich and Paul Whelan and others home. And it's fascinating that Moscow either isn't so convinced he'll win or decided not to wait until a possible Trump victory to do this. And I started thinking about, OK, how is Trump going to attack this later, once the exchange is done? If the U.S. had been letting go someone from its prison, a spy and assassin, as reportedly will be let go from a German prison for this swap, to go back to Russia, well, that's going to be harder for the former president to attack. And it could be that the German government said to Moscow, we'll do this for the Biden administration. We're not going to (INAUDIBLE).",

But when you look at the guy in charge of the negotiating team, the hostage envoy, Roger Carstens and his team, Roger was put in charge of this portfolio under Mike Pompeo's State Department, under the Trump administration. He stayed in the job because he's a U.S. Army Green Beret. He is apolitical. He's been all about this job. And he and his team, I know Roger has a big family. He and his team have lived this, not for months, for years of being away from their own families to try to get these incarcerated -- unfairly incarcerated Americans back home. And Roger being a Green Beret, I can't help but think about the Green Berets' motto is \"De Oppresso Liber.\" Forgive me if I butchered the Latin there.

That's who had been reported as the hoped-for transfers in this exchange. Now Alsu had been just doing her job, reporting on Radio Free Europe but reporting the kind of news that is illegal to say out loud in Russia, calling it like the \"illegal Russian invasion of Ukraine.\" And she went home to visit a sick relative and was arrested and her passports confiscated. Paul Whelan has been incarcerated for much longer. The former U.S. Marine held something like five years. His brother and sister have been keeping a network of reporters informed on every step of his case. And I know that in addition to his brother and sister up in Canada who are eager for him to come back, I think there's at least one dog at home, that is Paul's dog, that has been waiting. So just lots and lots of good news. And of course, there are a lot of people in \"The Wall Street Journal\" newsroom and other newsrooms who shaved their heads in solidarity with Evan, who got his head shaved. What was Evan doing? He had gone to a Russian industrial military town and, of course, at the time, we were all trying to figure out, what is the capacity of the Russian military complex to ramp up, to keep up with what Europe was supplying to Ukraine? The question was, can Russia supply its own troops in this back-and-forth war? And Russia -- and Evan was asking the kind of questions any one of us presumably would have been asking in that town when he was arrested for doing his job.",

That is a story that we have been covering for you now for some hours. Beginning now to get the detail on this, the 26 people included, 24 adults and two children, according to a Turkish security source. Among the individuals transported to Turkiye by total of seven planes:  two from the U.S., Evan Gershkovich and Paul Whelan, of course; two from the U.S., one each from Germany, Poland, Slovenia, Norway and Russia. Ten people, including two kids, were transferred to the Russian side, 13 to Germany and three to the U.S. according to the Turkish presidency. The details are just coming in here. Let's get some diplomatic expertise now. Nigel Gould-Davies is a Senior Fellow for Russia and Eurasia at the  International Institute for Strategic Studies. He's joining us now from London. Detail coming in; it sounds as if this is a completed exchange. Tell us, what's your initial reaction to the news that we are just reporting? NIGEL GOULD-DAVIES, SENIOR FELLOW FOR RUSSIA AND EURASIA, INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR STRATEGIC STUDIES: It's very striking and very significant. It's a complex exchange. I think it's important to be precise about the words we use here, described as a prisoner exchange and loosely that's right. But in fact, it's Russian intelligence operatives and spies, who have been rightfully detained, being returned to Russia. And in the case of those going the other direction, they are people who have committed no crime, other than to speak and write freely. And they are not all non-Russian citizens returned to their own lands. There are plenty of Russian dissidents who are, in effect, being expelled from their country. So I think it's important to frame it like that. But this is unprecedented. As you say, the details are coming in; the numbers I've seen from Russian sources suggest that there are more people traveling out of Russia now, in this exchange, than into Russia. And that's interesting because the Russians themselves normally strict that these, in terms of numbers, these have to be parity, equal numbers or on either side. So it may well be that, in some crude sense, it's the West that has got the better part of the deal. And that raises the question, of course, why Putin has agreed to it now.",

GOULD-DAVIES:  I think it's easy at this stage to rule out hypotheses rather than to point clearly in a -- in a particular direction of causation. I doubt that it has very much to do with the recent developments in American politics and the renewed speculation about who might be president next. These deals typically take a long time to get through the works, especially one of this complexity. So it's not something that Putin has suddenly, as it were, to respond to. It's a slower burn than that. It might in some, I would have to say, misleading way, be an attempt to convey to the West that Russia is a country that, for all of the differences with the West, can be dealt with and with whom agreements can be reached. I would say that's inherently deceptive. I don't think Putin fundamentally is interested, for example, in a negotiated end to the war. But even that point about agreeing an exchange and that being an achievement, think back to what happened in 2018, when Sergei Skripal, who had been the subject of a previous exchange of this kind, was the victim -- (CROSSTALK)",

So there will be this worry that those who are being returned or sent to Western countries are potentially unsafe. The Kremlin again changed its mind and decides that it wants to eliminate that. It's them, it's done that before. So I think we shouldn't relax too much at this (INAUDIBLE).",
