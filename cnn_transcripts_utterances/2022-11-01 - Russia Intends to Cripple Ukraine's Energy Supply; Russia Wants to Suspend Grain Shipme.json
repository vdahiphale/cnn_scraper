In Kyiv, a city with a pre-war population of some three million people, the mayor says 80 percent of residents were left without water on Monday. And while power is gradually being restored, one Ukrainian energy company warns it's running out of equipment to make repairs. Ukraine's military says it was able to shoot down 45 of the 55 cruise missiles fired by Russia on Monday. But Russian President Vladimir Putin says that those strikes are not all his military can do. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz is following developments for us. She joins us live from Kyiv. Good to see you, Salma.

They are encouraging people to store water at home, they're putting in time to power cuts to try to conserve energy. They're running trains at a delayed time. Anything they can do really to conserve electricity. And the concern here is, Rosemary, is that these attacks are becoming all but inevitable. This is a clear strategy from Moscow, target civilian infrastructure, inflict greater pain across the country. Even far, from the front lines. Bringing the battle into people's homes.

Also risky for ships because at least one insurance broker ASKET under Lloyds of London has said that it will pause any new insurance writing for ships. Obviously, it's honoring existing contracts that are in place. But that really changes the calculus for shipping companies wanting to try to help get grain out of Ukraine's Black Sea ports.

Have a listen to what President Putin had to say about that.

Anything can happen after the elections. But he still has the best possibility to reach what Israelis now consider the magic number of a bear majority of 61 parliamentary seats out of 120. The average of all of his parties in the polls over the last campaign cycle has been around 59, creeping up over the 60-seat mark out of 120 seats. If that trend continues, it's not impossible that he would get 61 or even more. That would be a surprise. It would go beyond what we've seen in the polls but he does have that block. The problem is that the parties who are running against him, who want to form a coalition that he does not lead, they are not sufficiently united. So, at present, the blocks appear to be even. Those other parties representing, many of them representing the outgoing government have about 60 seats themselves. But they are not sufficiently united. That's one of the reasons the government fell apart. So, it is certainly a possible scenario. He would be going in the religious Zionist Party that you mentioned in your report which is very extremist, nationalist supremacist theocratic party.

And those are primarily the two parties if they cross the threshold representing mostly Palestinian Arab citizens of Israel.And there was a great controversy over the United Arabist joining the previous government. The other party called Hadash-Ta'al, probably nobody would invite them in. They have been taking a very hard line against joining a government, and so it's -- he wouldn't have an easy path to building a coalition. He would have to pull off some very significant and masterful negotiations in order to prize somebody away from the block of party is currently supporting Netanyahu or even individual members of one of the parties. Likud is certainly the immediate option if there are people who are willing to defect in order to join. Yet Yair lead -- yet Yair Lapid led block. The other option is that the other party in that block party of the current defense minister, outgoing defense Minister Benny Gantz, the party is called National Unity. They are claiming that even though they're only polling at around 12 to 13 seats that they would have a better chance of breaking the Netanyahu block and pulling one of the parties over, and that maybe they could form the coalition. Of course, you don't have to be the biggest party in Israel, as we know from the outgoing government. And so, all of those scenarios are on the table. There are many permutations of each scenario, and there's a great deal of uncertainty. In terms of the issues of the campaign, it's complicated because of course, Israelis are worried about cost of living, dealing with the price hikes like everybody else in the world, but they don't really distinguish between the parties based on economic themes. It's much more about, in Israel it's much more in terms of issues. It's about the Israeli Palestinian conflict and security. And we have seen serious escalations over the last number of months, that's very top of mind, including attacks and ongoing raids of Israelis and Palestinian cities and attacks on Israelis. So, all of that certainly, generally helps the right wing, pushes people to vote for more right-wing parties. But I really think that ultimately at this point, fifth election in less than four years, most people are choosing based on which block. The Netanyahu supporting block, or those who are opposed to Netanyahu. They see the same issues, but they just believe whichever side they support will resolve them better.",

And just last month, the entire city imposed this citywide lockdown, which effectively shut down all non-essential businesses affecting factory production as well.

They are walking out the streets and on the highway as well, just as the city it continues to enforce this punishing zero COVID lockdown. CNN was able to geolocate the videos. They were indeed taken in Zhengzhou, but we were not able to identify the people in these videos. But given the disturbances and given what's happening with zero COVID in Zhengzhou, what kind of impact is it having on Apple supply chain? Well, according to one analyst, it's having a significant hit. Let's bring it up for you. This is a regional based analyst who points out this, quote, \"more than 10 percent of global iPhone production capacity is currently affected as Foxconn's Zhengzhou iPhone plants suddenly entered close at production without warning.\" Now Go (Ph) adds that he believes that, Foxconn's production capacity will improve in the coming weeks, and he also adds, it will have a, quote, \"limited impact on iPhone shipments in the fourth quarter.\" Now, we've also learned in the last couple of hours that Foxconn in order to retain is now giving staff a bonus of $55 U.S. dollars a day.
