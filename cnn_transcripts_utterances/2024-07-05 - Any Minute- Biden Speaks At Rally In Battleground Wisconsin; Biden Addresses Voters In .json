And by I mean this fight, the contrast with Donald Trump. So, by -- by being energetic, that's one thing. Show he's got the energy for this, but taking it to Donald Trump nearly throughout the entire speech, other than, as you said, at the top Boris, the news of it that he wanted to get out is, I'm in this, I'm digging in, my head is down. I'm not listening to any of these calls to get out of the race. All of that was clear.Now the question becomes, does a 17-minute or 18-minute energetic speech where you are, you know, reading from prompter and taking the fight to Donald Trump in the way Democrats want to see. Does that ease the concerns? I don't know that we know the answer to that. I mean, we're going to wait for a couple of things to happen here. Obviously, this interview is happening. But I think the next two big things that we have to watch for here, the return of members of Congress to Capitol Hill next week after they've been home for the 4th of July recess, heard from a lot of Democratic constituents. And what that told them, especially the Democrats in battleground districts. And especially on the House side because the House for Democrats is actually within grasp of the majority this November. And if that is slipping away that is going to be a big, big area of concern. And then the second thing is, these battleground state polls, we've seen a lot of national polls come out since the debate. Wait for next week in the round of, you know, does Wisconsin still look like it is within grasp? Or does it look like it's slipping away? Do states like Minnesota, New Mexico, New Hampshire, Virginia, look like they're actually becoming more competitive and not being put away and the battleground map is expanding. If that is the case, too, I'm not sure these 17 minutes of a very the energetic speech giving the kind of fight that Democrats want to see will be the only thing that he and the campaign in the White House need to do to quell those concerns.",
