Kennedy Jr. that they discovered a worm inside his brain. Likely a pork tapeworm larva, according to experts. The dead parasite ate a portion of his brain before dying there. And apparently this is what caused Kennedy's memory issues at the time, according to \"The New York Times.\"I will say, we have been talking about this in the break. I don't know who wants to go first on what is going on here. But, Elliot Williams, why don't I start with you.

And it's those casual voters, it is those disaffected voters, it's a lot of young voters, it's a lot of sort of, you know, non-partisan voters who dislike both major candidates.
