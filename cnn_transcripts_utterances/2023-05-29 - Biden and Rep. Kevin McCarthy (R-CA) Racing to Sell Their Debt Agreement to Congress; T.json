Let's bring in now CNN Economics Commentator and Washington Post Opinion Columnist Catherine Rampell and former Democratic Congressman from New York Max Rose, he's also, of course, a veteran of the war in Afghanistan. He received a Purple Heart among other honors. Nice to see you both this morning.I'm going to start with you. When we look at what is happening here, and I think as Manu laid out for us, we know there is a lot of skepticism. There's a lot of angst on both sides of the aisle here. But we press people a lot and we say I need a yes or no answer. As you know all too well, and Congresswoman Jayapal actually gave Jake Tapper a one-word answer, when he said, does the president basically need to be worried here, and she said, yes, you should be worried about progressives. If the White House messaging is, hey, it could have been worse, is that really enough to convince progressives? FMR. REP. MAX ROSE (D-NY):  It will be enough for it to pass. It will not be enough to convince progressives. So, you have this incredibly fascinating dynamic right now, where Kevin McCarthy and Joe Biden and potentially also the leader of the Democratic caucus, Hakeem Jeffries, will all be working in tandem together to pass this legislation, of course, to avoid economic catastrophe, but also because it is in their political best interest. Now with this bill, the administration has certainly cemented the fact that it is absolutely, resolutely committed to bipartisanship and normalcy. And in the process, I actually think, that they have boxed the Republican Party into this really awful corner, where by now the Republican Party has to advocate for increased spending, of course, because the debt ceiling will be raised trillions of dollars and for increased social service spending now within expansion of SNAP benefits for veterans as well as the homeless. On the other hand, the Republican Party can say the Democratic Party did not get any priorities in there, and that, yes, is true as well. So, it might be the sign of a great negotiation that nobody is happy right now, but this will certainly pass and will pass because of moderates on both sides of the aisle, and they will largely do that because they do not want to be the reason for economic calamity.",

That money has a huge return on investment, both because it means better customer services and taxpayers are happier and they're more voluntarily compliant. And it means that the IRS has the resources to go after wealthy tax cheats and corporations. So, I don't think this was a good place to cut money. In fact, it will expand deficits.That said, they did some kind of accounting gimmicks where it doesn't look like it's materially going to affect the IRS' overhaul in the near term. It will probably be more of a problem several years from now. But, again, making it easier for rich people to cheat on their taxes doesn't seem like the thing you would do if you really cared about getting deficits under control.",

First of all, Kevin McCarthy has to get over half of his own caucus to support this before it even gets to the floor, and they have not confirmed that they will do this. And that whipping process, as it's known behind the scenes, is not fact-based. This at this point will be deeply personal. The speaker wants this. The leader wants this. The -resident wants this.

I won't call them moderate, let's just say less extreme wing of that party expressing their support for this.With that being said, though, the Democratic Party, I think that in that whipping process that we're seeing right now, what people will be upset by, yes, is the policy, but they're going to be more upset, legislators will be more upset about two other things. One, did we get anything out of this at our own priorities, Democratic -- core Democratic priorities? They got victories. What did we get? But secondly, I think that there will be certain angst around giving Kevin McCarthy a win. So, they're going to want to see the Republicans show momentum around this, show that they can pass this themselves or come somewhat close to it before Democrats start raising their hands and saying that they'll go about doing this. And, of course, last to conclude, there's going to be folks that want to turn this into a Christmas tree as well. I certainly wouldn't rule out some people thinking about amendments. How can I get my little appropriation assorted with that? You'll see a lot of that over the coming days.",

So, clearly, Paxton here kind of covering himself in the work that he's been doing of going against the Biden administration to try to win political capital here in this state.

And it comes as CNN teams on the ground heard several explosions in Kyiv overnight.Now, these Russian attacks also come as Ukraine nears the launch of this long awaited counteroffensive we've been talking about. One of Ukraine's top generals recently posted this highly produced video. It shows Ukrainian troops preparing for battle and ends with troops chanting a message that calls for victory for a decisive offensive. Joining us now with more, retired U.S. Army Major Mike Lyons. Good to see you, as always. So, when we talk about this, what would this potential counteroffensive at this point, what would it look like? MAJOR MIKE LYONS (RET.), U.S. ARMY:  Yes. Just see it, look at the map. You can see Russian forces in two separate locations. I believe any counteroffensive is going to cut these Russian forces in half here and threaten Crimea. I think that is the issue here for the Ukrainian forces. But they're not going to do that until they have the combined arms, the shock effect, the tanks, helicopters, Bradley Fighting vehicles, more men, more equipment.
