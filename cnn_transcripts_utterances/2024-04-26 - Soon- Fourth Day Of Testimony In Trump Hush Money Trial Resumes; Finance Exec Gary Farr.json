But unlike Pecker, she was on the stand for just a very short time. And now, we are waiting to see who the next witness is going to be. My panel is joining us now to discuss the latest developments from inside the courtroom. And Laura did both sides seem to accomplish what they were trying to accomplish? At least so far today?",

Every person is not going to prove your entire case and every witness not going to give you that either that Perry Mason moment or that blockbuster, who ordered the code red that people might think happens in courtrooms, but doesn't actually happen in courtrooms.The purpose of this witness, it seemed was to introduce documents. To demonstrate that he did not use e-mail. Maybe that was used by the prosecution to suggest that there'll be other witnesses you have to rely on. For the information you seek. Also, that Stormy Daniels had been in Trump Tower before he ran for the presidency and announced his election. And that there was also contact information for both Karen McDougal and Stormy. Now, they don't have to actually prove as the prosecutors and there was ever any sexual liaisons or an affair, but what they do have to prove is a way to buttress the credibility of their other witnesses. Now, on the other side for the defense, their goal seemed to be, look, recognize this is a friendly witness to you. Don't have to unduly cross examine this person, demonstrate and humanize Donald Trump. She did just that, talking about him as being a respectful boss, as somebody who affected her intelligence, who is often fair and decent, and her role how close she was, she was so close this person for 34 years. When it was time for his inauguration, she was on the platform. That's how close she was to him, and think they have all accomplished that. But on the other side of this, if you're the prosecution in this case, and you think you're going to call a witness at the end of the day and say, all right, Your Honor, I think, hate to start the next witness here. And judge is like, who is your next witness? Prosecutors, you said, you called ready? Let's go. Who is next?",

If the judge had gone through every one of these prospective jurors who raised their hands and said they couldn't be fair to Donald Trump.And he questioned each one of them individually, which he was allowed to do to try to rehabilitate them and get them to give an honest answer that they could be fair on a jury. That could have added weeks to the trial. I think he's moving it along, and a lot of it really is on the judge. Now, setting aside that the judge has not ruled on this gag order, which is a sort of looming question over the trial. It is -- you know, it -- nothing is abnormal here. The idea of David Pecker testifying for 10 hours, but Rhona Graff testifying for what was it? 20 or 30 minutes is also not alarming based on what you wish to get at least two witnesses. One was a critical fact witness talking about firsthand interactions with the defendant, another one came in to get a couple of documents into evidence and get out of there. And that's it.",

She's valuable because -- potentially, because of those documents. She -- did see Stormy Daniels out there in the in the waiting room? So, I think we just have to see what the calendar shows.

We're getting these great updates from our colleagues in the courtroom. There is a few different things he could be testifying about. He could be testifying about payments made to Stormy Daniels. We also know that Michael Cohen, he had to borrow against his home to pay Stormy Daniels. So, that could also be why he has been called to the stand.

Carolyn, thank you so much for being with us. So, the first two witnesses have wrapped, both of them fairly close to Donald Trump: David Pecker, a longtime friend, assisted him with this catch and kill stories of the National Enquirer.

So, if you're trying to demonize Donald Trump, and make him seem like he is guilty, you might not want to close with witnesses, who have a long-term positive relationship. And so, you know, even if you just look at Rhona Graff, who worked for him for 34 years, that's almost an unheard-of amount of loyalty that one person can give to another. If you think about most marriages, that's a really long time. And so, they might be worried that her positive feelings for Trump are going to eke out.

He, as predicted will use the courthouse steps any chance he get as a -- you know, campaign platform.But I don't think it's going well for Trump, I think the evidence seems to be very strong, what does one juror decide can make a difference. But this isn't helpful for Trump's reelection campaign, Wolf. You know, even if it affects -- if a guilty plea comes in, he may -- he's not going to go to jail, he might have to, you know, it will be appeal until after the election. But it's a big dent, I think. And it just shows you, I think the whole trial, it's just -- it's sort of a can of worms.

He may get a bounce out of Milwaukee on July 15th. Trump, even if he is convicted, and he'll be played the martyr, but in the end, anybody who is sitting in the middles, you know, they are saying, that this guy just can't be back yet.

But it is amazing how well he learned the sleazy side of American tabloid industry. His whole life, he became big in the 80s. Trump, you know, became a household name and it's always been one scam after another. But this time, the interference with an election, hush money payments, it's not about the money of $130,000. And it's not the fact that they were adult film stars. It's just the amount of sleaze that comes out of the man from Mar-a-Lago. It's hard to compare it to any other president in American history.
