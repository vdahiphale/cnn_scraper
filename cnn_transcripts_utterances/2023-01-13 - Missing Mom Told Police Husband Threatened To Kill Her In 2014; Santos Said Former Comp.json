That's where she was living at the time before she got married.Apparently, in terms of what is outlined in those -- in this report, she told police that Brian Walshe allegedly, quote, made a statement over the telephone that he was going to kill her and her friend, of course, making that type of threat is a felony, but he was never charged. And the reason for that is on the report as well guys, it basically says that Walshe was never charged because according to the incident report, quote, the victim refused to cooperate in the prosecution. So certainly this is another disturbing piece to this puzzle. Meanwhile, we were out here last night in this very same spot where the community got together here in Cohasset. They held a vigil for Ana Walshe. And as you can imagine, so many of the people have basically stopped watching the news. There have been so many horrific details surrounding this case. They've been tuning it out. And what they've been telling us is their focus right now is on the welfare of her three children. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
