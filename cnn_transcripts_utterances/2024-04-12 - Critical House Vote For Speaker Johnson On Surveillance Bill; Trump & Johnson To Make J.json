The FBI wants it to pass because they say America is absolutely unsafe from foreign threats without it. House Speaker Mike Johnson wants it to pass to avoid another embarrassing failure and try to keep his job.Important context here. This same vote failed just 48 hours ago after Donald Trump on Truth Social told lawmakers to kill it. But now another vote is about to be underway and after that, the House Speaker will hop on a plane to Mar-a-Lago to proverbially kiss the ring on the first tightly gripping the Republican Party. That is, of course, Donald Trump, as he fights to keep his gavel. And the confusion doesn't stop there. Once in Mar-a-Lago, Trump and Johnson are set to make joint remarks about something else -- the upcoming election. More important context, Trump led a failed effort to overturn results of the last election and Johnson tried to help him. CNN's Alayna Treene has brand new details this morning about what is going to happen at that Florida event. But, first, let's get to Lauren Fox on Capitol Hill.

The next one is the one that we care about. That is because it is the vote to pass what is known as the rule up here on Capitol Hill. This is the vote that failed just 48 hours ago with 19 hardliners voting against it.Now, we do not know if this is going to actually get them to pass and if this is going to get them to the debate, but we do know that there are many members who voted against the rule last time who are now saying that they are comfortable with the changes that have been made to this bill. The key change is that instead of this being a five-year reauthorization of the Federal Intelligence Surveillance Act, it is now a two-year reauthorization. The reason? A lot of hardliners believe that if Donald Trump wins in November, he will then be the president and can make his own changes to this bill that he wants to see. That is exactly why many hardliners are saying that they are comfortable with it this morning. But again, when it comes to these rules votes, we have seen before them fall apart on the House floor seven times in this Congress alone. So we're just going to have to keep a very close eye. Sara?",

Also, CNN political commentator and former communications director for Vice President Kamala Harris, Jamal Simmons. So, Jamal, let me start with you. She is going to say Donald Trump did this.

I remember her anger really about this and the way she questioned the staff and really wanted to get her lawyers to figure out what all these -- what this judgment meant and what it was going to mean for people. And so going down there is a continuation of two years from this vice president to talk about the real impact of Donald Trump removing the right to abortion for women and what it's had -- the impact it's had on women, whether they're being pursued for having miscarriages by legal authorities or they're being denied access to abortion care, even 10-year-old victims.

Right now, we're talking about inflation and some of the questions on the economy. We remember in 2022, everyone was looking at the economy and saying Democrats are missing the ball by not talking about the economy enough.What we found in the White House was that there was a cohort of voters who, while they were concerned about the economy, they were also concerned about the state of our democracy and what was happening in terms of how we were going to deny or keep the January 6 protesters at bay. And at the same time, they were concerned about abortion and how they were going to protect the right to abortion care for women and the men who care about them. And so I think we talked about that. The vice president talked about that throughout the fall. And what you saw was that Democrats did well in those elections and that Democrats and the pro-abortion position has won every time it was on the ballot. So in states like Arizona, where you're going to see that on the ballot again, it puts the president in the game in a way just to be raw political about it. It puts them in the game in a way that maybe he was a little sliding a few weeks ago.",

I think most of those criticisms have been very fair.But you have to then be consistent. Regardless of what the amounts are, they've been engaging in some of the same activity that they've criticized Donald Trump for. And if we're going to be consistent, again, not always rewarded in 2024 in American politics, then you can't -- if you're in a glass house, you can't throw stones. And, look, \"Glass Houses\" is my least favorite Billy Joel album, and they're all actually my least favorite. But it's very true that if you're building that glass house, you can't throw stones, and this is a problem for the Democrats as we go into Trump trials and questions about the RNC funding.

Now, at this point, it's quite obvious that he's in a position where he can't possibly stay on Trump's legal team, really, in any manner whatsoever, because he's not just a witness, he's a critical witness.
