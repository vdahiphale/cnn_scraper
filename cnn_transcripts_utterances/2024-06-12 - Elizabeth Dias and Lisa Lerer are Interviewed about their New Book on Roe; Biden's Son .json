Majority Leader Chuck Schumer calling on his Republican colleagues to pass this IVF bill. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): Protecting IVF should be one of the easiest votes the Senate has taken all year. The vast majority of senators should agree that strengthening treatments that help people start a family is a good thing. In no way shape or form is protecting IVF a show vote.

They are the authors of the new book, \"The Fall of Roe and The Rise of a New America.\"Good morning to both of you. Thank you so much for being here. And we'll let Kate and Matt ask some questions as well because this, obviously, is a conversation that the country is now having with itself, what - how is the nation going to look in the wake of the fall of Roe? And we are learning kind of every day the new implications that come out of it. Talk a little bit about how you came to write this because you really, I think, set out to answer the question, how was it that Roe fell? What did you learn in the course of reporting this that helps us understand what's going on now? ELIZABETH DIAS, CO-AUTHOR, \"THE FALL OF ROE\": Sure. We felt it was really important to create a narrative of just what even happened, especially over the last ten years, because there hadn't really been one, right? This is an issue that's pretty polemical. And instead of just looking at that side of it, we needed to know, what are the facts, because you can't understand where we're going. And now we're talking about IVF, all kinds of issues that the - we had not talked about really publicly in campaigns before.

It's simultaneously a family tragedy, but also sort of a love story too in which, you know, and in the room, you know, the jury barely - barely deliberated at all. It was like three hours and they came back with a guilty verdict. It was so short that actually much of the family wasn't even there for the actual reading of the guilty verdict. It was just Jimmy Biden, the president's brother, and - and his wife. Jill Biden was not there. Val Biden was not there. She hurried in basically right after the guilty verdict had been read. And basically the first lady came up and then went straight to the witness holding room and then went to Hunter and then, obviously, exited with him, holding his hand.Hunter Biden, when he heard the verdict, you know, he basically didn't move. He was like just a still portrait. And then right afterward, he just nodded his head three times as if, OK, let's move forward. He hugged his lawyers. He kissed his wife. And then just said, let's get on with it, the next thing. And there's plenty of next things to go. Beyond appeals, which are definitely going to come, potentially on Second Amendment grounds. You also have another trial that, honestly, as messy as this one was, this one - the next one might be messier because when you're talking - dealing with a tax case, you're dealing with everything he was spending money on.",

And Hunter didn't want to be a reason that he didn't run for president. So, there was a lot of - you know, Alex called it a love story. There's, you know, there was a lot of mutual love there between the two of them. Both of them kind of looking out for each other personally and wanting the other - you know, wanting to do what was right for the other. So there's, you know, there are a lot of complicated feelings there, but, you know, at its core, a lot of love and a lot of respect. It is also incredibly difficult and challenging for the president, as it is for - I mean I think any American who has a family member who's struggled with addiction, it is a constant cloud that can hang over you. And, obviously, the president is enormously proud of how far Hunter has come and how he's fought to get to where he is today and, you know, protecting and preserving that progress that Hunter's made is really important to the Biden family. ZOLAN KANO-YOUNGS, WHITE HOUSE REPORTER, \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\": And we know today, in his story as well, that the president does still fully believed that Hunter can continue on this - on his road to - for recovery. But at the same time, given all the events going on, he is concerned about what the future holds for his son as well. I think that it's interesting that also you're seeing - and that's evident also in just the movement of the president yesterday. You saw him change his scheduled to go to Wilmington. You saw those images as well of him stepping off the plane, immediately embracing his son.

It's unlikely that this gun thing could lead, even though there's a potential for 25 years, it's likely not to hit that.
