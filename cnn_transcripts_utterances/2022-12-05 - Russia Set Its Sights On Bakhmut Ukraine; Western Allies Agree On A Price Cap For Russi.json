Why Bakhmut matters so much to Moscow. Then western allies have landed on a price cap for Russian oil. But is the price low enough to drain the Kremlin's war chest? And Iran may be reviewing its own mandatory hijab laws. They're part of what sparked weeks -- if you remember, protests. But brave demonstrators want much more from the regime now. But first, tonight, Moscow is beginning this week with deadly airstrikes on Ukraine. Have a look at this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) (SIREN BLARING) (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Several regions are reporting losses of power as well as water supplies. The Russian attack struck civilian targets as well, at least, two people were killed in Zaporizhzhia and at least one person in Kryvyi Rih. Ukrainian Intelligence officials believe Russia's stock of precision missiles have plunged to critical levels, but they say there's still enough for Russia to continue to do some serious damage. Meanwhile, as Moscow throws its military might into the battle for the eastern city of Bakhmut, Ukraine's defenders include some Russians. Our Sam Kiley spoke to some of them. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Caesar(ph) is Russian. He's taking a break at a monastery from fighting Russians in nearby Bakhmut. It's a relief from scenes like this. Bakhmut Ukrainian field hospital. He's been defending this Ukrainian town from Russia's most intense assault along an 800-mile front. (GUNFIRE) Artillery duels and trench warfare have almost destroyed Bakhmut. As Russia throws its army at a bid for victory. After months of defeat to the north and south. \"Defending Bakhmut against Russian motherland is a religious imperative for Caesar(ph). \"The fighting is very brutal now\", he says. \"There are very few prisoners.\" (on camera):  And when you see those Russians in your gun sites, what do you think and what do you feel? UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  I believe that these people who have broken the law of man and the law of God, I have no pity for them.

Sixty dollars is part of a calculation that means that they estimate that it will have some limited impacts on Russia's revenue. Some estimates of Russia's euros, crude, put it slightly above 60, others put it slightly below. There are other grades of crude that are parading above that. So they should see some impact but not enough the West calculates that Russia will swiftly retaliate, cut exports to countries as it has promised to do so, and cut production, which would of course, cause oil to come off the market and send prices higher. And whether or not Russia retaliates is still in question. The Kremlin had some pretty strong words on this today, said that they again would not do business with countries that are participating in the cap, and said they are preparing a response. So this is the wild card right now, Isa, this is why there's been some uncertainty in the oil markets today. Is that there isn't any sort of certainty around what Russia will do, next.

It's inflated and important for Russia because of course, it's said to cut back on its gas exports because of the retaliation measures that it's taken against Europe. The economy is shrinking, which means their tax revenues are down. So, oil is more important than ever. So, for them to do that is pretty serious.

Incumbent Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock andRepublican challenger Herschel Walker face off Tuesday after neither candidate secured more than 50 percent of the vote in the November 8th general election. Stakes are high, and as Democrats hope to win an outright majority instead of the current 50-50 split. Nearly 2 million Georgians have already cast early ballots. Our U.S. national correspondent Dianne Gallagher joins me now with a view from Georgia. Dianne, great to see you. So, early voting, I believe, was pretty massive. What's happening on the final day of campaigning? DIANNE GALLAGHER, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, look, Isa, it's not just the final day. We're talking about the final hours of this campaign here. And both candidates are out on the trail, trying to get advance, basically, anybody who hasn't already cast their ballot to go and do so on Tuesday. Now, we were at an event with the incumbent Senator Raphael Warnock, the Democrat, just a few moments ago just wrapping up at a university here in Atlanta, Georgia. Talking to college students, trying to convince young voters to make sure that their voices are heard. He's done quite a bit of reach out to young voters during this four-week runoff campaign. You mentioned early voting, we're talking about 1.85 million Georgians who have already cast their ballots in this race. And look, when we look at those numbers, about one-third of those ballots come from black voters. According to a CNN poll of likely black voters. They prefer Raphael Warnock to his competitor, Republican Herschel Walker, 96 percent to 3 percent. And I can tell you that the senator has tried to tell his supporters not to dance before they're in the end zone. Essentially, don't celebrate before election night and we have the results here. But his campaign does seem to be feeling good, and does seem to feel that the momentum is on their side going into election night. Now, we've talked pretty at length about the differences between these two campaigns on this four-week period. The Republican Herschel Walker who has had scandals swirling around him, but still managed to push the incumbent into a runoff. He took a very light schedule, not a whole lot of events, that changed today, he's hitting five different locations in an attempt to sort of barnstorm areas of Georgia where he underperformed other Republicans during the general election. He's also getting the form of a helping hand from former President Donald Trump, in a telephone rally tonight. The former president not coming here to campaign in person. Republicans telling CNN that they thought that was actually a good idea because there's some controversy of course, even within the Republican Party. But Herschel Walker handpicked by Trump to run, and has still stood by him the entire time. We expect to get those election results tomorrow to know whether the Democrats will gain that true majority in the Senate or Republicans will keep it 50-50.",

And so, they've taken some of these often bizarre stories that he will tell and use them in ads, quoted them to try and make him seem as if he's out of touch, sometimes even with reality. Now, I will say that the Walker campaign has said, look, he is -- he is not a politician. He's just a plainspoken man who's telling stories. This is how he's always talked through these analogies, through these metaphors. And they say that's what he was doing there, trying to talk about politicians. But it has been an effective campaign.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Ash fills the skies in Indonesia, forming a thick caustic cloud over Mount Semeru on the island of Java. Video from the country's Ministry of Environment and Forestry captured the explosive eruption on Saturday. A burst of ash shooting 15 kilometers into the sky. A sign for people living in the volcano's shadow it's time to go. This van, escaping on a motorbike, the ash caking on his face. He says he doesn't know where he's going, just somewhere out of the volcano's reach. Authorities say nearly 2,000 people have been evacuated from the slopes of the volcano, which is located about 800 kilometers southeast of Jakarta. The roads in the area packed with vehicles, rushing to outrun the volcanic ash that is still raining down. Emergency workers are directing people out of the danger zone, handing out masks and urging them to go to shelters.
