I have talked to others who say they have seen that as well with babies, but they are still finding bodies.And I will say also one significant thing is, when they found those bodies last night, if that mother and her five-year-old son, and you can only imagine them preserved for eternity huddled together, burnt to a crisp, as horrific as that is, they were not included in the hostage number before. Because when those bodies were found, they did not decrease the hostage number, which may indicate that Israel has a greater visibility on who really is a hostage than many are aware of, because they weren't counting those people as possible hostages. They were not. And, obviously, now they have confirmed two more deaths in this horrific massacre. And this comes as President Biden is set to deliver a primetime Oval Office address tonight, pushing for continued funding. And it is not just for Israel, it is also for Ukraine, where that war wages on as we speak. The president expected to make the argument that supporting both countries is a deep matter of U.S. national security when the world is at an inflection point.

But there is a big question about how Congress will decide to proceed with this. And the president will be delivering this primetime address in the Oval Office, a rare evening Oval Office remarks, fresh off his trip to Israel.Part of the goal during that trip was trying to learn more about the needs Israel will need as they plan their fight against Hamas. And the president is expected to make a direct pitch to the American people about why it's important to not just offer support to Israel but also to Ukraine. One administration official saying the president will make the arguments that the cost of inaction and the cost of walking away is much higher. Now, it comes as sources have told us that the president is expected to ask Congress for about $100 billion in funding for Israel, Ukraine and other matters as well. And it comes as we have seen polls that have shown that there is large sympathy for the Israeli people as they are reeling from this attack by Hamas and planning their ongoing fights. There's also polling that shows that nearly a third of Americans believe that the U.S. is providing the right amount of assistance to Israel at this time, 36 percent saying that they're unsure. Now, while that poll doesn't exactly address the issue of funding, there has been bipartisan support up on Capitol Hill for ensuring that Israel has support going forward. The U.S. already provides about $4 billion a year over a ten-year period based on a previous memorandum. But then there's the question of Ukraine, which has a much higher uphill battle it is facing in Congress. The majority of Americans, according to an August poll, believe that Congress should not authorize more aid to Ukraine. But the president, while his trip to Israel largely had focused on trying to rally worldwide support, showing that the U.S. will long-term support Israel, today he faces the task of trying to convince the American public to not just support Israel but also Ukraine as these two fights could go on for quite some time.",

And so when you can back up not just what the facts are and then show how you got those facts, it really does help. And so for members of the Senate to receive that much of an in-depth briefing, what was very, very helpful, they don't want to tell the world how we get our information because then that jeopardizes our ability to get that information in the future.

It's consistent with the way that the House and the Senate feel as well. And so in that respect, we are sending a message to the Israelis and to the rest of the world that we will stand by our allies. That was a very important item to achieve.The second piece on this and the part that we wish we could do a better job of is to send the message to Iran that we will hold them accountable when the people that they are funding, the people that they are helping to get the supplies, the weapons and so forth, and the training as well, that we will hold them accountable as well when these terrorist groups attack and kill innocent people around the world. And I hope that that is part of the message that the president sends, that we understand that while this attack that there is evidence that Iran did not know specifically the timing of it or the exact planning of it, that they are still going to be held accountable for what they have done to create this terrorist network and other terrorist networks throughout the Middle East.",

And the House was designed by our founding fathers to be emotional, to express the anger, the concerns of a country at the very moment. You see that going on right now as those folks over there are angry with what's going on in the world, they're angry with what's going on with the economy here in the United States. It is reflective of the frustration that they feel. The founding fathers recognized that but they expected the Senate to work through the issues to find common ground and to be that steady force. And, hopefully, we will be. We will provide the resources necessary for Israel. We will provide the resources necessary for Ukraine.
