I'm Erin Burnett tonight live from Milwaukee with an exclusive interview with the president of the United States.In an extensive one-on-one, we talked about the war in Gaza. And, for the first time, in his most uncertain terms, the president of the United States lays out conditions on American aid to Israel, connecting it directly to what is happening in Rafah right now. We also talked about his rematch with Trump, Biden telling me -- quote -- \"I promise you he won't\" when he talks about Trump accepting the outcome of the upcoming election. And we talked about the number one issue for voters, and that is the economy. It's why we're here in Milwaukee, the must-win state of Wisconsin, and President Biden today announcing Microsoft's $3.3 billion plan to build a new A.I. data center here. It's 100,000 potential new jobs, jobs the Biden administration wants to tout on the exact same land where Trump made one of his biggest job announcements of his presidency. Those jobs did not pan out. And now Biden tonight is saying he can do what Trump failed to do. Here's our exclusive interview with the president of the United States. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

And you're aware of many of these, of course. The cost of buying a home in the United States is double what it was, when you look at your monthly costs, from before the pandemic. Real income, when you account for inflation, is actually down since you took office, economic growth last week far short of expectations.

We have made -- we're in a situation where people have access to good-paying jobs. And the last I saw, the combination of the inflation, the cost of inflation and all those things, that's really worrisome to people, with good reason. That's why I'm working very hard to bring the cost of rentals down, to increase the number of homes that are available. But let me say it this way.

She gave. Prosecutors are first- hand account out of what was worth $130,000, right, after \"Access Hollywood\" tape before the election. What exactly happened that Trump would want to hide? She also undercut one of the defenses saying that, look, he really wasn't interested in protecting his family. But what they're going to be focused on tomorrow is the fact that you've raised the possibility multiple times that this alleged encounter wasn't consensual, and, Erin, and they're upset about that because that is not what she has said historically though in her new documentary, she did compare this alleged encounter with Trump to an experience she had as a child. She is, of course, a sexual abuse survivor. So this is something they want to focus on. Now, keep saying the case does not succeed or fail on her testimony, but it really does appear that it's going to come down to Michael Cohen. So, everyone is asking how soon could we see him? Expect Stormy Daniels to wrap up tomorrow. Well hear from at least one other summary witness, someone who just gets evidenced in this week.

And the more they elicit that, that could actually be worse for him for the jurors. And then the other way in which it could backfire is right now, they might act actually having a basis to appeal. They try to even say that this should be a mistrial because of the prejudicial information that came in from Stormy Daniels because it was so salacious, et cetera.

Obviously, Trump has repeatedly denied any sexual encounter at all.So, Terri, how fine a line does the defense need to walk with its questioning, right? I mean, they don't want to admit it happened. TERRI AUSTIN, HOST AND LEGAL ANALYST, LAW &amp; CRIME NETWORK: It's going to be a very fine line that they have to walk. And I understand that they want to bring his reputation back, but what they should do is ask one question. Are you trying to say Stormy Daniels that you were raped? That's a yes or no. Move on. Then they need to focus just on credible ability and bias. And I think Necheles has already done that with the beginning of a cross- examination, where she said, you hate Donald Trump, don't you?

So he goes on social media today. He says: It's a really bad feeling to have your constitutional right to free speech, such a big part of life and our country. So unfairly taken from you, especially when all the sleazebags, low lives, and grifters that you oppose are allowed to say absolutely anything they want. It is hard to sit back and listen to lies and false statements be made against you knowing that if you respond, even the most modest fashion, you're told by a corrupt and highly conflicted judge, you'll be put in prison. So, okay, he's allowed to say whatever he wants about the judge. I'm just zoning in here, Ryan, on sleazebags, low lives and drifters that you oppose. Is that violating the gag order on witnesses?",

So he knows all about this, knew about the room said Trump would go to Riker's Island, the infamous location, if he goes to jail for violating the gag order, in a self-contained cell small space alone.

So \"The New York Times\" is reporting that Kennedy found the dead worm, parasite, after suffering from severe memory loss and mental fog. And so then he goes to several top neurologists and they see a dark spot on one of his brain scans.And according to a deposition, a couple of years later, Kennedy says a doctor in New York determined that the spot was caused by, quote, a worm that got into my brain and ate a portion of it and then died. Now, RFK Jr. responding to this report posting on social media tonight, quote, I offer to five more brain worms and still beat President Trump and President Biden in a debate, making light of the whole thing. But Professor Scott Gardner runs one of the worlds largest parasite collections at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, and he joins me now because truly, Professor Gardner, this -- this is something that has captivated people in disturbing ways. So, RFK Jr. says that the worm gotten his brain and ate a portion of it, you know? So as an expert on parasites, does that sound right to you? Is this the kind of thing that can happen?

And then it was in there for awhile and apparently from what I've heard is that it's dead now. So then it starts to calcify and kind of goes away. It doesn't really go away, but it just stays there.

And the basic life cycle goes from human to pig, human to pig, and where people get in there and the problem.Sometimes the problem is that sometimes the eggs are ingested accidentally, and then they basically burrow into your intestine and they get distributor distributed around in the blood system and end up in the brain or any other parts of your body.
