I'm Zain Asher in for Richard Quest, and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. Tonight, Kamala Harris seeks to capitalize as Barack Obama tries to help secure the US presidential race for her. The former president spoke at a rally in Pennsylvania Thursday night. He gave some of his most forceful comments to date on this election, telling Black men, listen, it's not acceptable to sit this race out. It comes as the Harris campaign tries to win over more male voters. Obama says he thinks that people don't understand what strength actually is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He's great on the campaign trail. He's still the most exciting Democrat in the party, many would argue, and that's why we see him on the trail now, not only in support of Vice President Harris, but really participating in these down ballot contests as well. But his comments specifically geared towards Black men, so before that rally, he made a surprise stop to the Pittsburgh headquarters for the campaign, and he gave this stern sort of message to Black men to get involved in the process, to not sit on the sidelines and not be susceptible to some of the sexism that we're seeing out here. And some said that that was the right moment, the right message for the moment. But others even prominent surrogates in the Harris campaign, like the American actor, Wendell Pierce said, listen, Black men do not need to be lectured to. We need to channel this message towards White women who will largely support the former president and that Black men, by and large, are going to be supporting Vice President Harris, even though Republicans are making incremental gains -- Zain.",

But the other part of it is, I think we're in a different time, and Donald Trump would use those opportunities when she was pointing to her race and gender, he would use those opportunities to cause her problems, to attack her. We all know, he doesn't have any filters. He will say anything. He will do anything.

And it turned out, the good studies that were done of that showed very clearly that they told people they were voting for the Black candidate, but they got into that polling place and just couldn't manage to pull down that lever. So there's some of it. It's less certainly than it was in the 70s and 80s and 90s, but it's still there. Now how much of it there is, is open to debate. I tend to think that Trump is probably going to do one to two points better than he is polling. A number of pollsters that I check in with think that's a pretty good guess that they've done as much as they can to get blood out of a turnip, that is to convince people to tell them the truth about who they're going to vote for and they adjust the numbers, they weight it for new variables, like, do they live in a rural area where Trump tends to do very, very well? So they're doing what they can, but they still don't have it. They don't have it perfect. And you know what? They never will.

I was just in one in San Francisco a few weeks ago. So these cybercabs from Tesla, they look very cool. They have no steering wheel. You don't need a gas pedal. You don't even need to plug them in to charge them. But you know you will hear him there saying, probably it will be in production by 2026. But we don't have a sense of really, when we'll start to see these things on the road. There are going to be regulatory approvals that are needed.

And when you talk about Uber and Lyft, I think the question is too how much will consumers really feel comfortable getting in a taxi that doesn't have a steering wheel or brake pedals? You know, will consumers really feel safe rather than using a service that they know they're familiar with? Often, people want to be employing humans, and not necessarily these sort of AI-driven systems.

So if you take that into account, that's a major difference, and that plays in our industry, because we all are about retro basketball, retro football.

So we see more and more the same trends happening across the world. And that is really where we play global.
