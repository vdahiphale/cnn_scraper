And this reception that is being held at the White House is part of the tradition.President Biden and First Lady Jill Biden hosting each of the Kennedy Center honorees and celebrating their life's work. You heard the president tick through all of the achievements that they've achieved in arts and culture from George Clooney's movies to Amy Grant as a Christian singer. But he also spoke in that about some of the humanitarian work that they've done and spoke directly about their character. President Biden said that this is a truly exceptional group of nominees who embodies that phrase, we the people. Now, the president and first lady will be on hand at the Kennedy Center Honors a bit later tonight. This is the second time that they are attending the honors and this is actually the second time this week that they've had this night of glitz and glamour here at the White House. On Thursday, they hosted that same dinner for French President Emmanuel Macron, which also included people like John Baptiste, the singer who President Biden referenced in his remarks there and he -- and the president also talked about the power that music and the arts has to unite people. And that is part of why he is celebrating these honorees here at the White House tonight.",

So, there is nothing in there except basically the metal that makes this thing up and it's, you know, if it hits something, and of course, it could do a lot of damage, but there is no explosive capability here. It's just in essence, except for the fuel that's in there, it's just in essence a big impact.And that is going to create a large problem. And the key thing here is that there are so many of these that they could throw at the Ukrainians and what that does is it overwhelms the air defenses and makes it harder for the Ukrainians to discern which of the missiles they really need to knock out of the sky. These are not that important. The ones that are important are the ones with the real warheads.",

And it's very close to Kyiv, and we remember from the first part of the war that when the Russians came in to capture this area, they captured areas around here and around here. The big effort was designed to actually go in and try to take Kyiv.They were unsuccessful in doing that, but if the Russians and the Belarusians come together again and the Belarusian army becomes part of the Russian army, they could potentially open up another front and that other front could try to move against Kyiv once again. So, this is very dangerous thing. And when the Russian Defense Minister, Sergei Shoigu, met with his Belarussian counterpart, it was very clear they're trying to establish a relationship and even deepen the relationship that already exists between the two countries.

And in the college football playoff, here's what we now know, we now know who will play who on New Year's Eve. Defending champs Georgia will face Ohio State. Many were wondering who would get in between Ohio State and Alabama, but it would be the one last Buckeyes who make it there in end. Alabama will miss the playoffs for just the second time and number two Michigan will face number three TCU. The national championship will be decided January 9th in L.A. All right, let's move on to other type of football. As we mentioned, the World Cup currently in the knockout stages. Winner will go home for every match from now on and the pressure has really ratcheted up. Kylian Mbappe for France, the absolute star of the show Sunday for the (inaudible) against Poland, (inaudible) a four for the tournament for the PSD superstar. At this point, Mbappe also scored in the 2018 final in Russia against Croatia. And then before the end of '23, Mbappe, with his now tournament high fifth, that's a stunning strike, isn't it, 3-1 the final. Robert Lewandowski did tuck away a penalty for the Poles right at the end, but France gets the job done. They're through to the quarter finals where they will face the country of my homeland, England, the three lions with three different scorers in their 3-0 win over Senegal. Well, let's tip our hat to the skipper, Mr. Harry Kane scoring his first goal of this World Cup. Huge relief for him, but it's a goal, Pam, that brings his total now to 11 World Cup goals for his entire career. That's the most ever for any English player. So, really cool piece of history for Harry Kane. Heartbreak for those Senegalese fans. With that, it's right back to you, Pam.",
