Michel Martin speaks to Kimberly Teehee, the native American activist hoping to becomethe first congressional delegate for the Cherokee nation. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. The White House is publicly revealing intelligence that suggests the North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un could meet President Putin soon. The administration says Moscow is trying to drum up weapons and ammunition for its war in Ukraine. On the other hand, Putin will not be meeting with G2 partners, world leaders who are gathering this weekend at a summit in India. And it is widely expected the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, will also not attend. A stark reminder of the world's existing tensions and hardening divisions. U.S. ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel is at the center of American policy in the Indo-Pacific region. He was also at Camp David when President Biden hosted a rare gathering with leaders of Japan and South Korea last month. All designed to strengthen this alliance and deter serious challenges from China and Russia. I spoke to Ambassador Emanuel earlier from Tokyo. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

If you think, which put aside the fact that this war is anillegal illegitimate war, the entire endeavor here for Russia was to reestablish its empire, and this empire now is dependent on North Korea, it's dependent on Iran, two isolated countries, two countries that are seen as pariahs, that tells you how much of a failure this war is. Second point is both for North Korea, for Russia, also for China and Iran, they're all -- they have a genuine characteristics they share. One of economic origin, one of aggression and one of repression at home. And all three -- four countries also share characteristics people are trying to flee them. Their own people are trying to flee them. And so, I do think at a fundamental level, while not helpful, not good for the embargo and the isolation we want of Russia, Russia's attempt at building an empire is become dependent on North Korea. I think that says it all. There's not really much to add to that.",

Is it seal-proof? No. But it does mean that this has to -- you have to think about it this way, Russia had to cross a lot of psychological, political and economic kind of thresholds to get to a place they had it publicly, and they haven't yet acknowledged it, but we have done our job to expose it, that they dependent on North Korea. There's hundreds of countries in the world that this is what the Russian empire, the endeavor of this war, it has a political implication at home for Russia, for Putin, specifically, that you are now not the sponsor of North Korea, North Korea is your weapon supplier. Think of the flip of that, what that means politically, diplomatically, economically and the consequences of that. Now, it is not welcome, but it is a sign that the embargo is effective and working.",

What we have in the United States is allies and alliances, it's built on trust, built on commoninterests and more importantly, common values. This a kind of like an agreement among players that are isolated in the world. And I really do think the characteristics that define them and unite them are one of aggression, oppression and coercion. That does unite them. And it also is a telling sign, now that those characteristics unite them, that the people in their own countries. I mean, remember, think about this, Iran is literally coming up with the -- one-year anniversary where they're scared of their own people because they were killing their own people who were literally trying to stand up for freedom. You have kids fleeing both St. Petersburg, Moscow, Beijing and Shanghai. And also, in North Korea. That is a telling sign. And I think sometimes those of us in the West, included myself, you, we forget how powerful a seductive force freedom is. Now, this is not a welcome sign, this alliance, because we -- you think our embargo is having an impact on Russia's ability to wage a war, that said, it is a major, major political embarrassment for Russia to be not the sponsor of North Korea but dependent on North Korea for the military capacity.

A protection of those interests, thosevalues and working in unison and combination. And one example of that is when it came to the March 3rd vote in 2022 in the United Nations condemning Russia's invasion and illegitimate illegal invasion of Ukraine, Japan got on the phone with the ASEAN countries and helped produce eight out of 10 of the ASEAN countries to vote to condemn Russia. Four of them were co- sponsors. Cambodia was one of those country. Cambodia is actually actively involved in helping Ukraine on minesweeping. That is alliance projection. It wasn't like that 30, 40 years ago. It's a relationship also, when we say projection, when Japan decided to increase their defense budget from 1 percent to 2 percent of GDP, becoming the third largest budget with what I add is a capitol deed to deterrence, not militarily alone, diplomatically, developmentally wise, as well as in defense spending. That to me is what defines alliance projection into the region. And it's also when we we're working on the trilateral that was recently held in Camp David, that too is taking the risk, taking -- going a little farther to help project a more unified, collaborative and cooperative relationship into the region and a set of values. So, it's not just the United States the but it's the United States with the corn in the realm, its allies by its side.",

      "speaker": "EMANUEL",
      "sentences": "Well, I would make three points that are think are really, really important. Put aside and blow all the smoke aside. The politics in thisregion are pretty straightforward, from our perspective, the United States. We are a permanent Pacific power and presence, and you can bet long on America. China? We're the rising power, they're the declining power, you either get in line or you're going to get it. That's it. And China's entire -- one China's core principal strategies is that the United States and its allies cannot get on the same page and work unison. That changed fundamentally the region after Camp David because of the president's leadership. Second product of that that I think is really important is when you have trust, like President Biden has built with allies, trust also that they have in the United States and in particular, a person in the Oval Office, they won't do the bare minimum, they'll go a little farther. And that is what happened with Japan and Korea in their trust of the United States and specifically President Biden. They went farther because they changed something. And then, third, I think this is a really valid point in my view, that sometimes gets lost. I think you could agree with me that given the war in Russia -- rather in Ukraine, the first war since World War II in Europe. You have a very dark moment. You have an attempt, that I think in this particular case, where Putin is basically chasing Peter the Great and Catherine the Great in the 17th and 18th century, and he's caught by the ghost and he's caught by history in the past. The president -- we have a complicated history with Japan and Korea individually. They have a complicated history. But neither one of the leaders decided to get caught by the past, but more importantly, try to make something of the future. And in this period of darkness, I think Camp David not only is strategically important, diplomatically important, but I think it stand as a symbol of where dialogue and diplomacy can be successful rather than the war, where the future is more alluring and more seductive than were in the past gets you caught up. And I specifically say it because not only is Russia caught in the past, China this weekend, Christiane, put a map out of their view of the world and the region, specifically that Vietnam, the Philippines, India, even Russia and Brunei all complained about. So, if you're going to chase the 17th and 18th century, do it on your dime and don't involve everybody else. They have a vision of the South China Sea touches Vietnam. It touches the Philippines. They have a vision of also the border with India, island dispute with Russia, view of the South China Sea that Brunei also and others don't -- do not agree with Indonesia. Everybody complained. And it's a vision that comes from the Qing dynasty of 17th and 18th century. It's caught in the past. It is not looking at projecting for the future. And I do think that Camp David is a contrast point both on values, interest and how you proceed forward, one built on allies, alliances. And again, I want to say this, America has a complicated history with Japan. We have a complicated history with Korea. Korea and Japan have a complicated history. We did not let the historical facts and background capture or hold us captive to a different future. And one in which both diplomacy and dialogue is better than the one that you're seeing play out in Ukraine or possibly play out in the South China Sea. There is no neighbor to China right now. The Indian border, conflict. Philippines, hitting their coast guard constantly. There is no -- in the South China Sea, the resources or Korea, there is no country in the region. They haven't had -- tried to apply economic coercion or has some form of military or otherwise type of confrontation. And the map is an example of that. And that tells you one of the reasons why the countries of this region want the United States in this region, both militarily, politically, diplomatically, economically because they do not want to untether China running around, claiming areas that are not theirs.",

Post COVID, the youth led the protest. One out of three of your youth are unemployed, have given up. And their strategy is to yell at them that they don't -- are not working hard enough. And all of these economic liabilities that are now accumulating collectively in China are all the result of a policy that Xi adopted. He turned his back on the international economic system that he could have been a part of, that was successful for the last 30 years. And now, the country of China and the people of China are bearing the brunt of Xi's policies and consequences of those policies. Simple as that. What we have done, and I think the president has led that effort here in the region, is build allies and alliances in collective interest. That's -- you saw it most glaringly during the Camp David process and putting together three countries that all produce this year national security documents that are incredibly complementary about a set of ideals on freedom, rules and law, not one person's authoritarian rule and decision to use raw exercise power rather than uphold the rules-based system. China, when they were a part of international system, succeeded. China, when they turned their back on the international system, is failing, full stop.",

But they are still there. And then, this easy way to succeed in making this coup may be -- may have encouraged the people you see on your screens to do their coup. But even if it's the same trend, it's not the same really in Gabon. Gabon is a rich oil emirate and petrol state, first. Two, it's in Central Africa. There's no jihadists there. It's not about losing the control of the country. So, it's very different. And I think that the two main common points beyond this jihadist movement that threaten the Sahelian countries, you have first the easy way, the coup happened previously, encouraged this coup leaders in Gabon to do the same. And the second reason is what we just mentioned, the presence of the former French colonial power and the fact that the population is fed up with under development. And in Gabon, you know that even if it's a rich oil country, the people lives -- the majority of the people lives under the line of poverty. So, that is something that matters a lot. But it does not mean that the protesters you see celebrating the new masters of Libreville, the population supports them. In fact, they are happy to get rid of the former power, you know, because the Bongo family has been running Gabon for 56 years.",

And so, there was this small faction of Cherokee who illegally signed this treaty with the United States. The treaty which was ultimately ratified by the Senate and sign by the president of the United States at the time Andrew Jackson. And so, to the United States, it was a very valid treaty. It's one that's considered the law today, and the United States took the first steps in implementation of that treaty when they forcibly removed our people, you know, in the Trail of Tears, where a quarter of our population perished, mostly elderly and children.

It took a really long time to rebuild the nation. And Congress had a role to play here because after removal, Congress kept passing law after law dismantling the Cherokee nation, requiring allotment of our lands, taking away our ability to be governed by our own laws, even electing our own chief. It took an act of Congress to give us back that authority to elect our own principal chief for the Cherokee nations in the '70s. That's in my lifetime, and your lifetime. And so, if you took -- look back at all that happened to dismantle us and then to rebuild us and to put us in place where we could actually start focusing on other things, and so, you know, in the '70s, Congress started passing laws called self-determination laws to help tribes with the resources they need to rebuild a nation, to bring back their home lands, to provide for their citizens. So, it look like with all of that history -- but you also realize, it wasn't until the 2000s that our chief even had the legal authority to appoint a delegate.

Yes, Congress can pass a law to seat the delegate too, but we don't need the Senate to act again because it did that nearly 200 years ago. And so, we're seeking similar authorities of the delegates that you just described, the U.S. territories, which, you know, most of the delegates that we've talked to have expressed support for seating the Cherokee nation delegate. But we're seating -- we're seeking that particular authority because we do know that even though there are limitations on voting on the house floor and final passage, there is still a great deal that delegates can do through the deliberative process of the Congress and making sure that, you know, we have a seat at the table and getting laws passed that impact our communities.",

Number two is that the deliberative process of a bill becoming law is really the behind-the-scenes action of where things get done. Committee work is so important. You know, being able to introduce legislation, being able to vote in committee, being able and sit in a committee, and as those bills get deliberate rated on voted on. You know, and the reason that there's a legal distinction between a delegate and a representative of the house is that final vote on final passage. Because that final vote means that it can change whatever happened in committee or they can concur with it and move it on. And so, I think it's a very important process.

When you think about the fact that federal dollars that flow to Indiana tribes, you know, over 90, probably 95 percent of those dollars are considered discretionary dollars. It is imperative that we put a mechanism in place that allows for either forward funding to tribes or in some instances, mandatory funding to tribes so that tribes are not victimized by this process of uncertainty, you know, we're looking at that now when Congress goes back into session in September as a possible government shutdown. I mean, those impact us severely. But in addition to that, you know, like other governments, we look at our infrastructure needs, water needs, healthcare needs, education needs, farm bill needs.
