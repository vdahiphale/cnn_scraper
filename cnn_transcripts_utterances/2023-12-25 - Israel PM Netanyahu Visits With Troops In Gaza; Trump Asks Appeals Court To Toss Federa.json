Opposition leader and Chief Putin Critic Alexei Navalny has been found after simply disappearing for two weeks. The Head of his Anticorruption Foundation says to volunteer is now in a penal colony in the far reaches of Northwestern Siberia, 1000s of miles from the jail where he was last known to be. He was moved from a detention center near Moscow where he was serving a 19 year sentence. CNN's Nada Bashir following these developments for us.

But as you mentioned that this is a moment of relief for his supporters and of course his legal team after they lost contact with him a little over two weeks ago as we understand it.Now according to his spokesperson and the Director of his Anticorruption Foundation, Navalny was able to meet with his lawyer today who could confirm his location in the region of Harbin, Northwestern Siberia, some 2000 miles away from Moscow. It is in this penal colony that he is now being held after two weeks of losing contact with family members, with legal representatives and we have just a couple of hours ago received a statement from the Director of his Anticorruption Foundation. This is what he had to say about Navalny's location. He is in colony IK-3 in Kharp called Polar Wolf, one of the northern most and most remote qualities. The conditions there are harsh with a special regime in the permafrost zone. It is very difficult to get there. And there are no letter delivery systems. Now of course there will be concern around Navalny's safety, security and the conditions that he will face in this penal colony. As we've understood it in the past, he was held at a penal colony some 150 miles, east of Moscow where he had faced poor health conditions as well. So that is a point of concern. He was sentenced back in August of this year to 19 years in prison on charges related to extremism. He had already been serving charges of 11 and a half years but of course, important to underscore these are charges that he has repeatedly and consistently denied. Many of his supporters believe these are politically motivated charges because of his vocal criticism of President Vladimir Putin.",

But neither Grover Cleveland, nor Millard Fillmore, nor Theodore Roosevelt were facing constitutional challenges, nor were they under indictment for any crimes whatsoever, the time that they were seeking to return to the Oval Office.So where we are writing history as we go right now. I think - I think a lot, even on a Christmas Day, or for those that would like to wait a day, I can understand, those would like to think about the significance of all of this, I would say ask yourself, whether you think that the founders of this nation after a revolution to overturn the power of a tyrant would - would have wanted to create the possibility of having an elected absolute monarch. And the answer I know is no. So the idea that our founders and our Constitution makes it possible for a president to have an absolute immunity is a nonsense. President Trump's lawyers made the argument that in 200-year - 200 plus years, despite the motive and opportunity to do so, a no- no - no president has ever been charged for an official act. That's not true, in the sense that President Nixon had motive and opportunity to seek criminal immunity from acts that he had committed while president and he didn't and why didn't he? Because Richard Nixon, as a good lawyer understood that that's nonsense. He did, as a former president seek immunity from civil prosecution for which he got limited immunity. But during the time he was president, his lawyers never sought immunity for criminal - from criminal prosecution. They sought immunity from judicial orders. So Richard Nixon clearly had a motive and was a lawyer. And he didn't try what the Trump team is trying to do. And what Harry, the point here we made is really important. We want a united voice from the - from the court, not simply for the court's credibility. That matters, of course, but for the credibility of our Constitution. So we need to define the limits on presidential power yet again. And that needs to be done with one voice by the conduct - by our Supreme Court.",

The Prime Minister flew to Northern Gaza this morning to meet with IDF troops on the ground there. He vowed to continue the long fight as he put it against Hamas.This is his second visit to the area since the war began 11 weeks ago and it comes on the heels of one of the deadliest nights in Gaza. The Hamas-run health ministry says at least 70 people were killed after an Israeli attack on a crowded refugee camp in central Gaza. They're now reporting at least 250 people killed over the last 24 hours in central Gaza. CNN's Will Ripley is joining us now from Tel Aviv.

Well, over double that figure, more than 53,000 people have been wounded in this war. And they are wounded, many of them, most of them in a place where there are barely any functioning hospitals left.Like you can count them on two hands. That's how many functioning hospitals are left in all of Gaza right now. And they're all in the south. In the north where the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made his visit, you can see the handout images from his office meeting with the troops. In some photos, they were all together, they were smiling. They were trying to project confidence and project victory. And in a sense, they do feel like they've won the north, so to speak, because they have operational control there. And they are now confident enough that they can send in their Prime Minister and have him make a visit to that devastated area, relatively safely. But in central Gaza, and in the south, the situation is far more volatile, because the IDF, the Israeli military is now moving its operation into these areas. People who've been displaced several times already are being told they have to pack up and move again, in many cases. These are people that have nothing left other than their lives, and hopefully the lives of their families, although nearly everyone in Gaza now knows many people and has lost many people close to them. And by the way, the same situation on the West Bank, the occupied West Bank. When we were there, everybody knows somebody who is either displaced or dead. That's how close to home this is hitting for so many millions of people touched by this tragedy. The Israeli military says it will continue to fight until they eliminate Hamas, until they eliminate the risk to Israel of another attack like the horrific attack on October, the seventh. But that is going to be a very, very long road ahead because Hamas is still fighting. They're still able to launch rockets, they're still getting resources, weapons sent in from their supporters, among whom they've actually gained credibility. Hamas itself has gained credibility dramatically since the seventh of October, according to U.S. intelligence as other terrorist organizations have watched them wage this war against Israel. They've decided that Hamas is credible and they actually want to help them at the expense of the tens of thousands of lives and injuries in Gaza. Not to mention the food situation which is so dire right now according to the World Health Organization. Just listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEAN CASEY, W.H.O. EMERGENCY MEDICAL TEAMS COORDINATOR: Anybody who we speak to is hungry. There's the risk of a feminine here in Gaza actually and even here in the hospital, everybody says that they only have rice. They have very often only one meal a day and they're hungry. I went to Gaza today.
