We're saying, \"Who else should have done something about it? Was it the law enforcement? Were the parents?\" comparing, of course, with the Ethan Crumbley situation, in Michigan, where his parents are going to be tried, for involuntary manslaughter. That was a minor, though. So it's a little bit different than a 28-year-old person.

It's no stranger to that. But to see that moment, today, between Thomas Massie, and your colleague, Jamaal Bowman, I wonder what you made of that. And this idea that if Democrats could not get an assault weapons ban passed, when you had both chambers, how do you get one now passed down, with the Republicans, in control of the House? REP. PETE AGUILAR (D-CA): Well, thanks for having me, Kaitlan. As you mentioned, House Democrats did pass an assault weapons ban, last year. Unfortunately, the Senate didn't take it up. We have to keep trying. The frustration that you heard, from my colleague, Jamaal Bowman, is the frustration that all of us feel that all of us as parents feel. Jamaal was an educator, in a private life. He spent time in a classroom. He knows these issues incredibly well. And I think all of us are just deeply frustrated that Republicans have spent more time, in the House, banning books, talking about banning books, rather than making our schools safer. It's just unconscionable that this continues to happen. We clearly have a gun violence epidemic, in our schools, and in our communities. And it's just continues to be troubling. But what we learned, last year, is we have to keep trying, we have to keep working. We got the gun violence, the bipartisan bill, out of the Senate, and out of the House, and was signed into the - signed by the President. We did that after parents made their voices heard, after teachers made their voices heard, and after members of the clergy made their voices heard. That's what we need to do here, in these moments.",

This grand jury meets Mondays, Wednesdays and Thursdays, for just three hours, each of those days, when they're sitting. And this isn't the only case that they hear. So, we have seen a number of witnesses come in. There all these indications we're getting toward the end of this investigation. There was the requirement under New York law, to invite the former President, as the potential defendant in. He declined. They brought in a witness on his behalf. And then, just on Monday, they brought in David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer, in, as a rebuttal witness. But there is not, again, an immediate deadline. So, the D.A., Alvin Bragg, his office can discuss this, again, debate this. This would be the first time a former President was indicted. So, it certainly is a weighty decision, a historic decision. And at least as best, there are questions about the strength of this case. And so, it certainly is something that they are debating, not taking lightly. This is definitely a decision they don't take lightly. And they don't have an immediate deadline. But all of that said, they are meeting three more days, before they go on this break.
