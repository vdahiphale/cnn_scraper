At least 68 people were killed when the plane crashed about 18 minutes after it took off from Nepal's capital. You can see plumes of smoke billowing from the crash site. We know 72 people were on board, including children and search efforts will resume at daylight on Monday. Video also shows what appears to be the plane moments before it went down. The aircraft rolling on its side. You see right there in midair. And I want to get right to CNN's Vedika Sud who is following this for us. Vedika, any word yet on what might have caused this?",

Like you rightly said 68 bodies have been recovered, four are still missing. And as soon as there's daylight in Nepal, which would be another four hours from now, the rescue teams will be back on the site and they'll be looking for those four passengers.For now the official figure stands at 68. Nepal's prime minister has ordered a probe. We're expecting a report in the next 45 days, and I think the priority after finding those four passengers, the likelihood of them surviving this accident for now looks bleaks, will be to find the voice recording box from the cockpit because that is going to be key to this probe to understand what really went wrong. It's very important even to tell our viewers here that this Himalayan country has faced several accidents in the past, and this is essentially because most of the highest mountains are in this area. At least we have about eight of the world's 14 highest mountains in Nepal, including Mount Everest, and these air accidents usually take place due to inclement weather or because these air strips are situated in difficult to land terrains. What we're going to find out in the next few hours is whether there are any survivors. Like I said, the chances of any survivors are bleak at this moment -- Jim.",

But both now are committed. It's a grind it out type of fight. And in this one place, the Russians are more in their comfort zone.They have the Ukrainians a little bit in a -- if I may use this, a bear hug where they're close, they're tight, they're able to use artillery and all the rockets and everything else. Ukrainians are fighting tough, they're dogged, but they're forced now in a mano-and- mano fight. Ukrainians are in this window where, I think, it's pretty common knowledge they want to have a counter offensive. They have to find a way to balance this meat grinder flight, where the flower of Ukrainian youth is also being killed. Whether it comes down to the Kherson zone, a pin access or up through (INAUDIBLE), and Melitopol or up Kherson towards -- I don't know, but the Ukrainians it think are trying to buy the time and the resources to do it while bloodying the Russian forces.

We'll tell you about the remarkable recovery with the legendary Bob Costas. There he is. He's next. You're live in the CNN NEWSROOM. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [16:15:07] ACOSTA: Devastating news to tell you about out of Georgia. Devin Willock, the 20-year-old offensive lineman for the University of Georgia, was killed in a car crash. This happened overnight, just hours after the team celebrated its national championship with a victory parade. According to a statement from the university, three others were in the car, a staff member, Chandler LeCroy, who was also killed and two other teammates, we should mention were injured but are listed in stable condition at this hour. Police are now investigating the fatal crash. Willock hailed from New Milford, New Jersey, and played in every game this year. In a statement the team's head coach said in part, \"Devin was an outstanding young man in every way. He was always smiling, was a great teammate and a joy to coach.\" And we're learning now about a heartwarming encounter that Willock had with a young fan hours before the crash. Willock ran into 7-year-old UGA fan Camden Gonzalez at a restaurant last night. Camden's grandfather posted photos of meeting, thanking Willock for making his grandson feel special. You could see Willock even let Camden try on his enormous 2021 national championship ring and Camden's grandfather says Willock seemed so full of life and just happy. Buffalo Bills' safety Damar Hamlin cheering on his teammates from home as they take on the Dolphins in the playoffs. Shortly before kickoff, Hamlin tweeted, \"My heart is with my guys as they compete today, supporting from home as I focus on my recovery. Nothing I want more than to be out there with my team.\" The 24-year-old who was released from the hospital earlier this week after suffering a cardiac arrest on the field, got to hang out with the team yesterday at the Bills facility. You could see him there with a big smile. And joining me now, CNN contributor, the legendary Bob Costas. Bob, it's incredible just to see Damar Hamlin smiling and hanging with the guys in the locker room. What a remarkable turnaround.",

The rules were what they were. And Australians as a group, the citizenry, were under some rather severe lockdowns, so there was significant resentment toward Djokovic for first entering the country and then he leaves, and he also hosted some sort of what turned out to be super spreader event and was less than forthcoming about that. Now the Australian Open officials have put in effect a no booing rule, which obviously was designed to shield Djokovic.

Prior to the variants, not only did the vaccine, once they were available, not only did the vaccine in the vast, vast, vast majority of cases keep you from being hospitalized or from dying, the deaths were disproportionally and overwhelmingly among the unvaccinated.
