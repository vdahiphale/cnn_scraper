The other issue here is there's a feeling that the Kenyan police will just not be a good match for the terrain in Haiti. They don't know the area. They don't speak the language. Haitian, Creole, and French are not widely spoken here in Kenya. And so that's one aspect. And also they've not been able to stamp out low- level crime, banditry, other terrorist incidences here within Kenya.

The fertility rate is the average number of children born to a woman in her lifetime. In 1950, that number was nearly five. By 2021, it was cut in half, and by next century, researchers believe that rate will drop to 1.59 children per woman.The reasons for that, better contraception, better education, and improved employment opportunities for women. Countries need a rate of 2.1 children per woman to maintain population levels. Analysts say declining birth rates will bring serious economic, societal, and geopolitical consequences.

The \"Mirror\" says the hospital informed the palace and launched a probe into the allegations, and in a statement to CNN, the U.K.'s information commissioner's office said, we can confirm that we've received a breach report and are assessing the information provided. On Wednesday, the U.K.'s health minister, Maria Caulfield, warned that hospital staff could face prosecution. MARIA CAULFIELD, BRITISH MINISTER FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND WOMEN'S HEALTH STRATEGY: You're only allowed to access the patient notes you're caring for with their permission, and there's really strict rules. The information commissioner would take enforcement action against trusts or primary care practices, but also as individual practitioners, your regulatory body.
