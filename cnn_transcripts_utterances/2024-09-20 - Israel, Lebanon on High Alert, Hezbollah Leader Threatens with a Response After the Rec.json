The threats are raising fears of a wider regional conflict.Israel's military carried out dozens of strikes in the past 24 hours, hitting what it says were about 100 Hezbollah rocket launchers, weapons depot and other sites in southern Lebanon. Iran-backed Hezbollah said it launched at least 17 attacks on Israeli military sites in northern Israel using drones and rockets. Israeli authorities say at least eight people were hospitalized. Meanwhile, more funerals were held in Lebanon and the leader of Hezbollah made his first public comments since the pager and walkie- talkie attacks. CNN's Ben Wedeman has more from Beirut.

We also know that there's been an urgent demand for the Chinese government to better protect the lives of foreign nationals in the country. Even though violent crimes like this are rare in China, there's been a spate of stabbing attacks recently that have caused some concern. For instance, in June, we saw four American college instructors stabbed in China. Just two weeks after that, a Japanese mother and her son were also stabbed at a bus stop in China. And a Chinese bus operator who tried to intervene later died from her injuries sustained during this attack. Now, these concerns were echoed by the Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida at a press conference on Thursday, where he described this attack as, I quote, \"It was a despicable crime and a serious and grave matter.\" He goes on to say, quote, \"such an incident must never be repeated. We strongly urge the Chinese side to ensure the safety of Japanese people.\" Now, Kim, this also have to we also have to remember that this attack occurred on a very sensitive day in China, the anniversary of the 9-1- 8 incident, which is widely known in China as the beginning of the Japanese invasion of China back in 1931 on September 18th. Now, this is a day that's very fraught with tension, with grief, and with anger, and also a date that state media and the Chinese government often urges its citizens to never forget. And though we don't yet know what the motive was behind this attack, some on Chinese social media speculate that it could have been racially motivated, given the fact that it occurred, again, on such a sensitive date. But again, this moment has been very fraught for Chinese and Japanese relations, and people in both countries have been mourning this tragic loss of life. Kim.",
