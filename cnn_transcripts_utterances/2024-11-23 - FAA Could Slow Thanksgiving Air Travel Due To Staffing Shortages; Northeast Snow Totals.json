Time for millions of us to start making our moves for the Thanksgiving holiday. And the weather, well it's not exactly cooperating. The TSA is expecting over 18 million Americans to fly over the long holiday weekend and week. A record number and a notable uptick from just last year. But be forewarned between stormy weather in several states and potential air traffic control shortages in the Northeast, there could be significant airport delays. Parts of New York and Pennsylvania, by the way, have already gotten over 1 foot of snow, paralyzing traffic in some areas and leaving more than 100,000 people without power this afternoon. It's a hodgepodge of a whole lot, all the stuff that you really don't want for a holiday week. But CNN Meteorologist Allison Chinchar, she is someone we do want and we want you to bring some sunshine to this very stormy weather. Is it possible?",

Take a look at this, high point, New Jersey in the last 36 hours, picking up nearly 2 feet of snow.This system was definitely an overachiever, but other portions of Pennsylvania, New York, picking up well over 1 foot of snow. Now that system is starting to wind back down. You've got just a few lingering areas of showers, both rain and snow for portions of Massachusetts, Maine, up in New Hampshire and Vermont. The snow really kind of sticking up in the extreme heights of the White and Green Mountains there. But we mentioned a few good spots, so let's highlight those. The southeast, much of the central U.S., no travel issues whatsoever for today. The only other bad spot is going to be out west. We heard about the bomb cyclone earlier this week. That is done, but that atmospheric river is still funneling in a little bit extra moisture for today. So you're going to see that. You've still got some of these rain and snow showers pretty much up and down the Pacific Northwest and even into portions of northern and central California. We'll finally start to see a lot of that moisture begin to recede at least in the next 24 to 48 hours. But it's not done entirely. And then there's another system that comes in on Monday. So really, over the next four to five days, you're still looking at about 1 to 3 inches of rain, especially along the coastal regions and snow that's going to be measured in feet, 1 to 3 feet.",

A lot of local travelers, people that are going to wait till the holiday itself before they get out. The big issues here are going to stretch safe from interior New York all the way back down to East Texas. That's where you're going to have the biggest concern, especially with rain showers. So then that begs the question. What about the Macy's Day Parade? A lot of folks either go to it or watch it at home.This would be a good one. Maybe to just stay bundled up on your couch at home. There is a chance of showers. We are expecting rain in New York City, especially the back half of the day Thursday. So those first couple hours may be dry, but it's the latter few hours of the morning where we may have a few light showers that get mixed in. Regardless, Fred, the temperatures alone in the upper 30s at best, probably not enough to convince someone like me to actually attend",

      "sentences": "Yes, that was one of the biggest roles that we had been waiting for a long time for Donald Trump to announce, Fred, especially because we had been hearing already two weeks ago that Donald Trump was leaning toward the hedge fund manager Scott Bessent to leave the Treasury Department. However, behind the scenes then, really we saw one of the biggest fights play out in this transition process so far at Mar-a-Lago over this role. We know that Howard Lutnick, one of Donald Trump's co- transition chairs, had really kind of had this contentious back and forth about whether Bessent was right for the role.And he was also pushing himself for that role as well. We know that Lutnick ended up becoming the Secretary of Commerce. But, look, I will add as well that this is going to be a huge job for Bessent. We know that Donald Trump over the entire campaign trail and in the lead up to the November 5th election, talked a lot about the economy and his economic promises. One thing in particular I think to keep an eye on is tariffs. We know that Donald Trump has vowed to impose widespread tariffs on imports. He also has talked a lot about wanting to lower inflation, about wanting to deliver better mortgage rates for Americans. These are all things that Bessent is going to be tasked with carrying out as the head of the Treasury Department. This is really where Donald Trump's economic policy is going to stem from. That's partly why it took Donald Trump such a long time to come to this decision and why it was such, in his mind, a big decision for him to make. Now, one other thing as well that I will tell you is that Donald Trump over the last week had expanded his list when it came to Treasury decisions and the candidates that he was going to be talking to. We know that even as late as Wednesday, Donald Trump had interviewed two different people for that role. He was still kind of contemplating who he thought would be the best pick. But with Bessent, I will say as well that many people in Donald Trump's orbit, those working on the transition with him, they had really been pushing for Bessent. They thought that he would be right for this role. One, he is a big business name. A lot of people on Wall Street like him. They also believe that he should have an easy time getting through his confirmation process. We saw many senators, Republican senators, I should say, last night applauding Donald Trump's choice So, we're moving forward now with this latest pick, one that I know Donald Trump is, I was told, happy to get off his plate.",

It kind of gave me flashbacks to when he was office under his first administration. He had those Friday night news dumps.But, yes, he named a lot of people. He named his Secretary of Labor, many other health roles. But one name that also stood out to me just for having covered Donald Trump for several years now is Russell Vought. He named him to be the head of the Office of Management and Budget, really the White House Budget Office. I will tell you, Vought is someone who, in the past, he ran the budget office in Donald Trump's first term, but he also in the years since had become a key architect of Project 2025. We know that has been very controversial. Democrats tried to use Project 2025 to undermine Donald Trump's candidacy throughout the end of his campaign. But also, Donald Trump has tried to distance himself from that as well. Vought is someone, though, who is very close with Donald Trump. He worked on that project. I believe that, you know, really, he had left and went to a different policy shop and really framed a lot of the policy agenda that people close to the former president believed would be operating for a second term if he was elected. So I keep an eye out for him as well, Fred.",

Obviously, they're going to want to have the details around any impropriety that Hegseth might have allegedly went through or experienced. And I think it's going to be the forefront, probably of around his specific confirmation period. Again, Gaetz coming in and having such a tumultuous experience around this kind of highlights anything regarding something or anything related to sexual misconduct.

It was one of the first thing alarms that people when I talked to Republicans, that was one of their first concerns. They also -- any interaction with a foreign, you know -- any interaction with a foreign country is going to be problematic for a person seeking that kind of position. And I think that is going to play a major part, not to say that, you know, she won't get confirmed, because Republicans in both chambers are ready to deliver president-elect Donald Trump's agenda. But also they don't want to get in the way of his agenda or his confirmations. We see about there are multiple members who are up for re-election in 2026. And the last thing they want is former President Trump tweeting something or putting something on social media that suggests that they aren't good for a re-election.

And in the south of the country as well, where Israeli forces are, there's been some pretty intense battles going on for a couple of days now around one town in the southeast of Lebanon, which is strategically important to Hezbollah. I think all of this puts together tells us that Israel isn't taking the foot off the gas at all in this fight, that it is trying to expand its control in the south and press and go after more senior Hezbollah figures.",

Israel pulls back its troops out of Lebanon back into Israel. Hezbollah pulls their forces back from the border overlooking Israel. They go back 30 miles north of the Litani River. And into that sort of military vacuum, if you will. The U.N. puts more troops in. It has a presence already. It's really small. And the Lebanese army, which has really been emasculated over the years and is nothing near as strong as Hezbollah, they also would go into that military vacuum to form a buffer zone.

You know, in a certain sense, Churchill once said, I'm going to write the history of my time, so I'm going to be fine. History will remember me the right way. But nobody can write it for themselves. But I think when we look back, we're going to see what it was that he did as a person, as a public service, especially at a time when we're not valuing public service in the same way, as well as what he accomplished during his administration. But things take time. Churchill -- Truman left, you know, in a 25 percent approval rating, and he's now one of the great presidents. LBJ has come up over time. The war in Vietnam will still always be a stain. But what he did domestically has -- and what has stayed forever is part of his legacy. And he's ranking up there among the historians. So we'll take time to do that. But I think that was a gracious way that he spoke to the donors tonight.",

So these presidents come up and down depending on how people write about them. But more importantly, what's important at the time when the writer is writing about it, so their reputations can go up and down. It's an interesting way that history -- history does. But you get the first guys, George Washington, Franklin Roosevelt, Abraham Lincoln, they have remained extraordinary time after time after time for decades and decades.

It's true that every president wants a second term. Lincoln said that in 1864. He said the second term matters even more than the first term because it's a judgment on what your first term was like. And you want to finish the job. He just wanted so much to finish the war in -- in 1864.And it wasn't sure that he was going to win that election. In fact, he was told that unless he compromised on emancipation, there was no way he would win in November. He turned the people out, the Republican bigwigs. He said, there's no way I'm going to compromise. I'd be damned in hell and eternity if I did so. So he made that decision, ambition for the larger goal, trumping in a certain sense the ambition for winning that election. He was lucky that in September, Atlanta fell and the mood of the North changed and he was able to win the election. But with emancipation secured, those are the kind of qualities that you're looking for in a president. And I think when we look for it over time, it's not just what they did, but who they were. Did they have humility, empathy, resilience, accountability, ambition for something larger than oneself? That's what is judged over a period of time. So it's the person as well as their accomplishments or their failures.",

If I bring Lincoln back, I think what he would tell to President-elect Trump is that don't go into punishing enemies. When -- when -- what -- what happened for Lincoln as the war was coming to a close, the North was on the eve of triumph and -- and people wanted radicals around him, wanted him to prosecute and punish and hang the Confederate generals and Confederate soldiers. And he said, we've had enough hate. We've had enough sadness. We just want to move forward.And then in that great second inaugural with malice toward none and charity for all, let us bind up the nation's wounds. So that would be Lincoln's advice. He would say, remember, once you said, Mr. Trump, you said success is the best revenge. You've had success. Let it go. And I think what LBJ would tell him is that every decision you make during this transition period uses up capital. After he had won in 1964 by 15 million votes, I mean, so much more than was won in this election. He knew that it would dwindle with every decision he made. He'd have a fight with Congress, a fight with the press. He would make a decision and it would dwindle. So he told his staff, get off. He said, get your asses off the ground and get my program through and make sure you have the right priorities in mind. So every choice you make of cabinet, every decision you make as to whether to go after your enemies or not, the tone you set. When Jefferson came in as president, there had been a huge vitriolic fight with Adams during the presidential election, almost a civil war they feared was going to come. And what he did is he said, we are all federalists. We are all Republicans. We need civility and magnanimity right now. And he reached out for common ground. And that tone can be set in language. So all these things that are happening now will determine really the success of the presidency. The transition point is really, really important. Not only the cabinet choices, the White House staff, but the tone you set and the actions you make during this period of time. They should be really thought through very carefully. That's what my guys would tell them.",

They put on a forensic pathologist who was essentially there to counter the testimony of the city's medical examiner, which was a key witness for the prosecution.She was the one who said that she had no doubt that Jordan Neely had died as a result of put -- being put -- put in a chokehold by Daniel Penny. So when the defense was up to present their case, they put on their own medical expert to essentially counter those findings. And they spent a lot of time talking about all the other conditions that Jordan Neely suffered from that actually contributed to his death, according to them, including the fact that he suffered from sickle cell disease and that he was high on K2 at the time of the incident and that he had serious mental health issues, all of which -- which was previously known. So now it's going to be up to the jury. And what's going to happen next week is that the lawyers will meet to talk about how they're going to charge the -- the jury.
