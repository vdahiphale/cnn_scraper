You have people like Michael Flynn, his former National Security adviser, Patrick Byrne, the former Overstock CEO pitching things for everything from martial law to seizing voting machines using the military or DHS.

[15So a typical Iowa campaign topic that we have seen for years and years, no mention of the investigations. Of course, the former President often talks about this on social media. He often rails against the investigations and the indictments. But as of now, he is not mentioning this, perhaps attuned to the fact that many Republicans do want to turn the page and win back the White House. So we've heard the former president here in Council Bluffs, Iowa talking more about Joe Biden than he often does, talking about how it is time to move him out of the White House. The question is, is Donald Trump electable? Will these investigations and the indictments affect his electability? This is what pretty much a Republican Party divided. There is Trump fatigue, as we talked to voters as well as Trump excitement, of course, here at this rally, there is a lot of Trump excitement. There are many Republicans who are not here who are considering other candidates who are not excited about this. But at least as of now, at this moment, it could change at any second, but he has not yet talked about the indictments or the investigations that are indeed consuming him, guys.",

I was at an event for former president - Vice President Mike Pence. Last evening he was imploring a small crowd of Republicans to look for new leadership. He said it's the time to turn the page. It's unclear if the vast majority of Republicans would like that. Yes, there is a swath of Republicans who want to move on from the Trump administration from the Trump era. But there is clearly as you can see, behind me here, a good collection of islands and indeed, Nebraskans since we are in the western part of the state, who are very eager to see him win this primary and win the nomination. So this is all part of this Donald Trump effort here. The question is fatigue.

So do the cluster munitions oftentimes cause problems to civilian populations? In some cases, they can. But I think what the claim is - again, of course, this is being consulted with the Ukrainians. The Ukrainians just saying, look, we will take cluster munitions understanding that they could threaten our civilian population down the road, because the much greater threat, the much worse threat to the safety and security of our population is the Russian invasion and what we really need to do is focus on repelling that and these munitions will help us do that.
