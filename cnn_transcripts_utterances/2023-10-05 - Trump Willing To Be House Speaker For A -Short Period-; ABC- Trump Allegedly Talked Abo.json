It comes as he's placing himself front and center in the Capitol Hill chaos. And breaking news this hour, ABC News tonight reporting Trump allegedly discussed potentially sensitive information about nuclear submarines with a Mar-a-Lago club member. So, how does this fit into special counsel Jack Smith's case? And Russia launching one of the deadliest strikes on Ukraine yet. And Putin claims he didn't start the war, he's just trying to end it. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, Donald Trump for speaker? Trump saying tonight that he will take the job, telling Fox News digital today, and I, quote, they have asked me if I would take it for a short period time, for the party, until they come to a conclusion. I'm not doing it because I want to, I will do it if necessary. Trump also telling Fox, he will visit the capital on Tuesday. Now, keep in mind, the vote for speaker is expected to be Wednesday, possibly, and this will be Trump's first visit to the Capitol, since the insurrection, January 6th, nearly three years ago. And make no mistake, there are plenty of Republicans who don't want Trump getting involved. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

A person who ABC is reporting tonight, allegedly discuss potentially sensitive information about newest U.S. nuclear submarines with a billionaire, who then shared this information with more than 45 other people, including more than a dozen foreign officials.ABC reporting tonight, that billionaire Anthony Pratt, an Australian who runs the American company Pratt Industries, one of the biggest packaging companies in the world, has been interviewed by both the FBI and prosecutors at least twice this year. And he told him apparently that at Mar-a-Lago in the spring of 2021, he brought up the American submarine fleet, which he discussed Trump before. Pratt says he's told Trump, hey, Australia should buy U.S. submarines, and then sources tell ABC, that in response Trump, quote, leaned into Pratt, as if to be discreet, and then told him two things about American submarines, supposedly, the exact number of nuclear warheads that they routinely carry, and, exactly how close they can get, supposedly, to a Russian submarine, without being detected. It's pretty incredible things to just share to a person at a club. Of course, Trump is already charged with 40 felony counts of stripping and sharing classified information. Melanie Zanona is OUTFRONT on Capitol. And, you know, in the context here, Melanie, Trump now saying he is willing to, not just run for president, but potentially be speaker for a period of time.

The reality is what we want is a speaker who is willing to work across the, out to get things done for the American people. And, it sounds like that's exactly what my colleague Mark wants as well. Sadly, we never got that from Kevin McCarthy. I mean, this is a man who, governed to his base, to the extremists from the very day that he was elected speaker. It required Democrats to bail him out, including averting a government shutdown. We bailed him out, coming to his rescue, to avoid a government shutdown, when 90 of his own members, his own Republican colleagues in the House, voted to shut the government down. And then what does he do? He goes on TV the next day, and starts bashing and blaming Democrats. He could have done the most modest outreach to a few members of our caucus and said, I genuinely want to work together, to include you in the governing process, the same way that the vast majority of American people want.

It didn't work. He didn't get anything done. In the same period of time, under Nancy Pelosi, we passed three times as many bills out of the House, that Kevin McCarthy passed in his speakership. So it didn't work for legislating, it didn't work for the American people, and ultimately cost him his job, to just listen to people like Matt Gaetz.

I know you are well aware that your colleague, Democrat Congressman Dan Goldman, said that Liz Cheney reached out to him, about Speaker McCarthy, ex-Speaker McCarthy. She reached out to say, should remind him that McCarthy obviously had, he had such a horrible response to January 6, he had flip-flopped. And the view that she had, that he poses a danger to democracy, because of how he behaved on January 6th, and his current support for Donald Trump. And then, Congressman Goldman says that he went and conveyed that to the entire Democratic conference, right before the vote. And it was -- it was framed that that was very -- that Liz Cheney was actually very crucial to the decision and the Democratic caucus, to not back or bailout Speaker McCarthy. Is that how you saw it, how big of an impact does she have? MOULTON:  No, I don't think that's true. I mean a lot of Democrats have respect for Liz Cheney for her political courage, in standing up to Trump, and the insurrectionists, and the people in her party, who are election deniers, right.

It is therefore the argument, though, that they are making, as to why he shouldn't be facing charges, in a court. Evan Perez is OUTFRONT.

So, Ryan, I -- we have always talked with the fact that impeachment is a political process, and a court of law is a legal process, right and, that these are two different things, right? That was Mitch McConnell's whole point, let the courts decide it. But that's the argument they are making, acquitted by the Senate, so therefore, throw it out. Is there any case here to do that, with presidential immunity? RYAN GOODMAN, JUST SECURITY CO-EDITOR-IN-CHIEF:  For that argument, no. I don't want to miss characterize it, but it is almost ludicrous, in the sense that, he almost is saying that you require a Senate conviction, in order to be able to then prosecute a president. But, that would make any sense, because evidence could come to light later. For example, and then as Evan says, there was a particular, specific charge in the impeachment, which was the incitement. These are other charges. Jack Smith didn't charge him with incitement. So, there are many reasons that will fail. He does have a separate argument which is just, the Supreme Court has found presidents are immune from civil suits. That is a good argument, and he is now saying that should extend to criminal suits.

But in a criminal context, that has never really been adjudicated.And certainly, there are certain things that we can say, for sure would be outside of the outer perimeters, things like domestic violence, or even sexual assault. Those will be totally, and wholly unconnected from any official duties whatsoever, potentially making the president amenable to criminal process. But, when you have a case like this, where there is a question about the conduct, and the execution of the laws, and looking into the federal election, and things of that sort.

We learned his name is Sergei, and the deceased was his wife. As you can see, this building was completely annihilated when it was hit by the missile. The Ukrainians are saying that this was an Iskander missile launched by the Russians. That is a very heavy missile that is normally used to destroy large troop formations or even armored vehicles. And as you can see, it completely devastated this building right here. The Ukrainians say more than 50 people were killed. It's very difficult for them to identify some of the bodies because they are in such bad shape. They also say what was going on here was an event around a funeral. And they say that the people who were attending that event were all local folks. There was chaos, the chief investigator tells us. There was a fire which was extinguished by firefighters. Of course, evacuation measures were taken to get people out of the rubble. Obviously, all of this is still very fresh, and a lot of the search and rescue cruise crews are still very much at work. We can see over there, that some of the first responders are still busy sort of doing the forensics on the scene here and also still putting bodies into body bags. There's a lot of them laying around here and a lot being taken way by some of these crews here. One of the other things that we can see over there is that, obviously, this was some sort of recreational area. There still seems or the some sort of playground that was also heavily damaged when the missile hit. Ukraine's president visiting Spain pinning the blame on Russia. Tragically, because of this inhuman terrorist attack, 50 civilians were killed during a funeral. Russia does this every day in the Kharkiv region, and only air defense can help. But that help will be too late for Sergei's wife and the others killed. The only thing he can do for her now is help the crews lift her body to be taken away. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

You are absolutely right, the destruction here is complete, it's total, you can see the rubble on the ground, it looks almost like some sort of massive earthquake struck here. That's what this missile did to that building, and that is certainly what we found when we got here, shortly after all of this happened, as well. There were still a lot of bodies that were strewn around, the debris here, but also, in front of the building as well. It seems as though the folks who survived, the first responders drag some of the bodies out, and there were people who were sort of tending to them, but it was very clear, very early, on that there is very little that any sort of paramedics will be able to do here. So this very quickly became a recovery operation, and, you know, there was definitely a lot of carnage here. The authorities did what they could. But you can also see now, Erin, they have very much given up any sort of hope that anybody could be found alive. In fact, the recovery operation has stopped as well, and we are now in the middle of the night. You can see that this place has been completely destroyed, Erin.",

And instead, you have an alderman talking about the border. This is an issue that is coming home in people's communities. I want to note something about the announcement by the administration itself. I was reading a statement by Alejandro Mayorkas, the homeland security secretary. And he didn't say we're going to expand the wall. He said, plural, we're going to expand, or at barriers. And, having driven the border, I think I understand what's going on here.
