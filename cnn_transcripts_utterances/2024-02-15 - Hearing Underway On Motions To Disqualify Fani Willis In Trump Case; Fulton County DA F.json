It's unfortunate that he testified that she insists on paying her way, gave him some cash, there's the boat, gave him some cash. Miami trip, booked it abroad. It would balance out. A couple of other trips that we didn't get any information about. Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, all of those could be financial benefits. We don't know. He didn't know. But he was very vague about that. And even the best friends testified that it happened in 2019. Now, Mr. Wade has testified that the relationship began to become romantic, and that is a conflict in and of itself, right there. That's a big conflict. We've also got more receipts.

So that's not going to do the trick. They need to get her clean copies of this, Laura Coates. But it seems like what are going to be drilling down here, drilling down on here, and there's a lot of things, but in particular, having to do with her cash reimbursements. And most significantly, the timeline of the relationship because a former employee and friends and in the district attorney's office, Robin Yurty (ph) had earlier said that she believed, without a doubt, that the relationship had started in 2019. And we just heard testimony from Nathan Wade. He said 2022.. LAURA COATES, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CHIEF LEGAL ANALYST: First of all, this is a stunning, an extraordinary moment. We're about to have the D.A. for Fulton County, the one who is bringing RICO charges for more than a dozen, including the former president of the United States, who has an active RICO charge right now in case involving a huge case out here in Georgia, getting ready to take the stand and actually sat down on the stand. And why? Because she is going to be testifying about the nature of her relationship with one of the lead prosecutors, Nathan Wade, the timing of it. Whether she personally, financially benefited from that existing relationship, whether there is a conflict of interests, according to Georgia ethical obligations and laws, that would require her to be disqualified. And not just her, but her entire team, which would then put this case on a very different trajectory to maybe not be tried before the election, if at all, Brianna, this is an extraordinary moment. And of course, I'm here with Nick Valencia right now on this very important issue. Nick, the fact that she is testifying, first of all, my mind a little bit blown because she is getting ready to expose herself for a number of reasons. There are many reasons to never want to take the stand. She will now have to answer questions about private matters in front of a potential jury pool, dare I say the world. And it's all about whether should be disqualified.",

She had 18 co-defendants at one point. Everyone processed through the Ritz on Rice Street, the Fulton County jail. We saw President Trump come through here. We see legal analysts say what a strong case she has. Instead, we're not talking about the fake elector scheme to subvert the Electoral College. We're not talking about the infamous phone call where Trump called the secretary of state here, Brad Raffensberger, and said, find me 11,000 more votes. We are not talking about the illegal accessing of voting data in rural Coffee County. Instead, what are we talking about? We're talking about a relationship which -- what appears to be two consenting adults. But it also appears though that they may have some credibility issues. The defense attorneys are drilling down on this. Did they mischaracterize or contradict themselves in these sworn, legal written briefs that they handed over to the court? That is something that has been a focus today. We knew that the presiding judge, Scott McAfee, was very, very interested in whether or not she personally benefited from this personal relationship. Now though, it seems that credibility is an issue here today, Laura.",
