Thank you so much for starting your morning with us.So the death toll in Hawaii rises to at least 80 people after devastating wildfires in Lahaina. And as the grim reality sets in for survivors, some are questioning the state's response before and how much was done to warn residents to get out. Plus, Hunter Biden's legal troubles heat up. The Justice Department elevates the U.S. Attorney investigating his case to Special Counsel after plea talks fall apart. Republican presidential candidates descend on Iowa. Today, all eyes will be on the Iowa State Fair as former President Donald Trump and presidential candidate Ron DeSantis go head to head. We will have the latest as the candidates make their pitch to voters ahead of this crucial and critical Iowa caucuses and the first presidential debate.

The images are absolutely devastating and the destruction in Lahaina just 80 miles to the west of here is finally coming into focus.Now let's start with the latest. As you mentioned, crews that are equipped with cadaver dogs are in the process of searching many of the structures that have been destroyed. We know that a majority of the victims that have been found so far were found outside of many of these structures. And officials have said that they've yet to search through every building that has been burned to the ground there in Lahaina. So we are expecting sadly that death toll to increase in the next several hours. Now the fire in Lahaina has been contained by about 85 percent. But that does not mean that the danger is completely over. [06:05:09] In fact, overnight, there was another brush fire that took place on the western part of the island and that fire triggered evacuations overnight. We've heard just a short while ago that that fire has been completely contained and that evacuations are no longer mandatory. So some good news there, but it's certainly not what residents in Lahaina are trying to hear. Now, yesterday, Lahaina opened up the only public road that is currently accessible in order to give residents there an opportunity to get back. They're anxious to assess the damage. They're anxious to figure out whether their home was completely lost to try to connect with family and loved ones who may still be there. But people began to pile up. There was a big traffic jam. And officials were forced to close the road back up again. So right now, there's a lot of frustration. And really, people are losing patience. They are waiting for supplies and for help to arrive in the area. Now, just to give you an idea of where I am, we are in Honolulu standing at the convention center, which is right here behind me. This has been operating as a support center for evacuees. More than 30,000 people were flown out of Maui since Wednesday. Some of them have arrived here in the last several days. And they have been trying to get to -- connect it to help to other flights to find accommodations as they get on their way. But as I mentioned, frustration beginning to build in the area, especially for people who are in Maui in the western part of the island waiting for help. Now, we've heard from multiple witness reports that they did not get a notification. There was no alarm system that was deployed in the area. Sirens that usually are turned on when there is danger regarding the weather did not go up. That has prompted an investigation by the Attorney General here in Hawaii who said that he is -- they are conducting a review of the decisions that officials made in the early hours just as the fire was beginning to burn.

These structures literally did burn to the ground, but not completely. In many cases, these were old structures, wooden structures, in some cases, metal structures, so the integrity of the buildings also need to be considered for safety.But that is the most concerning thing for us the fact that most of the casualties have been found outside. We have yet to go inside where we know for many individuals, they may not have been able to escape that quickly. This took place at night, with howling winds outside. You just can imagine the terror for many sheltering in place was probably what they thought was the best idea, and obviously was not. We've also heard so many jumping into the water in absolute fear.

And the judge in this case is really being firm on what Trump and his legal team can and cannot disclose it out the case to the public. So Judge Tanya Chutkan, she issued a protective order. And it lays out that Trump cannot disclose any sensitive information that's given to him and his team during discovery.So that includes material about the grand jury process or information from it, or search warrants. And she also issued several warnings to Trump. She noted that even though he's running a political campaign, he still in her words has to yield to the administration of justice. And she said if that means his political speech has to be somewhat limited, then that's the way it's going to be. She says she is carefully scrutinizing any statements that Trump and his team make. She says that anything that they say that can be interpreted to be intimidating to witnesses or prejudicial to potential jurors could really threaten this whole process. So under all of these terms, prosecutors are saying they're prepared to begin handing over material immediately. This includes 11.6 million pages of documents. It includes hundreds of recordings of witness interviews, which Trump of course will be prohibited from disclosing publicly. And we'll see how quickly this case could go to trial. The prosecution wants it to start January 2nd. Trump's legal team has to propose their start date sometime next week. And they'll likely propose it after the election. But really the rate that Judge Chutkan is moving here, she'll likely want to hew closer to the prosecution's proposed January date. So we'll see. Guys?",

He won't be under the day to day supervision of the Justice Department, but he will write a report at the end of the investigation to explain his charging decisions. And Garland said that he will make as much of that public as possible. And this appointment comes after a plea deal Biden reached with Weiss fell apart last month under scrutiny from a federal judge in Delaware. Biden had agreed to plead guilty to two tax misdemeanors and reached a diversion agreement on a gun possession charge. Prosecutor said they would recommend no jail time. On Friday, Weiss's office then negotiations to amend the plea deal reached an impasse. And they were prepared to go to trial. Several House Republicans called the plea a sweetheart deal. They are investigating the Biden family business and the Justice Department's investigation into Hunter Biden.

The question of his vice president and whether or not she's prepared to step in, is just out there. The Republicans have really made an issue of it rather than let them try and define the issue.

Great to have you. First, can you just help us understand what this perseids are, and what makes them so special seeing them. JANET IVEY, PRESIDENT, EXPLORE MARS, INC.:  Sure. The source of the perseid shower is common with tidal. And they basically fragment this comet, which orbits between the sun and beyond the orbit of Pluto once every 133 years. Which again sounds crazy, but the comet sheds bits of material every time it returns near the sun, and this debris keeps traveling along the comet's orbital path, creating kind of a river of rubble. And every year, the earth passes near this path of the comet, and basically, the debris left behind by swift tidal shows up as meteors that are sky. And tonight, we're going to pass through the deepest part of that river of rubble. And we should be seeing about 50 to 100 meteors per hour tonight.",

So if you go ahead, happen to catch it tonight because of weather or clouds, you still have a few more days to look up.
