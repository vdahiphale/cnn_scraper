First in the 2024 presidential race, President Biden challenges Donald Trump to debate starting next month. Trump's response, let's get ready to rumble. We're also following breaking news out of Ukraine. While in Kyiv Secretary of State Tony Blinken just announced $2 billion in military aid to the country. This comes as Russia is making its most significant gains in two years, launching a wave of missile attacks, hitting apartment buildings and a shopping center. Let's bring in White House Correspondent Arlette Saenz and Chief National Affairs Correspondent Jeff Zeleny. Arlette, to you first big news with these presidential debates, President Biden throwing down the gauntlet by challenging Trump, what can you tell us?",

      "sentences": "Well, Jim, President Biden's campaign proposed some revisions to the potential debates between Biden and Trump, suggesting that they would like to see debates happen in late June as well as early September. The campaign chair, Jen O'Malley Dillon, wrote a letter to the Commission on Presidential Debates, saying that Biden would forego those traditional debates held by the commission, which were currently slated to begin in mid-September. Biden also teased challenging Trump to two debates in a video posted on social media. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  Donald Trump lost two debates to me in 2020. Since then, he hadn't shown up for debate. Now, he's acting like he wants to debate me again. Well, make my day, pal. I'll even do it twice. So let's pick the dates, Donald. I hear you're free on Wednesdays. (END VIDEO CLIP) SAENZ:  So, the Biden campaign laid out their proposal, which includes one debate in late June after they believe former President Donald Trump's criminal trial in New York City would conclude, and then also another debate in early September. One of the arguments that they're making is they think that they need to appear before voters before early voting begins in some of those key battleground states. They are also saying that they want to see one-on-one debates. That would mean excluding any potential third party candidates like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Additionally, they want to negotiate these debates and organize them directly with broadcast networks, eliminating the Commission on Presidential Debates. Now, Trump, just moments ago, posted on social media saying that he would also agree to those terms of the dates in June and September. He said, I am ready and willing to debate Crooked Joe at the two proposed times in June and September. Just tell me when, I'll be there. Let's get ready to rumble. Of course, the final details of this would also need to be fine tuned, but these debates could potentially be occurring much earlier than traditionally held with late June just being a few weeks away.",

      "sentences": "I think it is. And, look, one of the big questions hanging over this rematch is, are they going to debate? I think if President Biden had his druthers, he may not. He would be a sitting president in a position of strength, like Reagan, only agreed to one debate, but that's not the case as we see the polls out there.So, what the White House is clearly trying to do is take charge of this situation while the Trump campaign and the former president is distracted, trying to put this proposal out, saying we want to debate and soon. Early June would be -- or late June would be the earliest ever for a debate. But, look, how voting in America is done has changed dramatically, even since you and I have started covering presidential races. But since 1988, the Commission on Presidential Debates, this sort of bipartisan, non-partisan group, has held these debates. There's been a lot of criticism from all sides. So, this would be a dramatic shift in this, so late June, early September. The reason for that is, clearly, the Biden campaign wants to flip the script, if you will. [10:05:01] They want to start showing that President Biden is more in charge, in command and seeing that head to head matchup is something his advisers believe will do it. If you think of him in the State of the Union address, that's the kind of Biden they want to see head to head with the former president. And early September, that is also just about when early voting begins. So, that would be a dramatic difference. And just a few moments ago on the Hugh Hewitt Radio Show, the former president said he doesn't mind the moderators. He said he will do whoever. So, if this continues, we could have this set up pretty soon.",

He ran for the 2024 presidential nomination for the Republican Party. Governor Hutchinson, what do you make of this challenge from the president to Donald Trump? He did say, make my day, channeling Clint Eastwood there a little bit. What do you think? Is Donald Trump going to make his day? FMR. GOV. ASA HUTCHINSON (R-AR):  I think it's going to happen. And I'm with you that it is surprising that the first debate suggested is in June before the National Convention. So, I think it reflects the fact that Joe Biden sees the latest polls that he's dropped. He's worried about the third party candidate. So, he's setting this in motion, hoping it will give him a boost, and Trump is ready to go on it. So, I think it's going to happen, and I like the revision to the rules, where actually the mics can be turned off unless you have allocated time to speak. That's a good revision. It's interesting that President Biden does not want to have a studio audience, trying to take away from some of the dynamics that is favorable to Donald Trump.",

The jury knows what's going on in the courtroom there, and it could have an influence on the jury. But the second thing is, if they're just there as a friend, certainly you understand that. But if the motivation is to set the stage to challenge the verdict, if it is a guilty verdict, then that is a greater concern. And I think that's what's happening. You're seeing those people that are there, the candidates, those that want to be V.P., those that want to support Trump, you're going to see them attacking the verdict if it happens to be a guilty verdict at the end of the day, saying it was a sham trial, this sets the stage for it.

You're looking at pictures of a blown out apartment building following a wave of Russian attacks. And take a look at this. This is just a piece of a Russian missile falling in one area. The fighting is so intense that Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has scrapped his meetings with foreign leaders for the time being. Over the last week, Moscow has made its most significant gain since 2022 in the New York Times report. Some in the Biden administration fear this could be a turning point in the war.

There's one town near the border that right now seems to be under full-on Russian assault called Vovchansk, where there are a lot of people who are being evacuated from there. And the Ukrainians are saying that the Russians are managing to take up positions in that area. So, on the whole, on that part of that new frontline, very difficult right now for the Ukrainians, as they're really outnumbered and outgunned by the Russians to a large extent. And, of course, that's also something that overshadows all of those meetings the secretary of state is having there in Kyiv, in Ukraine, first with the Ukrainian president, then with the foreign minister. And you're absolutely right. He did pledge a significant amount of new U.S. aid, $2 billion in military financing. He said that happened on several levels.

The president posted, I've received and accepted an invitation from CNN for a debate on June 27th. Over to you, Donald, as you said, anywhere, any time, any place.Now, just to recap, the Biden campaign has proposed holding two debates between the two men, one in late June and another in early September, foregoing the traditional debates from the Commission on Presidential Debates. Former President Donald Trump has responded that he would agree to two debates, one being in June and one in September. So, now the ball will be in Trump's court to decide whether they will accept this invitation as well from CNN for a debate on June 27th. Now, the Biden campaign has said that they want to see these debates just be one-on-one debates. That essentially is excluding a potential third party candidate. They also are organizing these debates directly with broadcast networks, cutting out the Commission on Presidential Debates, which was set to begin these face offs in mid-September and hold three of them over the course of several weeks in the fall. Now, there are still a number of details that need to be worked out. For instance, Trump did a radio show interview a little while ago where he said he would like to see these debates be two hours. He believes there needs to be podiums involved. The Biden campaign has also laid out very specific details about what they want to see. They want this to be in studio with a moderator and the candidates, eliminating some of the distractions and potential interactions that come from an audience. The Biden campaign has also called for mics to only beyond when the candidate is set to speak, potentially some -- potentially eliminating some of that intense back and forth that we saw at that very first debate between Biden and Trump in 2020. So, we will see what the Trump campaign might have to say about Biden, saying that he's accepted this invitation for a debate on June 27th hosted by CNN. Of course, we're still waiting to hear more details about what exactly that will entail. But it shows that both of these candidates are eager to begin this debating process much earlier than is typical as they're heading towards that face-off in November.",
