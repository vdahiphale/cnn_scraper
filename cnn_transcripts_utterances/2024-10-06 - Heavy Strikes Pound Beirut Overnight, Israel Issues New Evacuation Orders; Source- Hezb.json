For the fourth time over the course of the last year, the Israeli military now beginning to carry out another major offensive in northern Gaza in the Jabalia refugee camp after it says that Hamas militants have begun to regroup there.It is just the latest instance of the Israeli military being forced to go back into areas that it had previously carried out an offensive in which it said it had cleared. But then Hamas rebuilt speaking of course to major questions about Israel's long-term strategy in Gaza and the lack of an alternative to Hamas governance inside the Gaza Strip. Overnight, the Israeli military striking more than a dozen targets in Jabalia from the air as well as from artillery strikes to prepare the ground for Israeli infantry troops to move in. As it is doing so, it is also once again, forcing the displacement of thousands of Palestinians living in northern Gaza. Hundreds have already begun to flee the area of Jabalia expressing concerns about what they will find in these humanitarian zones, which have been struck themselves as they head to those areas. But the Israeli military has actually now issued evacuation orders for the majority of the northern part of the Gaza Strip, where hundreds of thousands of people are currently believed to be living. And so major impacts to this. And just another reminder that as we are now approaching this one year anniversary of the October 7th massacre, a year of the war in Gaza, the fighting in Gaza very much still continuing Hamas. While it may have been defeated as a military structure, as the Israeli military has said, very much still fighting as a guerrilla force, as the Qassam Brigade, Hamas's military wing, saying that they are engaged in fierce fighting with Israeli troops in northern Gaza. As all of this is happening, of course, the Israeli military is also stepping up. It's military offensive in Lebanon, where ground troops are also now engaged there as well issuing additional evacuation orders for Lebanese villages in southern Lebanon raising questions about how much more that operation will expand. And in addition to that, of course, we're still waiting for the Israeli retaliation for that barrage of ballistic missiles fired by Iran earlier this week. The Israeli government vowing it will retaliate, but we don't yet know when or how severe that retaliation will be.",

And now that's what they've done. So, again, I think that's the difference in this round. It's intelligence and it's demonstrating with a terrifying ferocity, the capacity of the Israelis to strike. Unfortunately, there are too many civilian casualties as they go after these Hezbollah leaders. But I suspect that's going to continue an effort to decimate the organization, prevent it from recreating itself with any serious sense of command and control. But as Ben Wedeman pointed out, Hezbollah's strength here may actually be in an insurgency and guerrilla tactics, and that's what the Israelis are going to face as they push farther north in Lebanon.",

I also want to just note that we saw someone at this rally on Saturday that we hadn't seen at Donald Trump's rallies before, and that is Elon Musk. Of course, remember, Musk actually endorsed Donald Trump just moments after the gunmen had opened fire in Butler, Pennsylvania, in July. It was almost a full circle moment. Musk came on stage and said that he believes that the 2024 election is the most important election of our lifetimes. He praised Donald Trump.

There's one fund for disaster relief. And that's what Secretary Mayorkas said, because Congress hasn't appropriated us a full year funding plan, because we're operating on short term funding, we're going to need a more robust package to make sure all the victims of this terrible hurricane have what they need to rebuild. There's also a separate, much smaller fund that FEMA distributed to cities that were being overwhelmed by migrant surge in the past couple years.

Again, Congress is fairly observant of FEMA spending money. They're not supposed to be spending in places they're not allowed to spend. So, again, the House didn't even act on this, and there's no evidence to suggest that the Disaster Relief Fund was being used to fund this. And again, there's so many things that people are talking about, but I want to hit one thing that I think a lot of -- why these rumors get started. This is an area that got heavily hit, and quite honestly, if my home got destroyed, I lost family members, my community is wiped out, I don't want to hear about the great job everybody's doing. I'm hurting. And in that environment, it's easy for misinformation to spread. I got cousins in this area that have had significant impacts, they're trying to help their neighbors. And they were texting me going, hey, we're hearing all this stuff. And we don't think it's true, but in the absence of any information, people are wanting to grasp something that explains why this was so bad. And so, I get that. The important thing is to get past the information. Quite honestly, none of these people in this area are worried about where FEMA spent their money. They just want to know FEMA's there to help them. So, I think some of this attention is nationally. Think about the areas of impact, they have hardly any communications. This broadcast isn't reaching many of the people that have lost their families and homes. So, we're talking to ourselves. We really should be focused on the people we're trying to help. Focus on the survivors and the programs getting in there.

Now, both Harris and Walz will be visiting Arizona to rally support and encourage people to vote as early voting starts on Wednesday.Joining us now is Brian Stelter. Yes, first of all, let's talk about this media blitz, you know, that Harris is going to embark on and very different types of outlets and vastly different audiences. BRIAN STELTER, CNN CHIEF MEDIA ANALYST:  I believe Kamala Harris is the first person to ever go from \"Call Her Daddy\" to 60 Minutes in the span of a day.",

This is the first time he's going on one of those big Sunday public affairs programs, and he's doing it in what the Harris campaign believes is the opposition, going to the opposition, going over to Fox.Now, you know, tomorrow, he's on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live\" doing his first late night show. So, he's going to have friendlier territory tomorrow. But yes, I do think it's strategic for Walz, not Harris, to be doing an appearance on Fox News. We know Fox has been trying to get a debate, and Trump and Harris have not been willing to get together at the same time for a debate. So, Fox is having an interview with Walz instead. But, you know, that's all part of this media blitz that Harris is also promoting. I think, you know, we view it all as one package deal where both of these candidates, as October begins, they are trying to get to send a message that they are willing and able to appear pretty much everywhere.",

It took a while until she did her first and then now, you know, we're seeing a handful of them happening, you know, just a month before the election.",

      "sentences": "You know, I do think it's fair to say that as much as news junkies like yours truly have been paying close attention for many months, more average voters might only be tuning this fall. We know that the first debate on September 10th was a big tune in moment for many people to start to pay attention.So, if you're the Harris campaign, now it does make sense to appear on \"The View,\" or to appear on the \"Howard Stern Show,\" or appear on Colbert, you know, as opposed to doing that a month or two ago. Maybe it makes sense for the campaign to, quote/unquote, \"hold their fire\" until now when early voting is actually getting underway. And while a lot of these interviews are going to be on friendly territory for Harris and Walz, I do want to recognize 60 Minutes, the biggest news magazine in the United States, some tough questions were given to Harris -- were offered to Harris yesterday, that was taped yesterday, it's going to air tomorrow. It's really notable that Donald Trump backed out of that 60 Minutes appearance because, again, it's the most popular news magazine in the country. Trump initially agreed to be on it, then he withdrew. So, all of a sudden, CBS still has this big primetime special, but only one of the two candidates.",
