I do think that it does - it does show, on the other hand, that these dictatorships, these regimes that we think of as so stable, are not really that stable because they depend on these individuals, in this case the president, who's the butcher of Tehran, who was involved in the murder of thousands of political prisoners, who's been oppressing women in Iran for all these years, who really was the product of a rigged election. And, you know, just like that, no more president and nobody knows what's going to happen next.So, it does tell us something about this regime, is that it's actually very brittle. Their helicopters aren't that good. But it doesn't tell us that they want war. It actually tells us that they're actually weaker and actually more fragile than we really understand. Yes.

And the administration also came out and said that ICC officials were supposed to be on a plane going to Israel to work out more on this and, instead, they didn't get on the plane.

Remember, this comes after the last couple of weeks he, you know, announced that they were withholding the 2,000 pound bombs contingent on what Israel was doing in Rafah. There was a lot of, I think confusion about what that meant. There was some coverage and discussion of that as he's, you know, walking away from arming Israel. That wasn't their intention. I think maybe there could have been clear communication around that from the White House, to be quite honest with you.But, remember, this - this comes, you know, after that conversation. And so I think the president is trying to be particularly explicit in showing that he is not walking away from Israel, that he is allied with Israel. And, of course, this point about the ICC equating Hamas and Israel, you know, is - is ludicrous. And I think, you know, the president wants to be clear about that. I would also say, you know, he and his team have been explicit from the outset that they don't believe what's happening in Gaza is a genocide. That's language that they've used. You've seen, you know, John Kirby, Jake Sullivan. They've been very clear from the podium, we don't view this as a genocide. So, this was also the president, you know, reiterating that.

So, this is a very, very unstable and risky situation.And now that doesn't mean that Iran wants World War III, but it means that the risk of miscalculation that could lead to an unintended war is at an all-time high. And I think that's what a lot of people are - inside our government are worried about. Now, as for the - how do the indictments effect Netanyahu, I think you're absolutely right, I think they give - they put Israelis on the defensive and they make people around Netanyahu rally to his defense because what he's facing is an internal struggle. His war cabinet is breaking up. People around him want him gone. They want him to specify an end to the - the - how the war ends. This is all - he was almost at his last sort of option and now it seems like, well, now the - it makes sense that the government's going to rally around him temporarily. But it doesn't solve any of the long-term problems. So, if you think the best way to end the war is to get rid of Netanyahu. Well, now he's got another reason to sort of say, look, everyone's against us. I'm going to stick around for a while. But that only delays the problem. It doesn't solve it, in my view.",

And sometimes that means you can't say the thing that you maybe would want to say in the moment because you're looking at the larger goal.

The bulk of the defense case is trying to undercut Michael Cohen. So, the jury, when they go back to deliberations, they're going to be having to think about what the closing arguments are, the summation that Donald Trump's legal team gives, but they also don't have a lot to work with and it includes this moment of disruption that was so odd.

The quote that I wrote down at the end from Todd Blanche, the defense attorney, just sums it up what their case is going to be. It's not just that Michael Cohen isn't credible, it's, how is keeping a false story from the voters' criminal? What took this into something that was criminal intent and not just political messaging?
