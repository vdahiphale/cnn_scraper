I'm Fredricka Whitfield.And we begin this morning with the apocalyptic destruction in Hawaii, the deadliest natural disaster in state history. At least 80 people are dead. And thousands more displaced from the wildfires. And now, rescue crews are bringing in cadaver dogs to help search what is left of burned buildings. Devastation from Lahaina fire costing an estimated $5.5 billion in Maui County. One lawmaker tells CNN the state underestimated the threat of wildfires and failed to plan for communication issues with the emergency alert system. Governor Josh Green has ordered a comprehensive review of the state's response. All of this developing as we are seeing more videos of harrowing escapes. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It is part of the leverage. But if you want to use it as leverage, you actually have to be willing to lift it, and some of the critics of this deal have always been against lifting the sanctions, which then eliminates them as the bargaining card in the negotiations.

What was happening outside of that press conference maybe was providing the answer. In a court filing, David Weiss and his team disclosed to the judge that is overseeing this case that pre- negotiations have collapsed and that they now believe a trial is appropriate. That's remarkable, Fred. A trial against the son of the sitting president of the United States and that incredibly unprecedented situation and the high stakes attached to it appears to be one of the leading reason why that David Weiss believes that special counsel designation was appropriate at this time.

One is it insulates him a little bit more from the allegation that this is being weaponized -- DOJ, headed by Merrick Garland, blah-blah-blah.It also helps him in his attempts to hold back the congressional enquirers who have wanted him to testify on the Hill, and have questioned whether or not he has the authority to do the whole investigation. You have the IRS whistleblower who is accusing him of bad faith. So all of these are the types of extraordinary circumstances that the special counsel regulations contemplate. And I think Merrick Garland did the safe thing in elevating him from U.S. attorney in charge of this investigation to special counsel in charge of this investigation.",

The prosecution of the president's son and the public interest being, you know, called into question because of Republican attacks from the Hill, and the IRS whistle-blower, the safer thing is to appoint Weiss as a special counsel to take all those issues off the table.",

The prosecutor said no, no, there's still the Foreign AgentRegistration Act, FARA, as it is known, aspect of the investigation. That is still ongoing. The defense attorney said we thought that was off the table once we pleaded guilty. The prosecutor says no you're mistaken. The plea breaks down and it seems as if now that FARA part of the investigation, is what is going to be the biggest problem for Hunter Biden going forward. How do they deal with this allegation that he improperly received funds from Iran, from China, from everywhere else in the world that they've accused him of receiving funds from.

In this case, what's interesting is when the plea gets revoked, and they have to bring criminal charges, what would have been a plea in Delaware is now going to be a criminal trial in either the District of Columbia or California. So you've got a whole new jury pool to consider.So yes, it always looks funny when you say I was going to plead guilty, but then I'm not going to and I want to go to trial. But I think the jurors will be instructed about that and you have to put that aside and they'll move forward with the trial if that is what happens.
