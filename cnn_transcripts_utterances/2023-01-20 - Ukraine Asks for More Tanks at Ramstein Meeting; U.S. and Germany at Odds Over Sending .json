Another victim of the FTX collapse. I'm Eleni Giokos. Hello, and welcome. This is CONNECT THE WORLD. We're live in Dubai. Now in just one hour, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin will talk to reporters in Germany where some 50 nations have been meeting to address Ukraine's military needs and reinforce their support. The conference coming as the U.S. announced a new $2.5 billion aid package for Ukraine that includes combat and fighting vehicles. But notably not the heavy tanks Ukraine's president says are desperately needed to defeat Russia on the battlefield. Germany's Defense minister saying today no decision has been made on sending German heavy tanks to Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskyy talked about that as he addressed the conference via video link while expressing thanks for the help Ukraine is getting. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Meantime, CNN has learned CIA director Bill Burns made a secret trip to Kyiv to brief President Zelenskyy and top Ukrainian intel officials on Russia's upcoming battlefield plans. So there is a lot to cover here. We have CNN chief international correspondent Clarissa Ward in the Ukrainian capital for us, and Oren Liebermann is at the Pentagon. Clarissa, I want to start with you. Look, we're seeing big numbers in terms of aid, but Zelenskyy keeps on reiterating that the urgency in getting the equipment isn't there. What does a delay on tanks mean for the fight against Russia. I mean, this is a big sticking point, as we wait for that press conference and some detail on whether Germany is going to budge.",

      "sentences": "I think, Eleni, if you talk to Ukrainian officials, there is a real concern that the momentumneeds to be on their side. And they need to act quickly and decisively, and to launch offensives before Russia has a chance to regroup, and launch its own kind of offensive. In order to do that, when you look at the state of play at the moment, particularly in Donbas, where it's sort of a grinding close to stalemate they need, in their own words, long-range artillery, F- 16s and tanks in order to be able to push through those defensive lines and start to take back more territory. So for them I think the feeling is that this is really a decisive moment, and I think there is more broadly a sense of frustration with this sort of drip, drip approach to supplying the Ukrainians with weapons because when they asked for something in the first, there's usually a lot of handwringing, should we, shouldn't we. Does it risk escalation. And then ultimately after some kind of back and forth, they usually do end up getting those weapons, but not in the numbers that they need them, and slowly and incrementally they get more of them. And so what you're hearing again and again from Ukrainian officials is, like, let's just cut to the chase, and get those weapons, and get them moving faster. You know at the end of the day, you're going to arrive at the same conclusion. So certainly a lot of pressure on Germany particularly today to supply those tanks or at least to allow third countries, 13 European countries also have these Leopard 2 tanks in their inventory. So a lot of pressure now on Germany to say decisively, once and for all, whether they will allow those he tanks to be supplied to the Ukrainians.",

And so they're always going to try to create a sense of heightened urgency around their request. At the same time, when we look at where the war is at, it does feel that there is a sort of inflection point. You had a series of major counter offenses that the Ukrainians were able to pull off last year. The Russians have been in sort of a state of disarray. And what you're hearing not just from the Ukrainians, but also from the Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is now is the moment not to allow the Russians to have that time to regroup, to build up their ammunition, to build up their capacity to create or, you know, build up their own military industry inside Russia, production inside Russia. Now is the time to keep up the fight, and to keep up with those offensives. The fear, of course, is that out of these 300,000 Russian troops who were mobilized, 150,000 of them have been going through training. They're about to come to the end of that training, and they could be part of the new wave for some kind of a new spring offensive. And so I think that's why you're seeing this heightened level of urgency, not just in the rhetoric coming from the Ukrainians, but in many of the Ukraine's allies as well in this.",

This in combination would help to have a combined battle warfare which is needed to support Ukraine. And Abrams, in addition, are very -- have a lot of logistic support needed, and it's much more costly to deliver the Abrams. It is more helpful to send the more light IFVs combined with the heavy German Leopard tanks with the other nations.

And two of the biggest companies that it borrowed to. Well, one, Alameda Research which had the links with FTX, but also, what was it called? Three Arrows. That was their other major one. And that one went bankrupt even before Alameda Research and FTX imploded. So actually this firm was already in trouble long before that. So when I think in November they decided to stop customers withdrawing their money, that was the writing on the wall at that stage. And there are so many other elements to the story which we could get into. I mean, there's the issue with Gemini, another crypto firm that was the one founded by the Winklevoss twins. Now they are in a huge dispute about a shared crypto product called Earn, and whether or not Genesis owes investors of Earn some $900 million. Both those companies also charge by the SEC and just over a week ago in fact were illegally selling securities to investors. It is hard to know where to begin with a story like this. But we say it a lot and we'll say it again, as ever, this is a lending platform. It's not like traditional finance, it is not regulated, it does not need a capital cushion.

Right now they are staying in a couple of universities in downtown Lima. But what they are saying is basically that they want to stay in the capital and keep picketing and protesting until they achieve their goal, which is essentially resignation for Boluarte. So that is the main problem right now. And for today, Friday, and then the next couple of days and the weekend, what happens with these thousands of protesters who are not from Lima, they can't simply go back to their homes because their homes are sometimes days' travel away. And the second big problem is on the long term, how can Boluarte sort of bring the country together, and cruising away of these dire strait. We talk to more than once that this is not a crisis of her making because these grievances are decades old, and it's a complete debate, deep debate about the way that the country's resources are shared and spread among the population. But she is now the person who needs to open a dialogue and sort of bring in the country together, I think. And that is perhaps the biggest challenge because even if these crisis right now would be resolved, unless the root causes of economic inequality are addressed, it's likely that Peru will find itself here again in six months or a year in the future -- Eleni.",
