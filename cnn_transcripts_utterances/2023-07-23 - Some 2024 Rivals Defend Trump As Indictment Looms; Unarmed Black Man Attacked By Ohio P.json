      "sentences": "You are live in the CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington. Good evening.There is one big question hanging over the nation's capital this evening. Could this be the week Donald Trump is indicted for trying to overturn the 2020 presidential election? Even the former president himself believes the indictment is coming. Question is when. It would be Trump's third criminal indictment and a potential game changer for the battle for the Republican presidential nomination. But some of Trump's GOP challengers are shrugging off Trump's role in the January 6th insurrection. Among those questioning the case, former Vice President Mike Pence. Here is being whisked off to safety that day. You'll remember some of those images as rioters chanted hang Mike Pence after believing Trump's false claim that Pence could overthrow the election results. Here's what Pence said earlier today on CNN. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MIKE PENCE (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The president's words were reckless that day. I had no right to overturn the election. But, while his words were reckless, based on what I know, I'm not yet convinced that they were criminal. President Trump was wrong on that day and he's still wrong in asserting that I had the right to overturn the election, but what his intentions were, and as you know, criminal charges have everything to do with intent, what the president state of mind was. And I don't honestly know what his intention was that day, whether as he spoke to the crowd, as he tweeted during the riot itself, but for my part, from what I saw, as I've said, his actions were reckless. I believe that history will hold him accountable. I believe that the Republican primary voters know that we need new leadership in this party. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

You don't want to tick off the base, so I can kind of be like, yes, you know, wink and nod, I'm kind of cool with you, bro, but I've got a little bit of a disagreement with Trump. And look, in Trump world, you're either hot or you're cold. And if you want to get some of these Republican voters, you've got to be fully hot. So this kind of middle ground thing isn't working.

But up until frankly the election, there was like something in our hearts that said there's no way Donald Trump can actually win this. Like sanity, somebody is going to come in on a white horse.And I think it's a combination of things, Jim. Every time Donald Trump appears to be down and somebody speaks up, they get crushed because he always comes back. You know, Speaker McCarthy resurrected Donald Trump late January, when he went down to Mar-a-Lago, and so I think these candidates are scared. You're running for like the position of the strongest leader in the world, and you're scared to take on this guy. But it's also this idea that maybe other people will do the hard work, maybe other people like the justice system will do the hard work, and then they can still run for the scraps, to say look, I never went against Donald Trump. I mean, that's Ron DeSantis's plan. It's actually not a terrible plan if you're Ron DeSantis, which is like continue to be Trump light so that if he does go to jail, you're the guy. But listen, I think we're at a point where Republican voters will vote for Trump even if he's in jail so you've got to take him on. Chris Christie is doing that. Will Hurd is doing that.

So that's possible.I do think so. I think he'll continue, again, for having been the strongest man in the world, most powerful man in the world for four years, he's been the victim of literally everything. Like why would you even vote for Donald Trump again because he obviously can't defend himself against anything. He's a huge victim, right? Well, now he just uses victimization. But I think what's going to happen is a further indictment, it's not necessarily going to stop him from winning the nomination because he only needs 51 percent of Republicans, probably less because of the others in the race. But it will guarantee that -- I don't want to say guarantee because it makes people kind of rest. I think it further hinders his ability to win the presidency.

If the polling holds, Trump could potentially have the Republican nomination locked up by then. And we haven't even seen an indictment if it's going to come in the January 6th investigation.

I'm in Jerusalem, just outside of the Israeli Supreme Court where tens of thousands of protesters have now been coming for several days because the legislation that's part of this judicial overhaul package is set to be voted on tomorrow in the Israeli parliament.This specific legislation would take the Supreme Court's ability to declare government actions unreasonable completely away. And that's why these protesters have been coming out here now. They've been coming out for months of course to the streets of Israel, but the protests have really ramped up in recent days because of this legislation. And you can feel the pressure rising. I want to show you this big Israeli police truck right here. This is actually a water cannon truck. This is crowd control and it is ready to go, potentially, if they need to, if the police feel like they want to clear out these protesters from in front of the Israeli Supreme Court. It hasn't been used yet, but we've seen it being used in other protesters in parts of the country. Also happening tonight, though, is a protest in favor of this judicial overhaul. These protesters, they call it a reform. They say that the Israeli Supreme Court and the judiciary is in desperate need of reform, that it's become too powerful and too elitist, and this will help balance things out. But for the protesters here, they fear that this is the beginning of the end of the independence of Israeli judiciary, that would put too much power in the hands of the Israeli government. Protesters here have set up a tent city in the largest park here that's right by the Israeli parliament, saying that they will camp out for as long as necessary. Adding to the pressure is thousands of Israeli military reservists who have said that they will not serve if this legislation passes. That of course brings into question the preparedness of the Israeli military against the many fronts that it faces. And then, Jim, all of this is happening as the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu actually was hospitalized on Saturday evening in a sort of emergency fashion to be fitted with a pacemaker after a heart condition was discovered. So a lot going on with the Israeli prime minister despite being in the hospital, still indicating that he plans to push forward with this vote on Monday saying that it will pass, despite all the pressures from the protesters, from military, from President Joe Biden, and from the Israeli president Michael Herzog who upon landing from his trip to the United States actually tonight went straight to Benjamin Netanyahu's hospital in order to try to negotiate with him to come to some sort of compromise on this legislation.

Before we get to tonight's show, let's talk about the strikes in Hollywood. You talk to a lot of actors. They're not promoting their films right now. We've seen them leave screenings and that sort of thing. It's been amazing to watch. I mean, but one of the questions that just regular folks like you and me have, I supposed, should we go to these movies? Should we be staying away from them if we want to support the actors and writers who are on strike? What do we do? KEVIN FRAZIER, CO-HOST, \"ENTERTAINMENT TONIGHT\": Well, here's the most important thing to understand, that it's not about Margot Robbie or the people out in front. It's about the people behind. And that's who you're supporting, those working actors who are struggling to get by each and every day. Sure, you can go and see and entertain yourself. But remember what this strike is about. You know, outside of my office, there is a holding area for extras and background actors all the time. I see them sitting outside, eating their lunches. And these are the people who are just fighting to get by. They live in Atlanta, they live in Louisiana, they live in Los Angeles, they are in Vancouver. But these working actors, not the people out front making all the billions, is what this strike is all about. We're fighting for their rights. And also, just the scary proposition of what AI can do and how it could change the entertainment business.",

It wasn't a bunch of savages out in the bush who you saved them by kidnapping and enslaving them. But that was the first real shock for folks. But I want to also take you all the way back to Bill Cosby in \"I Spy\"before his legal troubles. You know, we have to remember that Bill Cosby was groundbreaking with what he did on \"I Spy,\" and won three Emmy Awards. Let's talk about Diane Carol and her amazing performance for \"Julia.\" A black woman that you're seeing for the first time as not a housekeeper, but a nurse, who made the ultimate sacrifice. Her husband lost his life in Vietnam and now she was raising her son as a single mother. We also forget a show like \"Get Christy Love.\" You know? That was an ABC show in the '70s that while short-lived, it had an African- American in the lead. But as that ramped up, then you get to \"Toots.\" What you said, was a tsunami, it was an earthquake.
