The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Netflix will hike prices in the U.S. and Canada as soon as the actors strike in Hollywood is resolved. According to the reports, streaming services are charging us about 25 percent more just this year for their services. If you don't want to watch ads. CNN Senior media reporter Oliver Darcy is here to explain all of this. So, Oliver, why are we seeing these price hikes?",

      "sentences": "Well, according to the Wall Street Journal, Netflix is planning to raise the prices after the conclusion of both the writers strike, which they reached a deal last week or two weeks ago, and the actors strike, which is still ongoing. And the studios are still trying to find a solution for that.And that's likely because costs are going to go up. They're going to have to pay writers more money and actors more money, and so passing along perhaps that price to the consumer might make some sense. But the big -- the big overarching theme here is that Wall Street was at one point rewarding subscriptions at any cost. The game -- the name of the game in streaming was just grow your subscription base, pay whatever. Don't worry about profitability. And that's changed in the last year or so. Now there's a big push to be profitable to really get as much money -- squeeze as much money out of the consumer as possible. And so you're seeing companies across this landscape raise prices. And Netflix would be just the latest.",

      "sentences": "I think what they're trying to do here -- you'll notice that they're raising prices, reportedly, according to the Journal, on the ad free tier, the advertisement free zone. And what they really would like to do, these companies, is push the consumer toward the advertiser supported tier. And that's because the tier that relies on advertisements is actually a lot more lucrative for these companies. So while it's cheaper for the consumer, I think Netflix it starts at $6.99 versus $15.99 with ad free. It's actually a way to make more money for Netflix and for these other companies.And that's why you're seeing companies across the board raise the prices on those ad free models pushing the consumer toward the ad supported models. Yesterday, Discovery Plus, which is owned by our parent company Warner Brothers Discovery, they did the same thing. They raised the ad free model of that platform from $6.99 to $8.99. And so I think this is going to be a trend that you're going to continue seeing as these companies again try to increase their profits to satisfy Wall Street.",

Ukraine is getting a military boost from an unlikely source, Iran. For Iran, this is not by choice. The U.S. recently seized weapons and ammunition from the Iranian regime, and CNN has exclusively learned those military assets are being transferred to Ukraine. Let's bring in CNN's Natasha Bertrand, who broke this story. So tell us how this works, Natasha.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Pam. So these are munitions and weapons that the U.S. Navy has seized from ships that are being sent from Iran to Yemen to kind of fuel the war in Yemen and support the Houthis there. And these are ships that the U.S. has essentially intercepted and taken thousands of weapons from, including rifles and other things like grenade launchers and rocket launchers, as well as over a million rounds of ammunition over the last several months.And the argument from advocates has been, why don't we just use all of the weaponry and equipment that we have seized from the Iranians as part of this crackdown on this illicit smuggling route to send it to the Ukrainians instead of just kind of keeping it in storage. Now, apparently, according to central command, they have already started to transfer some of this seized equipment to the Ukrainian forces as recently as Monday. According to a statement that we received from U.S. Central Command, quote: On October 2nd, the U.S. government transferred approximately 1.1 million 7.62-millimeter rounds to the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The government obtained ownership of these munitions on July 20th, 2003, through the Department of Justice's civil forfeiture claims against Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Now this is really key, because this is the legal mechanism through which the U.S. is able to use this seized equipment, these seized munitions to send them to Ukraine. It is through civil forfeiture. Essentially, they work with the Justice Department to request that these assets, these Iranian weapons and equipment be forfeited, essentially allowing the U.S. government to take ownership of them. At that point, the U.S. can then transfer them to a third party, to the Ukrainians as they wish. Now, this is really important because of course, the Iranians have been working with the Russians to support the Russians war in Ukraine. They have been supplying them with drones and other forms of weaponry throughout the course of the war. So this could actually potentially drive a wedge between the Iranians and the Russians, as the U.S. works to take seized Iranian weapons and put them into the Ukraine's hands of the Ukrainian forces. Once the Russians see those Iranian weapons ending up on the battlefield and the Ukrainians of course being replenished in their ammo stockpiles with this equipment, then it could raise some concerns, of course, among the Russians and potentially drive a wedge in that partnership -- Pam.",

Right now, the House is adjourned until next week and no legislation can be passed until a new speaker is elected. This leaves President Biden's request for an additional $24 billion of aid in limbo. It's estimated that Ukraine's current burn rate of weapons and munitions is nearly $2.5 billion per month. The Pentagon has warned that money for Ukraine is now running low, with about $5 billion currently available. That's essentially 2 months' worth of money. Of course, all of this is happening as Ukraine's counteroffensive against Russia grinds on, with little change on the frontline.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But you can just barely see a little crescent over to the left, traveling about 30,000 miles an hour.It comes down here comes by parachute. It lands. And now, they're opening it in the lab. And what they're saying is that the sample they got from this asteroid, the asteroid Bennu, which is somewhere out between us and Mars. When they got this sample, they got more than they expected. So now we're talking about maybe a half pound of material here and they're opening it very carefully, so they don't lose any of it to see what it can tell us. As they say, the sample runneth over.

It's a period of time in which we can learn an awful lot about the makeup of the solar system.So what they're trying to do is analyze all this material, this dust, and these little rocks. To see if they can find signs of organic material. Instead, it will offer generations of scientists a window into the time when the sun and the planets were forming about 4.5 billion years ago. And they're looking for organic material. Anything that would suggest water anywhere else. Thing that would just give them an idea of where we all came from.
