Just ahead, devastating scenes in Maui where dozens have lost their lives to raging wildfires, the latest from Hawaii just ahead.Then horrific violence in Ecuador as a presidential candidate is assassinated after a campaign event less than two weeks before the elections there more on what we know. And Russia on edge after a string of attacks and a massive explosion, a closer look at the mood inside the country. We begin with the breaking news in Hawaii where the death toll from wildfires raging through the Island of Maui has jumped dramatically now to 36. The U.S. Coast Guard and Navy helicopters are being used in search and rescue efforts as firefighters, battle the flames and residents get out any way they can. Hawaii's Lieutenant Governor Sylvia Luke warns that it will take years for Maui to recover from the destruction brought by these wildfires. Hawaii's Director of Economic Development and Tourism spoke to CNN a short time ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Ecuador is under a state of emergency after a presidential candidate was gunned down at a campaign event. It was captured here on video and we want to warn you the footage is disturbing.Fernando Villavicencio was leaving a rally at a school near the capital Quito when shots rang out. Here's the moment it happened. Well, this comes just 10 days before the presidential election as a lawmaker Villavicencio was outspoken about corruption and the violence caused by drug trafficking. Our Rafael Romo joining us now with the latest on the situation and Rafael, we know that Ecuador has been rocked by gang violence in recent years, but this is really a shocking event for the country.

Well the attack happened right after the presidential candidate had finished a rally at a school in Quito Ecuador's capital, according to campaign aides, contacted by CNN and a video that appears to show the moment of the attack.All of a sudden, a burst of gunfire was heard as he was getting into a waiting vehicle. Several people were hit by the bullets, including Fernando Villavicencio, a 59 year old activist, journalist and politician who was running in Ecuador's presidential elections to be held in less than two weeks August 20. As Villavicencio gets in the backseat of the vehicle at least 12 gunshots can be heard. A policeman quickly closes the door behind Villavicencio and many people are seen taking cover from the gunfire including his security detail. The Ecuadorian Attorney General's office later said that at least nine people were injured in the attack including a candidate for the National Assembly and two Police officers, Christina. Current Ecuadorian President Guillermo Lasso later said on social media that he is outraged and shocked. He called the attack and assassination. Lasso also expressed solidarity and sent his condolences to Villavicencio's wife and daughters. He also vowed that this crime will not go unpunished, Christina, back to you.",

      "sentences": "Yes, certainly, it's a change of focus and the change really of Ukraine controlling the narrative. This is a place that has been the focus of Russian advances, Russian investment, frankly, of artillery and troops over the past week.So it does appear to be having enough of an impact that Ukrainian officials have issued that mandatory evacuation order, Kupyansk were there months ago, a large enough town for this if there are indeed enough people still living in the wreckage there. Member law has gone back since it was liberated to mean that the Ukrainians are concerned about Russian activity around. In fact, Ukrainian officials suggesting that as many as 600 artillery attacks may have occurred there in the last 24 hours or so this is right up to the northeast, from where I'm standing. And where Ukraine's counter offensive is putting most of its focus. And so you could argue this is perhaps a bid by the Russians to distract Ukrainian forces that are trying to amass here. Perhaps take some pressure off the slightly southern focus of Russia's previous advances, Bakhmut. It is unclear what their larger strategic goal is because Kharkiv the city, well, that's pushed the Russians back significantly. And this is some drive away from there. But it may be a bit, too by a bit of breathing space, perhaps for the Russians in the north, and possibly withdraw Ukrainian resources that may otherwise have been sent to the southern front here where I should say we are still hearing reports of heavy fighting. Russian officials suggesting that a lot of the settlements along the front line where Ukraine is trying to advance are getting hit quite hard. We've seen ourselves that there are gradual moves forward by Ukrainian officials. And then there's a whole separate narrative too frankly in Kherson, the Dnieper River of suggestions that Ukrainian forces there made a brief crossing and of causing some trouble for the Russians there too. So a lot moving, I should just give you some context about the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. That is essentially concerns about the main power supply. There is a backup supply the Russian officials managing it so they're going to get that main power supply back on track. They think so a sign of potentially a crisis down the line, but at the moment, known it seems no major cause for alarm, Christina.",

      "sentences": "Well, I think it has a pretty major impact. And I think you're absolutely right. It's a string of attempts, but it also is becoming almost a daily occurrence. And, you know, we have those two very separate areas. On the one hand, you have the area around Sevastopol in occupied Crimea.But you also have the Russian capital as well. If we look at Sevastopol, that seems like a pretty straight forward military target. That is the main base of the Russian Black Sea fleet. And the Russian was saying that they shot down two drones there near the Sevastopol area and also took down nine additional Ukrainian drones over the Black Sea. Some of them using the electronic countermeasures, but some of them are also being shot down as well. But I think that the Moscow situation is certainly one that is very troubling right now for the Russian leadership. You have those two drones that the Russians say they shot down tonight, and I was sort of looking at the area where that happened. One of it was around a Kaluga, which I would say is around 150 kilometers southwest of Moscow, a new restring of town called the garden rings, very beautiful towns Kaluga, by the way, as well, that's still pretty far away from the capital. But the other one is near the sort of beltway highway around Moscow road called the MKAD, which means that it was pretty close to actually being on the territory of the Russian capital. And of course, there were also drone attacks that happened yesterday that were foiled also by the Russians and near Moscow as well. And then last week, of course, we had attacks that took place and actually hit the financial district in Moscow. So certainly something that will be troubling and even the spokesman for the Kremlin said at that point in time, it's a security threat, Christina.",

So you were mentioning the winds and what led to all of this. You're right. It's basically a two part scenario, we had Hurricane Dora that was just south of the Hawaiian Islands a good 700 miles at its closest approach.And then we have this strong area of high pressure to the north. So these both working together created very strong winds funneling between the strong areas of low pressure, which was Dora and the strong high to the north. So it was the perfect scenario for just complete destruction across Maui. And the Hawaiian Islands created very strong winds. We saw wind gusts as high as 82 miles per hour, but a lot of wind gusts reported between 55 and 65 miles per hour. You mentioned the winds are decreasing they are 15 to 20 mile per hour winds. This is pretty much right now. And then as we go throughout the day, you can see a hyena right around 15 to 20 miles per hour winds, and then they'll steadily decrease. Of course, we're not going to have completely calm conditions because it's Hawaii. We constantly have a breeze across the island, but about 10 to 15 are definitely normal. So here are the hotspots that we saw, according to from NASA imagery, and then they just the smoke just blew and the fires just blew down the mountain side of the hillside. The hotspots detected over Lahaina right now you can see just a couple and then compared to yesterday where we had all of the fires and a lot of hot spots. So you can see it definitely improving across there. A lot of that is because all of this is already burned. So there's nothing more to burn but at least the fire control is getting better.

August has been particularly fraught with a spike in small scale drone strikes on Russian cities, including the capital. Also been at least two dozen arson attacks on military recruitment centers across the country. Like this one in the Far Eastern republic of Buryatia, home of more casualties in the Ukraine conflict than any other Russian region. But arrests and nationwide Russian officials say vulnerable citizens like pensioners are being duped into fire bombings by Ukrainian agents posing as police or creditors calling in loans. I was called by bankers says this arrested woman and I thought they were the FSB, she says. But a spokesman for one Russian partisan group denies Russians have been coerced, telling CNN that if people weren't angry with the authorities, they wouldn't do anything, the Kremlin he says wants to hide the true level of discontent. At the moment there's no real evidence the latest factory explosion was anything more than the devastating safety breach officials claim. That with the impact of war now increasingly felt at home.
