There were protests to over Israel's war Hamas. At one point, President Obama said, you can't just talk and not listen. That's what the other side does. As for the other side, we're just now hearing from Donald Trump for the first time about his trip to New York. He was there to attend the wake of a fallen police officer. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I've never seen so many police. I've never seen so many firemen, a lot of firemen. They view it, you know, in a very similar way, and I understand that.

We know that it was interrupted multiple times throughout the evening. Stephen Colbert, it sounded like, led actually very substantive conversation about the situation in the Middle East, all three presidents weighing in on this issue, all three of them, of course, very familiar with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. You know, one woman who came out of this event that I talked to briefly, she said she paid $500 for her ticket. She said she was generally impressed by the way that the three presidents responded to these live interruptions during the evening, that they tried to be not critical of the interruptions and tried to be empathetic to the situation in Gaza. But I think this was such a clear reminder of how much the situation in Israel and the Middle East has been a political problem for President Biden, too.",

      "sentences": "Right. There're several important pieces there. Number one, the Democrats are trying to say that all of our top guns are on the same field, all-hands-on-deck. And, look, President Biden needs that. He's struggling right now and he needs all the help he can get financially. They need that money.Fundraising does not win campaigns. But if you spend that money wisely, you can win a campaign because you have the money and he has an advantage right now. You will not see George W. Bush raising money for Donald Trump. You will not even see his own vice president, Mike Pence, raising money for Donald Trump. So, it does tell you that the big heavy hitters in the Democratic Party are going to try to help President Biden. Now, President Biden is underwater on the economy, underwater on immigration, underwater on other issues, has a historically low approval rating. He has a lot of problems. So, he needs that money. He needs that money. They're already on television. It costs more money if you're an incumbent president because Air Force One costs more than another plane. What is Trump doing? Number one, he's playing to the base. Crime here in New York, he's going to Michigan next week to do immigration. That plays to the base, but it also plays to the suburbs. Biden has a lot of cracks in his coalition. Trump has one giant problem, which is the suburbs. That's his kryptonite. And crime and immigration can play in the suburbs. The issue plays well. Sometimes Trump overdoes it with his tone. So, we'll see how that goes. And the crime debate is interesting because, overall, the violent crime is down. But personal property crime is up, motor vehicle thefts are up, and it gets a lot of attention on local news and on a certain network that is clearly trying to help the former president. They play it up more than maybe out of context a bit.",

      "sentences": "If you look at that right there, 47-44, so we would say no clear leader because you're averaging the latest three or four national polls, which is a smart way to do it. Don't focus on any one poll. I would also argue as we get closer to the election 200-plus days away.Now, national polls are less meaningful and you want to look at the battleground states. However, if you look at that 44 percent for President Biden and our poll of polls just at the beginning of the month, he was at 46 or 47 percent. So, again, his share of the vote is down a little bit. He's struggling right now. I would argue that we need to pay attention to the third party candidates increasingly, not just Trump versus Biden. Because if Trump is at 47 and Biden is at 44, where's the rest of that vote, right? And so you look at that, number one, the third party candidates. And then, again, the most important thing, where do they get on the ballot, which states are they on the ballot, and then try to study who they're helping or hurting, as you look at that. The general thinking is, if you lower the bar, you can win with less than 50 percent, that helps Trump. But I think state-by-state, it's going to be complicated.",

What broader cultural or social commentary is she trying to say with Cowboy Carter? BLACKWELL:  Well, in addition to the genre, she also addresses the question of race in music. There's a track, Spaghetti, that starts with Linda Martell saying that genres are a funny little concept. Now, if you never heard the name, Linda Martell, she was the first black female country singer to have real commercial and chart success. First to sing at the Grand Ole Opry, first to perform on that old show, Hee-Haw, and she was pilloried from moving from gospel and R&amp;B into country and faced issues on plantation records, if you can imagine, in the 1960s, a black woman singing on that label. There's a track also on this album called Blackbird, which is a play- on and using the original lyrics of the Beatles' Blackbird. And Paul McCartney back in the 60s, he said that he wrote this thinking not about a Blackbird but a woman in the civil rights era. Well, in this version Beyonce sings it with three other black women in country. Listen to a portion of Blackbird here. Sara, there is a lot on this album. She says that it's not a country album.
