New messages into OUTFRONT from the Nashville shooter to a friend just moments before the rampage, including why the shooter was reaching out to her specifically. That friend is my guest.Plus, his 12-year-old daughter was put on notice by police for anti- war drawings, and now, he has been sentenced to a Russian penal colony for calling the war an occupation. Tonight, though, he is on the run, and his lawyer is speaking to OUTFRONT. And Tucker, Hannity, Ingraham all could be taking the witness stand as Fox News starts to cozy up with Trump again. Let's go OUTFRONT. Good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, the breaking news -- there are new messages, direct text messages just into OUTFRONT, messages sent by the Nashville shooter to a childhood friend moments before the attack. One of these new messages reads and I, quote, I wanted to tell you first, because you are the most beautiful person I've ever seen and known all my life. My family doesn't know what I'm about to do. Now, in a moment, I'm going to speak to the woman who received this message, and she's sharing more messages with us because this comes as Nashville police are releasing disturbing new details about the shooter who killed six people, including three 9-year-olds at that private elementary school in Nashville. And they admit, though, but they still do not know why the killer opened fire in the first place. What we do know is that Audrey Hale was able to legally purchased a total of seven different firearms and was under doctor's care for an emotional disorder. It also comes as we're seeing the heart stopping bodycam footage of officers racing through the school and eventually confronting the shooter. Now, we want to warn you that the video is disturbing and what you're about to see here begins his officers start to search classrooms for the shooter. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So the small, isolated hole from a nine millimeter bullet fired by a handgun in blue, and then in orange, that's the gaping exit wound from the AR-15. The difference here is very stark. So when you talk about the type of weapon used, it sounds like you're just saying clearly from a medical perspective, to state the obvious, there's a huge difference.",

We learned through sources that they believed are after that, we need to bring in someone to rebut, to button up our case. We saw David Pecker going on Monday. But Michael Cohen's name was also floated because Costello's role was to attack Michael Cohen's credibility undermined his narrative about how this hush money payments were executed.

I want to warn you that some of the images that you are going to see in this report are graphic. Ed Lavandera is OUTFRONT. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ED LAVANDERA, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  This dramatic video captured what appears to be the beginning of the fire that spread through this Mexican migrant detention facility in Juarez late Monday night. You can see flames and smoke filling the detention area in a matter of seconds, migrants scrambling for their lives and several Mexican immigration officers walking away from the area while migrants were left locked in the cells. Eventually, thick smoke fills the area, making it impossible to see anything else. Outside, witnesses described hearing migrants screaming for help as fire spread through the detention center. Rescue workers responded, pulling people from the smoke and flames. This woman says there was smoke everywhere. Everyone was running for their lives. But all the men were left locked inside and the door to let them out was never open. At least 40 people died, 29 others were injured in the blaze. Mexico's president says the migrants started the fire when they found out they were being deported. The president says they protested by setting fire to mattresses inside the building where they were being detained. The video from inside the detention center doesn't clearly show how or who started the fire, but several mattresses can be seen on the ground by the steel jail bars. Mexico's national migration institute and attorney general are investigating the cause of the fire as many questions remain.",
