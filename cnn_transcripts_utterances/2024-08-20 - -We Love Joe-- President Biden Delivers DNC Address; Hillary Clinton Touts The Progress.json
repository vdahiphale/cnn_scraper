I did several months ago, all Democrats, but went on to Pennsylvania and she said something interesting to me, Kasie. She said, what if we lose this election? And another lady reply to the group texts and she said, well, two of my neighbors who are moderate Republicans, who were voting, who voted for Biden before, were preparing to vote for him again, are now on the fence that they may actually vote for Trump. And so I think there's an interesting dilemma here for Democrats. I thought the presidents speech was great politics aside. I kind of felt bad because I thought to myself as a younger person at some point, I'm going to get older and I cant imagine spending half of my life working for something and then people sent up, Shermichael, you're too old buddy, you got to go and that's sort of what I saw and felt for the president just as a person taken off the partisan hat.

And I actually think it was really important in part of the centerpiecing of Joe Biden at the end of the night, despite all of our East Coast friends, it was great for our West Coast friends. But despite all our East Coast friends, it's the idea that this was alead-up to passing the baton. This was a lead-up to passing the torch, that surprise appearance by Kamala coming up, Kamala Harris coming out later, coming out at the end of Biden speech, this idea that they are working together, that they are a team, but that this is also highlighting everything that Joe Biden has done and given to this party. There is a reason that it wasn't just Joe Biden who got emotional. I'm pretty sure that we saw Tim Walz crying in the audience as he was watching as he was watching this play out, we saw people kind of wistfulness from the audience that was trying to -- the original delegates who had cast all of these votes for Joe Biden, who almost immediately turn their attention to Harris, but did so with the knowledge that they had put Biden there and that they had been ready to support him despite the debacle of the age thing. The other thing that I think is important here, too, is that where somebody like Hubert Humphrey, who becomes the nominee in 1968, has the baggage of the LBJ's administration in Vietnam and is really under the weight of that. There are people fighting on the convention floor and fighting outside of the convention when this happens. That's not happening here. What we're seeing instead is the transition from Joe Biden from president to Joe Biden, the historical figure who gave everything for his party, who did the thing that was necessary to do when the country asked him to do it. And that is his legacy. And we could see it on his face, too, I think at the end of the night, there's still a degree of anger over what happened, but he went out on his terms and now he has cemented his place in history.",

When you're talking about 10 to 12 inches of rain in such a short period of time, doesn't take much to see that flooding ensue, and of course that caused the state of emergency across the state. Now look at this. This is the 48 hour rainfall total, and you can see the southwestern sections of Connecticut and into long island, northern long island. That is where we saw some of the heaviest rainfall totals. Now, fortunately, the bulk of the precipitation has come to an end with the exception of extreme northern New England. So, Northern Vermont, New Hampshire, and into Maine. This is all because of an upper level low that continues to kind of meander across the area, doesn't take much to trigger off more showers across the region, but they should remain light, maybe another half an inch of rain for those northern sections. But Connecticut into Massachusetts as well as New York, your rainfall chances pretty much diminishing through the day. Mild conditions left in its wake. That is the good story about the Upper Midwest, but the same cannot be said, unfortunately, for today in Texas. Another hot day, and you factor in the humidity levels, that's why the National Weather Service has these excessive heat warnings in place across the majority of the state?
