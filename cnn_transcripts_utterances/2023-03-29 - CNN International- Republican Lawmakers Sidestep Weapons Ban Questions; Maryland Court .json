His attorney says that there is no basis for retraumatizing him. Syed had spent more than two decades behind bars for the 1999 killing of his ex-girlfriend before his release last year. CNN's Brynn Gingras has more.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: The judges in the appellate court, essentially saying that hearing late last year where Syed's conviction was overturned, that hearing needs to be redone. Essentially siding with the victim's family in this case, Hae Min Lee, who was the ex girlfriend of Syed. Essentially, they said that her brother didn't have the adequate amount of time to prepare for that hearing. Was only notified about it just a few days before it happened. And because he lived in California didn't have time to actually traveled to Maryland, and attend that hearing in person, which violated his right. So that's why the appellate judges says that hearing needs to be overturned. Now they went into detail about how this doesn't mean it's double jeopardy, essentially saying he's not being prosecuted twice for this case. Instead the same conclusions could come at the end of that hearing when it happens. His conviction could be reinstated or again could be overturned. Certainly a gamble for Syed who we have reached out to you, but haven't heard back yet. Of course, the family of the victim here celebrating this, saying they're very pleased with the judge's decision and that we don't know yet the date of that hearing. The appellate court judges saying that they are giving 60 days for both sides to sort of figure out what happens from here. I'm Brynn Gingras in New York, CNN. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

He's also traveled to areas around Bakhmut, Zaporizhia, Dnipro and Kherson in recent days. Scott McLean joins me now for more on all of this.

Though China hasn't actually called the Russian invasion of Ukraine an invasion.So, President Zelenskyy says look, he wants to speak with President Xi. He wants him to come to Kyiv. He says that the two leaders haven't been in touch or had been in touch prior to the full-scale invasion but haven't been in touch since then. Though there has been an effort, according to Kyiv, to broker at least a call between Xi and Zelenskyy to discuss China's peace proposal. That proposal involves a ceasefire and a political settlement. Though Zelenskyy initially last week said that, look, that would only allow Russia to sort of freeze the conflict in place and then regroup stronger. NOBILO: And Zelenskyy also mentioned in this interview Bakhmut, the city that has taken on so much additional symbolic strategic significance because of the focus on it for all of the last month.

But Zelenskyy said that, look, if Ukraine were to give up Bakhmut, were to withdraw, then that would only allow President Putin to sense that Ukraine is weak and, in his words, would push, push, push further into the country.He says that he also worries that he would get pressure not only from international allies. but from within his own country to compromise with Russia and to reach some kind of negotiated settlement. Which is not what Zelenskyy wants to do at this moment in time. We've also heard from Ukraine's Deputy Defense Minister who says that look, Ukraine is not holding Bakhmut for political expediency. She insists that, look, there are good military reasons to hold this city. And they will hold it as long as there's a good reason militarily to do so. And at the moment that seems to be -- to put it very bluntly, according to the Ukrainians -- to kill as many Russian troops as possible. Because they have a huge numbers advantage on the front lines around Bakhmut, and so Ukrainians are essentially trying to wear down that numbers advantage that they have there in preparation for potentially a counterattack down the road. Ukrainians also say that the situation is under control. In fact, they say that they shot down a Russian bomber just yesterday.",
