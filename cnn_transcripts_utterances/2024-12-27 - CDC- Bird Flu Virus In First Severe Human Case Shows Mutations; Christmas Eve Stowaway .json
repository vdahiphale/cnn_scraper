I'm joined by former trump white house coronavirus response coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx to discuss what this means for you and your family.Plus, a second stowaway incident on the same airline for Delta in just a matter of weeks. How does this keep happening this time it was on a flight from Seattle to Honolulu, how this happened again. We're going to dive into that. And inside the secret drone factory fueling Russian attacks in Ukraine. New CNN reporting just out this morning. I'm Pamela Brown in Washington. Jim has the morning off and you're in the CNN NEWSROOM. And we begin with a concerning new CDC report on the first severe human case of bird flu in the U.S. Samples taken from a patient Louisiana show mutations that could make it easier for this virus to spread from person to person. Now right now there's no evidence it has passed -- it's been passed along to anyone else and the CDC says risk to the public remains low. But experts warn a single mutation like this could potentially lead to another pandemic. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DEAN BLUMBERG, INFECTIOUS DISEASE EXPERT, UC DAVIS CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL: The virus may mutate and become more easily transmitted person to person. So, the more this virus circulates and specifically co-circulates with human strains that's going to increase the odds of the virus evolving to more human-to-human transmission and that -- that of course could signal another pandemic.

And if you go to the CDC website you can see that they're monitoring more than 10, 000 exposures but they've only tested 530. What does that mean? That means we're not testing enough and we know from other viruses that a lot of the spread can be asymptomatic.So, we're kind of have our head in the sand about how widespread this is from the zoonotic standpoint from the animal to human standpoint.

And we just have to admit that and say, what are we going to do? Where is our school guidance for the next pandemic? That's what we need. We need practical school guidance. I was out on the road keeping universities and schools open. How did we do it? Testing. Once a week testing. Didn't quarantine. Just removed the acute cases. And they didn't have any campus spread. So, we know how to do it, but we're not using everything that we learned and applying it. Because now we're just arguing about individuals on either side rather than saying, let's find a practical place in the middle where we can all agree, this is going to be our response. This is how we can keep the schools open. And it really comes down to being able to see what viruses are circulating. That's why I keep coming back to testing.",

And what should we all be doing right now? I mean, should we just avoid it's the holidays? Should we avoid gathering with a lot of people? What do we do now? BIRX: No, I think to me, testing is fundamental because I have my children test and I have the grandchildren test because we're still protecting people. My grand -- my mother is 96. She hasn't gotten COVID. She's been in a multi-generational hassle. So, all of these things are possible if you give people the information that they need to protect each other. And I think of what we learned, anything from the last pandemic, education is much more important than mandating. Mandated at the beginning because we had nothing. But as soon as we had tests, you can see we had the Reopen America in April and it was all about now testing and then having therapeutics in the summer and then having vaccines. That's the way you approach a pandemic. But fundamental to that was starting with testing. And I think coming out of this, we should have really clear guidelines for schools about testing. Schools before covid used to have flu breaks where they would send children home for a week or two because they had such widespread flu. If we had tested and they had removed the asymptomatic cases and the early diagnosis cases once a week, you wouldn't have had the flu spread. Now we know it's really important to keep kids in school and keep them in school now. So, keeping them in school by applying 21st century solutions is so key. And we have them.

The attempt happened on Christmas Eve and according to officials, the stowaway went through security screening, but without a boarding pass. The unticketed passenger was discovered as Delta flight 487 was taxing on the runway. How does this happen again? Joining us now with CNN's Carlos Suarez. So, Carlos, can you help us answer that question? How does it happen to get on the same airline? CARLOS SUAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on-camera): Well, Pamela, there are so many unanswered questions. We know that this passenger was able to clear a TSA security checkpoint the night before that flight on Christmas Eve, meaning that this passenger who again did not have a ticket was able to get past this checkpoint and was in this terminal for several hours before getting on that flight again without a boarding pass. As you noted that Delta flight was taxing getting ready for departure when the flight crew finally realized that someone that was on board that plane should not be on that plane. And so, they decided to go back to the gate. It's at that point that we're told that for reasons that haven't been explained yet. The passenger was able to get off the plane before law enforcement arrived at the gate and so law enforcement gets there and then has to figure out exactly where this passenger is. We're told that at some point they were able to figure out that the passenger was in a bathroom and so they were able to detain that person. Now in response to all of this, Delta Airlines released a statement that read quote, as there are no matters more important than safety and security Delta people followed procedures to have an unticketed passenger removed from the flight and then apprehended. They went on to say, we apologize to our customers for the delay in their travels and thank them for their patience and cooperation. Pamela the name of this passenger has not been released by authorities. Though we're told that the passenger was detained on a trespassing charge.",

Thank you for sharing part of your holiday week with us.So, let's begin with CNN's reporting on this Russian drone factory. You heard Clare really lay it out. How significant is Russia's strategic shift to this technology, in your view? MIKE LYONS, RET. U.S. ARMY: Hi, Pamela. Happy holidays. Yes, I do believe it's very strategic, and I think this is all part of this 2025 strategy that they have in order to increase their drone capability. As they recognize that they have an advantage here, they bring in workers from China and from Africa and the like, parts from China as well, using Iranian-based designs here. And making those decoys is just as important as making the actual Shahed drones there that they use to fly. And so, they can quickly overwhelm the Ukraine air defense platform. So, these are kamikaze drones. They fly in one direction only. They fly just to kill. They're not used to return or anything like that back to Russia. So, I think this is part of a ramp-up that you're going to see Russia do in 2025 when it comes to trying to get some kind of technology advantage over Ukraine. And the only way that Ukraine really will be able to defense is if Western countries continue to pour in the air defense platforms, both anti-ballistic missiles as well as some of the small arms, because you could take some of these drones out with some of the small arms once they get into close range.",

That would likely be a suicide mission.I don't think that they're capable of hitting it. And I think that's why Russia put it in this place. It's an area that it had been for economic advancement inside of Russia, whatever that means. But it's well outside kind of prying eyes of Western satellites and the like. You could see some of the satellite shots that were got there. They're hard to get. So, I think that's really why they put it there.

There was going into Russia.There was clearly a mistake made on the ground. Not allowing that plane to land inside of Russia is also unforgivable from an air traffic controller perspective. They clearly wanted it to outside of Russia. They didn't want any evidence there. But now those black boxes are inside of Kazakhstan and those authorities will have them. So, I do think that will show that the pilots will say that they were hit with something that came out of nowhere, likely air defense systems.
