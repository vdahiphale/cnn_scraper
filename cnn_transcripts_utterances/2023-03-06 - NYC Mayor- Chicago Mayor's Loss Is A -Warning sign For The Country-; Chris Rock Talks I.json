It's exploited by some but I think mayors around the country are actually trying to solve it. Not just demagogues on the issue, not just use it as a political talking point, but it will be a part of every mayor's race in every major city in America.",

But I will say that crime is certainly something that we have to make sure that we're addressing. You can't just look at certain statistics, people do need to feel safe.That's why I think you are hearing the mayor say a lot more about their investments both in policing. But also defining what police work and what violence prevention is going to be. We have moved far beyond kind of that defund the police conversational era. And I will say you will be hard-pressed to find many mayors, whoever really adopted that rhetoric, even to the extent that there were changes in funding or allocation. Everybody said police departments are important. Public safety is vital. And I think it will be probably the number one issue in most every mayor's race, and folks are trying to avoid certainly what they just saw in Chicago.",

I think for all of our communities, Chicago is one of them, Kansas City is, New York, lots of American cities, violent crime has existed for a while. It isn't new with just Lori Lightfoot. It isn't new with my election or mayor Adams or anyone else. But we're being tasked with how to fix it.And for us, we recognize that substantial investments in policing, right? $280 million a year we spent on the police in Kansas City. This will be a plan that's 30 million over five years. So, 6 million in violence prevention, 280 million on the enforcement side, we think is something that at least allows us to start on things like how do we get jobs for youth? How do we make sure we're investing in mental health treatment for so many, particularly in our homeless population that might be impacted by a violent crime or our perpetrators themselves? That's why we're looking at that balance. And we're supportive of any administration efforts to try to put more money into violence prevention, in addition to hiring cops, having jails going through all the same things we've been doing my entire life.",

And I think what some people forget when they're having these dialogues about violent crime is that it tugs at us each and every day.There is not a mayor in this country, certainly at least not me, who doesn't look at the numbers every day, doesn't learn the stories of people, hasn't been impacted by violent crime and homicides in my own family in my own community. The reason I said that four years ago when I was endorsed by the Fraternal Order of police was because somebody needs to finally stand up and say we're going to be committed to making a difference and a change. Being a mayor is not just about going to ribbon cuttings and celebrating Super Bowl wins. Although that's certainly fun. It's also about making sure that we're trying to do everything possible. So, you ask about $30 million for violence prevention. I certainly hope it works. If it doesn't, then we will try something new until we can guarantee that this city will be safer like you've seen other cities change over time.

I didn't have any entanglements.(END VIDEO CLIP) [11:40:20] ELAM: Now, that entanglement references to the fact that Jada Pinkett Smith, Will Smith's wife had had one of her read-table talks talking about how she had an entanglement with one of their son's friends and then talked about it with Will Smith on that show. So, Chris's point in this stand-up was that she has hurt him way more than he could ever have hurt either of them with his joke last year at the Oscars when he made a GI Jane II joke because of Jada Pinkett Smith's haircut. And then it was after that that Will Smith got up on stage and slapped him. He did go on to say though, that he is not a victim, and that you'll never see him on Oprah or Gail crying because he took that hit like Pacquiao. The other thing that he did say too that was interesting, he's like people have always asked why I didn't fight back in that moment. And he said it's because he has parents and they taught him not to fight in front of white people. And then he dropped the mic. That was at the last ten minutes of his show, Kate, that's what he had to say. But making it very clear that he has strong feelings. His eyes were very intense while he was in his monologue, but it was still very pointed.",

We've seen record numbers of anti- Semitic incidents across the country in recent years, an explosion of anti-AAPI Hate, you know, the emergence of like, radical ugly anti- Zionism. The truth of the matter is that we need to engage the public in an ongoing way to make sure people understand that prejudice should have no place in our popular culture.
