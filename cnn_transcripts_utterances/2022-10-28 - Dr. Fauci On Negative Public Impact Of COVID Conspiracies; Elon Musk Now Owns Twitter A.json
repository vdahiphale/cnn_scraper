We reference them as a point of caution.We're at a moment, right now, of extreme polarization, where calls for violence are leading to actual violence. We cannot pretend that these are all isolated fringe events. There are people in mainstream-accepted society, elected officials, TV anchors, others, who have been creating a permission structure that is helping, to open the door, to this violence, a permission structure created, when they dehumanize opponents, or smear them, or belittle or make light of acts or threats of violence, against their perceived foes, or spread conspiracy theories. And while it might feel as though the political divides of the present are too vast to bridge, now is the moment that we all need to stop and think about our common humanity, or at the very least, the basic golden rule, and how you want to be treated. Political violence in America is no longer a threat. It's a reality. Two years ago, a lawyer dressed up, like a FedEx delivery man, and showed up, at the New Jersey home, of U.S. District Judge Esther Salas. Her son, Daniel, celebrating his birthday that day, ran to open the door. That lawyer opened fire. Daniel was killed. His father was shot, three times, but survived. Judge Salas is with us tonight. Judge Salas, thank you so much, for being here. I'm sorry, it's under these conditions. And what a horrible - what a horrible task, a calling, you have. What was the first thing that went through your mind, today, when you heard about Paul Pelosi? JUDGE ESTHER SALAS, U.S. DISTRICT COURT, DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY, SON KILLED IN 2020 HOME INVASION: Good evening, Mr. Tapper. Thank you for having me on. The first thing that came to my mind was just sadness, where we have come to in this country. Words matter. The way we treat each other, it matters. And we see what words can do. And we see what happened, in my case. This gentleman came to my house, as you said, and took our only child, as we say, our blessing from God, and changed our lives forever. Words matter, Mr. Tapper. And judicial security now matters more than ever. Judicial security, sir, is a matter of national security. And we need to pass this bipartisan law, to protect judges, to protect democracy, and I'm going to say, to protect, really, humanity. We need to start working together and change the course and the direction, the dangerous direction that we are headed, in this country.",

Judges every day are facing repeated attacks, verbal attempts. The numbers are over 4,000 at this, from last year. We need to act now. And we need to do it now. And this is an urgent matter. And these attacks, like the one, on Mr. Pelosi, are just showing where we are. We're living in a rising tide of tremendous violence. A real, clear and present danger exists. And it exists, right now, for the judiciary. And we have the ability to pass this bill. And I would say that this is a bill that is a bipartisan, bicameral. We actually have, I last counted, we have 121 representatives, Congress, men and women, congressmen and congresswomen that have signed on, from both the Republican side and the Democratic - Democrat side. And we are ready to pass this bill. I would also now note that the Senate has been working in a bipartisan way. And we have people, like Senator Graham, co-sponsoring this bill, Senator Cotton, who supports this bill. Senator Cruz signed on as a co-sponsor. This bill is bipartisan.

Twitter says the $44 billion deal closed, last night, ending a months-long saga, and averting a major court battle that was set to begin today.Less than 24 hours in, Musk has already taken his first actions. He fired several of Twitter's top leaders, including its CEO, CFO and top lawyer. These abrupt changes may come, as little surprise, for a guy, who revels in stunts, such as carrying a porcelain sink, into Twitter's headquarters, acting out, \"Let that sink in!\" \"Elon Musk is now your boss!\" That would appear as the news is sinking employee morale and sending it right down the drain. Sources tell CNN that this morning, Twitter staff still had not been notified, of the changes, even as media outlets were recording the news of the firings. But the impact of Musk's takeover goes far beyond Twitter's employees. Musk tweeted last night \"The bird is freed,\" a hint at his preferred policies, which he says would expand the boundaries of free speech. Here to discuss what this all means, is tech entrepreneur, and business professor at NYU, Scott Galloway. Scott, good to see you again. The last time we spoke, you called it. You said this deal would definitely go through. Now that it has, what do you make of Elon Musk's actions so far?",

But the conspiracy theory that endures throughout time is anti-Semitism. And it's the quickest to kind of go to language around violence. And I don't think it's any accident that we have this enablement, by people, on the right, who refuse to condemn it. And quite frankly, people on the left, who conflate empathy, for mental illness, or this weird perverted view of free speech, and don't condemn this, out of hand. I think that what you saw with Adidas, and Gap, and Creative Artists Agency, immediately walking away from Kanye was an important move. I just don't think it's an accident that we're seeing an increase in hate crimes. We're seeing an attack on the Speaker of the House's husband. I think all of this is related. Angela Aaron's (ph) talked about a manifest shallowness. Neutrality in the face of evil, and this is evil. It's not neutrality. And unfortunately, these platforms are being weaponized.
