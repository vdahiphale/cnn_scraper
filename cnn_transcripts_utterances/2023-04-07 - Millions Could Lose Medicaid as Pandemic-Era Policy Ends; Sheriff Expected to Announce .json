I mean, this will disproportionately impact children and of course, people in the black and Latin X communities. But right now the most important thing to do for Medicaid recipients is to get online, go to your state's Medicaid portals and update your contact information, your financial information.And do not forget to press the Renew button; renewing your enrollment will be paramount. There are two main things though to be I guess people are keeping an eye on that they're concerned about. And you mentioned to John 15 million people, they're expected to potentially lose their Medicaid insurance coverage. This is primarily for people with low incomes, not because and about half of those 15 million are expected to lose their coverage not because there are - they're no longer eligible. But because perhaps mistakes will be made along the way by state employees, or the Medicaid recipients are not aware of this \"Unwinding period\" and they will fail to re-verify their information and re-enroll. Also, to keep in mind, the biggest challenge right now for advocates is just getting the word out, making people aware that this is even happening. Right now, 14 state, states will have about 14 months I should say to re-verify and dis-enroll people from the Medicaid rolls. And I spoke with Courtney McKnight. She is an enrollment specialist here in Georgia. And she said yes, that has been the biggest hurdle getting people to know that this is even happening. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

As you'd imagine, John, it's going to be a monumental task, especially for many states that are dealing with staffing shortages, and high turnover rates, which means that there will be some inexperienced workers who will potentially make mistakes and perhaps deem someone ineligible for Medicaid, even if they are eligible.So, the best thing to do right now, what's in your power as a Medicaid enrollee is to get to your state's Medicaid portal and update all your information and re-enroll now, don't wait for the state to contact you that you need to do so in this short window, John.",
