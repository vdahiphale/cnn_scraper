Well, the U.S. president-elect has announced that the Tesla CEO and Vivek Ramaswamy will lead what he calls the Department of Government Efficiency.Trump says they will be in charge of cutting bureaucracy, excessive regulations and wasteful speech spending. Musk released a statement saying, quote, this will send shockwaves through the system and anyone involved in government waste, which is a lot of people. Trump, meantime, says a smaller government with more efficiency and less bureaucracy will be the perfect gift to America on the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. I am confident they will succeed. Now, the incoming president has also announced a number of other picks for his cabinet and administration. He has asked Fox News host Pete Hegseth to be his defense secretary. Hegseth served in the U.S. Army in Iraq and Afghanistan and is known for his work as a veterans rights advocate. Trump has chosen John Radcliffe to be his CIA director. The former Republican congressman from Texas served as director of national intelligence for part of the first Trump administration. The president-elect has picked longtime friend Steve Witkoff as special envoy to the Middle East. Real estate developer is also a chair of Trump's presidential inaugural committee. And Trump has announced Mike Huckabee as his choice for U.S. Ambassador to Israel. The former Arkansas governor has a long history of supporting Israel, including its claims to the West Bank. And he made this controversial comment about Palestinians in 2008. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He said, we want your team to work like tireless bloodhounds. Don't leave any stone unturned in your search to root out inefficiency.And you can see how effectively inefficiency has been rooted out in the federal government here, 43 years later. You know, there's a long history of people in business thinking that they can bring kind of those approaches to the federal government. The history is, you know, that these efforts, while they may find some inefficiencies, they cannot fundamentally, you know, restructure federal operations, both because all sorts of rules, but also because the vast majority of federal money is not wasted. You know, the biggest thing the federal government does is provide retirement security to seniors through Medicare and Social Security and Medicaid for long term care. You know, it's been described as an insurance company with an army. And so, yes, you can squeeze here and there, but there is no way to radically reduce federal spending along the magnitude that Ronald Reagan promised or that Donald Trump and Elon Musk are now promising without significantly changing what it does.

CNN has previously reported that the Trump team will now argue that as President-Elect Trump cannot be sentenced, that he has constitutional protections from either being indicted or prosecuted or even sentenced by state actors. Now, it's unclear if that will be successful, but the judge has at least one more week before he has to make any decision in this case.

And since the Nixon administration, and it was affirmed during the Clinton administration, the Department of Justice has had a policy that says sitting presidents cannot be prosecuted. And so that is running head on into the Jack Smith investigations, both in the January 6th case and as well in the documents case.

Right? BRETTSCHNEIDERhow that decision, even though it is a Supreme Court decision, is itself a lawless decision. It isn't based in the Constitution's text. There is a case about civil immunity which is very different than criminal immunity. And so they really have made it up. They've created this immunity. And let's talk about what's so dangerous about it. They've created it in regard to the moments in which the President is most dangerous. The official duties of a president are the ones in which they might actually destroy democracy. And after all, January 6th was an attempt at a self-coup, an attempt at to destroy democracy. Now, Jack Smith had ways around it. He was arguing that it wasn't just official duties. But to my mind, the decision is actually flawed. And of course, in the United States there are ways to push back against the Supreme Court. We could have legislation that narrows the immunity decision. We could have a constitutional amendment that overturns it. And that's what citizens really need to do now is not just take this decision as is, but think about fighting back against it.",

Right now, there is a lot of economic hardship, and in several cases over the past year, we have seen instances where people do mass harm, whether it be at a recreation type center, as we saw here in front of a school. There was a situation earlier this year where a bus plowed in front of a crowd, in front of a school. Guns are very difficult to get here.

It lives in some of the deepest parts of the ocean.The new species is nicknamed \"mystery mollusk\". It's the first known sea slug to swim in parts of the ocean that are 1,000 to 4,000 meters below the surface and untouched by sunlight. Scientists describe the new sea slug as having a gelatinous hood, a flat tail with finger like projections and colorful organs in the middle. It can also light up with bioluminescence to scare off predators. Researchers say they first spotted the species in February of 2000 off of California's Monterey Bay. It was during a dive with a robotic camera, and they've been studying it ever since. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
