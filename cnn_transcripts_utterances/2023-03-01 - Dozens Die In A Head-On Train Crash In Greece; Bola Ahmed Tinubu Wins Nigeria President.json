Then, Nigeria declares a president-elect. But the future is far from clear after significant voting issues. And then later this hour, CNN reports from the southern tip of Argentina on Antarctica's new record low sea level. But first, this hour, tragic human error. That's what Greece's prime minister is blaming for a horrific train wreck in central Greece that has killed at least 38 people. The train carrying 352 passengers and crew slammed head-on into a freight train around midnight near the city of Larissa. Authorities say many of those on board were young people, including students. Rescuers worked through the night to retrieve the victims and helped dozens of injured survivors, described an apocalyptic scene with fire, broken glass and twisted iron just all around them. The prime minister visited the site a few hours ago, and Greece's transportation minister resigned. A local station master is under arrest, charged with mass deaths through negligence. Our Nada Bashir has more on how this tragedy unfolded. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER (voice-over):  The aftermath of a horrifying late-night crash. Heaps of debris and carriages scattered across train tracks in central Greece after a passenger train carrying more than 350 people collided head-on with a freight train killing dozens. KYRIAKOS MITSOTAKIS, PRIME MINISTER, GREECE (through translator):  What we are experiencing today is very difficult as a country. We are talking about an unspeakable tragedy. Our thoughts today are first and foremost with the relatives of the victims.",

And one Ukrainian commander says Russia is using air attacks to break Bakhmut into quote, \"molecules\". But Ukraine's defense forces are refusing to give ground, saying they have no orders to leave. Our Alex Marquardt joins me now from eastern Ukraine. And Alex, I mean, this time roughly yesterday here on the show, I was speaking to an adviser to President Zelenskyy. And for the first time, Alex, I heard the Ukrainians say that they are weighing out the options in Bakhmut, including strategically pulling back, if needed.

But it is clear that they are weighing their options, that they are considering a strategic withdrawal that would allow them to save some of their forces, to fight another day. Ukraine does appear to be on its heels, as the Russian forces are trying to push forward. Much of the city has been encircled. Those Wagner forces, primarily, they have been backed up by Russian regular forces, have tried looping around the city, they've kind of taken territory to the north. It is a fierce battle. President Zelenskyy saying that this is the toughest fight in the country right now, that those Russian forces are hidden, the -- are intensifying their assaults against Ukrainian defenses. Now, both sides have faced significant losses. There is an argument at this point that Ukraine is trying to weaken the Russian side as much as possible and for whatever may come next. If the Ukrainians do need to withdraw, obviously, they're going to try to blunt any kind of Russian advance, blunt any kind of advantage that Russia might take, from taking this city of Bakhmut and turn it more into a symbolic victory for the Russians, rather than a natural strategic victory. Of course, if Russia were able to take Bakhmut after several months of some of the fiercest fighting that we have seen, they would be able to claim a victory. Whether it would actually reshape the battlefield in any way remains to be seen. The Ukrainians were definitely, and are intensifying their defenses to the west of the city, and want to make sure that the Russians are in as weak a position as possible, so that Ukraine can hold the line and prevent Russia from advancing further into Donbas.

The Russians pushing forward on different axes. One certainly is Bakhmut. That's where they've been pushing forward in one of their strongest ways. Vuhledar is certainly another one. Vuhledar is very interesting as we pointed out in our reporting, because it does sit at that axis between the southern and the eastern fronts. So far, the Ukrainians have managed to keep the Russians at bay. If Bakhmut were to fall, obviously, that would be one of the first places where Russia would see a success in this offensive. But Isa, they have not had any real successes. They have been throwing an enormous amount of troops and material at all of these different efforts, and they have very little to show for it. In Vuhledar in particular, they are coming across open fields where Ukrainians -- where the Ukrainian forces have laid mines. They have lost huge numbers of men, of armored vehicles. They haven't been able to make any progress there. So, for the time being, Ukraine is holding its ground. It is doing quite well in the face of this Russian offensive. The big question also is, when will we see a Ukrainian counteroffensive? That is something that Ukrainian military and political officials have talked about, where exactly that would take place, when exactly that would happen. That is still unclear. There's a sense that Ukraine will try to make some kind of push in the south, so that is something that we're also watching very closely, Isa.",

Mounted police were there, they were using stun grenades, they were using water cannons, there was a huge police force there. We have reports of at least 11 people who were injured.

The committee was very concerned about that company's ability to kind of vacuum up the data of Americans. It also covered the topic of the origins of the pandemic, which we got new information about earlier this week, new questions over whether the pandemic did emerge from a lab. But the overall sentiment of the hearing -- and really this was just the first of many to come from this committee -- is that the U.S. needs to be taking the China threat, in their words, more seriously. And essentially, decouple the United States' economy from the Chinese economy and take stock of the competition that exists between the U.S. and China and how it is not a healthy one, about how it is actually very threatening to the U.S., considering China's theft of intellectual property. Basically, everything that the Republicans and the Democrats are warning about with regard to China, all kind of smushed into one hearing.

Now an assessment from intelligence agencies that the pandemic is most likely a Chinese lab leak, we heard today. But I was under the impression that the intel community is somewhat divided on this. So just break it down for our viewers.",

The first intel community assessment was released in 2021. That was still a low confidence assessment. The FBI had a medium confidence assessment. But it is still very much the minority view of the intelligence community that this pandemic did emerge from a laboratory. We should note that the intel community as a whole is united on the fact that they do not believe that this was deliberately engineered in a lab, it was not made as a bioweapon. What they also say, what they also all agree on is it's going to be very difficult to ever get to the bottom of how this pandemic began without China's cooperation. And right now, it is not likely that's going to happen.",

Teenagers who love endless scrolling, they may be about to hit a bit of a roadblock, a bit of a TikTok timeout. TikTok is setting a one hour daily limit for users under 18. While teens will be able to turn off this new setting, it at least prompts them to actively decide to extend their time on the app. This is one of the most aggressive moves by a social media company after years of scrutiny of platforms' impact on young users. Earlier today on Capitol Hill, the House committee voted to advance a bill that would make it easy to ban TikTok in the U.S. CNN's Clare Duffy joins me now to discuss the proposal. Clare, let's talk about this TikTok timeout. One colleague of mine today in the meeting was saying one hour, it feels like 10 minutes when you are a TikTok user. The thing is, they can just ignore it. So what is the point of it?",

However, the app did say that if teens turned the feature off, once they've reached 100 minutes of screen time, it will prompt them to set some kind of limit. So I think this is an effort by TikTok to address some of these concerns about -- from parents and lawmakers about the way that young people use the app. There are these concerns that young people are sacrificing sleep to continue to scroll or that the app can lead them down sort of problematic content rabbit holes. TikTok isn't the only platform that's faced these kinds of concerns. The app, TikTok in particular, makes it so easy to keep scrolling. So I do think this is an effort by the company to address some of those concerns. We'll have to wait and see how much of an impact it really has, given some of these caveats.",

This bill would still have to be approved by the House and the Senate. It would be a huge step for the U.S. government to say 100 million American users can't use this very popular app. TikTok has called that fact out. They have said that this will be tantamount to censoring that 100 million American users. There's no evidence that this presents a risk to U.S. national security. But as you're discussing there with Natasha, there are real concerns from U.S. lawmakers about the ways of the Chinese government could act to -- could influence the app or access U.S. user data through its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. I think that the company's going out to sort of scramble to regain trust with lawmakers if it wants to avoid this.",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NED PRICE, U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESPERSON:  These comments were irresponsible. They were repugnant. They were disgusting. And just as we condemn Palestinian incitement to violence, we condemn these provocative remarks that also amount to incitement to violence. We call on prime minister Netanyahu and other senior Israeli officials to publicly and clearly reject and disavow these comments. We condemn, as we have consistently, terrorism and extremism in all of its forms. We continue to urge that there be equal measures of accountability for extremist actions, regardless of the background of the perpetrators or the victims. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And he said that the town, the town of Huwara, I'm quoting here, \"needs to be erased.\" What you heard there from the U.S. State Department was a reaction to those comments, incredibly incendiary. We will stay on the story. From 12 months to 12 days, the U.S. warns that Iran has sped up its ability to produce a bomb's worth of fissile material. A Defense Department official testified before Congress about the progress Iran has made since the international nuclear agreement fell apart. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) COLIN KAHL, U.S. UNDERSECRETARY OF DEFENSE FOR POLICY:  Iran's nuclear progress since we left the JCPOA has been remarkable. Back in 2018, when the previous administration decided to leave the JCPOA, it would have taken Iran about 12 months to produce one fissile -- one bomb's worth of fissile material. Now it would take about 12 days. And so I think there is still the view that, if you can resolve this issue diplomatically and put constraints back on their nuclear program, it is better than the other options. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

This is the same policy that we adopted in the case of Yemen, Afghanistan and various other countries in crisis.
