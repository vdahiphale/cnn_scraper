He said that is where the names of those who have stood with Ukraine since Russia invaded nearly a year ago this Friday -- that is where the names of those who have stood with them will be engraved.President Duda, of Poland, was the first one to have his name engraved there. He was there for the opening of that ceremony. Now you see President Biden and President Zelenskyy there as President Biden was making that historic trip to Kyiv. Earlier, he had visited the official home of the Ukrainian leader. He wrote a note in a guest book saying that he was honored to be welcomed again in Kyiv -- obviously, his first trip since the invasion, but President Biden's eighth trip to Kyiv overall. And said to stand in solidarity and friendship with the freedom-loving people of Ukraine. Alex Marquardt is live on the ground in Kyiv. Alex, you were there as President Biden arrived before it was publicly known that he was actually there. You know, what does this mean for people who have stayed in Ukraine during this war -- who have lived through this -- to see a U.S. president come and visit?",

      "sentences": "Absolutely. We'll get back there in just a minute in Warsaw. Kaitlan, thank you very much.Let's bring in David Sanger and Col. Cedric Leighton. Good morning to you again, and thank you both for joining us. David, let me just take a step back with you for a moment to remind people of how Biden's position on Ukraine was informed through eight visits now and his time in the Obama administration, really pushing then-President Obama to provide lethal aid to Ukraine -- the decision, ultimately, the president decided against. How does that play into the decision you think he will make next about long-range missiles and F-16s? DAVID SANGER, CNN POLITICAL AND NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST (via Webex by Cisco):  Well, Poppy, it's a great question. And I think that it's pretty clear as we reconstruct the debates in the Obama White House that then-Vice President Biden was pressing for more. You'll remember that President Obama's view was let's not send Javelin antimissile systems. He -- that seems pretty quaint today compared to what else we've given the Ukrainians. But President Obama was very worried about provoking Russian aggression. At this moment, it's provoked. And the question that faces President Biden is how does he square the two different objectives that he's laid out for his staff and for this war. One is help the Ukrainians remain independent, and the second is don't start World War III. And he is hesitant every time he thinks a missile system could provoke Russia to widen the war or perhaps use nuclear weapons.",

COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST, U.S. AIR FORCE (RET.):  Well, Sara, as far as I'm concerned, I think the possibility certainly exists that Ukraine can be victorious. But, of course, you've got to ask the question, as I'm sure David has as well, what does victory actually look like? And in a situation like this victory is at least rolling the Russians back to the status that existed on February 23, the day before the invasion of this past year. So that would be considered I think at least a major change. It is not what President Zelenskyy wants. President Zelenskyy wants to eliminate the Russians from Crimea. He wants to eliminate them from the east -- from the Donbas region. And he certainly wants to make sure that the Russians don't pose a threat again to Kyiv or any other city in Ukraine. So those are I think the major things but that, at least, would be a major step forward and it would give the Ukrainians a chance to achieve some degree of, if you will, breathing space, at least temporarily.",

The more the Western technologies and the better equipment Ukraine has, the sooner we will bring back the peace and stability and this -- and the end to this war.Of course, we've heard what are the -- what are the plans of the Americans. As for now, the artillery system, the anti-aircraft systems are very much needed. The ammunition to those missiles and rockets and, of course, to those systems. This is what is very much needed now. Of course, as diplomats, we will continue our work in order to convince also, all our partners -- not only Poland, U.S., or Great Britain, but also our Western allies to follow the same path.

We, down here on the Eastern Flank of NATO, doing our job but with the great leadership of the U.S. We need this support. So what we would like to hear is also this commitment that we are standing together, that we are united, and we will continue the policy of deterrence to Russia. That are ready to continue our support to Ukrainian partners because it is the right thing to do. And, of course, we're going to -- we're going to hear the White House already said a couple of words about the Polish role and the role of Polish government and the Polish people with regard to this crisis.

PRZYDACZ:  Well, as you remember, in 2016, down here in Warsaw during the NATO summit, the decision was taken to deploy NATO troops on the Eastern Flank. Thanks to this good decision we down here -- down here on the Eastern Flank -- we are -- feel much more safe and stable. Their challenges are still there -- are still to the east of our borders. We are doing our part. We are spending almost three percent or four percent of our GDP for military purposes because we want to secure the Eastern Flank of the entire NATO. So the more help from our allies, including U.S. but also our Western European partners, the better for all of us. There should be a division of labor. We are securing the Eastern Flank but what we need to do -- what we need to get is more support by personal but mostly equipment, storages of ammunition, infrastructure. That's what we would like to see. But, of course, the decision will be taken during the NATO summit in Vilnius this summer. This is the preparatory meeting as I -- as I expect. So, for sure, President Duda will be trying to convince President Biden to take this leadership and to show its commitment also to -- I mean, America's commitment to the entire Euro-Atlantic region.",
