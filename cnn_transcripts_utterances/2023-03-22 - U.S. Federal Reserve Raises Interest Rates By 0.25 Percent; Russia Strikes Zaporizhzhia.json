Tonight, markets are reacting to a quarter of apercent interest rate rise as the U.S. Federal Reserve walks a fine line trying to tamp down inflation without sending more banks over the brink. You see the Dow Jones now in the red. Then Russia takes aim at Zaporizhzhia. The smoldering apartment blocks proves civilians are in the firing line. And then President Macron breaks his silence on the massive protests we have been seeing right across France. How he plans to balance normal life as well as legitimate anger. But we begin this hour with breaking news on the economic front. The U.S. Federal Reserve has announced in the past hour, it will raise interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point. The announcement comes amid stubbornly high inflation and a global banking crisis, which have injected daily volatility into the markets. Let's look at the stock markets right now and see how they are doing, following the announcement. The Dow Jones turned negative in the last -- I will say probably in the last minute or so, now down two-tenth of a percent. We're seeing the S&amp;P as you can see, they're pretty flat, Nasdaq going a similar way at this moment. Here's what Federal Chairman Jerome Powell said just a few minutes ago. Have a listen to this.

That is why in response to these events, the Federal Reserve working with the Treasury Department and the FDIC took decisive actions to protect the U.S. economy and to strengthen confidence in our banking system. We are committed to learning the lessons from this episode, and to work to prevent episodes, events like this from happening again. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Because on the onehand, he's trying to make it clear that the Fed is not satisfied with inflation, that it is way too high. Still under the jobs markets, it's probably too hot. But on the other hand, he's got to acknowledge the stress in the banking market, the bank failures that we've seen. And the fact that, that stress is actually probably going to slow down the economy. And it actually may be doing the Fed's work for it. And there's so much uncertainty here, and Powell really made that clear, he said, we don't know how much the tighter financial conditions from the bank failures is going to cool off inflation. We don't know how much is going to slow growth down. And what's interesting is, he did say that, you know, heading into this meeting, before the bank failures, it was pretty clear the Fed was going to have to raise interest rates today and probably a series of interest rates going forward. And he said that in the last few days, they did consider a pause, which obviously is something that's been debated and a lot of experts were advising the Fed to do. But ultimately, they decided to go ahead and raise interest rates. And Isa, I think that part of the reason there is because if the Fed didn't raise interest rates, they ran the risk of really freaking out investors. Right, a lot of people would have wondered, what does the Fed know that we don't know?",

But we know he's also now really worried about the banking system even though he said it's safe and sound. The statement said that. Let me go back to what he just simply said. \"The effects of banking crisis are uncertain. If credit conditions don't tighten, we may need to do more.\" So what this is really, Isa, whatever happens, rates are going up. Two ways, either the credit -- the banks stop lending themselves because of the crisis, tightening of credit markets, therefore the economy slows down, or if that doesn't happen, we will raise rates anyway.

We've been in and out of Kherson, the city right on the edge of the frontlines here in the southern part of the conflict. And you hear artillery outgoing and incoming, all the time on a frequent basis. Those rockets and artillery in this region are hitting civilian areas and injuring and killing people. The President, President Zelenskyy saying this is a savagery, and other Ukrainian official saying this is yet another example of what they say are Russian war crimes that are happening on an ongoing basis. What it does speak to, is that, either the Russians are doing this deliberately as Ukraine suggests, and possible to know that for sure. All they are just targeting areas near military, but you know, frequently. There's no evidence of military close to these sites that are being targeted. So, perhaps, the aim is terror on the part of the Russian forces. But certainly, in the last 24 hours, you've seen yet again, these barrages of missiles and strikes with people with miraculous stories of escaping them and an ongoing search right at this hour in Zaporizhzhia to find those who may still be alive.

We understand that the French Prime Minister is going to be meeting with not just trade unions, but representatives of civil society as they look to get their future reforms through. They are also looking to beef up the police, the security forces, the laws that allow them to get strikers back to work quickly.

So he went to see this accommodation center set up for Ukrainians who didn't manage to get homes with local families. Lots of local families have taken Ukrainians in and they are given training on how to get jobs, they are given language training and Ukrainians are given full access to public services here, to schools and to hospitals. So he's really trying to highlight how Poland continues to support Ukrainians. That isn't just a Polish effort, it's actually something that they're effectively doing to the west.

Now, speculation still swirling over if and when former U.S. President Donald Trump may be criminally charged in New York. The grand jury investigating his alleged role in a hush money scheme is not meeting today. One source says the district attorney has suggested they may need, in fact, to him, more testimony, while other sources tell CNN prosecutors are taking a moment to regroup. Let's bring in CNN Stephen Collinson in Washington to help us digest all of this. Excuse me. So, Stephen, what is your analysis then, of what is unfolding or expected to unfold in New York on the hush money investigation? First of all, how likely is that Trump will be indicted here?",

Ever since then, speculation has been swirling. What the situation is right now is it's clear that a case in New York is driving towards a conclusion. You mentioned it. It's about an alleged hush money payment paid to an adult film star way back before the 2016 election. Trump potentially could face charges related to business law and even infringements of election law if it was proven that he'd tried to influence the outcome of that election. What happens in the United States is that a prosecutor brings evidence before a jury, a grand jury, as it's known, and those people have to vote and decide on whether there's sufficient evidence for an indictment. The jury, as you said, was not meeting today. There had been some expectation that could happen, so we don't know exactly why. And that is adding to the increase of the speculation.",

And you recall back during Trump's presidency, he was repeatedly accused of using his government power to interfere in theadministration of justice, most often in cases against him. Now that the Republicans have the power in the new House majority, that's exactly what they're trying to do. They've demanded that the prosecutor in the New York case Alvin Bragg, the District Attorney of Manhattan, come down to Washington to testify. It's a pretty clear attempt, I think, for them to use the power they have to intimidate the prosecutor, perhaps to try and convince him not to indict Trump. And it's also giving us a taste of the massive political cataclysm, I think, that would unfold in the unprecedented event that a former president was indicted. So, you know, clearly, this is hugely political, and there are multiple and actually accelerating investigations against Trump in which he's also deeply legally exposed. That could also come to a head, and it's conceivable that he could also be indicted in the classified documents matter, for example, his attempt elsewhere to steal the election in Georgia. So, I think we're on a political precipice in many ways in the United States waiting to see how this all.",

That's not to say that there aren't Republicans who would like to move on, but I don't think it's surprising. I think it's completely in character with the changes that Trump has wrought on American politics, and it shows that, you know, the trauma of his presidency, although it ended two years ago, is going to take potentially years more to work through in American politics, and it's going to be a very divisive process.",

So, Trump has laid the groundwork on this for many years. You know, everything in the United States is deeply politicized at this point, and I don't think there's any avoiding it, you know.
