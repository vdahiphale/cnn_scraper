If you're just joining us, here are some of the top stories today.In just a few hours, the FBI will brief U.S. lawmakers on the New Orleans terror attack. Officials say at least 15 people were killed and dozens more injured when a truck plowed into a crowd on Bourbon Street celebrating the New Year. The suspect died in a shootout with police. Police in South Korea have carried out a search and seizure operations related to the crash of the Jeju Air jet that killed 179 people. They searched the Muan International Airport, Jeju's Air offices in Seoul, and at least one other building. And in Montenegro, officials say a gunman who killed at least 10 people during a rampage has died from self-inflicted injuries. The suspect had been on the run from police after opening fire in a restaurant not far from the country's capital. Now the FBI says it's carrying out search warrants in multiple states associated with the New Orleans terror attack, including Texas, where the suspect had lived. 42-year-old Shamsud-Din Jabbar was a U.S. Army veteran and American citizen. Investigators are focusing on figuring out the motive and if there were any accomplices. Officials say Jabbar had recorded videos about joining ISIS. The terror group's flag was found in the Ford pickup he rented and later used to ram into a crowd on Bourbon Street. Local authorities and law enforcement analysts have been speaking out about the killings. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

An Army veteran who went to college and worked in real estate and IT, had started to have some financial troubles. He posted a YouTube video, though, as recently as four years ago where he described that he had been born in Texas, that he was trying to get this real estate company off the ground. He identified himself as a veteran.We want to play you a short clip of this, even though this video has been taken down because it gives you a window into the background of this suspect. SHAMSUD-DIN JABBAR, SUSPECT: So I'm born and raised in Beaumont, Texas, and now live in Houston. And I've been here all my life, with the exception of traveling for the military, where I spent 10 years as a human resources specialist.",

And then after our break, when we got the news and we learned of the severity of the tragedies that happened, you know, we had to get back together as a team. I think a lot of people would start to hear that the game would be postponed, but we had to get back together and discuss what had happened. And so, you know, what I told the team is, you know, in the toughest moments, the culture of any program of a nation is revealed.

Police say 10 people were injured outside a nightclub in the borough of Queens while waiting to get into a private event. A group of four men approached a group of 15 people, including minors, and fired approximately 30 rounds before fleeing the scene. All the injured are between the ages of 16 and 20. They're expected to recover with no life-threatening injuries, but the motive behind the attack remains unclear, and the police are searching for more information. Now, Russian gas is not flowing to Europe through Ukraine anymore, but unlike the crisis it had in 2022, the EU is not worried about the impact. We'll explain why after the break.

But this time around, European officials say they're not too worried about the impact. For more, we're joined by Clare Sebastian.

They have been shown to be able to survive under all different stress scenarios, but certainly that's something that Ukraine is going to be looking at. Ukraine is also losing transit fees through ending this deal, worth about 0.5 percent of GDP, but I think their thinking is that the political symbolism of keeping this up was just -- they couldn't stomach it anymore.",

And we now know that South Korea's transportation ministry has a transcript of what was said on that voice recorder. Communication between the cockpit and the control tower.But in terms of when we, the public, are going to be able to see that transcript or hear audio from the voice recorder, those are still unanswered questions. However, South Korea's transportation ministry was able to reveal just one specific detail about what they've heard on the voice recorder. And they told us this. They can't verify, they cannot verify the specific timing of when the cockpit and control tower had difficulty communicating. Now, we do know, before landing, the control tower warned the plane about birds in the area. Minutes later, the pilot called out, Mayday, Mayday, Mayday, and then bird strike. The plane would then crash a short time later. Now, as for the police searches of the airport and airline offices, a search warrant was issued on charges of, quote, professional negligence resulting in death and injury. That's according to South Jeolla police, and South Jeolla is the province where the crash happened. So, what we're looking for in the days ahead is a concrete time frame on when the flight data recorder is going to be sent to the United States. It is too damaged to be assessed here in South Korea. The NTSB is taking the lead on that front of the investigation. Certainly, a somber start to the new year here in South Korea. The headlines and the pictures in the paper certainly tell it all. So many families and loved ones leaving offerings on these tables that are just steps away from the crash site in memory of the victims, and more than 1,500 people volunteering their time to help families at the airport.

Some rain and snow here, mainly snow along the lakes, lake effect snow, but very windy conditions all the way from upstate New York all the way down every single one of the big airports for today will be windy, may get some delays for sure. The snow will likely be along the lakes and also into the Appalachian Mountains.Temperatures are going to cool down and cool down significantly as this below average temperature drops all the way down to the Gulf Coast. I mean, you're going to be below freezing all the way down to the Gulf Coast in places. We'll watch the storm come on shore in the Pacific Northwest roll through the middle part of the country. Rain, snow, sleet, and yes, maybe even some ice storms going on here. But now this is pushing you ahead to quite a few days. Things to still look forward to -- or maybe not if you're traveling -- but you still have time to get prepared for this rain, snow, sleet, and then maybe possibly even that ice. Could be some very deep snow in some places. Just depends on how cold it gets. Could be some real troublesome ice across the middle part of the country, especially the Ohio Valley and just south of there. Well below normal temperatures, you get a little bit of precip on top of that and all of a sudden you get the ice event. So, take care. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
