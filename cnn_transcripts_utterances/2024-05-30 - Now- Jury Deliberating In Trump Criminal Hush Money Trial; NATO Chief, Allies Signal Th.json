I mean, really all that the jury notes tell you is that there is at least one juror in there who has requested the - whatever it is that that they requested, whether it's the jury charge or particular portions of the testimony. And it could be that they want to refresh their memory. It could be that there's factions in the jury room where they want to use this testimony to convince each other.So it's really hard to know, what it looks like, though, is that they started at the beginning where the conspiracy started at this meeting where they decided that they were going to do this catch-and-kill scheme to benefit the election. It also looks like they're trying to corroborate Michael Cohen. They have to corroborate Michael Cohen because the law doesn't necessarily require that you corroborate everything someone says. He is an accomplice, which means you have to corroborate it a little. You have to corroborate it just enough and the checks alone would be enough for that. But there's an added corroboration that the prosecution emphasized and really encouraged the jury to say, look, we know Michael Cohen has a history of lying. He has a lot of baggage. He's actually convicted of lying to Congress. So corroboration here, you don't just have to believe his word. There's so much corroboration. And that's what I like about the notes is that the testimony they asked for all corroborates one another, so I think they're really paying attention. The other thing that this tells me is that this is not how Donald Trump suggested, which is that he can't get a fair trial. This is a jury that's working hard. It's evaluating the evidence. They're not having a knee jerk reaction one way or the other. They're really working. They're deliberating. And he is getting a fair trial, whatever the outcome is and whatever the verdict is.",

It's not - because there's two kind of issues in this trial. There's - well, it's actually three issues. There's where the records falsified, number one. Number two, was this to benefit the election. And then number three, was Trump involved.And I would say that the first two are proven beyond a reasonable doubt against David - sorry, against Allen Weisselberg and Michael Cohen, for sure. They committed those crimes. In fact, Michael Cohen went to prison just for this type of - for this conduct. The question is, though, can they link it to Donald Trump? And this testimony that they asked for is all about linking it to Donald Trump. So I think they're wrestling with the exact issue in this case.",

And it lists out things like evidence, right? They can take the evidence back with them. It has other things in there. And it doesn't specify this one way or another. So I think you could argue if they intended for the jury to be able to take the instructions back with them, that the law would permit that, but it's just one of those things.

So the rain metaphor basically says that you can assume, you can come to the conclusion that it's raining even if you didn't see the actual rain. If there's no direct evidence that someone saw the actual rain, you can infer that based on if it's wet outside or someone comes in with an umbrella or with a raincoat.And so I think that what they're doing is they're putting the pieces of the evidence together and saying, what can we surmise even if we don't have direct evidence of that.",

So, for example, Trump signed the checks. But there was also testimony that Trump was very careful about every detail, every dime that went out. He knew exactly where it went to. He knew exactly what it cost.And so what the circumstantial evidence is, if you put those pieces together, then you can develop the story and come to that conclusion.",

What about an inference that, yes, of course, that is how they would then approach another negative story involving another woman?",

You can infer something because this is something that happened before. You can infer something because when you put the pieces of the puzzle together, it can only come to one conclusion.So this is exactly what the prosecution wanted to happen, given the lack of credibility of the direct evidence, which was Michael Cohen, that the jury is not able to rely on specifically and directly because of his involvement in the endeavor.",

Already, we've heard, as you said, from Jens Stoltenberg, the NATO Secretary General, what we've already heard from Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Poland, that they are giving the green light to Ukraine to do just that. We're not talking about being able to strike anywhere inside Russia. We're talking about the limited use of their weapons, giving Ukraine the possibility of striking parts of Russia from where attacks are launched. And so specifically, what we've seen over the course of the last few weeks, which is that escalation along the border to the north of Kharkiv since the opening up of that third front by Moscow. The pressure that's being felt by the Ukrainian troops and Ukrainian civilians in that region has really left to this important shift. The question now, whether the United States will follow suit, and already Moscow keeping a very close eye on that. We've heard a number of statements from Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, but also earlier this week from Vladimir Putin himself, warning about what such an escalation would mean, Brianna.",

So, another very direct threat, very belligerent threat to those noises coming from Washington. And both what Sergey Lavrov said about those - the possibility of American missiles in the Indo-Pacific and what we've heard from the Kremlin about the possibility that Ukraine might be able to use its gifted weapons differently, I think, gives you a very clear idea of how closely Moscow is watching this, given what a game-changer it would be, Boris and Brianna.",
