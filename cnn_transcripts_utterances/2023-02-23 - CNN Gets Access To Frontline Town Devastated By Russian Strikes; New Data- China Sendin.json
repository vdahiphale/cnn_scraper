New video of the devastation in one town as tonight marks one year since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine.Plus, Moscow getting a boost on the battlefield from China. It's an OUTFRONT investigation. And a big gamble. Accused murderer Alex Murdaugh takes the stand. Did his tears and his admissions win over the jury? Let's go OUTFRONT. Good evening, everyone. I'm Kate Bolduan, in for Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, on the front lines, just hours from the one-year mark of the start of Russia's war in Ukraine, CNN has exclusively access to one town not far from where the head of Putin's private army, the Wagner Group made an appearance on the front lines as well. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YEVGENY PRIGOZHIN, WAGNER CHIEF (through translator):  Behind me is the outside perimeter of Artimus (ph). Here and now we can greet all men who are fighting, who are in the hospital, who are fighting for our motherland. Volunteers who are making ammunition. WAGNER FIGHTER (through translator):  We have seized a five-story building. It's really close to downtown Bakhmut. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  Hhow far from the enemy? WAGNER FIGHTER (through translator):  It's 400 meters. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  Okay, let's go. Otherwise, this will be our last address. (END VIDEO CLIP) BOLDUAN:  Now, the danger is certainly everywhere as the brutal fighting continues there without any end in sight. We're going to show you this new video into OUTFRONT showing the utter devastation in the region. Buildings reduced to rubble, thanks to some of the 5,000 missile strikes, 3,500 air strikes and 1,100 drone attacks that Ukraine says Russia has launched over this past year of war. This is what some of those first strikes looked like. A year ago tonight in Kyiv, and while Putin's war appears to be grinding on at any cost in Ukraine, he is also facing new public opposition at home. We want to show you this. This Russian lawmakers is making a bold mockery of Putin and posting the video on YouTube. Yes, you do see him with noodles hanging on his ears while listening to Putin's big speech this week, that act actually demonstrates an old Russian express which basically translates to stop lying to me. This is a daring act by a politician still in Russia because we've seen many times what happens to those who publicly cross Putin. I want to go now to Alex Marquardt on the ground in. He got an exclusive look at the front lines, a unit made of Americans and other foreign volunteers. Alex, what did you see?",

Rishi Sunak, the current British prime minister, has committed to training faster pilots and Ukrainian marines and, of course, we will discuss with our international friends and colleagues what other military equipment the Ukrainians need and how quickly we can get it to them.

So, it is incredibly important that the world sees and Putin understands that an aggressor cannot benefit from that aggression and as long as that is understood then, of course, we would want to see peace come quickly.

Have you poked holes to establish there's reasonable doubt, is your client credible and relatable and could he carry the day is the shift.Why did they do it, Kate? For the following reasons. Number one, motivation. What is the motivation as to why he would have done this, the defense has to continue with the mantra this is a loving husband and father who would never do it. Second issue, with respect to the time line, prosecution has him boxed in. How? They have the cell tower data showing that where he was. They've got the data of the car. They have the video with his voice on it so he was there. Have to explain that away in a way that resonates with the jury. Final point, what he then has to do, the defense has come up with a reasonable alternatives. Could it have been because he had this pill addiction and around unsavory people that meant his family harm? Could it have been Paul his son involved in that boating accident where people were not acting kind with him, could they have done harm to him? So, I think that was the calculus.
