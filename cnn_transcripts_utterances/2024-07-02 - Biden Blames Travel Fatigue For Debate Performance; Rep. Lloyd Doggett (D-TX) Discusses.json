And more fallout from that ruling, his New York sentencing set for next week just slipped to September. Good evening. Thanks for joining us. President Biden has just weighed in again on his debate disaster Thursday night. Speaking at a fundraiser tonight, reporters in the room, quote, the President is saying, \"I decided to travel around the world a couple - of times shortly before the debate. I didn't listen to my staff - and then I almost fell asleep on stage.\" Reporters in the room said he seemed to be joking when he said the part about almost falling asleep on stage. But regarding his travel, factually speaking, the President got back from his last trip abroad June 15th. The debate was 12 days later. In any case, his explanation comes at the end of a day in which the first cracks opened up in what was a fairly solid wall of Democratic support. Solid until today, when a Democratic congressman who joins me in a moment, Texas Congressman Lloyd Doggett, became the first national Democratic legislator to say the President should, quoting from his statement now, make the painful and difficult decision to withdraw. I'll ask him about that in a moment. It's notable because until today, what we have heard over and over from many Democrats is what happened at the debate was simply a bad night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He was certainly tired. Staff members who were younger than he was were - far younger than he is, were certainly complaining about it. But there may be something deeper going on here, because while the White House calls it a one-off event, in talking to staff members, others who've been dealing with the President, it's clear that there has been an increasing frequency of these moments where he is either frozen or lost the thread of his conversation, and that's made a lot of people worry and make them wonder that whether or not it was more than just the travel, that the travel may have made it worse, but may not be the underlying cause.",
