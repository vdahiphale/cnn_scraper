Right behind me, what you're seeing is the mountain, on one half of it is Lebanon, the other is Israel, and right below me is the Israeli community of Metula. Now, we heard -- this is a town that's been under -- it's a closed military area for the last few hours.But as I said, in the last few minutes, we heard several large explosions in the distance. That, in addition to what is going on to the west of here nearer to the Mediterranean along the border where we understand, according to the Lebanese news -- the official Lebanese agency, several rockets were fired in the direction of Israel. They were intercepted by the Iron Dome system. The Israelis later apparently targeted, according to the Lebanese news agency, an army observation point. And we understand that there are ongoing exchanges in that area as well. Now, this is sort of a change from the pace during the rest of the day. Earlier in the day, it was relatively quiet. In fact, the assumption was that perhaps the worst had passed here. I just heard another explosion. I don't know if you heard that as well. And another one. So, it does appear that things are picking up. I could hear the impact of that one in this direction. There are Lebanese soldiers here observing what's going on. OK. I'm just going to step out of the way, if you look at the top of that hill, there is a plume of smoke. I believe, but I'm not certain that on that side of the hill is Lebanon. But I can't say with absolute certainty. So, yes, this just began a few minutes ago. We don't know the reason, the cause but certainly the tensions here are extremely high. Hezbollah, the main, sort of, military force in this area in addition to the Lebanese army has by and large been relatively restrained during -- since the outbreak of fighting in the -- in Gaza. Yes, I can hear another impact. So, yes, you can see those smoke on the top of the hill. It appears multiple impacts up there. What I think that I am hearing is outgoing fire and then moments later, you will hear the impact. There it is right there. John.",

And basically, they -- this particular tank battalion, they were in on Saturday right after the attack, amongst the first to go in Saturday afternoon. And they're now staging, resupplying, and they say they are ready. And that's really what we have seen because we have been spending time going up and down along this Gaza border.Right now, we are about 3 miles away from Gaza border itself. And as you and Kate have been saying, we're 10 about or so miles from the Egyptian border. So, right here along the south, where there has been massive staging of the Israeli forces. And, you know, when you hear that going by, those are all military vehicles. I will say, they're also though bussing in troops on buses, literally coaches. So, if you saying 50 or so of those just even in the past bit, we've seen about 250 troops just coming in. It's just a constant flow in, and if we're going to think that they've been saying that they have 300,000 or 350,000 troops already at this border where we are, they have just been adding in constantly throughout the day. Constantly throughout the day and we have seen a higher state of readiness, not just with the tank battalion that we're looking out here, but also with the troops coming in, wearing their helmets, wearing their protective equipment. They are ready and there's a state of readiness. And obviously what that exactly means, we can't tell you in terms of how imminent any action might be, but we have seen that shift between today and the past few days. And we continue to hear the outgoing artillery fire followed by those thuds of explosions. In this case, in Gaza, similar to what of course Ben was just showing you live as that artillery was coming into Southern Lebanon.",

So, Gaza, you know, twice the length, Maybe, of Manhattan, and that's it.So, that when we put Gaza up on this map here, and I'll do that again, you know, the distance from end-to-end here is eight miles. This is 25 miles, and the entire length where you are operating is only 38 miles, 36 to 38 miles or so.

We've heard people say that actually some of the leaders, the political leaders of Hamas live in Doha, live in Qatar. Qatar has influence over Hamas, and the U.S. wants Qatar's help in releasing, trying to get released to some 100 plus hostages there.You can see them sitting down to begin that meeting.

All right. I mean, it gives you a sense of the terrain here. And John and Kate, I'll tell you right now, we're a few miles from the Gaza border. We've been all the way up and along this border, watching the state of readiness that you obviously can see right here. We're also about 10 or so miles from the Egyptian border down here. So, we've been all the way up and down that Gaza border and seen the readiness. Today, sort of, mix of, obviously, full troops like you can see in these tank battalion, also reservists coming in who are getting ready to go in. And I wouldn't say a higher state of readiness even at checkpoints, John and Kate, you know, helmets on, bulletproof vests on. They are ready to go. I had a chance to speak to one member of the IDF, actually he was from Long Island. He had grown up there. He's been here the past four years.

She's been up and down that border all day, and she's much greater activity than she has seen in recent days.

He began the day here in Jordan where he met with the king of Jordan, as well as the Palestinian authority president, down to Qatar. He's going to Bahrain later, and then ultimately will end up in Saudi Arabia. A whirlwind day of diplomacy for the U.S. secretary of State.

I'm just listening to CNN and hearing these -- the accounts made by people who escaped Hamas terror, those who love -- lost loved ones to Hamas barbarism. And it's difficult to make that switch to talk about from crystal (ph) pain to a strategic thinking. I'll do my best, how's that?Qatar plays a very problematic role in the Middle East. They tried to play both sides. When I was an Ambassador of Washington, I had a very nice relationship with my Qatari counterpart. But Qatar was also supporting terror around the world, certainly supporting Hamas terror, and at odds with some of the -- our future friends in the Gulf region, the Saudis and the Emiratis. So, I'd be very, very careful with dealing with the Qataris. And during the 2014 operation against Gaza, Secretary of State John Kerry tried to bring the Qataris into the mediation and Egypt and Israel and our other allies in the Middle East sort of turned him away. We didn't want to deal with the Qataris. They were part of the problem, not part of the solution. I don't know specifically what Secretary Blinken is doing in Qatar. I suspect it has to do with releasing American hostages that are held by Hamas, and hoping that Qatar can bring its influence to bear on Hamas leaders in securing that release. I do not believe that Israel is interested in having Qatar meeting -- mediating any simpler way here. We have used -- with that, we have allowed the Qataris to infuse the Hamas with cash. And here we get into very murky waters, Kate. We've gone through five rounds of fighting with Hamas, and each one ends pretty much the same way. They shoot thousands of rockets at us. We bomb them from the air for the most part. And at the end of the day, the Egyptians come in and mediate some type of ceasefire. And basically, I hate to say this in a more -- in a less crass manner, we sort of pay off Hamas. We let them -- workers come in to Israel, about 20,000 Gazan workers were coming in every day in the hope that that would give Hamas something to lose. And we let the Qataris infuse Hamas with huge amounts of cash. Huge amounts of cash. A payoff. It didn't work. Hamas wasn't interested in the workers. It doesn't care about the people of Gaza, and so it doesn't care about money. It cares about money only for one purpose and that's to buy weaponry. It didn't work. So, what now would be the role of Qatar in negotiations with us? I don't think there is one, but I understand why Secretary of State Blinken might be there in order to secure the release of those hostages.",
