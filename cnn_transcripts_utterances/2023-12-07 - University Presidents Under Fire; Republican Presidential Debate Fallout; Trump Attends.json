And he's listening in on testimony from an NYU accounting professor, who is expected to really just back up these claims from the defense that Trump and his co-defendants didn't violate any accounting principles or rules when filling out those financial statement of condition. Now, remember, the New York attorney general has said that Trump and his sons and Trump Org, they intentionally inflated the value of their assets in order to get better bank loans and interest rates, so the defense really trying to counter that central argument to this case. But we did hear from the former president, as we often do, before he headed into the courtroom. I want you to hear a little bit of what he had to say.

He was really trying to -- when he wasn't sort of in a back-and-forth with Chris Christie, was trying to remind voters of his conservative record in Florida, remind voters why he was at one time seen as the leading alternative to Donald Trump. Of course, he's struggled throughout the year. But as the year ends here, he is on a bit of an upswing himself. And I would say it was one of the strongest debate performances he had. But it was Nikki Haley who was standing center stage, taking all the incoming. Of course, she has really capitalized on her climb throughout the course of these debates here.

And I think he's probably right. Obviously, right now, the polling shows that he's way ahead of them in all of the early states. And I think that, in order for anyone to effectively challenge him, the field needs to narrow considerably and we need to have one alternative to him.

Sadly, I think he probably missed his window for the president, which would have, I think, been in 2012. But I think he played a major role possibly in this race. I think we would all concede this is Donald Trump's race to lose. He is by far the front-runner. But the way that someone could win would be win Iowa, win New Hampshire, get momentum going, and then eventually the national polls would follow. So it's a long shot, but that's the way somebody could possibly wrest control of the nomination from Trump. I think Nikki Haley is probably the most likely person to be able to pull that off, partly because she's ahead, well, not ahead of Trump, but ahead of the field and New Hampshire. Coming out of that, she'd be going into her home state of South Carolina. But I think she had a rough night last night. She was obviously targeted. She was fending off a lot of attacks. And I think it was Chris Christie who not only had a strong debate performance in his own right. I think Chris Christie bailed out Nikki Haley and really served, I think -- as the way that the Vivek Ramaswamy has been running you're sort of helping Donald Trump this whole time, I think that Chris Christie filled that role for Nikki Haley last night.",

MATTHEWSwere things like January 6 being an inside job, the 2020 election being stolen, the Great Replacement Theory, something that multiple mass shooters have cited in their manifestos. I mean, it was pathetic, it was disgusting, and I was really disappointed that the moderators did not call him out on those things.

He called for a meeting of the Board of Trustees to try to decide whether or not that testimony lives up to the values of the school and the board. Now, we have heard intense criticism towards not just Magill, but also the presidents of MIT and Harvard, after Tuesday's hearing. We heard from the billionaire, hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman, calling for all three to resign. Private equity billionaire and Penn alum Marc Rowan similarly stepping up his campaign. Albert Bourla, the CEO of Pfizer, he went on X yesterday and he called it one of the -- quote -- \"most despicable moments in the history of U.S. academia.\" And even the White House press secretary weighed in from the podium yesterday making it clear that there is no room for genocide.
