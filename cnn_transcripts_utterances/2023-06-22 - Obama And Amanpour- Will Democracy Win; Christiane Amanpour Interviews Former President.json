I'm Christiane Amanpour live in this ancient city of Athens, in Greece, where the seeds of democracy were first sown.Tonight, my one-on-one with the former President Barack Obama, who's here sounding the alarm on the fate of democracy and working to strengthen it through his foundation. He joined me at the Athens SNF Cultural Center, which is devoted to civil society and discourse. He spoke candidly about the current presidential race, which includes both of his successors, Donald Trump, and the current president, Joe Biden. It's worth noting that Obama's last overseas speech as president was right here back in November 2016, barely a week after Donald Trump won that election. His message, that democracy would prevail. But in the years since, democracy has taken a battering in the United States as well as around the world, from attacks on the rule of law and the press, to the rise of autocrats. So, he's delivering that same message now more urgently than ever. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

It depends on the engagement of citizens and an active, you know, mobilization of people around the belief, not just in any particular issue, but the belief in self- governance and rule of law and independent judiciary and the free press, all the civic institutions that go into making a democracy work.And I think it is indisputable that a combination of forces have put enormous strains on democracy and that we've seen a backlash against democratic ideals around the world. It's not unique to any one place. It's happened in Europe. It's happened in the United States. It's happened in this part of the world to around the Mediterranean. It's happening in Asia. The reason I'm optimistic is because I believe, particularly as I meet young people around the world, there is still a fundamental belief in the dignity and worth of individuals and their agency in determining what their lives are like. I think that's what young people want. But our existing democratic institutions are creaky, and we're going to have to reform them.",

But the fact that we have a former president who is having to answer to charges brought by prosecutors does uphold the basic notion that nobody is above the law and the allegations will now be sorted out through a court process.I think I'm more concerned when it comes to the United States with the fact that not just one particular individual is being accused of undermining existing laws, but that more broadly we've seen whether it's through the gerrymandering of districts, whether it's trying to silence critics, through changes in legislative process, whether it's attempts to intimidate the press, a strand of anti-democratic sentiment that we've seen in the United States. It's something that is right now most prominent in the Republican Party, but I don't think it's something that is unique to one party. I think there is a less tolerance for ideas that don't suit us and sort of the habits of a free and open exchange of ideas and the idea that we all agree to the rules of the game. And even if the outcomes aren't always the ones we like, we still abide by those rules. I think that's weakened since I left office, and we're going to need to strengthen them again.",

I dealt with China to get the Paris Accords done. I dealt with Modi to get the Paris Accords done, because I think climate change is something that transcends any particular momentary issues. It's a problem that humanity has got to deal with over the next several decades in a serious way.I do think that it is appropriate for the President of the United States, where he or she can, to uphold those principles and to challenge, whether behind closed doors or in public, trends that are troubling. And so I'm less concerned about labels than I'm concerned about specific practices. I think it is important for the president of the United States to say that if you have Uyghurs in China who are being placed in mass camps and reeducated, quote/unquote, that's a problem. That's a challenge to all of us, and we have to pay attention to it. I think it is true that if the president meets with Prime Minister Modi, then the protection of the Muslim minority in a majority Hindu India, that's something worth mentioning. And, by the way, if I had a conversation with Prime Minister Modi, who I know well, part of my argument would be that if you do not protect the rights of ethnic minorities in India, then there is a strong possibility India at some point starts pulling apart. And we've seen what happens when you start getting those kinds of large internal conflicts. So, that would be contrary to the interests not just of Muslim India, but also Hindu India. So, I think it's important to be able to talk about these things honestly. You're never going to have -- things are never going to be as clean as you'd like because the world is complicated.

And I think it was a wakeup call to Europe, and I think it was a wakeup call to the west and to democracies around the world that the old ways of thinking, might makes right, big countries can do what they want to small countries, that people cannot independently determine their futures, that those forces have to be confronted. Watching the Ukrainians themselves with such courage and bravery to fight back, I think that reminded Europe of who they were. And I've been impressed by the degree to which, in not easy circumstances, Europe has stood up. It has provided the aid that was necessary. I think the Biden administration has very deftly managed maintaining that alliance to support Ukraine.

It wasn't that long ago where John McCain was the Republican nominee and actively shut down a speaker at a town hall who was saying that I was an illegal alien bent on imposing sharia law on the United States.And there are still a bunch of folks who are more politically conservative than I am on social issues, on economic issues. But who I consider good people, thoughtful people who I learned from and who I enjoy conversations with. And so, the polarizations that we've seen in our national politics is not identical to what's happening on the ground. But what is true is that partly because of where people are getting information these days, the siloing of information. If you are watching Fox News, I've said this before, if you're watching Fox News or following some right-wing radio host or getting Facebook feeds within that bubble, your reality is different than if you read the \"New York Times\" or watch your program. And when people are getting such fundamentally different facts or what they think to be facts and their worldviews are so skewed in one direction or another, then it's very hard for democracy to work. So, this is the reason why I've been spending a lot of time both in the foundation and in other work talking about these problems of misinformation, not just the kind of misinformation that we see Putin engaging in the Ukraine situation, not just during election time, but just this constant demonization of the other side, making people fearful of each other.
