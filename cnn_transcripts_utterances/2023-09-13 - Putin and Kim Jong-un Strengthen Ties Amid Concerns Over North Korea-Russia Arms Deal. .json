Today, North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un pledged his country's full support for Vladimir Putin's ongoing invasion of Ukraine. Comes as U.S. officials are sounding the alarm about an actively advancing arms deal between the two nations. Ahead of their summit this morning, Putin gave Kim a tour of a space rocket launch site in Russia's Far East. Later hinted Russia would help North Korea develop its space and satellite program.And while Kim is in Russia, North Korea launched two short range ballistic missiles off the Eastern coast of the Korean Peninsula. Just hours before the summit, did not look like a coincidence. CNN's Will -- Ripley joins me now from Taiwan. As you look at this, Russia needs help in its war in Ukraine, ammunition. North Korea would love to have Russian help with its rockets, it says for space, but you and I know that's for ICBMs, as well as possibly space weapons. Do we know what each side is getting out of this?",

Now they're strolling around in the space center, talking about, yes, helping Russia, helping North Korea launch rockets. And of course, as you mentioned, intercontinental ballistic missiles, potentially helping North Korea to develop some of its most powerful and advanced ballistic missiles that have been unattainable because of sanctions that Russia can help North Korea get around. And all that Kim Jong-un had to do in exchange would be to provide weapons of which he has plenty and ammunition to help Putin's war in Ukraine, Jim.And so this is for Kim Jong-un a moment, really a victory after emerging humiliated from the Hanoi summit that president Trump walked out of, going back on that green train, empty-handed having to face his people, having to face his inner circle. He's now been able to orchestrate this partnership with Vladimir Putin, who has fallen so fast from world leader to pariah, kind of now at the same level as Kim, that they can combine forces and actually achieve their mutual goals, goals that the West and much of the free world would consider for lack of a better word, evil.",

We do expect a public hearing sometime this month but can they verify some of those key allegations. One of the big questions that Republicans and Democrats have alike and the hurdles ahead as McCarthy tries to move forward and possibly move to actually have a vote to charge the president with high crimes or misdemeanors. Now this all comes as the speaker is facing a range of pressures including about his own speakership.One congressman Matt Gaetz of Florida has warned that he could force a vote this month to oust McCarthy from the speakership. Something that would require just five Republicans and all Democrats to do over a range of issues that Gaetz says that McCarthy has broken promises according to Gaetz that McCarthy did not keep things that he promised in order to gain the speakership in the first case. I asked McCarthy about all of this and whether he how he would respond if this vote succeeded and he turned around and he took a swipe at Gaetz and said Gaetz was working with Democrats. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY, HOUSE SPEAKER (R): (INAUDBILE) So let me be very clear. Matt is upset about an ethics compliant. I don't care what they threaten against me, I am not going to interject into an independent committee like ethics and I am not going to put Swalwell on the intel committee.

He voted to convict Trump in his first impeachment trial, voted again to impeach him in the second impeachment trial, has called for new presidential candidates as well, had the possibility of facing a tough primary challenge in Utah, but nevertheless decided against running here, would leave a void of sorts among the Senate Republican conference, among some of the Republicans who pushed for some of these key issues.
