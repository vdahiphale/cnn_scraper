      "sentences": "With just 25 days until the U.S. Inauguration, fear and uncertainty at U.S. colleges are prompting some universities to tell international students to return to campus early from winter break.The schools want students safely back on campus before President-Elect Donald Trump returns to the White House in case he orders another travel ban, such as the one that stranded students abroad at the start of Trump's first term. Trump is promising more hardline immigration policies quite publicly, including expanding his previous travel ban and even revoking some student visas. Joining us now is Stuart Anderson, executive director of the National Foundation for American Policy, a nonpartisan research organization. Good to have you, Stuart. And I wonder, do you believe that worry is warranted? And is there specific guidance circulating as to what specifically Trump might target and who?",

      "sentences": "Well, international students are vital because they help U.S. universities provide more courses and programs for U.S. students. They help U.S. students have more access, basically, to the world.And over 70 percent of the graduate students at U.S. universities in key technical fields are international students. And we found more than half of the billion-dollar startups were actually founded by immigrants, and most of those are international students. So keeping all that in mind is the reason why university presidents and their offices have decided to tell students to be inside the United States, because, you're correct, that the first travel ban that was announced did include international students for those seven countries. Now, later on, the final version that the Supreme Court approved gave a waiver for international students. But the reality is we do not know precisely which countries and which classes of immigration will be included in a new ban. But we do know that there almost certainly will be a new ban. And in fact, there already is a continuing ban from the Trump administration on certain Chinese graduate students that the Biden administration continued. And I've had some of those students be in touch with me. And I know one student was a -- had a PhD program at a U.S. university. She went to visit her family in China, and she's been blocked for over two years from coming back to the United States. So these aren't theoretical worries. These are legitimate concerns.",

They actually affect people who are undocumented immigrants who may be enrolled at these universities.And considering that the Trump administration has said they really are not going to have any priorities, even though they've talked about going after criminals, really, they're going to go after everyone to drive up the numbers. Numbers are going to be the priority of the mass deportation plan. That's already been clear. And -- and so students who give their information and who are in the country and unlawful status, they can very well be targeted for deportation. And that's what I think universities are concerned about, in addition to the international students who they want to make sure are inside the country, because that's what the authority for blocking people is geared towards, blocking them from entering the United States.",

Essentially, even people who had U.S. spouses last time weren't able to get into the country in many cases. [13:35:03] SCIUTTO: Notable. Now, let me ask you this, because the prospect of, say, a UCLA not providing these records rings familiar to me. Because it sounds something like a sanctuary city, right, where you had cities who did not want to comply with some of the more draconian immigration regulations at -- at the federal level. Could universities, in effect, be oases from a policy such as this or would they be open to raids? I mean, could we see the prospect of raids in which students are picked up at universities and shipped out?",

But you know, having shock-and-awe type policies could be possible. I think the -- I think the bigger debate on international student policy is going to be -- Donald Trump had talked about allowing more to stay here and get green cards. Which is something, certainly, people like Elon Musk and other of his Silicon Valley supporters that supported the president -- the president-elect in his campaign would like to see. And someone like Stephen Miller, who's going to come in with a very restrictive policy and would probably like to keep many of the policies they tried to do the first time around.
