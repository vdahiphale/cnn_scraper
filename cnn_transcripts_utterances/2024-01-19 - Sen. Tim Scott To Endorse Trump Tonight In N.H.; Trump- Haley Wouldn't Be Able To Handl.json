But they did it without prejudice.That means they could always be resurrected. Since then, there's been further investigation. Elizabeth referenced that FBI report about that gun. And in the fall, this case was -- it was indicated this case was going to go to the grand jury.

But the prosecution has to prove a recklessness standard, meaning there is a disregard for human life. That's the standard under the law.Now, those are two different theories. One relates to Alec Baldwin's actual handling of the gun, and that critical question, Jake, did he pulled the trigger? The other is a bit broader. Remember, he's a producer on this, he is responsible for the set, there had been a walk off relating to safety concerns on the set previously, did he do his safety training? Those are all issues that are going to be prevalent at the trial. And the critical question is, what did he know? What was his subjective knowledge at the time?

And I think it's one of the most telling things that we have in terms of anti-abortion legislation, when they sat to write those exceptions for the life of the mother, they put a caveat in that says, if you have a life threatening emergency, you can have an abortion, unless that emergency is suicide. And if that emergency is suicide, you can't have an abortion. To me, there is no clearer example that they know and they knew and they know that forcing people to be pregnant will make them want to kill themselves and they enshrined into law that they don't care.",

Like Kate Cox's story and watching someone with a non-viable pregnancy. And the state telling them, it doesn't matter if that's non-viable. You need to carry it to term anyway. It sort of doesn't make logical sense. But when you start to understand that this was never about women or babies or families, but forcing pregnancy, enforcing pregnancy and childbirth, no matter what the cost or consequence, it starts to make a little bit more sense.So, no, they don't care about women. They don't care about babies. The infant mortality rate is going up in states like Texas where they have a strict abortion ban. And so this is very much about power and control, specifically power and control over women. And has nothing to do with babies or families or life, frankly.",

But I was and I love sports. And they did that. And that was such a treasured and cherished gift for me. And I'm sure you remember racing to the -- to your mail slot and -- at home or whatever, wherever you heard the mail person arriving to especially on Thursdays, I think it was, to grab that \"Sports Illustrated\" and start to read it.And you're right, the cover was iconic. It was much more than just a magazine. Now for people listening who are younger kids, they may not really understand the magnitude of what this meant to be on the cover of \"Sports Illustrated.\" But it was the greatest achievement really, you could have as an athlete, whether it was the 1999 Women's World Cup team was it, you know, President Ford was on the cover, of course, Michael Jordan, Muhammad Ali, over and over again and major issues also Jake, as you know, from steroids, to drug use, to racial issues, to issues involving women, although not so many of those assay wasn't great on that issue but on that topic.
