The lawyer for two women questioned by the House Ethics Committee says one of them told the panel she personally witnessed Gaetz having sex with a minor. We're breaking down what the lawyer said and the potential impact of Gaetz's confirmation.Also tonight, Trump could announce more cabinet picks at any time, with key positions including treasury secretary still to be revealed. This as the president-elect is confirming his plans to use the U.S. military to carry out mass deportations. Plus, a strategic shift in U.S. policy on the war in Ukraine, President Biden authorizing Kyiv to use very powerful American long- range missiles to strike inside of Russia. How it raises the stakes for the conflict and for the incoming Trump administration. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. And let's get right to the Breaking News, a lawyer speaking out about bombshell testimony in the House Ethics Committee investigation of now former Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz. It's fresh fuel for the firestorm surrounding President-elect Trump's choice of Gaetz to be the U.S. attorney general. Let's bring in CNN's Chief Legal Affairs Correspondent Paula Reid. Paula, what more are we learning tonight?",

We've learned that they've actually mined information gathered in a civil lawsuit down in Florida.Now, this civil lawsuit was brought by an associate of Gaetz against some people who were named in the criminal investigation. But as a result of opening this litigation, they engaged in discovery, which created a whole new record of evidence, including a deposition with a girl who was just 17 years old when she allegedly had sex with Gaetz. Now, her deposition is still under seal, but the lawyers for those who were sued in this case incorporated some of her sealed testimony into their own questions that are now, because of this lawsuit, part of an open record, including a statement where she claims that she had sex with Gaetz on an air hockey table. Now, a lawyer for another woman, who was spoken to by the ethics committee, says that she saw Gaetz having sex with a minor. Let's take a listen to what her lawyer said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The DOJ didn't actually go after Matt Gaetz for this, not because there wasn't a case and not because it didn't happen, but because they thought they might not be able to win it. And so those are two different things. One is the burden of proof as opposed to did it happen or did it not happen. At the end of the day, though President, Donald Trump -- you know, President-elect Donald Trump is not going to back down on this because, why, he is also someone who has been credibly accused of sexual assault. There are many members of his cabinet who are credibly accused of sexual assault. To back down on Matt Gaetz might open the door for other questions to be raised on his other picks.

And a lot of people have seen that discretion used against him, particularly people who aren't of means or of wealth. And so in that regard, his critique, I think, is pretty spot on.Now, we could, you know, argue and debate about who should lead the department within itself, but I don't necessarily have an issue with the critique of the Justice Department writ large. GARCIA-NAVARRO:  But, Shermichael, once if Matt Gaetz is actually put into place here, he is going to owe Donald Trump everything. Donald Trump will have gone to bat for him. He will have protected him. And he will now have him ensconced in the most important law enforcement position in the country.

That is just one of a number of things that President-elect Trump and his administration are thinking of doing. This remains to be seen if they can actually do it, and I'll tell you why. It is very hard to deport a lot of people like this. They're talking about a million people a year. Where are they going to put them? Where are they going to send them? Which people exactly are the ones that they're going to be looking for? They say they have a mandate. He ran on immigration. He did not hide that these were his plans. Many people support this.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice over):  For the desperately familiar scramble to find survivors after Russian missiles slammed into the border town of Sumi on Sunday night, less usual the death toll of 11, 2 children, a residential block hit. And just hours later, another ten killed in a strike on Odessa. Horrifically, this is now the norm for Ukraine. The weekend seeing a particularly large nationwide attack after nearly a thousand days of war. Donald Trump's election may have made diplomacy a likelihood again, but Ukraine's Zelenskyy clear how the strike showed, quote, what Russia is really interested in, only war. He visited two frontline towns under intense Russian pressure Monday, Pokrovsk, key to Ukraine's entire southeastern front, and Kupyansk, a town Russia was kicked out of in late 2022. All signs the war, for months, has not been going Ukraine's way. Perhaps behind the stark and significant U.S. policy change Sunday, sources telling CNN President Joe Biden has finally permitted Ukraine to use long range American missiles to strike inside Russia, something Zelenskyy has for months begged for. The plan to strengthen Ukraine is the victory plan I had presented to partners, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. Long-range possibilities for our army is one of its major points. Missiles will speak for themselves, he added. One U.S. official said the missiles would focus on Kursk, the part of Russia Ukraine invaded in August, where Moscow is due to make a counterattack and a key bargaining chip if peace talks begin. Biden's decision process familiar, like with HIMARS missiles, he said no, while Ukraine struggled to push Russia back in 2022, and then relented. And with Abrams tanks, he paused, so they arrived too late to help in 2023's counteroffensive. And F-16 jets, at first rejected, are now helping Ukraine push Russia's advances back. The ATACMS won't change Ukraine's war overnight. There are not enough of them. But it is a move Biden refused to make for months, saying it was too escalatory, but now endorses, entangling the U.S. deeper into the war just months ahead of Trump taking office. The fear, how Putin will react. When the idea first emerged, he said it would be a stark escalation. This will mean that NATO countries, the United States and European countries are fighting Russia, he said. (END VIDEOTAPE) WALSH (on camera):  Now, we haven't heard from the Kremlin head today, and it may be like in previous times, his sort of red lines begin to get fuzzy when the U.S. takes actions that he specifically warned them against. A foreign ministry spokesperson reiterated that kind of point, saying that Russia would respond adequately and in a similar vein. But this is an extraordinary move by the Biden administration, and it definitely changes the landscape that they will pass to President- elect Donald Trump. Maybe that's the point. Wolf?",

Secretary of Defense Austin, Secretary of State Blinken and so many others that have worked hard to create this coalition, that would not exist without the United States' leadership, without the U.S. leading that, without us pushing Russia, France, so many other countries to come to the table and give aid.That said, I have pushed for aid to be delivered faster, you know, as your prior segment pointed out, for certain systems to be delivered sooner on a quicker timeline.

We're also joined by CNN Contributor on Russian Affairs Jill Dougherty. General Hertling, how much of an impact will the use of these powerful ATACM weapons inside Russia have on Ukraine's ability to win this war? GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  It will contribute significantly to the tactical operations, Wolf. On the battlefield, these are intense weapons. They're highly kinetic. And depending on the type they use, whether high explosive or with the cluster munitions, it could be very effective against the Russian troops, specifically the Korean troops that are part of those formations. But we don't know yet how it will affect the issues strategically, because we don't know how Russia will react to the use of these weapons on their own soil.",

Maybe not too little but it's certainly too late. And then there are others, and especially you hear this from Trump supporters and the Trump team, that this is a very dangerous step. You certainly hear it from Putin, who is saying that this is a red line, and it's an indication that the United States now is directly involved in the conflict. And he says he'll retaliate.",

Riley, a student at the Augusta University College of Nursing, brutally murdered while she was jogging on the University of Georgia campus in February. Prosecutors have shown images of a man wearing clothes consistent with the defendants throwing out a jacket, with both his and Riley's DNA on it, and they've described Laken Riley as fighting for her life in her final moments, collecting DNA under her fingernails, which they say implicates Jose Ibarra as her killer.",

Even if you did not fly on Spirit, ushered in the term ultra low cost carrier so this might keyword might lead to ticket prices going up on other airlines. Here's the good news, if you have a ticket or a credit on Spirit Airlines, you will not notice any change. For now, spirit insists in a statement that guests can continue to book and fly without interruption and can use all tickets, credits and loyalty points as normal. Also, no impact to workers. The union representing Spirits flight attendants says their contract remains in place. No changes to pay or benefits, no furloughs or layoffs also, Spirits vendors will continue to get paid. The big question now is what will happen to Spirit in the long run? Frontier Airlines tried to merge with Spirit back in 2022, and just a few months later, JetBlue tried to do the same thing. But its acquisition of Spirit was blocked by the Justice Department on antitrust grounds. Frontier ended its merger plans with Spirit earlier this month, meaning no more apparent lifelines for Spirit Airlines. It's saddled with about $3 billion in debt, and now its really on passengers to pay attention. A top airline consumer advocate tells me that flights could be eliminated in the months ahead. So it's especially important to sign up for alerts and check your flight status online obsessively. One silver lining here is that this is unlikely to have an impact on Thanksgiving or holiday travel with the Thanksgiving rush just days away from beginning -- Wolf.",
