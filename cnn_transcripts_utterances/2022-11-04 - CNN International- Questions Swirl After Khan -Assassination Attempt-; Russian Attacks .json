Those are the latest health details that we received late last night from his close aides when they had a press conference. With regards to the investigation, there is that video that you mentioned earlier, there was a man who has not been identified, who spoke about his reasons for attacking Imran Khan. He gave a religious explanation. He said that he was - his rallies were playing music while the call to prayer was happening. We haven't been able to identify who that person is and under what circumstances that video was made by the Police. So, we're not going to be airing it on CNN.But, this is, of course, an investigation that always had the potential to be politicized, and that's what we're seeing unfold here in Pakistan. Imran Khan has come out, has sent a statement through his aides last night in which he has said that he wanted the nation to know that it is the Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, the Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah, and a senior intelligence official, Major General Faisal, who is behind this attack on Imran Khan. And, in response, the Interior Minister has responded saying that this is a grievous, irresponsible statement. Now, the government is saying that this incident took place in the province of Punjab where Imran Khan's party, the PTI, is in power self. It holds the provincial government, and the PTI is saying, Imran Khan's party, that the Inspector General of Police needs to be removed from office, and we're still waiting and seeing what Imran Khan is going to say once he finally speaks to the media, like you said, just exactly 24 hours after he was shot. So, a continuing situation here in Pakistan. Max.",

He also says a just completed inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency proves that Ukraine is not developing any \"dirty bombs\", as Russian President Vladimir Putin has claimed.

We understand from the U.S. that there is a growing, in my words, access of collaboration between Russia and Iran on weaponry that's being used now in this battlefield and including in civilian areas, in civilian - in the cities. So, this is very important for them now to get as much of that anti-missile defense in place.As well, the two Senators told me that they are currently now in The Hague, in the Netherlands, trying to get with the ICC, the International Criminal Court, some kind of special tribunal set up to prosecute alleged war crimes by Russia against this country, including in this term, this legal term, the crime of aggression.

And, we talked again with the Senators about does Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin get the message that any use of tactical nukes would have terrible consequences for Russia? And, the Senators said, absolutely. And, last week, Putin himself said they would use no nuclear weapons. And, the Russian Ambassador to the UK also said to me nuclear weapons are out of the question.But, nonetheless, this is a fear that has plagued this whole conflict since the very beginning.",

Let's go to Sioux City, Iowa, where Trump - the Trump rally took place where he made those comments.CNN's Jeff Zeleny is there for us live. What did you make of those comments as they unfolded, Jeff? JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Well, Max, look, I mean, the former president has been inching ever closer to teasing Iran. So, he added a couple more varies very, very probably, and he said, get ready. But, he did not give a timeframe. But, look, at this point, it would be far more surprising if he did not jump back in and have another bid for the White House than if he would. He has been teasing this, talking about it really for the better part of a year or longer. So, the question is exactly when? We're told likely the end of this month. But, the bigger point to all this is, are Republicans interested in seeing him come back? And, that's a question that we'll have to see play out.",

And, of course, the January 6 Commission is still investigating his role in trying to overturn the election. It goes on and on and on. Will it have an impact on his presidential bid? It's not going to have an impact on his decision to run. He will cast himself as a martyr and use some of these legal challenges, is ammunition really, to fuel his comeback.But, the question is, the substance of these allegations in many of these jurisdictions are quite serious. He is still being investigated by the Department of Justice, if he had a hand in overturning the election, sparking the insurrection. So, yes, they're very serious. But, that's one reason that he may want to jump in. So, the prosecution is slow a bit. And, we reported yesterday, my colleagues on the Justice Department, we reported that, look, they may appoint a special prosecutor to oversee this investigation now if he runs for president.

So, look for him to be a big competitor against Donald Trump. They've been sort of going head to head, some friction between the two of them. They'll be holding competing rallies on Sunday, actually, in the State of Florida. So, he is certainly one of them. But, there is also a long list that includes Mr. Trump's former Vice President, Mike Pence. He has been out campaigning aggressively. He has a book coming out next week. So, this is really going to be interesting to see if Trump's moves keep anyone out of this or if there is going to be a very big Republican field.And, of course, on the other side, the biggest question of all, Max, politically speaking in the U.S., is Joe Biden going to run again for president?
