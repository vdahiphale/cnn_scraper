And we actually begin our breaking coverage today in the Middle East, because we have breaking news out from Iran. State media report more than 100 people killed and many more injured in two explosions in what officials are calling a terrorist attack. The blasts happened in the city of Kerman, near the grave of slain military commander Qasem Soleimani. Soleimani was killed by a U.S. air strike four years ago. CNN's Nada Bashir is following developments from Beirut. Nada, what's the latest on this?",

      "sentences": "OK. This is certainly a developing story, but we are now getting more details from officials on the ground. As cited bystate media, as you mentioned, there are two separate blasts taking place in Kerman, injuring at least 141, but it was killing more than 100 people, according to the latest count, as reported by state media, citing officials on the ground. There have been questions, of course, around the cause of these twin blasts. And we have now heard from state media reporting that that first blast which took place at around 3 p.m. local time, according to the country's interior minister, was caused by a bomb placed in a suitcase, placed in a car. Now, this car was located some 700 meters away from the burial site of Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani. A second blast is said to have taken place about 20 minutes later, this blast about a kilometer away from a path where checkpoints were located for pilgrims to pass through in order to visit the burial site of Qasem Soleimani. And according to an interview that Iran's Interior Minister gave to us at the state broadcaster just a little earlier, the majority of those so far killed were killed by that second blast after rushing to the scene of the explosion to provide assistance. Now, of course, we have seen those dramatic videos emerging of crowds running away from the scene, emergency services rushing to support and help those injured and those killed in this incident. Of course, state media now characterizing this, citing officials as a terrorist incident. Important to note, of course, that this -- these twin blasts took place on the day which marks four years since Qasem Soleimani was killed in a U.S. strike on Baghdad International Airport as ordered by then-U.S. President Donald Trump. So, we would have been anticipating to see these enormous crowd gatherings to pay their respects to Qasem Soleimani. We are of course still monitoring the situation, getting more details from the ground reports, a huge point of concern. We are also expecting to hear just this hour from the Secretary General of the Iran-backed group in Lebanon, Hezbollah. Hassan Nasrallah set to give a speech today to mark the anniversary of Qasem Soleimani's killing. Of course, we will be waiting to see his comments with regards to this latest incident, if it does -- if indeed he does address this attack.",

But, of course, there are concerns about the potential for the conflict that we're seeing between Israel and Hamas escalating to other parts of the region.

This does have a lot of the hallmarks of a Sunni extremist terrorist group that was potentially trying to create some show of force at obviously an important moment/ milestone, Qasem Soleimani's four-year anniversary of his assassination.

The second, which obviously Tehran is going to say, let's blame Israel. But, there is no indication that I've seen yet that this was an Israeli operation. I think it's important to make that point in light of the assassination that did take place over the weekend against Hamas' second in command. However, it provides a Iran potentially a pretext, whether it's for going after Israeli interest, or let's not forget, four years ago, Iran held its fire and did not respond in the way that many were expecting after such an important military strategist was taken off of the battlefield.",

I mean, we also and Brett and Nada touched onthis as well, there was this assassination that Israelis -- Israel doesn't take credit or say yes or no that we did this. But, there are former Israeli officials who are out there congratulating the security services on the assassination of this Hamas figure. The White House is out there saying that they weren't aware that Israel was going to do this. How concerned are officials right now about the possible escalation here? LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST, &amp; WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, \"PBS NEWSHOUR\": Well, they're gravely concerned about an escalation into a regional conflict, and they have been since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, and since attacked October 7. And so, they've been frantically working to try to make sure that this doesn't escalate further. I mean, officials are still gathering information about the explosion in Iran on that front. And so, we haven't heard from the White House on that yet. But, I think this is certainly something that, to your point, in an election year, the President is just about to start his campaign in a matter of days, give his first campaign speech about domestic issues. But, front and center on a lot of Americans find, particularly the Democratic coalition that Biden has relied on, is what is going on in the Middle East. And it is what is happening with the Israel-Hamas conflict. And you're seeing that this is just becoming more fraught for the President here at home, and that he is going to have to really show that he is actively working to try to see if there could be an end to what's occurring over there.",

And yet, obviously, it can quickly spill over and the consequences of that, with everything that's going on in the region at the moment, is just quite extraordinary. And last point, Donald Trump, there is a domestic play to what just took place here. And I think Donald Trump is going to look to make hay, trying to make those comparisons with Joe Biden about what he would do at this moment, which obviously also increases the pressure on the White House, because Trump is going to be out there saber rattling, and that is going to add to the pressure here in Washington.",

He is planning to give a speech on January 6near Valley Forge, where George Washington camped in the winter 1777 with the Continental Army. Just to spell that out a little more clearly, President Biden will start 2024 near the place where the first Americans spent a terrible winter fighting to keep the still unrealized dream of a free democratic America alive. And he'll do it three years to the day after rioters breached the U.S. Capitol at the urging of a President who wanted to stay in office after he lost an election. Got it? I think we got it. The Trump campaign, meanwhile, kicked off the year with a memo outlining their central arguments, including trying to say President Biden is undermining American democracy, and also previewing how they will defend the former President against criticism over those four criminal indictments that he is facing. \"These are not just indictments against Donald Trump. They're indictments against millions of freedom-loving, hardworking Americans across this country.\" How is that for contrast in a general election? Let's dive into this with today's panel. Matt Gorman was Communications Advisor on Republican Senator Tim Scott's presidential campaign. Mark Longabaugh is a Democratic Strategist who worked on Bernie Sanders 2016 race. And Laura Barron-Lopez is back with us. So, yes, lots of metaphors. Let's -- I want to actually -- let's just have the Biden campaign spell this out, because this was all, of course, laid out. We've all been waiting for the Biden campaign to kick off its general election push. This is how they're choosing to do it. This is how his deputy campaign manager put it earlier today on CNN. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) QUENTIN FULKS, BIDEN-HARRIS DEPUTY CAMPAIGN MANAGER: We chose Valley Forge, George Washington, as you just said, you know, unionized colonies there and brought them all together. And then, he became President and set the precedent for, you know, peaceful transition of power, something that Donald Trump and Republicans refused to do. It's just as late as yesterday. And you know, we believe that they pose an existential threat to democracy. And over the last four years, that threat to democracy has only grown, and our campaign wants to communicate that message to voters that, you know, Donald Trump is telling us every day, who is going to be if he is reelected President.

And then, you can see those numbers there, equally both. Now, as somebody that was at the complex, I saw it with my own eyes, the protesters were not protesters. It was a violent mob at the Capitol. And Police officers that I know personally were injured. And obviously, we saw deaths as well at the Capitol. So, just to kind of clear that up. But, I think this says a lot about kind of where our political discourse has gone in this time. And the fact that you now have -- when people talk about J-6 heroes on right wing media, oftentimes they're talking about the people that were there. They're not talking about Police officers that were defending the Capitol.

But, I mean, there are progressives who are really upset about that. BARRON-LOPEZ: There are that are very upset because the administration has signaled, based on what sources have told me, that they're willing to do a lot in terms of mass deportations, do more in terms of limiting different access to asylum seekers that would totally overhaul actually the current U.S. asylum law. And that was something that Democrats forcefully attacked former President Donald Trump on repeatedly, including Kamala Harris, the Vice President, saying that the actions that Trump took during his administration were even unconstitutional. And you're seeing that the Biden administration is moving more and more in that direction on clamping down on the border. And they did keep in place Title 42, that deportation-era policy for a very long time, despite running on the fact that they were going to undo it. And they've also put in place much more restrictive immigration policy even after Title 42 was taken away by the courts. So, those are things that they've done. I mean, Biden is clearly saying he wants more money for border security. He wants to actually come to a deal. But, House Republicans are saying that they want a much more hard right bill, and that it's either that or nothing. And that will be where potentially the deal breaks down.",

They've got those gold leaf caucus captain hats going around with a big packet of instructions for people. It's really -- caucuses are a very complicated thing to organize.

As for momentum, the holidays kind of -- we haven't seen a lot of polling over the last couple of weeks. So, it's hard to say who is really moving. In the fall, Nikki Haley was definitely moving up. Her crowds have gotten bigger in Iowa. But then, DeSantis counters with a very important Governor Reynolds endorsement and of Bob Vander Plaats endorsement. And he has built a pretty big ground game. I think that -- they've also talked about. It's not like it's gone unnoticed. They have spent a ton of money in Iowa organizing. I spent a lot of time, done the 99 counties towards full Grassley. So, I think this is kind of coming down to a race to see who gets the right to go on to New Hampshire, who has momentum going to New Hampshire.

So, it's looked like she has been the one with the hot hand for the last month or so. But, again, it's Iowa. It's a little different. It's a more conservative electorate. Ground game really matters. These endorsements from Vander Plaats and Governor Kim Reynolds, who is very popular in Iowa, will definitely -- will help DeSantis a lot. So, I think -- I don't know if it'll be a photo finish between the two of them in Iowa. And I don't know if they'll beat expectations versus President Trump, which is, I think, what each of them are looking to try to do. But, DeSantis is going to need to pull something pretty big, I think, to go into New Hampshire with any momentum at all, because it looks like Nikki Haley has had the strongest hand there. And if you can make an argument that someone could actually beat Donald Trump in New Hampshire, you'd make the argument on her behalf. She has got the popular governor there, Chris Sununu on her side. So, we'll see how this plays out of Iowa.
