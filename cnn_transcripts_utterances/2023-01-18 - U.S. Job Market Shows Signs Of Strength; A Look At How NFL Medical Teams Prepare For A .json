Media companies are laying off workers, too. Even consumer giants like Walmart and Pepsi are reportedly trimming staff. At the same time, the overall job market though is in desperate need of workers. There are more than 10 million job openings in the United States, about 3 million more than before the pandemic. Weekly unemployment claims are low and hiring remains robust. So, what`s really going on in the job market? High profile headlines about tech layoffs don`t tell the whole story. The industry hired aggressively during the pandemic and now, it`s scaling back.",

Our Dr. Sanjay Gupta takes us to meet the NFL`s chief medical officer for a detailed look at all the precautions taken, all the product protocols that are in place to protect players in America`s most popular sport.

You may have missed this pop-up blue tent. It`s on every sideline. DR. ALLEN SILLS, CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER, NFL:  It`s like a medical exam room. We`ve kind of made this a medical space, even in the middle of a very busy stadium. It`s just so much easier to do things in here because like I said, everybody is just more relaxed.
