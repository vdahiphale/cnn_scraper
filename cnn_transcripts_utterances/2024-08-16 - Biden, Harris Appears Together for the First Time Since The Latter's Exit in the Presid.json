And the whole point of this speech was to really drive home his message on the economy.Now, when I talked to Donald Trump's senior advisers, they said that was really the goal for this entire week, that they wanted him to really drive a contrast between his economic policy and that which of his record when he was in office and compare that to what Harris is going to propose on Friday in North Carolina. Now, he had a series of props around him, a bunch of different groceries. And really, the point for him was to try and argue that Kamala Harris is responsible for the crunch that many Americans are feeling on their wallets. They also want to tie her to the Biden administration's economic policy. Part of that is because they know that Donald Trump pulled higher than Joe Biden when it came to that issue. And they believe that is a winning issue for him in November. Now, it was really interesting because Donald Trump really stuck to the script. He brought out a binder with him for these remarks. He put it on the podium, and then he read it line by line. However, once he started taking questions from the press, that restraint went out the window. And you really saw Donald Trump revert back to his well-worn playbook. I asked him specifically, you know, you have a lot of allies who are pressuring you, both privately and publicly, to stop with the personal attacks on Kamala Harris and focus on a more disciplined message, particularly when it comes to the issues, like the economy, but also immigration and crime. And he told me that he actually believes that he is entitled to those attacks. Take a listen. DONALD TRUMP (R), U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think I'm entitled to personal attacks. I don't have a lot of respect for her. I don't have a lot of respect for her intelligence. And I think she'll be a terrible president. And I think it's very important that we win.

Pressure is when the United States says that we have leverage on the state of Israel in terms of our protection of it in the United Nations Security Council, where we veto resolutions that are critical of Israel. We have leverage over Israel when it comes to the provision of offensive weaponry and financial support. And when that leverage comes into question, that's pressure. Right now, all we have is talk. Right now, all we have is rhetoric. Right now, all we have is the Biden administration saying we wish that things weren't the way that they are. Well, they are the way that they are. And unfortunately, until Benjamin Netanyahu feels that there will be actual leverage used against him, then he will continue to act with impunity, which is precisely what he's been doing for the past ten months, precisely because he knows that the Biden administration puts down red lines, including going to Rafah, including, you know, various actions over the past 10 months.

They have, according to Ukrainian officials, gained over 1,000 square kilometers of territory, 82 settlements.And we heard yesterday from the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announcing, confirming that Ukraine had captured yet another town, this time the town of Suzha, near Kursk. He said that this town is now fully under the control of Ukrainian forces as the Ukrainian troops continue to advance and push deeper into Russian territory as part of their ongoing incursion. As you mentioned, this has really put Russia on the back foot. This has been a huge source of embarrassment, of course, for the Kremlin and, of course, for Russian President Vladimir Putin. Tens of thousands of Russians have been forced from their homes. In fact, in the region of Belgorod, the Russian government has now been forced to declare that the region is in a state of federal emergency. We've heard from officials saying that the situation in Belgorod is, quote, \"difficult and tense.\" Now, as you mentioned, Ukrainian military officials have said that they haven't observed a shift in the presence of Russian troops in the occupied territories of Ukraine.

But, of course, what we've also been hearing from Western officials is that they do not believe that Russia is moving its larger, more advanced troops to its internal defenses, rather focusing on relying on conscripts from other parts of Russia to bolster its defenses, particularly in that Kursk region.

However, while this has been somewhat successful at this stage, what we are hearing from Western officials is that they do not believe that Ukrainian troops will be able to hold onto these Russian territories for a long time. And, in fact, there is still too early to tell, according to Western officials, just exactly how this latest incursion by Ukrainian troops will affect the broader outcomes of the war in Ukraine.

Ernesto is expected to pass near or over Bermuda on Saturday. But the hurricane can and has caused major damage without making landfall.In Puerto Rico, intense rainfall and flooding caused several rivers to overflow, impeding service at a number of water processing plants, which left hundreds of thousands of customers without drinking water. Meanwhile, strong winds from Ernesto knocked out power to nearly 300,000 customers on the island amid an excessive heat warning, making life and the recovery after the storm that much more difficult. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MADELYNE MATOS, PUERTO RICAN BUSINESS OWNER (through translator): This has been really hard. This is hard for us in our daily lives and for those of us who have businesses. I am in Dorado, but on behalf of all of us in Puerto Rico, each person suffers. Their pockets suffer. And worst of all is that if you make a phone call, they don't answer. They don't respond. And we are tired of seeing this happen. We'll be working and the power goes out. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It's been intensifying rapidly and is now the equivalent of a Category 4 hurricane. Thousands have been ordered to evacuate along coastal cities. More than 1,000 households were without power this morning. The storm is causing major disruptions during Japan's peak travel season. Two of the country's major air carriers canceled about 500 flights serving Tokyo. And several lines on the bullet train network are suspending rail service in warning of major delays. There is some good news. Ampil is expected to weaken by Saturday morning local time as it moves into cooler waters. A strong earthquake has struck Taiwan. The 6.1 magnitude quake hit off the island's east coast Friday morning. There is no tsunami threat and emergency officials say there are no immediate reports of damage. The island has frequently had tremors due to its location between two tectonic plates. This one happened near the epicenter of a deadly earthquake that hit the island in April.

GIOKOS (voice-over): Annual fires have become one of Greece's biggest problems in the Attica region, that includes the entire Athens metropolitan area. In the last eight years, wildfires destroyed more than 700,000 hectares here. Climate change has increased the risk of wildfires in Greece. Higher temperatures, drier forests, stronger winds. SIDIRPOULUS (through translator): The climate has changed. The temperature has definitely risen. There is no vegetation anywhere. So even the stones are scorching hot.

The display includes a mural of a gorilla with birds and other works including a mountain goat, monkeys, a wolf and a couple of pelicans. In a post on social media, the zoo says the animal-themed works will be moved for safekeeping. The zoo says it's thrilled by the joy the artwork has brought, but it needs to make full use of its entranceway where the art is located.And speaking of art, this artist is quite unique for a very simple reason. Limbani, as he's known, is a chimpanzee. The Zoological Wildlife Foundation discovered and encouraged the eight-year-old's talents and gives him free reign to express himself on canvas or paper or whatever. They say Limbani enjoys the process and has become a professional. His artworks are now available for purchase. The proceeds help to support his home, well-being and conservation.
