It says two drones were flown towards the seat of the Russian presidency last night and that Putin was not in the building at the time. CNN analysis of video showing the incident does support claims that drones were flown above the Kremlin, but there is no evidence of Ukrainian involvement.

Misinformation amplified by social media and the threat of artificial intelligence manipulating everything we see and hear makes fact-based journalism more essential than ever. The Committee to Protect Journalists which was recognized at the NASDAQ opening today says, a record 363 journalists were behind bars in 2022. We've seen evidence of that most recently in Russia's arrests of \"Wall Street Journal\" reporter Evan Gershkovich. World Press Freedom Day is also a moment to remember the courageous journalists who've lost their lives in pursuit of the truth, facts and evidence. And this marks in nearly a year since the renowned Al Jazeera correspondent, the Palestinian American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh was shot dead while covering an Israeli raid in the occupied West Bank. CNN's investigation revealed evidence suggesting that Shireen was killed in a targeted attack by Israeli forces, which Israel denies. Al Jazeera's documentary about their own colleague's death won a Polk Award earlier this year. And here is part of that film. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  Shireen, wake up, wake up. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  They were saying she's wounded, but no, she was a martyr.

And to be honest, you know, this is part of a long-standing pattern by the Israeli military. The Committee to Protect Journalists is actually releasing a report next week on the killings of journalists by the Israeli military, going back over two decades. They look at 20 separate cases of journalists killed by the Israeli military and they find a pattern of Israeli response that's designed to evade responsibility.

If that is indeed the case, then we can only look to the security council -- the security coordinator's original report back in July which relied heavily on the Israeli investigation and came to, essentially, the same conclusion, an Israeli soldier likely killer, but that it wasn't intentional. They don't specify how they determine that. So, you know, and like I said, this contradicts the video footage and the eyewitness testimony.

It has to be because as a king, he's the head of a multicultural country and also thehead of a multicultural commonwealth, a collection of 56 former British imperial states. So, the British government can engage in these culture wars. But the monarch can't really because he's got ahead to this international association of countries. And actually, one of the things they really want to talk about is the legacies of slavery and the legacies of empire, and it is something that the government doesn't necessarily want to talk about. But I think you are going to see a very multicultural, very inclusive ceremony. I mean, \"The Lord's Prayer\" has been said in multiple languages. There are people from the commonwealth.

This is an amazing thing for so many people of color in Britain. And I can't help noticing it went very, very wrong, and she's not even coming. And, you know, I've traveled around the former empire this year, and there is a view that this is reflective of the racism of the royal family. And actually, there is much less support in multicultural Britain for the monarchy than there is generally. I think 38 percent of ethnic people in Britain support the monarchy. Whereas, a general figure of 68 percent. And I think this is a real problem for the royal family because they also, historically, tied up in the racism of British Empire. I mean, black and Asian immigrant staff were banned from working in clerical roles in Buckingham Palace until the late 1960s.

And actually, I think, you know, the establishment disliked him for that. And it's going to be interesting to see how he plays it because now he is the ultimate establishment.
