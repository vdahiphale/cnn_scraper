We bring you a report on what was found. And Israel's allies wrestle with conflict and conscience. My conversation with former French President Francois Hollande. Then, a story of devastating loss. Dr. Izzeldin Abuelaish still fights for peace after losing dozens of family members to this war in Gaza. And finally, the power of words. Author Jason Stanley tells Hari Sreenivasan how language can influence war. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. Israel pushes ahead in Gaza, leaving the world in turmoil. In Washington, pro-Palestinian demonstrators chant for a ceasefire. Whilst in Israel itself, the five-day march to parliament in Jerusalem continues, demanding all their hostages be rescued or released. As conditions in Gaza and the death toll there worsen, Israel's allies grow increasingly concerned. Despite widespread condemnation, the IDF remains inside the main hospital, the Al-Shifa, which they claim was a Hamas command center. They have yet to release conclusive proof of that, and this was the scathing reaction of the Israeli claim from the Jordanian foreign minister. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

As we said, many of Israel's staunchest supporters abroad are trying to maintain that support while warning of the dangers of what the U.N. calls carnage in Gaza. And I've been speaking to the former French President, Francois Hollande. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) President Hollande, welcome back to our program. We are in a terrible, terrible global situation right now. And I wonder what your immediate thoughts are about the solution, the immediate solution, with the storming of the Al-Shifa Hospital, with the amount of deaths of civilians that are clearly mounting in Gaza. Your own president called for a ceasefire. What do you think? FRANCOIS HOLLANDE, FORMER FRENCH PRESIDENT (through translator):  We are in a war, a murderous war. Hamas is responsible for it. We know that Israel is going to push for the eradication of this terrorist organization, but there must be respect for humanitarian law. And that is why I've been urging, like many others, for a provisional ceasefire. And I stress provisional because we need to get the hostages freed, evacuated the wounded and to get help to the people inside Gaza, particularly the displaced persons. Afterwards, after what has happened in the hospital, I think there must be a provisional ceasefire. While some people have called a humanitarian truce, but I think it would be better to call it a provisional ceasefire, because I think this will allow us to prepare for what happens afterwards. So, it's during the war that we have to prepare for post-war.",

With the return of war like this I think we simply cannot have the same kind of images coming back every 10 years, terrorist attacks followed by Israeli intervention. Neither can we accept the settlements that Netanyahu supported in the West Bank, which tomorrow can give rise to such dramatic events as we've just seen in Gaza.

So, the Israelis really should be asking themselves how they want to live now and next to whom and whether it should be with or without a Palestinian State?

So, about Ukraine and Russia. It looks as if people have taken their eye off that for the moment. I don't know whether government's have but it's not in the news, it's not being talked about. Are you worried that Putin is making hay, in other words, taking advantage of this crisis in the Middle East, even Xi Jinping? HOLLANDE (through translator):  Putin wants to gain time across the board. Time is in his favor. I think that in Ukraine, the fact that the conflict on the front line isn't moving, despite the Ukrainian counteroffensive means essentially that what he's doing is to wait for the U.S. elections and hoping that if the Republicans win, and in particular Donald Trump, that the U.S. will abandon Ukraine and that the Europeans would not mobilize quickly enough to assist it. As for the Israeli Palestinian conflict, Putin only sees advantages in its continuing because meantime, nobody's going to reproach him for bombing Ukrainian towns or getting more arms from either Iran or North Korea. So, we see that authoritarian regimes, Russia, China as well, are thinking about it. Hence the meeting. between Biden and Xi Jinping. And at any rate, Russia has every interest in these crises never being resolved. And Xi Jinping, as well as Putin, calculate that we are weak, weak because we don't want to defend ourselves properly. And they think that we are weak from within our divisions, our societies, which are difficult to govern, the social debates. All these sows doubt as to the solidity of democracy.",

Because billions ofdollars in American and European help and military assistance has gone to Ukraine. And as you say, there main general has called it a stalemate right now. What would you do now to send Putin the message that you want to deliver? HOLLANDE (through translator):  We will continue to assist Ukraine, to supply them with more and more powerful arms until such time that Russia eventually decides it cannot occupy a territory which is not theirs. And if, regrettably, the U.S. were to withdraw their assistance to Ukraine, then we Europeans, with the British, should continue to increase even more our aid to Ukraine.

He showed me what happened there. And yet, he held on to his dream of peaceful coexistence, writing a memoir called \"I Shall Not Hate.\" But now, some 25 of his family members have been killed in Gaza in this new war. So, I asked Dr. Abuelaish how he's able to hold on to forgiveness in the face of such loss. Dr. Abuelaish, welcome to the program. We have spoken together over many, many years. The first time we met was in 2009 after your daughters, your nieces were killed in an Israeli tank fire during the last -- or one of the last ground invasions. You then wrote a book called \"I Will Not Hate -- I Shall Not Hate.\" How were you able to summon that forgiveness at that time? DR. IZZELDIN ABUELAISH, PHYSICIAN AND PEACE ACTIVIST:  At that time, even when I wrote my book, \"I Shall Not Hate,\" because the people were expecting me to be afflicted with this disease called hated. And even I mentioned it, if I could know that my daughters were the last sacrifice on the road to peace between Palestinians and Israelis, then I will accept it. My daughters and my niece were not the last. They are just numbers. And these series are continuing until now among the tens of thousands who are killed. That's why I don't accept it.

My nephew, Ali (ph), he is a physiotherapist.

I wonder what you would say to that. DR. ABUELAISH:  You know, I want to be able to differentiate, not to generalize. And this is one of the problems, the propaganda they use at Palestinian people by their nature are secular people. But the current situation in the Gaza Strip and to reduce the conflict and the situation just in Hamas and Israel, not as a Palestinian people with an Israeli people. That's what is needed. This is the main issue. Put an end to it. And even Hamas was elected in 2006. Since 2006 until now, we don't have election. Help us to have election, to have a free democratic election on the all of the occupied Palestinian territories, in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem, and let the Palestinians decide by themselves who can leave them. I urge -- and we want to have a new leadership that represents the whole Palestinian people. And even what is going on back home, it's -- there is difference between Palestinian Authority and PLO. Who represents the Palestinian people everywhere is PLO, not the Palestinian Authority. Palestinian Authority is a byproduct of Oslo Agreement, which was signed between PLO and Israel. And even for that, PLO recognized the existence of Israel. But Israel, they didn't recognize until now the existence of the Palestinian people. And all of the time you hear it, they say, no for 67 borders, no for East Jerusalem, no for withdrawal of the settlements, and of course, no for the rights of the return. So, what else? We want to live side by side based on international law and international resolutions. This is the guarantee for long-lasting harmony and life between Palestinians and Israelis.

This is a word fraught with historical associations. Now, I think we can talk. We can talk about the factuality of the word genocide. In our work, we emphasize again and again that speech is more than just about factuality. Here, it's particularly horrific to accuse Israel of genocide because the very word genocide, historically, it originates with Lemkin and it's connected to the Holocaust. So, when you cast that against Israel, Israel's actions, whether it's factually apt or not, it carries an extra knife edge. Now, the other direction, when Israel or various forces in Israel accuse Hamas of genocide, they're trying to connect Hamas to the Nazis. Now, Hamas is a violent terrorist, genocidal, murderous organization that in no sense should be equated with Palestinians, but this sort of grows and this is what you're finding the Israeli government or portions of the Israeli government saying -- they're saying, well, the allies bombed Germany into submission, killed a lot of civilians. That's what we're doing to target Hamas because that situation is exactly like the Nazis because they tried to commit genocide against us. How is it that they feel OK using that term, genocide, against a very weak -- a much weaker opponent, Hamas, and the combined forces of Hamas are strong and terrifying and a threat, but it's not like Nazi Germany. Nazi Germany was an overwhelming power that threatened the world and targeted Jews for no reason whatsoever. There's a long history here. So, what's happening in Gaza is not Nazi Germany. I mean, that's absurd. There's a long history here. But by saying that Hamas is perpetrating genocide, and it's like the allied war attack invasion of Germany, they're reaching back into history to try to make these historical connections. Again, it's not factuality, it's history.",

And other times it'snecessary to use the fraught historical vocabulary. I think it's necessary to point out that Trump is speaking like a Nazi. He's not speaking antisematically. There's no antisemitism there, although anti-Semites will hear it that way. But, you know, it's important to use the historical resonances. Now you're asking, when it's important to back away from the historical resonances, from terms that are loaded, to calm things down, how do we do that? And I think, you know, my colleagues at Yale, who work on climate change, they -- they've made advances on this problem. They go to communities in -- that tend to -- when they hear the expression, human caused climate change or climate change, they tend to think that's the opponents, that's the people I shouldn't trust, that's vocabulary. You know, that means they're Democrats, you know, they're Democrats. And they try to point them to actual circumstances in their communities that are actually the consequences of climate change but things that the local community sees. We're losing sand on the beach, let's do something about that. Let's protect their shoreline. So, you switch the vocabulary up to avoid the expressions that are connected with polarization. And the goal of -- one goal of politics, a political strategy, is to infuse more and more words with this kind of identity. So, as soon as your political opponent uses one of those words, in this case, climate change, people's minds shut off. So, they group people into groups and people don't listen to the arguments. They're just like, OK, that's my opponent.",
