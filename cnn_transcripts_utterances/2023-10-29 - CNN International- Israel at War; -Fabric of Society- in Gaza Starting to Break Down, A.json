But still hearing those strikes from the aircraft, still seeing the yellow flashes from the horizon, the occasional artillery round fired into Gaza as wellBut also, significantly as well, Hamas or other groups inside Gaza still able to fire rockets into Israel. We had to take cover here twice through the evening because of incoming rocket fire. The sirens went off. The Iron Dome intercepts came up, but it is generally quieter. But we're also hearing now that the IDF have made it at least two miles into the Gaza Strip, two miles from the northern border. It does seem that they've come down the coast and they've avoided those dense -- densely populated civilian area. Significant in part because President Biden has been -- has had a phone call with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and again stressed the need to avoid civilian casualties. U.N. agencies are voicing their concern, perhaps even more loudly about the situation in Gaza. One of the agencies, the U.N. agencies there that handles humanitarian supplies for refugees there, has said that their warehouses were overrun by people looting them on Saturday, and they're concerned that the fabric of society in Gaza is breaking down. The -- one of the NGO agencies for protecting children has said it is absolutely time for a ceasefire to protect the children of Gaza. So, there is increasing pressure on Israel to, sort of, contain control this increasing -- increasingly deeper military incursion into Gaza, at the same time pressure -- more pressure to allow humanitarian aid in, more pressure to have a ceasefire. But at the moment, it feels as if there's not a pause, but at least not as much military movement as there was in the early part of the weekend. Nic Robertson, CNN, Sderot, Israel. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

In that phone conversation, the President reiterated that Israel had a right to defend itself, but he also underscored the need to do so in a manner consistent with international humanitarian law that prioritizes the protection of civilians.And that was from the White House summary of the call. Of course, this is all illustrative of the fine line that President Biden is walking as he confronts this growing crisis in the Middle East. On the one hand, he is a staunch defender of Israel and certainly a defender of its right to protect itself. But he is also calling for protection of civilians and calling on Israel to adhere to international humanitarian law and avoid targeting civilians. And certainly, as the images out of Gaza come to light, there will be pressure on President Biden, certainly from the progressive left in the United States, but also from American Arab partners to do more and to say more to ease the humanitarian suffering. And in that phone call with Netanyahu, President Biden did say that there was a need to immediately and significantly increase the flow of humanitarian assistance. Now, we did learn more from the U.S. National Security Adviser, Jake Sullivan, about those negotiations to free hostages who are being held in Gaza, among them potentially Americans. He said that the expanded Israeli effort in Gaza had not stopped those negotiations, but that so far Hamas had not been forthcoming in releasing the hostages. And he also addressed these efforts to get Americans who are stuck in Gaza, hundreds of them, out -- across the border into Egypt. He did say that the Egyptians are willing to accept foreign nationals and that the Israelis are also not putting up resistance to that effort, but that so far, Hamas is making its own demands and putting up resistance to opening that border. So, President Biden certainly remains focused on the situation in the Middle East. We also learned that he did speak to the Egyptian president. With him, he discussed the humanitarian aid efforts, and he also discussed the expanded Gaza offensive. But interestingly, the two men also discussed the importance of ensuring that Palestinians in Gaza are not displaced to Egypt or any other nation. And so, while the Egyptians appear receptive to having foreign nationals cross the border into Egypt, it does not appear as if they are receptive to having Palestinians cross that border.

Targeting, among other things it says, Hezbollah infrastructure. Hezbollah concedes that almost 50 of its fighters have been killed in these skirmishes. Several Lebanese civilians have also been killed. According to the International Organization for Migration, around 29,000 civilians have fled communities along the border to safer ground further north. The continued skirmishes on the border are feeding fears the conflict in Gaza could spark a broader regional conflict. Friday, the U.S. Embassy advised all U.S. citizens to leave Lebanon now while commercial flights are still available. The U.S., just the latest country to urge their nationals to leave while they still can. A hint of where Hezbollah sees this conflict going may come this Friday when the group's charismatic but reclusive leader, Hassan Nasrallah, silent until now, is scheduled to make a speech.
