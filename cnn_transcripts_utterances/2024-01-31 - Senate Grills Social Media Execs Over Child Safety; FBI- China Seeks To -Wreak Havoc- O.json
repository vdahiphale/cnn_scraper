Angry members, of the, Senate Judiciary Committee, confronting them, about their company's ties, to the deaths of children, kids, who were, in some way harmed, by the impacts, of social media, including online harassment, and exploitation.

And this is about finally getting some accountability.I felt a sea change, having taken on issues from App Store fees, to social media companies, engaging in monopoly conduct. I felt some hope, in that room, today, few reasons. Bipartisan, you could see it. I think the companies always try to divide and conquer. They think, oh, we'll tell the liberals, this is bad. We'll tell the conservatives, this is bad. I think they think this is too esoteric to matter. I think those parents standing there, with the pictures of their kids, behind the CEOs, will be forever etched in people's memory. And the third thing is they always think, oh, Congress doesn't know what they're doing. That's not the Senate Judiciary Committee. We know what we're doing. And this focus on making them accountable. No other industry is like this. They -- literally, this rule was put in place before I was in Congress. It said they can't be sued for anything. And yet, they profit off of these kids. And opening up the courtroom doors would make a huge difference. They are no longer little companies in a garage. Giving law enforcement the tools they need, to go after the fact that we have pills laced with fentanyl. Two Minnesotans were there, whose kids just got one pill off the internet. They thought it was a Percocet. And it was laced with fentanyl and they died. And then finally, she mentioned it, Christine mentioned it, sextortion. We've had over 20 kids, according to the FBI, commit suicide, just because they're looking for a girlfriend, or a boyfriend, and someone lures them in that's really a corrupt person. And they give them their picture, naked picture, whatever. And then, they basically extort them. And the kid, who's maybe 15-years-old, kills themselves, because they think their whole life is over. This is happening, right now, in America. And the fact that, as I noted, a jet loses a door, and thank God, no one was killed, and we ground the 700 planes, which was the right thing to do? And this is going on. And we just sit. So, I am glad that Senator Schumer is committed. He's met with a number of us, to bring these bills to the floor. They're all bipartisan. And the time has come.
