Things that are making a difference in people's lives along with good paying jobs. And I think that's a story we need to keep telling because as usual in politics, there's a lot of noise.

But we also know that the measures we're taking to make life easier, to make budgets easier for American families is the right path and the other way, their way of more tax cuts for the wealthy.

People are comfortable with you.And I have a mission and that mission was clear. You know, when Martin Luther King was assassinated in April of '68, it was -- that was something that was quite traumatic for the whole country and I got to know Martin Luther King's widow, the true queen of America, Coretta Scott King, and she taught me a lot. And she said to me, you know, Byron, as Black people in this country, we have four major challenges. Number one, end slavery; number two, end Jim Crow; number three, achieve Civil Rights, and then she choked up and she said, and number four, the real reason they killed my Martin, achieve economic inclusion.

They killed him over the speech he gave in February of '68 at Stanford University, \"The Other America\" where he said there are two Americas and one America has access to opportunity, education, and economic inclusion, and the other America doesn't. There are two Americas and one America will not survive. And from that point on, I decided that I was going to dedicate my life to building the world's greatest media company to help effectuate change for the greater good and to achieve one America.
