And now the Anglican and Episcopal churches are without a leader as officials try to figure out what comes next.Plus, Congress is back in session and now we're just hours away from a critical vote. Will the MAGA wing of the Republican Party secure even more power ahead of Trump's return to Washington, D.C. tomorrow? And leading this hour, the president-elect's cabinet taking shape. His early hires are sending a strong signal as to what Trump's first priorities will be after he takes office again in January. The latest picks, both announced and expected, are national security and foreign policy focused, including secretary of state, homeland security and U.S. Ambassador to Israel. CNN's Kristen Holmes is here in studio. And Kristen, you covered the Trump campaign. Just got back from Mar-a- Lago. What do these new picks tell you about a second Trump administration?",

He is somebody who, while not Jewish, could strengthen ties between Netanyahu and evangelical Christians in America, something that Netanyahu has wanted to do.

And I asked him about any concerns that he may have given the narrowness of his expected majority. We have not called the House yet, but if they are on track at the moment to hold on to pretty a razor thin margin, very similar to what they have currently.And when we saw what happened to Kevin McCarthy in the last Congress, he took him 15 ballots to initially be elected speaker. And then of course he got ousted from the speakership in historic fashion. I asked him if he had any concerns that a handful of people on the far right in particular may try to prevent him from getting the speakership on January 3, he told me he's not. He believes his members will be online and he's going to try to rely on Donald Trump's support to get those members in line. And also Jake, he plans to go to Mar-a-Lago this weekend as they try to formulate the legislative strategy for the rest of this Congress and as Donald Trump takes power next January.",

And, you know, Donald Trump is someone they continue to see as an outsider, someone who's not from politics. You know, for me, I'm somebody that comes at this from a sense of public service. I'm not central casting of what you'd imagine a senator from New Jersey to look like. But they like that. They like that. I stood up to leaders in my own party over the last year, standing up against the previous senator who was indicted, standing up against the machine politics of New Jersey, you know, and that resonates with people.
