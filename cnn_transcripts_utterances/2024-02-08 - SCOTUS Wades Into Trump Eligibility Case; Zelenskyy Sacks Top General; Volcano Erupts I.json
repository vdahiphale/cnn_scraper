A breakdown of the historic arguments coming up. A major shake-up, Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy removes his top General. We'll ask what it means for the battlefield. We are live in Ukraine this hour. Also, the sky caught fire and the ground shook. An Icelandic volcanic eruption put on a dangerous display for a second time this year. But first this hour. The direction of the 2024 U.S. presidential election is literally hanging in the balance today after the Supreme Court heard arguments on whether Colorado can keep Donald Trump off the ballot. In the nearly two-hour hearing, there were signs the justice may side with the former president in the case. Most notably, when Chief Justice John Roberts questioned whether a handful of states should be allowed to decide the election. Well, attorneys for a group of Colorado voters argued Trump should be removed from the state ballot on constitutional grounds following the January 6 insurrection. The former president uncharacteristically stayed away from the proceedings, but had, well, this to say from Florida. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And interestingly, you know, the question of whether the former president engaged in insurrection, which is the standard here, really wasn't addressed very much at all in today's arguments. The focus was, as Marshall noted on whether, you know, every state, each state could decide this issue of who is eligible to be the president themselves?

And what we heard today for two hours, I heard all of it was heavily legal. But Trump's lawyer, Jonathan Mitchell said, we've never accepted this was an insurrection.
