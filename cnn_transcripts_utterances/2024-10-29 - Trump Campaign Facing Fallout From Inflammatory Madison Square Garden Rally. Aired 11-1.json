      "sentences": "All right, at any moment, former President Donald Trump will speak at his Mar-a-Lago resort as his campaign is grappling with the fallout from an inflammatory rally Sunday at Madison Square Garden.Plus, Vice President Kamala Harris will head to the site of Trump's infamous January 6 speech here in Washington, D.C. What we are learning about her closing message just one week out from Election Day. Good morning. You are live in the CNN NEWSROOM, busy morning. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington. And CNN's Alayna Treene joins us now from Mar-a-Lago. I mean, Alayna, this was supposed to start about an hour ago. We're now being told, I guess, by the pool or something that might be around 11:10. So we're still watching and waiting here. I mean, what do we expect from Trump in these remarks? I can't imagine he's going to apologize for what took place at Madison Square Garden. He had a chance to do that in the hours that went by before his speech Sunday night. He had all day yesterday to do it. Do we think he's going to do it now? I hate to put you in that position of guessing, but what do you expect?",

      "sentences": "I mean, look, Donald Trump is always unpredictable. We have no idea what he will do.You know, your guess is as good as mine. I think that is the big question, whether or not he's going to use this setting to condemn or at a minimum address those really racist and sexist comments made by other speakers at Madison Square Garden on Sunday. But I will say this. I have covered Donald Trump for several years. That is not his M.O. He is not someone, it's not really in his nature to apologize, not even for things that he said, but this is something that other people had said. So we will see what happens. Again, I'm not going to guess, because you never know with Donald Trump, but I think that's what we're all waiting to see. I think the big question of whether or not he will address it is whether or not he takes question. So this was dubbed, this event, as press remarks, not necessarily a press conference. I know that's -- I'm getting in the weeds here with the lingo, but all to say, a lot of times, a lot of the journalists, Donald Trump's team will tell reporters that they will be able to ask questions, they think he will take questions, and then he does not. So that's another question as well, whether or not Donald Trump even takes questions from the press today. But, Jim, I do want to talk a little bit about where he's going after this event, because I think it's very notable in the context of what we're discussing, which is he's going to Pennsylvania for a pair of two events. One is going to be a rally in Allentown. Now, Allentown, as we have discussed, has a huge Puerto Rican population. I mean, Pennsylvania overall has a massive Puerto Rican population. More than half-a-million Puerto Ricans reside in Pennsylvania, obviously, a very critical battleground state that a lot of people believe could be the deciding state in this election. And I think the reason that these comments are so important in the context of the campaign, of course, we have talked about how inflammatory, derogatory, demeaning those remarks were on Sunday, but I think when you turn it into what does that mean for the election, there are questions because a lot of what Donald Trump is trying to do in this next seven days is to make a difference on the margins. His campaign, Jim, recognizes how close this election is supposed to be. They think it's going to be one on the margins. And that's why you have seen Donald Trump spend so much time targeting key demographics, which includes the Hispanic population in this country, many of which -- and many Puerto Ricans in this country.",

In other words, they're not trying to respond directly to January 6 of 2021. Rather, they want to paint a broader vision for the country. That is what the vice president is intending to do in her remarks, but they also want to provide that visual. With the Oval Office just 500 yards behind her, they want to convey the message of it's either the vice president or it's going to be the former president by using one of the lines that the vice president has used multiple times over the last several days, that it is either going to be the former president, as she said, consumed by revenge and what she calls his -- quote -- \"enemies list\" or the vice president and her -- quote -- \"to-do list for Americans.\" And on that end, the vice president expected to walk through her policies and proposals on some of the key issues that have been top of mind for voters, be it the economy, what she calls the opportunity economy, health care, reproductive rights, immigration, among others. Again, this is going to be more extensive remarks by the vice president trying to do two things at once., paint the stark contrast with former President Donald Trump, not only what she says is the risk that he poses to the country, but also to the way that the U.S. is perceived abroad, while then pivoting too to that forward-looking optimism that her campaign has tried to project from the very beginning. Now, again, this is -- the vice president has been working on this speech with -- alongside her aides for some time now. This will all culminate in those remarks at the Ellipse this evening. And it is going to be one of the last opportunities, one of the last big opportunities that her team has to relay this message to especially undecided voters. That's what senior advisers to the vice president say, that this is going to be an attempt for them to try to capture votes that up until this point remained up in the air. It could be, for example, disaffected Republicans, as they have been trying to do in those moderated conversations alongside Republican Liz Cheney, just as much as it could be those voters who are still unclear on the vice president and her policies because they say they just don't know her well enough. So this is certainly especially targeted to the voters who remain on defense, and they're hoping that they can relay that message to them through these remarks tonight at the Ellipse -- Jim.",

It's not just the fact that these are American citizen voters in swing states. It also really just cuts to this idea of how we speak about people, what that language means and how it affects them. The whole big idea behind this rally that Donald Trump had in New York in Madison Square Garden was this sort of closing argument that was supposed to be this festival that was going to showcase him and his strength in what is a very blue city in a blue state. And, instead, what you have is a huge scandal that has united the Puerto Rican community from Bad Bunny all the way to the archbishop, the Catholic archbishop on the island of Puerto Rico itself, who have all condemned these very crass statements.",

So, The reason why you have to do more than clean up the rhetoric is, you have got to remind people that your populism is for all Americans. And this is the challenge now that they're trying to run a campaign that will rest on the votes of people of color, which they didn't try to do it in 2016.

On the contrary, I have to tell you, Kamala intends to conflict and keep this misery going, and she's going to keep it going as long as she can, because that's the only way she can get elected. She's going out and only criticizing, talking about Hitler and Nazi, and -- because her record's horrible. Her borders are the worst in the history of the world. There's never been a border in the world like this. I always say, in Third World countries, banana republics, they'd fight them away with sticks and stones if they had to. We let them come in, come on in, knowing in many cases they're murderers, they're drug lords, they're traitors in so many ways to our country, if they were involved in our country at all, even that. They're coming back in. People that left because they were traitors are coming back in. Everybody's coming back in. And it's at a level that we have never seen before, criminals off the streets. And other countries, from where they're coming, are now setting records, good records for them, where crime is down 70 and 75 percent, because they're taking the criminals off the street. They're emptying their jails into our country. And they're not finished yet. They're -- I'm amazed. I thought they would have done it by now, but they're -- if you take a look at Venezuela, their crime is way, way, way down. Then you go to Caracas, and you wouldn't recognize it. You can actually walk the streets without being shot or killed or mugged. It's becoming a safe city, because they have taken all their criminals, most of them. The rest are coming. They're all coming. They have taken their drug dealers, and they have put them into the United States of America. Thank you very much, Kamala. Appreciate it. But she continues and she will continue this misery. And her policies have caused such harm and such pain. And the three great people up here with me are going to just discuss that for a little while about what's happened to them, how their lives have been shattered. I'd like to begin with the story of one mother whose life Kamala has utterly destroyed, destroyed this life. And we're talking about thousands, thousands of people in very similar situations.
