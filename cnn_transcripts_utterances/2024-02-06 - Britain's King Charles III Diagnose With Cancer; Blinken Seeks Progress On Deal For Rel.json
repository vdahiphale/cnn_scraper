The palace says the 75-year-old monarch will step back from his public duties while he undergoes treatment, but he will continue with state business and official paperwork.

America's top diplomat is set for talks in Egypt in the hours ahead. But on Monday, he sat down with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for more than two hours in Riyadh. They discuss regional coordination, hoping to end the fighting in Gaza and plans for the enclave after the war. But so far, there seems to be no end in sight to Israel's offensive inside Gaza. The Israel defense forces is again calling on civilians to leave neighborhoods west of Gaza City, and in Khan Younis to the south. Now, there is fear of what could happen next in Rafah, in Gaza's fast South once Israeli troops reach the area and expand operations. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YOAV GALLANT, MINISTER OF DEFENCE, ISRAEL (through translator): We will continue this action and we will reach the places where we have not yet fought, in the center and south of the Gaza Strip.

      "sentences": "Rosemary, Secretary Blinken certainly racking up the air miles, isn't he? Saudi Arabia on Tuesday and then, Egypt, Qatar and Israel on Wednesday.So, I think, in Riyadh in the conversation with MBS, as he's known the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia. The focus is probably more on the day after the Israel Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, talking about things such as Saudi-Israeli normalization and the Palestinian state, or at least a concrete roadmap or steps towards a Palestinian state that the Saudis are now demanding as the price of normalization with Israel. Now, there are other issues that would be perhaps bilateral between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, which would also have been a topic for conversation as well. But since Saudi doesn't really have any leverage over Hamas, the focus would have been on the day after. Now, that may seem a bit counterintuitive to kind of deal with that first, but certainly, that piece of the puzzle is seen as integral to getting the current crisis in Gaza resolved with a focus in Egypt, in Qatar, and Israel, will be on getting those hostages released in exchange for the freeing of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails, getting more humanitarian aid, and then, of course, getting this humanitarian pause in place that could then hopefully, Secretary Blinken hopes will lead to a more enduring peace and resolution of the current conflict, which is ongoing. But as we've just heard from Israeli defense minister Yoav Gallant, Israel is certainly not letting up, although it does say that it's almost completed its operations in Khan Younis. And of course, the other thing to bear in mind is given how central talk of a two-state solution now has become, it's important to remember that both the current Israeli government led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is dead set against an independent Palestinian state, as is Hamas, which, of course, Israel is fighting right now. And so, long as those two parties are opposed, it's hard to see how that can become a piece of the puzzle to resolve the current crisis. But certainly, Secretary of State Antony Blinken is giving that a go when his conversations in Saudi yesterday and in Egypt, Qatar and Israel today. Rosemary?",

And Ukraine aid which they thought I think wrongly that the Republicans would rally behind, you had a winning combination, that there were things in that bill that not everybody was going to go like.But that it would -- the fact that you had all three together would bring together enough different constituencies. That strategy now appears to have failed. The problem with getting just the Israel money through is that the message it sends to Ukraine is the United States is giving up. And the message it sends to the Palestinians is the United States doesn't care as much about your suffering as they care about helping Israel continue the war in Gaza, even after the awful terror attack in on October 7th, that started this.",

And then, many of the Republicans who are now in the House don't either, because they would much rather campaign on the border issue, than give President Biden an opportunity to go do more to solve the problem.And it's a classic case of what happens when you have that urgent foreign policy problem that gets enmeshed in presidential politics. So, they'd much rather have a border bill, maybe even the same border bill just passed after the election. This leaves the Israel and Ukraine portions of this in a lurch. And also raises the question. If at the end of the day, the Ukrainians run completely out of ammunition, they're already running low. And Vladimir Putin makes significant gains, will the United States be in large part responsible for many of those gains by giving up on the idea of supporting Ukraine? At a moment that are the U.S. allies -- I'm in Berlin right now, the Germans have just committed nearly $8 billion to what the European Union has put together a $54 billion program over a number of years.

Many of them are suffering from moral injury, because we've not stood with our Afghan allies, our brothers and sisters in arms. This is a good way to address that. Secondly, if we don't stand with them, what message does it send to our allies across the world? Whether it be the Western Pacific, Eastern Europe, the Levant, I think it shows that America is not necessarily the most reliable partner, I think would have negative downstream effects for future national security. And then, lastly, quite frankly, it's just the right thing to do. I mean, America is a nation that keeps its promise. We have a moral obligation.

STEWART: It's one of those moments that you remember that the U.K. is a constitutional monarchy. We have a constitutional monarchy and there are potentially ramifications, not at this stage though. The king clearly isn't going to be doing any public-facing engagements. He will still be able to essentially work from home, going through those boxes of many, many documents and doing important roles, because the monarch in the U.K. has the role of appointing prime ministers, of dissolving parliament, of giving royal assent for new laws, so that they can be put into place. Now, in the event that his majesty were to get more on well, one of the options is to appoint a Counselors of State. There are actually several. It's always your spouse, the four next in line to the throne. And actually under this monarchy, two have been added, so Prince Edward and Prince Anne as well. So if the king chose, you could actually appoint two or more of those Counselors of State to take care of some the constitutional roles. That isn't happening at this stage. I would say though that Prince William, of course, is under even more pressure at this stage to possibly help fill in some of those public- facing engagements. And he's just had multiple weeks off to look after his wife, who's undergone surgery -- who underwent surgery and is undergoing a recovery.
