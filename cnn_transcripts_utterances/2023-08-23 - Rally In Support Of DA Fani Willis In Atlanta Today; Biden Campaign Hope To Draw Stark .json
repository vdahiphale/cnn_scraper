We saw that in the first debate with Donald Trump eight years ago, almost everybody was attacking him. He took them on and he looked like he was the guy in charge. If Ron DeSantis does that, he's definitely a winner. But I think for the kind of outside-of-the-box thought is I would look at someone like Senator Tim Scott. I think he's got a compelling story. He'd have to rev it up a little bit. I was advising myself to have a couple of cokes and up your caffeine level before but he comes out swinging with passion. He might be someone that people don't expect to have a big win tonight.

And so to talk about that is smart, especially when you look at the president's record. What I do think, though the campaign could do at their press conference around 1:00 is also talking about Donald Trump and the type of person he is, and the fact that he's facing four indictments, and how he threatened our democracy in the campaign. And Joe Biden has talked about the threat to democracy, but they haven't really leaned in on those indictments just yet. And there's an opportunity to do that because we pretty much know that very few Republicans will actually do that on the stage tonight. BOLDUAN: That is an interesting point.
