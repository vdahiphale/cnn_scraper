Tonight, a fight for the narrative and to explain what these pictures really mean. You're looking here at a crater. This is the aftermath of what Israel calls a wide-scale attack. But it is also a Gaza refugee camp, Jabalya, where the IDF claims the senior Hamas commander was using civilians as shields. Now, Israel says that the strike erased the target from the battlefield, but as you can see there, it erased so much more. Cameras captured the chaos in the minutes after the strike, the loud and frenzied race to pull people from that concrete. Now, eyewitnesses told CNN that they saw children carrying wounded children from the rubble. Cameras also filmed the eerie quiet. Palestinian body bags lined up outside of a building. Today, we've watched IDF spokespeople come onto CNN several times to call the strike proportionate. They also cast doubt on the information coming out of Gaza. And they give a blunt response to critics who say that Israel is intentionally killing civilians. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. COL. JONATHAN CONRICUS, SPOKESPERSON, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES: We were aiming for the tunnel complex where the Hamas combatant commander was. We didn't strike buildings. If we would try to strike buildings and cause civilian death, of course the situation would be different, but we are not. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And if you are aiming as Hamas is to resist an occupation that's gone on for 56 years, and a dispossession that's gone for 75, you are going to be tunneling underneath the whole of the Gaza Strip. My understanding is that the Gaza Strip is honeycombed with tunnels, most of which are far, far deeper than wherever this horrible bomb landed.I think that's not really the issue. There's no place to hide in Gaza. That's the whole point. There are 2.3 million people in this tiny area the size of Oakland, and Hamas is underneath them, perhaps in many, many, many, many places. The point is Israel is using weapons with a kill radius in the case of a 2,000-pound bomb, which is so enormous that even if they are targeting a tunnel, or a Hamas leader or a building in which a Hamas official is located, they are killing scores and scores of people every time that they do that. And I think that's why you're having these horrendous casualty tolls. The kinds of weapons used, the American artillery, and often the American ordinance that's being used, inevitably and necessarily kills huge numbers of people, even if somewhere in the vicinity there is a target that the Israelis claim is a legitimate one. I think that's the point. You saw the devastation. If they killed one Hamas leader in order to destroy that entire neighborhood, I think we have to ask about a question of proportionality.",

Democrats, though, call this disgraceful, a non-starter, offensive, a poison pill, problematic and ridiculous.But politics aside, here is the reality. The $14 billion is part of an $80 billion investment designed to ensure that the ultra wealthy and corporations don't skip out on paying their taxes. Tax enforcement is actually a big revenue driver for the government, without raising taxes, according to the non-partisan Tax Foundation. It's been popular with every president since Ronald Reagan. And according to the Congressional Budget Office, which is also non- partisan, investing in this enforcement at the $80 billion level was estimated to actually raise $200 billion in revenue over the next decade. So, if you hamper those efforts, it's possible that this would end up actually costing the U.S. even more in lost revenue beyond the sticker price. Now, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, also non-partisan, defunding tax enforcement by $14 billion to pay for new spending, the House will actually add more than $30 billion to the debt. And back with me now is Senator Lindsey Graham. Senator Graham, there is a new speaker of the House, Mike Johnson. He is now saying he wants to pay for Israel aid by slashing funding for the IRS.

He took issue with the words loan repayment written on the check and repeatedly saying in interviews that he didn't believe that Joe Biden had actually made a loan to his brother.Well, CNN's Daniel Dale is here with us now to walk us through what exactly we're talking about here. Daniel, what do you know? DANIEL DALE, CNN SR. REPORTER: I can tell you, Abby, that the available evidence suggests this was indeed a personal loan from brother-to-brother, just as James Biden's lawyer and House Democrats have said. Now, we do not have comprehensive evidence absolutely proving it was a loan, but the partial evidence we have is firmly on the Democrats' side. So let me explain. Congressman Comer released an image of one check, a 200,000 check from James Biden to Joe Biden in March 2018, and noted that James wrote it on the same day that James got $200K from a healthcare company he did business with. So Comer said he didn't believe this check was actually a loan repayment, even though again it said loan repayment on the front. What Mr. Comer did not release though, Abby, is an additional James Biden bank record that undercuts his case. That additional record, which CNN was provided by a source with access to the documents subpoenaed by his Comer's committee, shows that less than two months prior to writing that 200K check to his brother, James Biden received the exact same amount, 200K, via a wire transfer. And here is the key thing. Other records that CNN obtained from the source strongly suggest that the wire transfer was from Joe Biden. If people go to cnn.com, they can find my article explaining how the evidence connects Joe Biden to that account. Regardless here, the main point is this, Democrats have significant corroboration for their assertions that it was a loan. And one more point, Abby, I think is hugely important here. Joe Biden was neither in government nor a political candidate at the time this happened in 2018. To date, Republicans have not provided a shred of evidence that Joe Biden did anything in office to benefit his brother in his brother's dealings with this health care company. And that might well be because Joe Biden was not even in office at all at this time.",

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [22:52:34] PHILLIP: It's been more than 60 million years since the dinosaurs ruled the Earth, and after a city-sized asteroid wiped out three- quarters of all living species on our planet, but how exactly this doomed the dinosaurs remained unclear for a long time. Now, scientists previously thought that this was due to the soot produced from wildfires triggering a global winter, but there is a new study out that suggests that the fine dust from the pulverized asteroid may have played a bigger role than previously known, blocking out the sunlight and shutting down life for nearly two years. That caused a massive collapse in the food chain, ultimately leading to a mass extinction and the end of the dinosaur age. Joining me now to discuss this is astrophysicist Hakeem Oluseyi. And Hakeem, you are here to really solve a huge mystery for me and so many other people. This is a study published in the journal \"Nature Geoscience.\" And it seeks to answer this question, why is it that we didn't know this before? And do you think it's plausible, personally?",

And so they actually found this fine dust, and that was the experimenters. But then on the computational side, they had to actually create these models that show not only how the dust interacts with sunlight, does it absorb it, does it reflect it, but also how does the dust interact with the atmosphere.And what they found is that this particular type of material could stay airborne for 15 years.",
