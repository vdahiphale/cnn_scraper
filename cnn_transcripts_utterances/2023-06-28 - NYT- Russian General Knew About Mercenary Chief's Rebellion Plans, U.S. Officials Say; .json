In fact, Prigozhin and Surovikin go back to the Syrian civil war where Surovikin is credited with turning the tide in the Assad regime's favor. Surovikin is considered a brutal but competent commander. He is the one that is thrown into the fray last fall in Ukraine and put in charge of all Russian forces to stop the Ukrainian counteroffensive. He is successful -- he is successful in doing so but then is relieved about two or three months later by Gerasimov. And, of course, it's Gerasimov and -- who is the chief of the general staff and Sergei Shoigu, the defense minister, who both Prigozhin, Surovikin, and many on the far-right in Russia believe have completely mishandled the conduct of this war and response -- and are responsible for its failure. So you can see the lives of these men, their careers, and their gripes against the Defense Ministry all kind of aligned here. And I think we'll learn about more people who were kind of in this circle of hardliners on the right within the Russian military.",

On its face, it was about a legislative map drawn by North Carolina Republicans, but it also had the potential to change who runs elections, who sets election laws, and even upset fundamental checks and balances in the U.S. government.How did it have so much power? Some in former President Donald Trump's orbit, like John Eastman -- you'll remember him from our January 6 coverage -- were pushing something called the Independent State Legislature doctrine, and it goes like this. Under the elections clause of the U.S. Constitution, quote, \"The times, places, and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof.\" Now, proponents of this theory say statehouses should be able to then set the rules in federal elections with no check, no balance, no check from state constitutions, no check from state courts, no check from state commissions -- nothing. No balances. And it wasn't just the maps at stake. This had the potential to stretch all rules in federal elections. Let's talk about the consequences here. Alyssa Farah Griffin, Astead Herndon, and Elie Honig are with us. Good morning. Six-three -- Roberts writes the opinion. There's a -- there's an important part of the opinion here as it pertains to federal courts that gives people some pause, but overall, is this a win for democracy? ELIE HONIG, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST, FORMER ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, FORMER FEDERAL AND NEW JERSEY PROSECUTOR:  Oh, without question. I mean, had this gone the other way it would have changed everything. I mean, I think Judge Luttig is correct. It would have changed the way we vote. It would have changed everything about checks and balances. What it would have meant had it gone the other way is that state legislatures can decide to hold elections however they want and there's nothing that state courts, including state Supreme Courts, can do about this. And to think about what the consequences of that could be just think back to 2020 and what Donald Trump, and Rudy Giuliani, and John Eastman were pressuring state legislatures to do.

It's because that politically, there is a Republican Party that has been kind of forced into viewing itself as a minority party. And so, you have people who are looking at state legislatures because that allows them to circumvent kind of popular opinion. That allows them to be more reliant on things that happened back -- more powers locked in from gerrymandering. We think about Wisconsin, right, a state where Democrats have been able to win back power through winning that state Supreme Court race after 10-15 years of basically being shut out. That's a 50-50 state where the political voice has almost immediately changed because those maps are going to change. That's the power that really lies in those state legislatures and in this question here, and that's what Moore versus Harper really returns back to kind of our foundational principle of democracy rather than allow state legislatures to act fully unchecked.
