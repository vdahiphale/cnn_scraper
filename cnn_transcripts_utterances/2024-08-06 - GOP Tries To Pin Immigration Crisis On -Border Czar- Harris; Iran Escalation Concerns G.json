      "sentences": "The bottom line here is that Kamala Harris was named as the person that should address the root causes of migration at the beginning of the Biden administration. And we had seen that crisis continue to unfold not just here in the U.S. but also in many of these countries.Can you explain what you found and how you look at her role in this? CAITLIN DICKERSON, STAFF WRITER, THE ATLANTIC (via Webex by Cisco): Sure. I mean, I think what trying to interrogate Kamala Harris' record on immigration shows us is just how complicated this issue is and how simple fixes don't work. I mean, I have been following immigration for a long time as its ebbed and flowed over administrations, Republican and Democrat, and it's not like you can impose one simple tool and change global movement patterns. So Vice President Harris' job was to, as you said, look at the root causes of migration. She focused on Central America, which was sending the most people to the United States at the time. She raised about $5.5 billion of private funds to help support jobs in those Northern Triangle countries of Central America. And migration has actually gone down from that region during the Biden administration. Unfortunately, at the same time, conflict, and climate change, and instability, and poverty has unfolded elsewhere. I'm sure your viewers are paying attention right now, for example, to what's happening in Venezuela where a seemingly stolen election has sent scores of protesters into the streets. Two thousand have been arrested. That's a country where already about a quarter of the people have left and even more are expected to. So the reporting I've just finished up took place in the Darien Gap, a dangerous route through the jungle where many migrants are taking to get to the United States, and they're coming from all over the world. So as we see migration go down from Central America, we're seeing it go up from other places at the same time.",

CHRIS MURPHY (D-CT):  What drove the increase in migration was, in part, huge increased travel from a country like Venezuela, which was plunged into economic crisis because of Donald Trump's policies. Kamala Harris was given an important but discreet task. She was able to dramatically reduce migration from those countries. And again, apples to apples. Crossings at the southwest border are lower today than they were at the end of the Trump administration. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

You know, I think it's really a combination of factors -- again, a challenge with writing immigration policy. Sometimes you have the State Department imposing sanctions on a country that's violently cracking down on protesters while, at the same time, the Department of Homeland Security is saying hey, you're hurting the economy when it was already in a tailspin, and that's creating more migration -- another issue for the United States. So you really have to have foreign policy taken into account when you're writing immigration policy. And I think the unfortunate thing is that immigration has just become so politicized that we're all laser focused on the southern border on a month-to-month basis and comparing numbers that tell a much larger story. We have to look abroad and really take into consideration what's happening. You know, Kamala Harris alone, or even Donald Trump alone could not have taken Nicolas Maduro out of power in Venezuela, but we've got to have a more comprehensive approach to these issues.",

And so I really can't see her ever abandoning enforcement of immigration laws. It's just sort of an anathema to the trajectory of her career.I think what she was responding to there was allegations of abuse and allegations of really, really harsh treatment -- overly harsh treatment, especially of children and families, at that time that a lot of voters were taking issue with and wanting to sort of rethink the way immigration enforcement works in this country. I mean, again, like we've said, it's so complicated. ICE primarily works on enforcing immigration laws within our borders. And so there are questions when you're going after people who have been living in the United States for a long time, who have been working. You know, should children be arrested in those contexts? Should family be arrested in those contacts -- excuse me, in those contexts? So I think that criticism of cracking down on children and families that took place during the Trump administration is what Harris was responding to. I expect her to go nowhere near comments like that as the election continues and, really, to go nowhere near comments like that if she were to win the presidency. Because as you've talked about, most Americans at this point are citing immigration as a top issue for them and right now, saying that they trust Democrats more than Republicans. And so there's a lot of pressure on Harris to show that she's going to have a strong backbone on this issue and hopefully, one that takes into account the work that she's done for this Biden White House so far, looking at root causes --",

He's basically been unsuccessful in achieving a full military victory in Gaza. Basically, he's playing Whac-A-Mole with Hamas in Gaza.

CHARLIE DENT, (R) FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE, SENIOR ADVISER, \"OUR REPUBLICAN LEGACY\", EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, ASPEN INSTITUTE CONGRESSIONAL PROGRAM (via Webex by Cisco):  Look, the irony of what Donald Trump just said is really stunning. The Georgia GOP has suffered terrible defeats in the U.S. Senate because of Donald Trump's conduct. Because he threw a snit after the 2020 election and really undermined the Republican Senate candidates in the runoff in early January. He cost them -- he cost Republicans -- Trump cost Republicans the United States Senate. And he's still -- he's still aggrieved because Gov. Kemp and Brad Raffensberger wouldn't overturn the Georgia election outcome. And he's just a very petty, vindictive man, clearly, and he just can't get over it. He's obsessed. And he's actually -- Kemp is the one who's actually winning in Georgia. Trump's the one who lost and cost the loss of the Senate seats.

She loses Pennsylvania, her election is over.And that's why Josh Shapiro was at the top -- is at the top of this list because of his popularity and his strength. He has good political chops. He's a skillful politician. And especially, because he is strong in the Philadelphia media market. The city of Philadelphia -- the four Collar Counties, one of which you are from, as well as up into the Lehigh Valley. That represents probably around 40 percent -- maybe a little over 40 percent of the entire statewide electorate, and that is where Kamala Harris needs to run up the score. And so Shapiro actually helps her on the margins in that case. And remember, Pennsylvania is so competitive. It was won in the margins. Trump won it by 44,000 votes in 2016. Biden won it by about 81,000 votes in 2020. It's in play. So to the extent that Shapiro is on the ticket, he can probably help bring some of those soft Republicans and Independents over to Harris. And Harris is going to need some help because she took a position opposing fracking back in the 2020 presidential race. She's going to need someone to blunt those criticisms. Obviously, there's been erosion among Jewish voters not just in Pennsylvania but nationally from the Democrats -- some very loyal constituency to them. Shapiro can help there as well. You know, to put it -- to ease those who are concerned about the anti-Israel wing of the party. So I think he brings a lot of benefits. Walz, of course -- I know Tim. We served together.
