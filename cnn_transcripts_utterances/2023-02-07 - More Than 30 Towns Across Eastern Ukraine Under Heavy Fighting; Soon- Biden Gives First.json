More than 30 towns across Eastern Ukraine under fire tonight as new and graphic video shows the brutal Russian losses on the front lines.Plus, Congresswoman Ilhan Omar on getting kicked off a committee by Republicans, her special State of the Union guests and whether she thinks the president really has her back. And Governor Ron DeSantis publicly praising a lawyer who's going after Trump's election deniers. Is it game on between DeSantis and Trump? Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, under fire. More than 30 towns across eastern Ukraine facing bitter fighting in the overnight hours tonight. And we have new video to show you tonight from the front lines, I show you this, this is from where we believe is near the town of Vuhledar. And it is graphic. This is the first video. It's important to understand the context of what's happening on the front lines. We believe there are Russians standing by this tank. You see the drone hovering above. They drop that small munition, and the Russians are killed. It's gruesome and graphic. You're talking about human life. The tank is covered in blood. And the soldiers seem to be sitting ducks, in part, because you could see them. They don't have the proper equipment or any camouflage to blend into the snow. And as you see it there, and obviously, that tank is covered in blood. And let me show you another new video. This one is a bit different. You're going to see what appear to be other Russian soldiers taking shelter in a trench. They're spotted, munition is dropped, and you see that explosion. Now the drone here zooms in. Some are killed, others are injured. The camera gives you a sense of the scope. Some were able to crawl out. Some survive. This is what it's like there on the front lines, being hunted by drones, dying like that. The sickening death and destruction coming amidst intense street fighting in eastern towns. According to U.S. officials, the Russian death toll is in the hundreds every day right now, according to British intelligence, Putin's forces are only managing to move several hundred yards a day. And they're doing that with death in those towns and getting out of their tank and being hit by small munition and all dead on their tank. As Putin is planning a greater onslaught to try to overcome this incredible loss of human life, thinking throwing more bodies at it will solve it, the pressure is showing on him. I want you to take a look at this picture. This is a woman named Maria Ponomarenko. She's a Russian journalist. This is her in the cage of Russian judicial system. Russian prosecutors want to sentence her to nine years in prison, according to the human rights group OVD. Well, why? The reason is because she reported on the bombing of the Mariupol theater, you know, the one full of innocent women and children, hundreds were killed, the theater that was labeled \"children\" above it in Russian. Ponomarenko was arrested because she described what really happened on Telegram, what really happened, right, that there was a bombing, and so many of those women and children were killed. So, now, she is there in that cage, charged with disseminating false information about the Russian army. She's a mother of two and she may very well spend the next decade in her life in prison or a penal colony. After all, Russian courts who have a history of rubber stamping what prosecutors recommend. So this is the crackdown happening inside Russia as Russian soldiers take those incredible losses on the battlefield that few want to be anywhere near. Our Fred Pleitgen is OUTFRONT live in Kyiv tonight. And, Fred, you're there on the front lines. You had a chance to speak with some of those Wagner fighters who are, you know, the ones in those trenches by those tanks. They are now the ones you spoke to, Ukrainian prisoners of war, and an incredible opportunity for you to speak to them. What did they tell you?",

They were languishing in Russian jails when they said that the boss of Wagner, Yevgeny Prigozhin, came there and recruited them to fight in Ukraine.Now, at least one of the men was told that actually he would be in the rear echelon, that he wouldn't even be in the front line, but he said he quickly realized that it was going to be very different than that. You know, those brutal assaults where so many of these prisoners died. One of the guys said that he had taken part in four of those where many of the people around them were just mowed down by the Ukrainians because they were trying to run towards those positions. The other one said that it was five assaults that he took part in. Remind our viewers, about 50,000 such people the Ukrainians say have been brought to the front line by Wagner, and many of them already have been killed, captured, or have ran away, Erin.",

      "sentences": "All right. Thank you very much, Fred.And incredible to have the opportunity to speak to them, and doing so with as much, you know, care and directness as you possibly can just to try to hear their story as best as you can. Fred Pleitgen live from Kyiv. And I want to go to the retired Army Brigadier Mark Kimmitt, who's a former assistant secretary of state for political and military affairs as well, and Ekaterina Kotrikadze, the news director and anchor for TV Rain, which is an independent Russian language television channel that was shut down by the Russian government at the start of the war. General Kimmitt, these Wagner fighters, you know, it's interesting, Paul Whelan, the American who's been held for 1,500 days, now in a Russian penal colony, says that some of the worst operators in that penal colony left, they took the offer, we'll go, put their hand up and went to Ukraine, and that it's -- such that it can be better. I don't even want to use that, but some of the worst operators left and went to the front lines. So, I don't want to say this with sort of sympathy, but nonetheless, these are human beings and they're being put on the front lines and they're fighting. And you hear them talking to Fred about a fellow fighter being shot and killed by his commanders after they refused to advance. He keeps referring to this point of where they're going to fight as \"the starting line.\" What does that even tell you about the fighters here and the military? BRIGADIER GEN. MARK KIMMITT (RET.), FORMER ASST. SECRETARY OF STATE FOR POLITICAL-MILITARY AFFAIRS:  Well, first of all, I think we've always got to take prisoner of war footage with great suspect. That's why it's against the law of the land warfare. We certainly don't want to see our prisoners as a spectacle held up by the enemy. And that's why we traditionally don't do that with our prisoners of war. But what it does say is that the Wagner people coming from the penal colonies obviously think the front line gets them a better chance than living in a Russian penal colony, especially since that they do a good job, they'll be released. That's a real devil's bargain that they are signing up for. I think the way they're being treated demonstrates how callous the Russian way of war is, whether those were penal colony, Wagner group, or regular Russian soldiers. This was the way Russia treats their soldiers.",

He said to Fred, quote, I think it was the wrong choice. If I were at home instead of at the penal colony, I wouldn't have joined up. I wouldn't have needed it. I didn't know anything about the war then. They brought us here under a false pretext. And so we're at war, but I don't think it's a just cause. Now, again, you understand the situation that they are in when they say this. But, in a penal colony, and they're saying if I hadn't been there, I wouldn't have done it. It was just because of how bad my situation was. Does this make sense to you from everything you're hearing?",

But when you see this, you get a sense somehow from these particular videos, maybe of what it's like to be on the ground and just be hunted by them. And so, you're sitting there and you can't move and you don't know one is there, and then this happens, the tank comes out and all those Russians are killed. We're seeing incredible Russian death toll. And, yet, it is still slow in terms of what the Ukrainians are getting to fight back. Germany said today, 20 to 25 of those Leopard tanks will arrive in Ukraine by the summer, 80 by early next year. Early next year is a long way away. Is that too long, or is that effective, General?",

I think what is actually happening on the battlefield is far, far more profound, far more casualties, and far more, sadly, death and destruction.

You've heard from the president over the course of the last two years, a focus on resiliency and very clear progress over two years but the acknowledgment that there is more work to be done, talking about things like defending democracy, which has been critical to both his campaign and his presidency up to this point, bipartisanship, protecting Social Security and Medicare, a clear difference from the new House Republican majority. And also fighting for the middle class and police reform, something that has really been elevated in terms of importance over the course of the last couple of weeks in the wake of the beating death of Tyre Nichols down in Memphis. And one key element here is that focus on bipartisanship in particular because the new speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy, will be sitting right behind him for the first time during his state of the union speech. And in his remarks, which we have excerpts from, the president will say, to my Republican friends, if we can work together in the last congress, there is no reason we can't work together in this new Congress. The people sent us a clear message fighting for the sake of fighting, power for the sake of power, conflict for the sake of power gets us nowhere, a focus on bipartisanship even if there aren't any clear pathways for a lot of the major legislative agenda items the president wants and will list in his speech tonight, Erin.",

This as the U.S. Navy has recovered parts of the surveillance balloon. They did that off the coast of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, releasing these photos.And tonight, in a story you'll see first OUTFRONT, a top military analyst tells CNN that what China claims are weather balloons could actually be helping their military develop more accurate intercontinental ballistic missiles. Will Ripley has this report OUTFRONT from Taiwan. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This Chinese propaganda video released just days ago during the lantern festival, shows the military muscle of China's People's Liberation Army. The PLA promising to reunite with Taiwan, planning to build up bullet train across the Taiwan Strait, pledging to take control of this island of almost 24 million, bringing the self-governing democracy under communist control. One of the Chinese military's tools, high-altitude balloons. They've been testing them for years as this 2018 video shows. The U.S. shot down the suspected Chinese spy balloon last week. Beijing calls it a civilian weather balloon. They gave the same explanation to CNN on Monday for a second balloon over Latin America. CNN obtained images of similar Chinese balloons hovering over Taiwan in recent months, including this one on New Year's Eve, and this one a few months earlier. At least four balloon sightings in the last two years, says Su Tzu- yun, director of Taiwan's Institute for National Defense and Security Research. He says the island's relatively small size about the same as the state of Florida, gives Taiwan's military limited time to intercept balloons or even shoot them down. Why do these Chinese balloons pose such a threat? SU TZU-YUN, DIRECTOR, TAIWAN'S INSTITUTE FOR NATIONAL DEFENSE AND SECURITY RESEARCH:  The spy balloon crossed Montana state, a very important ICBM site of the United States. If Beijing tried to conduct a so-called first strike, it will destroy enemy's ICBM site first. So, such data is very helpful for PLA to organize.",

Taipei says Chinese spy balloons should not be tolerated by the international community.Last year, dozens of civilian drones from China captured videos of Taiwanese military outposts. Soldiers responded with rocks and flares, managing to shoot at least one drone down. Taiwan's defense ministry says 121 Chinese military planes flew near the island just last month. (END VIDEOTAPE) RIPLEY (on camera):  And there are balloons almost identical to the one that was flying over the United States for a week that were actually hovering over the presidential office here in Taipei. So imagine if that had happened and this thing was hovering over the White House. And experts here in Taiwan are telling us that these balloons can be weaponized. They can put supplies in them. They can potentially put bombs in them. So this is, you know, a lot more, some might say, sinister, for lack of a better word, than just a civilian weather balloon.",

And maybe that's part of the ingenuity, for lack of a better word, of what may be happening here.All right. Will Ripley, thank you very much for that exclusive reporting. OUTFRONT now, Adam Kinzinger. Of course, he's the former Republican congressman, also though a lieutenant colonel in the Air National Guard, and previously flew surveillance aircraft in the Air Force. So, Congressman, I really appreciate your time. There's a lot to talk about here. So, you hear Will's reporting. And obviously we knew the military says the spy balloon flew over these sensitive sites where the U.S. stores a lot of nuclear facilities. So, do you think China could've been using the balloon to collect information for its own ICBM or missile targeting?",

I think when they look back at historical radar data, that's how they were able to -- DOD was able to look and say, this was the radar return we got off this balloon that we knew was there. Oh, my goodness, here are some other times it's been there as well. And keep in mind, if this thing's flying at 100,000 feet, not 60,000, which is very possible with these balloons. They can go up basically until they hit space. The ability to take them down is much, much harder at that altitude.",
