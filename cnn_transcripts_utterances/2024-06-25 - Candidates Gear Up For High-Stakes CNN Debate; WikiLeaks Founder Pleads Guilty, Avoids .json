The stakes incredibly high with recent polling showing no clear leader in the rematch between Donald Trump and President Biden. The current president is hunkered down at Camp David. He is preparing for the debate with top advisers. CNN reporting that Biden's personal attorney, Bob Bauer, likely playing the role of Trump during mock debates. Bauer performed the same role in 2020. Here's what he said about that experience just last week. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BOB BAUER, PRESIDENT BIDEN'S PERSONAL ATTORNEY:  Any debate prep involves immersing yourself in whatever the candidate who you are playing, immersing yourself in whatever they have said, videos of their interviews, videos of their speeches -- speeches, so that you can really and seriously. I mean, not by way of doing some sort of comic impression, but seriously model out what the experience of debating will be like. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

President Biden's doing a lot of prep on the issues and the arguments or is it going to end up being about the sort of intangible character things, like does the either of the respective rivals convey authority or command or charisma, right?And a lot of times, that's what debates end up being about. But I think with both men, with the current president, with the former president, there is a -- the audience interests is really driven by kind of what's going to happen in terms of like, you know, are either of them going to meet or defy the expectations that are baked into the media narrative around them. And will that give you more confidence or less confidence? It's not like a normal debate where its like, I really want to find out about what they believe in or what the two of them are like, or who appear stronger on the stage like Americans know both men very well, too well, you might say.",

      "sentences": "The kind of media machine that has been more aligned with Donald Trump or critical of Joe Biden has certainly portrayed him showing clubs of him tripping, climbing the stairs, or having a moment referring forgot what he was going to say. And so there has been a big expectations game around.You talked to a lot of voters who are kind of, you know, low to moderate news consumers. And their view of Joe Biden is not really based on watching him give full speeches, or watching him interact for long periods of time. It's built on snippets and clips on social media that's sort of metastasized. And there are actually people who think that he can't walk to the, you know, podium by himself and that sort of thing. So this is going to be for President Biden rejecting those expectations and proving that's not where he's at. But you know, there are a lot of Americans who aren't quite an extreme category who are just he seems older than he was when he took office. You know, does he still have what it takes? And I think on the other side with Donald Trump, the Democratic argument around Donald Trump has been that he's chaos machine and all this sort of stuff, how will he conduct himself on the stage? Will he seem presidential and serious for the people who? Maybe were concerned about that in 2016 or 2020 is that more concerned, are they less concerning now?",

I mean, looked to that, one of the things I think we've seen some of the Trump team tried to do here is lower expectations for the former president by essentially trying to raise some for president Biden, because as she pointed out there is there -- they have gone pretty far in saying, well, Joe Biden is so far gone that he doesn't seem to have to do very much to disprove some of that, as you say.The latest thing from Trump, he posted this on Truth Social, is that you want to drug test for Joe Biden, of course, this around this idea that -- I mean, he said this out loud at his rally in Philadelphia, get a Congressman Ronny Jackson wrote a letter -- of course, Jackson was I suppose, infamous, I would say is as Trump's physician. This whole seems to add up to -- I mean, is the Trump campaign nervous about Thursday?",

      "sentences": "It seems like sort of a throw everything at the wall strategy right now, that on the one hand, the message -- early messaging was like Joe Biden can't even talk, whatever. And now, it's like Trump saying he thinks so, be very strong debater and should be taken seriously.This has been certainly about an expectations game but we've seen the former president put other lines in the water, too, like if it ends up being tough questioning or he doesn't do well, it'll be because the moderators are against him or for Biden. If Biden does well, it'll be because he was always strong. If Biden does poorly, it will be because he's too decrepit to, you know, serve an office. So they're like three or four multiple strategies in this completely unfounded insinuation that, you know, President Biden is getting some sort of energy shots or something like that when Donald Trump, of course, fell asleep in court or had his eyes closed and people thought he was asleep. So, yeah, there's been all this sort of messaging in multiple directions so that his bases are covered no matter what. I'm not really sure any of that's going to matter. There aren't that many Americans who were undecided at this point. This is always been about turnout in November. But I think there are some Americans on the margin. Who are either sort of inclined to go with Trump or stay with Trump, but they're worried about January 6 or inclined to stay with Biden, but they want to make sure that he has the energy that is up to the job. So I think for those people, it could be decisive. For many Americans, there's just a jury periodicity about the return to the stage of these two men. I hope we can learn something from this debate.",

There isn't anything in the law that should allow them to exempt from serving national service like other capable young people.So it's been thrown out, so its a huge problem for him. How does he then explain this or deal with this with those key members of his cabinet, the proper -- propping him up in power. So it's a big moment for him, big moment for ultra orthodox Jews.

So, again, just incredible. Some of the rainfall totals here, ten to 17 inches over the last couple of days from Sioux Falls down towards Sioux City. You can see this huge swath of about four to six inches of rain.
