At least three people were killed and 25 injured after a massive missile attack on the central Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih. Officials say the missiles hit a multi-storey apartment building and other civilian infrastructure. More on that in just a moment.Meanwhile, there are reports of intense fighting along the border of Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia. Ukraine is reporting more gains on the ground. A top defense official says they have captured seven villages in the past week. And CNN's Fred Pleitgen has more now from Ukraine. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Ukrainian military video purporting to show strikes on Russian positions behind the front lines, as Kyiv says its forces have dramatically ramped up their offensive operations, taking several villages over the weekend in the southeast of the country. This drone video that Ukrainian say showing their troops sweeping a settlement and taking several prisoners. The same unit displaying Ukraine's flag after the battle. They try to push us back with their artillery, the soldier says. We managed to seize back the initiative and slowly liberated the settlement one house after another. Well, Ukraine says it's attacking the Russians in several areas of the vast front line. Kyiv remains coy about whether the long anticipated large-scale offensive has really begun. The head of Ukrainian military intelligence releasing this video of himself just sitting at his desk with a message, plans love silence. But the Russian say they're holding the line in most areas. This defense ministry video allegedly showing a Russian chopper destroying Ukrainian Reconnaissance Vehicles. In total, the Russians say they've already destroyed a large number of Western-provided armor including German-made Leopard 2 main battle tanks and U.S.-donated Bradley Infantry fighting vehicles. But as Russia's defense minister Sergei Shoigu, hands out metals to Russian soldiers, the infighting between Russia's military and the Wagner private military company continues. Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin refusing to abide by a defense ministry decree to sign a contract with the Russian army saying he's mercenaries are more efficient than regular troops. Unfortunately, most military units do not have such efficiency, he says and precisely because Shoigu cannot manage military formations well. Balancing the rival factions in his war machine a tall task for Vladimir Putin as the country celebrated Russia Day. Putin urging people to keep supporting his war in Ukraine, while calling it a difficult time for his country. Russia is based on faith and people, he said. People who go from victory to victory basing their lives and all their work on faith. Faith in victory, faith in justice, faith in Russia. Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Zaporizhzhia Ukraine. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

How much humanitarian assistance do I provide to both the east and west or the left and right bank is, as they call it of the Dnipro River. How many people can I get out and at the same time, how much of the territory that's been flooded, which was probably part of the plan for offensive operations do I have to shift? But it certainly also affected the Russian side as well, because they had their defensive belts in the area that actually received the most flooding. The eastern flank of the Dnipro -- eastern bank of the Dnipro River. So, I think it probably hurt the Russians more than it hurt the Ukrainians. Ukraine actually adjusted their plan appears to go in several other different directions.

But he kept those documents even though the government was trying desperately to get them back and to get them into safekeeping. They sent him requests and letters.

And while the current economic backdrop might not look good for oil demand, you've got the Eurozone entering recession you have China's economy slowing. For Goldman Sachs, this cut to its oil price forecast is largely a supply side story. There's simply more oil sloshing around the market than had been expected. And in large part, Goldman Sachs thinks this is due to oversupply from sanction countries like Russia or Iran and Venezuela. This report says Russian oil output has nearly recovered to levels not seen since the invasion of Ukraine, despite numerous bans and sanctions. And actually, the IEA, the International Energy Agency reported Russian oil exports had fully bounced back in March.While European countries have weaned themselves off Russian energy, other countries have cut deals. There have been record Russian oil exports to China and India. Currently Russian oil trades at a discount of around $20.00 a barrel compared to Brent. So, while Russia may be pumping plenty of oil, it's not able to reap the revenues it once did. But that price gap has narrowed. A year ago, Russian oil cost $34.00 less a barrel versus crude. Saudi Arabia recently announced a further cut to its oil output. This was an attempt to raise oil prices. But the oversupply from Russia undermines that.
