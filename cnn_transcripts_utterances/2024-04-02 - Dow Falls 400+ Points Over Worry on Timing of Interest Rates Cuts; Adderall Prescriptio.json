Now, remember, the higher this stock goes, the richer Donald Trump is, at least on paper, because he owns a dominant stake in this company, now up 7 percent on the day, near session highs.Now, yesterday's selloff was caused by concerns about this company's financial condition. They disclosed that they lost $58 million last year. Not shocking that a startup lost money, but what was more concerning is the revenue, only generating $4 million in revenue. Remember, this is a company worth being valued right now by Wall Street in the billions of dollars. So, we should keep a close eye on Trump media because it is moving dramatically, higher and lower every single day. I mean, you can't look away because otherwise you're going to miss a massive stock spike or a plunge.",

And you can see the shortage was announced around October 12, 2022. And you can see an obvious difference there in the rate of prescriptions being filled. That went from almost 50 percent there before the shortage to down to a low of about 40 percent in February of 2023. Overall, the average monthly fill rate was 11 percent lower in the first half of 2023 than in the first half of 2022. And, Boris, these data sort of mask the frustration that many patients and families are feeling around this because even if they're able to get their prescription filled, we've heard anecdotally that many families or patients have to go to multiple pharmacies or call multiple pharmacies just to find their medications each month. So, this has been an incredibly frustrating situation for a lot of people.",

Is that fearmongering, particularly about immigration, that helped propel him to the White House in 2016, and they are hoping helps him again in 2024.Now, this time, he might have an advantage, particularly because we've seen in those recent polls that immigration is a key issue for so many voters. So something to keep an eye on. But again, this is the rhetoric that he is doubling down on. We've talked a lot about how President Biden and his team were to double down on reproductive rights. You're going to hear a lot from Donald Trump on immigration and crime, linking the two together as we get closer to November.",

Mostly his past had flown under the radar until a group of progressive activists here in Enid learned more about his past and started sounding the alarm. And Judd Blevins has made it very difficult to understand exactly where he stands these days. He's disavowed comments that he's made. He's also denied making very controversial comments. He was at that Charlottesville rally back in 2017, but he also remains defiant and is trying to win this election. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JUDD BLEVINS, ENID CITY COMMISSIONER, WARD 1: I think that this election is really about the next three years of this city, not about organizations that disbanded five years ago. Now, if speaking out against what was being done to this country, what is continuing to being done to this country is a crime, then I would gladly plead guilty to that. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The other is state interference with government property. One thing I was going back and forth with our Josh Campbell talking about this. He also indicates it looks like it's being worked by the FBI criminal squad, not the terrorism unit. So it sort of gives you an indication about what they may be looking at this. We know that suspect traveled from South Carolina and then tried to follow an employee into that fence line area when that gate was able to stop him from getting inside. Now, the reason why we don't have a mugshot just yet is he has not been turned over to local authorities because he's currently being evaluated still at the hospital.
