He's slated to deliver a keynote address at the United States Capitol as the country marks the Holocaust Museum's annual Day of Remembrance. We'll take those remarks live the second that they happen.But first, we are waiting for the jurors to retake their seats inside a courtroom in the building behind me. They've spent the morning listening to testimony from the woman at the center for the criminal case against Donald Trump, adult film star Stormy Daniels. Here with the team in New York, Paula Reid and John Berman. I mean, they have set the stage. We're now at the point where she is recounting the run -- she's now in the hotel room of the hotel suite of Donald Trump. And now, they have taken a break.",

Now, one of my takeaways here is of course, the defense has argued that Trump made this hush money payment not to help his chances of getting into the White House, but instead to protect his family. Throughout this case, though, prosecutors have done a pretty good job of bringing in evidence, including Hope Hicks' testimony that Trump told her that he was happy to sort of suppressed ahead of the election, of recounting that.But I want to remind people that Eric Trump, he's in court today. He's sitting in the front row, listening to this. Now, our colleagues report that he's pretty much just looking down at his phone, not really engaging. But he's the only one of Trump's five adult children who has shown up to this trial. He was there yesterday. He's been here before. But you think again, the impact on the story even if that wasn't why he suppressed it or you know, they're arguing over why he suppressed it, how uncomfortable is this for Eric Trump right now?",

But we are absolutely seeing the why he allegedly did that and what he was allegedly covering up.He is going step by step into this sexual encounter. We're about to get to that moment after the break here. And the jury might be sitting there thinking, OK, now I get. I get the issue that is at play here. Whether or not the documents were falsified, that's another thing, but at least here we have what I think we see on TV as a motive. The motive behind doing it and why he would do it. One other thing I want to point out, is I think the defense only objected once so far since Stormy Daniels has actually been on the stand. If it was more than that, it was only, you know, a little bit. We've seen a lot of contentious action between the defense and prosecution witnesses on the stand.

But in any case, I think one of the issues is like, at no point did we hear anything about a nondisclosure agreement before this encounter. And it actually is not all that surprising, given the givens, that if somebody were to have sex with a porn star in 2006, and a decade later, maybe her career is fading a little bit in terms of on-screen, that individual is now the Republican presidential nominee, it's not really all that surprising that she would want to tell that story.",

But I don't think the prosecution needs to do much more with her than just establish the baseline because this gets us to the actual crime.It's not the crime. Having sex with Stormy Daniels is not a crime. The crime becomes a cover-up, the payment of hush money, and then the falsely mislabeling that hush money as attorney's fee.
