I'm Fredricka Whitfield.And breaking news into CNN a source tells CNN that President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke earlier today, fueling fresh hope for an end to the Israeli hostage crisis and the resulting six-month war in Gaza. Meantime, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is headed back to the Middle East right now for a new round of talks aimed at ending the deadlock between Israel and Hamas. Blinken plans to meet with regional partners in Saudi Arabia. Journalist Elliott Gotkine is joining me right now with the very latest. Elliott, great to see you. What do you know about this call?",

They were abducted, of course, as part of the Hamas terrorist attacks of October 7. They've been in captivity now for more than 200 (INAUDIBLE). And at the same time freeing a number of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, more humanitarian aid going into the Gaza Strip.And I suppose the other hope for the U.S. administration, for Biden's administration is to try to get this deal done in order to forestall Israel's planned ground operation in Rafah, which it says it has to undertake to take out the last bastion of Hamas in the Gaza Strip. But of course, there are more than a million Palestinians sheltering there. And the U.S. President Biden's Secretary Blinken, has reiterated time and again to the Israeli government their concerns about the potential for civilian casualties in any operation there. So I suppose it's a win-win if the hostage deal takes place, then Israel has said that it would, at the very least, postpone its plans for a Rafah operation. And I suppose in that respect, that is something that the Biden administration will see as very good result, Fredricka.",

I suppose what we're also learning here is Hamas is ability to influence Israel's stance in these hostage negotiations. Because what it's trying to do here is, of course, galvanize Israeli public opinion.

A release of the remaining women and children, sick, elderly, and wounded without the Israeli commitment to end the war. But Israel was too slow to act on that. And Hamas leaned back and hardened its positions and demanded the end of the war. And here as I said, Netanyahu does not want to end the war. He believes that there can be the complete victory that no one else agrees with. There's no such thing as a complete victory in these circumstance. The longer that Israel remains in Gaza, the more we will see armed insurgency against Israel and will encourage the development o, Hamas and more radical groups than Hamas. There must be a political alternative put on the table for the day after, and Netanyahu and his government refused to do that? And the negotiators are stuck.

He would have to step aside. And here we have a great reluctance from his side as well. But perhaps the Arab countries can persuade Abbas to step aside and they can support a credible, legitimate Palestinian element to take over with the agreement of the Saudis and the Jordanians and the Egyptians and the Emiratis and perhaps others to send a peacekeeping force to Gaza once Israel withdraws. This is the political element that Netanyahu refuses to accept.

[14:10:00] Right now, we're deadlocked. The war goes on. The Israeli threat of the incursion into Rafah is genuine. You don't make threats unless you intend to carry them out. Israel has issued draft notices to reserve soldiers to show up on May 1st to begin their preparation for the incursion into Rafah. So I think everything must be done to prevent that because there are 1.5 million Palestinians in that small area of the Gaza Strip. And we really do need to get the hostages home and to end this war.

But there is a lot for the two of them to discuss. Of course, not so long ago we had those Israeli strikes against Iran. Now, they had not spoken after that. In fact, the White House had really kept a tightlipped strategy as that unfolded and Israel did as well. And so that is something that we know they've talked about before, particularly after Iran struck Israel. So that could have been something that came up in this phone call between the two leaders. But also as you were just talking there with your guest about the hostage deal, this has been front of mind for U.S. officials for months now. It's a top priority one that they consistently come back to and are concerned about because it is a deal that until it's finalized, it's not clear whether it can come through. That was the case in last November. And so this is a topic of discussion, particularly with the Secretary of State in the region that the two are expected to have discussed. And if there can be a ceasefire that can be reached, and that is really where it has gotten quite tricky and whether they can agree on the parameters of what a ceasefire would look like. Whether too, where Israel stands with its operation into Rafah. That is a place where over a million Palestinians have been displaced and the U.S. stood firm in their position that it would -- that they couldn't support that type of operation, given how many people are there and they're concerned about containing any sort of civilian casualties. So there's a whole gamut of issues that these two leaders likely talked about. We'll get that readout later this afternoon to get a little more detail as to what that was. But clearly, when these two jump on the phone, it does come at a pivotal moment. And that is one that we're in right now.",

Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein was among more than 80 arrested during a protest at Washington University in Lt. Louis. The school says demonstrators included students, employees, and people not associated with the university. And at Arizona State, university officials say a majority of the 72 arrested there for trespassing on Friday were not students. Tensions have been mounting for months following Hamas' horrific October 7th attack on Israel and the war in Gaza. Pro-Palestinian groups are demanding an end to the war and for universities to divest from Israel-linked entities. We have correspondents covering the protests coast-to-coast.

They said that they have seen some progress on a couple of their demands, mainly in transparency when it comes to the university's investments. Also some progress when it comes to the president's potential statement that she may possibly issue when and if it gets resolved. However, that sticking point about divestment, that is where the university and student negotiators have not seen any common ground and we are told as we get ready for yet another week of potential protests here at Columbia University, both on-campus and off-campus, it's important to remind you, that those negotiations they're still ongoing though there haven't been any updates this weekend. As for Columbia University, no doubt every day, certainly ramps up the pressure on the university to see what will be their next step. Will they once again call on the NYPD for assistance in clearing out that encampment on campus, which would make them subject of a Columbia Senate investigation.

Well, the House Speaker said, he's demanding President Biden send in the National Guard. But today, Senator Tim Kaine said that would be a big mistake. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. TIM KAINE (D-VA): I think calling in the National Guard to college campuses for so many people would recall what happened when that was done during the Vietnam War and it didn't end well. There are other ways using campus security, but also again, offering students more opportunities to have dialogue that is, that is civil and constructive where people hear one another.

They didn't weigh in on it and Israel also was quiet about it, but this is a moment where when the two connected, they did discuss it. They also talked about the hostage deal. This again has been a top priority for U.S. officials and it includes a six-week temporary ceasefire, as well as the release of hostages to allow for the also the opportunity to get additional humanitarian aid into Gaza. This has been an ongoing effort. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in the region now and clearly, we're at a pivotal a moment with the two discussing it in their phone call today. They also talked about, again humanitarian aid into Gaza, another priority for this White House and one that they have been hammered on by the president's own party as well as by humanitarian aid organizations and the protests across the country, given the situation that is unfolding in Gaza. And importantly, that Rafah operation. Israel has said that they may move into Rafah. That has been a concern for the White House because there are more than 1 million displaced Palestinians there and they have wanted to contain civilian casualties. So this operation is one that the U.S. has been certain about and in this readout it says, quote, the leaders discussed Rafah and the president reiterated his clear position. His position being that right now is untenable, given how many civilians are in Rafah.

So you see sometimes the students on the pro- Palestinian side linking arms trying to get closer and closer to the group supporting the Jewish students and vice versa, you feel a lot of the Jewish supporters essentially trying to get closer to the pro Palestinians, and that's when you have these confrontations. And that's when you have people shouting at each other and really there is no way to get these people to agree. This is just people more passionate or shouting about their issues. And who want to have their voices heard. You know, I've talked to people on both sides of this issue who have told me that yes, they're trying to keep it peaceful, but the reality is that it has not always been peaceful here. And this is separate from the university encampment. The university really trying to keep those two areas separate, but it has been almost impossible for the university to really control what's going on. And again, right now, we have not seen police officers being involved. We did see officers with riot gear sort of standing to the side, but as of now still, no police involvement. Again, we'll have to wait to see how this all develops, but we have seen many, many more confrontations here, Fred.",

And right now, nearly 65,000 customers are without power across Texas and Oklahoma. This outbreak was the latest in a series of storms that first hit the Central Plains on Friday, causing widespread destruction across Nebraska and Iowa. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. PILLEN (R), NEBRASKA: I think the weather service said there were over 80 events across the state. We -- I know some folks in Greeley county and so there were their cells damage everywhere across the state.

Nearly, a hundred and 20 tornado reports, a lot of damage to sift through. And when you look at the risk for today, you could see it's a lot of the same areas, just a little bit farther to the east, including states like Missouri, Arkansas, and then the heart of it today could be eastern Texas. But look at the warnings that we've had over the last 48 hours. It isincredible. On Friday the weather service office in Omaha issued the most amount of tornado warnings that they have ever issued in a day at 42. And then yesterday, Norman, Oklahoma, did that as well, 59 warnings just yesterday, the most that they have ever issued in a day. So incredibly busy and we've had some flooding rain with this too. It hasn't just been the tornadoes. I mean, look at cars an undated in parts of Oklahoma, flooding risk continues as we go through the day today, flood watches span from Missouri down to the Gulf Coast there for parts of Louisiana and Texas, storms are exploding again. As we start to refuel the atmosphere, you get that daytime heat and humidity and the storms are exploding, particularly in eastern Texas. This is what were watching June right now, the Storm Prediction Center just put out an update saying that there are watching to see how the atmosphere could be refueling. This could be our next tornado watch spots. We'll have to watch that closely. Here's the bulls-eye for today. You see that orange enhanced risk parts of Shreveport going into Eastern Texas again, multiple tornadoes, damaging winds and large hail, all on the table.",

I was excited to be up here on stage with President Biden tonight, mostly to see if I could figure out where Obama was pulling the strings from. It's also wonderful to be back in Washington. I loved being in Washington the last time I was in D.C., I left my cocaine at the White House. Luckily, the president was able to put it to good use for his State of the Union. I'm not saying both candidates are old, but you know, Jimmy Carter is out there thinking, I could maybe when this thing. He's only 99. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
