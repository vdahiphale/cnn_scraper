In public marks, President Biden said Israel is starting to lose global support for its war against Hamas over its, quote, \"indiscriminate bombing campaign\" in Gaza.We want to go to the White House now with CNN senior White House correspondent, M.J. Lee. M.J., walk us through what we have learned happened at that meeting. M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Boris and Pam, you can easily imagine probably how incredibly emotional this meeting was. This was the first time that President Joe Biden was meeting in person with these families. We were told by the White House about a dozen of them came here physically to the White House for this meeting. A couple others joined virtually. These are families whose loved ones have been missing since the October 7th attack. And they said they are simply looking for a miracle for their loved ones to get out of Gaza. Most of them have very, very little information about their loved ones, including whether they are even alive. When they came out and spoke with reporters a few moments ago, they said they are incredibly grateful for the White House's close engagement on this and all of their work so far. They also said they feel like the White House understands that each of these hostages is more than just a name or face but they are somebody's son, somebody's mother, somebody's grandmother. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JONATHAN DEKEL-CHEN, FATHER OF MISSING SON IN ISRAEL: It was a terrific, terrific meeting and conversation. I think we all came away feeling that, as families of hostages, of American Israeli hostages, which are eight out of a total of 138 hostages. We felt that -- and we have felt before and we were only reinforced in seeing and believing that we could have no better friend in Washington or in the White House than President Joe Biden himself and his administration.

They had just lost in the Wisconsin Supreme Court and the attorneys who worked on the case, they were in D.C. and they wanted a meet and greet with their client. Before they went in with Trump, they were told, don't give him any false hope, don't indulge this notion that he might still win. Some of the people in the room followed directions. Chesbro did not. Take a listen to what he said about Arizona. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KENNETH CHESBRO, FORMER TRUMP ATTORNEY: I am sorry I ended up explaining that Arizona was still hypothetically possible because the electors voted. And I explained the whole logic that because the electors had voted, we had more time in litigation. So it was, I think, clear in a way it hadn't been before that we had --(INAUDIBLE) -- to win.

Wade.A decision could come by July, which is right in the middle of the presidential campaign season. And we know that the decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, the larger questions about abortion, those have been hot issues on the campaign trail. Here, of course, we are talking about access to Mifepristone, which is a commonly used abortion drug. It is currently still available, even though some lower courts have issued decisions trying to restrict access to the drug. The FDA approved the drug 23 years ago. And in recent years, they have tried to make it easier to access. So you can get it, for example, through telemedicine. You can even get it through the mail. But the challengers in this case, including some doctors and other groups that oppose abortion, insist that the FDA did not properly evaluate safety concerns back when it initially approved the drug or, as it made it easier to access. But this is shaping up to be quite a term of the Supreme Court. And this is going to be one of the biggest cases to watch.

It's sort of a, hey, do you best you can to help us get to net zero by 2050 with eight different possible tracks that include less oil and gas production, but also more renewables and carbon capture, help poorer nations to adaptable to global warming. But there is no real mandate on how best to do that through financing as well. John Kerry, the U.S. envoy, was really trying to make the most of this. His final thought -- this could be his final COP, you never know -- it seems to be, look, this is really hard. So success is the fact that it did not fall apart. Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN KERRY, U.S. CLIMATE ENVOY: The message coming out of this COP is we are moving away from fossil fuels. We're not turning back. That is the future. And the United States will continue to take charge on this on the home front through investments and the Inflation Reduction Act, and bipartisan infrastructure law.

We must ask ourselves, how much longer will the world have to wait before nations summon the political will to overcome the special interests and act on behalf of the future of humanity? It's telling, Boris and Pam, the small island states that have a coalition to try to make their case, they were in tears when the gavel came down. They said it was rushed, that they didn't have a chance to make their objections known before the gavel fell. And OPEC, on the other side, the oil and gas-producing nations, sent a letter of congratulations to Sultan al Jaber for a successful COP. Again, depending on where you are in the world, this is sort of successful. But this is a time test.
