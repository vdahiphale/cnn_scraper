Dr. Anthony Yeung is a Clinical Psychiatrist with the University of British Columbia and has a particular interest in ADHD. He and his colleagues became intrigued when they started to notice an influx of patients seeking help for their focus and concentration. All of which coincided he says with the rising popularity of so-called ADHD TikTok. So Yeung and his team set out to look at what kind of information was being shared, what they found was shocking. More than half of the top 100 most popular videos at the time about ADHD contained misleading information. DR. ANTHONY YEUNG, CLINICAL PSYCHIATRIST, UNIVERSITY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA: I think the whole conversation around mental health, of course, has changed for the better, in the sense that people are actually quite open and honest about talking about their individual struggles.",
