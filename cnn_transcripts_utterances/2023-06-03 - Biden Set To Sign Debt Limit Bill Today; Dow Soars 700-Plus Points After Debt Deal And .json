I'm Paula Reid in Washington in this weekend for Fredricka Whitfield.Developing now, President Biden is preparing to sign the bipartisan bill to raise the nation's debt limit, averting a disastrous default. He says he plans to sign the legislation today. The bill cleared the House and Senate in bipartisan fashion following weeks of closed door negotiations led by Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. In his first-ever Oval Office address last night, President Biden said the consequences of not getting a deal done could have been catastrophic. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Nothing would have been more catastrophic. No one got everything they wanted, but the American people got what they needed. CNN's Jasmine Wright is at the White House.

And also after the bill was agreed to in principle over last weekend, we didn't see President Biden come out and claim it as a win, really trying to protect the bill as it made its way through both House chambers in Congress, really trying not to jeopardize any potential GOP support that was needed to pass it bipartisanly. Now that has happened and it's making its way to his desk, the president said that he will sign it today. But last night he heard him do a couple of things. First, he talked very deliberately about what's in the bill but also what's not in the bill, talking about how his White House negotiators really staved off putting democratic policies on the chopping block inside the bill, something that Republicans wanted to see. But he also talked about the importance of bipartisanship in these negotiations, really trying to lay down a new narrative for the future. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

That's the highest since October, but it's still in this historically low 3.4 percent to 3.7 percent range. Now, economists say the jobless rate rose partly because more Americans permanently lost their jobs and more people entered the workforce. A milestone of sorts for women, the share of women age 25 to 54 in the job market hit an all-time high. Two possible reasons. Hybrid work gives more women flexibility to return to the workforce. Also high inflation might be making it a necessity for more women to work. In a potential worrying sign, the black unemployment rate jumped from a record low of 4.7 percent in April to 5.6 percent in May. Annual wage growth slowed to a still strong 4.3 percent. It's cooling, but after 14 months now of rate hikes, the labor market is remarkably resilient here. Since the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates 14 months ago to cool the economy and slow down the jobs market and inflation, the economy has added an astonishing 5.1 million jobs.

Normally when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates as aggressively as it has, they have difficulty not just cooling the economy, but preventing it from actively falling into a recession.That's one of the main reasons why there had been those predictions thus far, that we were on the edge of a downturn. That's part of why I say we may not completely be out of the woods yet. I think we haven't fully felt the effects of those tightening financial conditions so far. There's a little while before they work their way through the system. So the fact that we're doing great or much better than expected anyway, I think, is wonderful news. We should celebrate it. I don't want to prematurely celebrate a soft landing just because I don't know if we will get there. I hope we do. But I think that there are some things kind of happening behind the scenes that may have been contributing to the unexpected strength of this economy, including the fact the immigration system has somewhat normalized. A couple of years ago, borders were closed, very difficult for immigrants to legally come into this country and those who are here to legally work. Some of that has reversed itself and that seems to be a big supply of labor. And you also see, as Christine mentioned, a huge increase in the number of prime working age women who are looking for jobs or in jobs much higher than had been predicted previously.",

He got a 28-year sentence for that. He will have to then return to Peru after the U.S. court filings, court trial have been completed. Natalee Holloway was last seen alive with Van Der Sloot and two other men 18 years ago in Aruba. Those three men were arrested numerous times but then released because there wasn't enough evidence. Holloway's body, her remains, have never been found and back in 2012 an Alabama judge declared her legally dead. Van Der Sloot has been indicted here in the U.S. for charges of wire fraud and extortion in connection to an alleged plot to extort the Holloway family, essentially telling them hey, I'll point out where her remains are if you give me $250,000.

This coming after a dozen horses died in the past month alone. And the racetracks says than an internal review and investigations from regulatory organizations have not found a single factor that could be identified as a potential cause for these deaths, nor have they discovered a pattern to link them together. So the races will stay suspended through the remainder of the spring meet in July until they can find some answers. Elsewhere in the sport, more devastating news. A 6-year-old horse died on Thursday at New York's Belmont Park ahead of next week's Triple Crown finale. Chaysenbryn injuring his front leg after bumping into another horse, was euthanized on the track, that track hosting the Belmont Stakes, the third leg of the Triple Crown, a week from today. And the Stanley Cup Final begins tonight with the Vegas Golden Knights hosting the Florida Panthers. No matter how this one shakes out, it will be a historic moment for the winner as this will be the first championship for either of these teams. For the Golden Knights, this has been a rapid ascension. They were founded just six years ago. They reached the final in their very first season. And they were certainly the best in the west this year. The offense has continued to be incredible in the post season. They are favorited in this series. But the Panthers look like a team of destiny in these playoffs.
