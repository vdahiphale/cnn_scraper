I'm staying in a square where you can see destroyed vehicles from the beginning of the war. We actually can't take you to the scene of these attacks because the targets were critical infrastructure and Ukraine has very strict rules about filming and showing these locations. They don't want to tip off the Russians to what areas they might have hit and what areas they might have missed. But in this case, Kyiv says that most of the missiles never reached their targets because they say out of around 40 missiles that Russia fired directly at Kyiv which is a huge number, even for locals who've been living here and throughout this full-scale war for nearly 10 months now. They say they shot down 37 of them. There were however three explosions reported here in Kyiv both on the east and west banks of the river, two of them in the East, one in the West. There are reports across Ukraine of entire cities plunged into darkness as a result of these attacks, which didn't just hit here in Kyiv they also hit to the South in Odessa and to the North, in Sumy, and Kharkiv. But here in the capital, there were tens of thousands of people sheltering in place, hiding and underground subway stations waiting for an all-clear, and there were sounds of explosions. We actually heard them this morning as we were getting ready to pack up and go on a road trip, the air raid sirens went off, and there were some loud explosions that can be heard in our vicinity. CNN staff who lived even closer to the scenes of the explosion said they also heard the sound of the air defense systems being activated, shooting down, presumably those dozens of missiles that were headed towards the Ukrainian capital. The number of dead and injured of course, those reports are always fluid. But as of now we know at least two people killed at least five people injured, including children. And UNICEF just days ago warned that these ongoing Russian attacks this constant bombardment of the civilian power infrastructure is putting the physical and mental health of nearly every single child here in Ukraine at desperate risk.

Anyone who doxes gets suspended. That is the rationale that Elon Musk is using.

And thesejournalists were reporting aggressively, but fairly, on Elon Musk and what he has been doing with Twitter. And, clearly, he did not appreciate that sort of reporting, and so he has banned them from the platform. That's really the short answer here. They have been reporting primarily as of late in the past 48 hours or so, on him banning an account that used public flight information to track his private jet. Elon Musk has always hated this account, he's tried to get it shut down in the past, and now that he owns Twitter, he did that, and it resulted in some news coverage. And then Elon Musk banned the reporters who covered that story. And I think this has really exposed his lack of commitment to free speech. He came on Twitter and said when he bought the platform that he wanted to make this the free speech beacon of the world and now you are seeing him ban high-profile journalists from CNN, \"The New York Times,\" \"The Washington Post,\" and other of news organizations. And I think this also raises the question of, what does the free press look like on Twitter? You see CNN in a statement said it will reevaluate its approach based on how Twitter responds, and so I think that's something to pay attention to moving forward.",

Advertisers might not want to be associated with a platform that's in the business of censoring journalists. You can imagine that a company maybe like Amazon, which is a Jeff Bezos company, and Jeff Bezos owns the \"Washington Post,\" and now Elon Musk is banning his reporter for no good reason off Twitter, so I would be curious whether Amazon, you know, for instance, wants to continue advertising on this platform. But there are a host of others, including news organizations. You know, I was just on Twitter and I got an ad for the \"Wall Street Journal,\" you know, putting an advertisement. Are they comfortable advertising on a platform that is in the business of censoring the free press? I think there are a lot of questions that this action has raised, and, you know, we are still in the immediate wake of this.

Well, just days before this Title 42 rule is set to expire, we have seen a week's worth ofsurge, a migrant surge here just specifically in the El Paso, Texas, area, which is kind of in the middle point of the U.S. southern border between California and the very southern tip of Texas. And what we have seen is about 2500 migrants a day arriving ahead of the end of this Title 42 which comes next week. And it's almost like a precursor, a foreshadowing of what city officials here fear could be coming. The mayor yesterday here in El Paso says that when Title 42 is lifted that the number of migrants arriving here in El Paso could be 5,000. And that creates a logistical nightmare. What you see behind me are pockets of dozens and dozens of migrants who have been sleeping on the streets this week because the shelters are filled with people. And it has been extremely frigid. Temperatures near zero degrees Celsius for much of the week in the overnight hours, but many of these people are waiting to catch bus rides out of town. When these migrants arrive here in the U.S., very few of them stay in the border areas. They have court dates to appear in immigration court at a later time, but the logistical unit, there's a sanitary concern, so, you know, the city has put out trash cans here. In fact right now the migrants are helping city workers empty these trash cans into the dumpster here. And that is the concern that they have to worry about at this point, that people, volunteers have been coming by giving the blankets, giving them warm food and warm drinks as these temperatures have been so brutally frigid here for much of the last week. But the concern is just, you know, how many people are going to be arriving once this Title 42 rule expires next week. The Biden administration says that across the entire U.S. southern border, they are anticipating anywhere between 9,000 and 14,000 people per day. That is roughly about double the number of migrants we're seeing arriving right now at the U.S. southern border. So it is being described as a humanitarian crisis and a possible disaster. So we will see what happens, but many of these communities bracing for what's to come next week.",

For 17 days he hadn't heard a thing. And the mystery had deepened of course because we've seen on the 3rd of December that CCTV footage of Kenny DeLand Jr. obviously in a store, a sports store about an hour and a half to the south of where his university was, and then nothing at all. And then this morning it was the news at last that his father wanted to hear. He'd been found. We don't know still what his condition is. We don't know where he's been. We don't know why he's disappeared. None of those details for the time being simply the fact, Eleni, that he is in communication with his family and that he is in Spain. We've learned yesterday that amongst the small amount of stuff he left home with on the morning of the 28th of November, he actually had his passport with him.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DON RIDDELL, CNN WORLD SPORT (on-camera): Souq Waqif has been one of our favorite places during this World Cup tournament. It really has felt like a global village with fans from all 32 teams and many other countries lingering here, hanging out, enjoying each other's company, often late into the night. We are not seeing so many fans here tonight with three days go until the final. Perhaps it's the calm before the storm. But there's still a great vibe, a great energy, a really good atmosphere and hopefully we can find some fans of Argentina and France to see what they think about the big game. So when we flew out here four weeks ago, of course, we are very much looking forward to the tournament. And I was wondering if I was going to miss the alcohol, the chance to have a beer every now and again. [10:40:002] And the truth is, I really haven't. So I'm going to introduce you to our new vice. We love these, often very, very late into the night. They're absolutely delicious.",
