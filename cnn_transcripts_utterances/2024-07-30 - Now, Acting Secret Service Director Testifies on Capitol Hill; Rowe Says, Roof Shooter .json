At any moment on Capitol Hill, acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe will tell senators that he is, quote, ashamed of the botched security that led to the near assassination of former President Donald Trump. Rowe took charge last week after the sniper attack on Trump forced the resignation of embattled Director Kimberly Cheatle. And his prepared remarks released ahead of his testimony this morning is saying, quote, what I saw made me ashamed as a career law enforcement officer and a 25-year veteran with the Secret Service. I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured, end quote. Rowe will discuss how the Secret Service is improving security and Trump will likely put those new protocols to the test very soon because he is saying that he will continue to hold outdoor rallies and will even hold an event at the site where he was shot.

I don't think we should be stopped by somebody that has severe mental problems or whatever his problem.",

Obviously, the fact that nobody was on that roof, nobody was there with sight of that roof was a huge, huge failure. And then the fact that there was this lack of communication, which meant that the former president got on stage, even while we were looking for someone suspicious, right? They could have held him backstage for a little bit.One of the things you'll hear today from the new acting director is how they've changed protocols. They've added some of the assets to protect Donald Trump as well as some of the other people. There's, of course, J.D. Vance is now getting protection, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is getting protection, and they've changed the protection for the new Democratic presumptive nominee, Kamala Harris, Vice President Harris. So, those are all things that have that have changed. The other thing, Pamela, that you can see already changed is the fact that he went to the site. It's something that Kimberly Cheatle did not do before her hearing. And, of course, that ended up extremely badly for her.",

Cheryl, there's the accountability aspect, and there's also the aspect of what more are you doing in the Secret Service to make sure that these rallies are safe, this doesn't happen again. There are already changes in the Secret Service since the July 13th shooting, including obviously, we were talking about the director's resignation, there is elevated security for those they're protecting.

So, there are things that will probably take place behind the scenes that the public may not be aware of, but there probably are ongoing changes all the time and daily, depending on the site location.And as you played earlier, the former president is going to go back to that location, and I'm sure there will be changes made at that location as well as any other outdoor event that he plans on doing, as well as indoor, but particularly in the outdoor situations.",

What can the former president's interview add to the investigation, in your view? FRANK MONTOYA JR., FORMER FBI SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE:  Well, I think like Darrin just said, it's all about perspective. I mean, he is a witness. He was there. The incident occurred to him. And so getting that perspective is really important in terms of putting together the whole 360 about what happened, when it happened and perhaps even to give us some, some insights into how you might be able to prevent, you know, future actions like this from happening again, in terms of and how Secret Service reacted. They absolutely did the right thing. They were courageous in what they did. But, you know, how can they do this a little bit better if there is such a threat the next time? But, yes, the key point is that he was a firsthand witness, and so it would be important to get his perspective on this.",
