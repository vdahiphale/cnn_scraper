      "sentences": "Tonight, straight from THE SOURCE, it's a date. Trump set for trial, in the classified documents case. But could he have the nomination locked up, before a jury has even been seated?Meanwhile, Vice President Harris going scorched earth, in Florida, today, not mentioning Governor Ron DeSantis by name, but accusing him of, quote, \"Gaslighting,\" after his State revised its school lesson plans, arguing that some Black people benefited from slavery. And there are legends, and then there is Tony Bennett, a crooner for the ages, who said he never worked a day in his life, because he loved performing, so much. And the world loved him right back. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. May 20th, 2024. It is somewhere between what the Special Counsel pushed for, in the classified documents case, and what Trump's legal team wanted. And now, Judge Aileen Cannon is splitting the difference. Donald Trump could be going to trial, while he is on the campaign trail, multiple times, actually. In January, the day of the Iowa caucuses, his civil defamation case begins. His hush monies trial, here in New York, starts 10 days after Super Tuesday. Well, we could have a pretty good idea, by then, if he's going to be the Republican nominee. And if his classified documents trial starts in mid-May, as it is scheduled, today, by Judge Cannon, there's a possibility that Trump could have effectively clinched the nomination, by then. That was the month he did so, in 2016. And of course, we are still waiting to see if he'll be indicted in the January 6th case, after he got a target letter, last Sunday. Here's what his new attorney, in that case, said today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN LAURO, FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ATTORNEY, FOUNDER OF THE LAURO FIRM: There's no need to appear, in front of any grand jury, right now. President Trump did absolutely nothing wrong. He's done nothing criminal. When he saw all these elections discrepancies, and irregularities going on, he did what any president was required to do.

Joining me here, tonight, is Republican congressman, Ken Buck of Colorado, here, on set. Thank you, for being here, in New York, with us, Congressman. You have said previously that you couldn't vote for Trump, if he was a convicted felon. But now, the idea that this case, this documents case, is going to be pushed back, or at least, right now, it's scheduled to start in mid-May? That's after your state's primary. What do you do? REP.

And the maitre d' said, \"Mr. Bennett is here. He'd like to talk to you.\" I came downstairs.

Tony Bennett was a very accomplished painter. I mean, he was really a serious painter. And oh, he taught me all kinds of things, about art, about the painters that he loved, John Singer Sargent, and Sorolla, and Zorn. And when he sang, he was kind of using a paintbrush, you know? You could feel the oil paint, you could see it, you could feel the texture, the way that he colored, the way that he would color the words, the way he would tell the story, and sing the song, and phrase it.

But I'll tell you a moment that I really remember above many other moments. I was in the recording studio with him. We were recording songs, of Jerome Kern. And we were recording with my trio, with Kenny Washington and Peter Washington, drums and bass, all together, no headphones, everybody in the same room, so, it's real-time and real recording. And we were doing the song, \"They Didn't Believe Me,\" an iconic popular song by Jerome Kern, lyrics by Herbert Reynolds. Now, this song is the ultimate in romance, and a really important American popular song, in the way that it says, \"And when I tell them, and I'm certainly going to tell them,\" that's really American. But what was happening is that we were in the studio. He was standing in the middle of the room. The studio was right in front of us, the recording booth that is. His son, Dae, was sitting at the recording -- at the recording console. And Susan Bennett was standing right there, behind the glass, about 10 feet away. We started the take.
