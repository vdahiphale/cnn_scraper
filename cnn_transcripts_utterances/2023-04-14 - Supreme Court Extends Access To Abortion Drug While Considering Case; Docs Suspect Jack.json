Just minutes ago, the U.S. Supreme Court hit pause, pause on the battle in the case of the abortion drug mifepristone. This means women, girls, doctors can continue to have full access to one of, if not the most common method of abortion amid mifepristone, without any restrictions, at least for now. The ruling, the decision takes us back to how the situation was in the United States before that Texas judge ruled in which suspended access theoretically to mifepristone, We're going to start with CNN's Jessica Schneider. And, Jessica, this came down just minutes ago. Tell us more about the ruling and this isn't the end of this fight, right? I mean, the U.S. Supreme Court's going to still make a decision on this.",

      "sentences": "This is not the end, Jake. That is right. This merely put this on pause for about five days. I mean, you can see it's a very short order here.What this does is this is -- this is Justice Samuel Alito, granting in part what the DOJ and FDA was asking for here. They were saying, if you -- if you can't give us anything else, give us an administrative stay, which basically puts a very brief pause on any of the changes that the Fifth Circuit had ordered. So what does this mean practically? Well, this means that full access to mifepristone remains. It remains just like it did before that Texas judge ruled one week ago because the concern was that if the Supreme Court did not do what it just did moments ago, that overnight tonight, 1:00 a.m. Eastern Time, there was concern that all of the rules surrounding this abortion pill mifepristone would have to be changed. That would mean that doctors would be instructed not to allow women to take this past seven weeks of pregnancy, because right now it's at 10 weeks of pregnancy. There are also concerns that they make them change the rules about telemedicine and getting this drug in the mail. For now, none of those rules are changing, as was feared, and things will remain the same. However, this is a very short window of relief for the DOJ and the FDA. The Supreme Court is saying that as of 11:59 p.m. on Wednesday, this stay will expire. So presumably, sometime on Wednesday, we will once again be waiting for the Supreme Court to weigh into this and to see if there's a longer stay put on this. You know, the appeals process is already moving forward in the Fifth Circuit. The Fifth Circuit has already set a very aggressive briefing schedule. They've already set oral arguments for May 17th so things are moving along at the appeals level, because, remember, this is just about pausing what the Fifth Circuit put into effect. So, the Supreme Court is doing that, there will be no changes. But, Jake, as you mentioned this legal battle continues to play out, and once again on Wednesday. All day will probably be on pins and needles again, much like we were today, waiting for the Supreme Court to once again, weigh in and see if they will continue to put these rules, or these changes once again on hold, Jake.",

The studies are deep. It's -- it is not a dangerous drug, and that has been shown over time.What the judge in this case, Matthew Kacsmaryk, a 2019 appointee of Donald Trump, who, as you're suggesting did have a background in anti- abortion advocacy, he reevaluated everything. He went, and, looked at his own studies, his own field of evidence to make his determination that this drug is not safe and that it really harms women and that it hurts the physicians that brought the case because what he has asserted in his opinion is that they end up having to care for women where these medication abortions have gone wrong. And what the Department of Justice has said is this is, you know, bologna. They used better legal terms, but basically what they said is that he had no -- he has no real evidence for finding this and it was -- and furthermore, what they say is, it's unprecedented for a federal district court judge to try to put himself in the shoes of the agency, where the expertise resides. So I can see indeed why many people would be challenging that, and that's why I actually think in the end and you know, in the abortion context now, you know, any kind of predictions are really fraught in so many ways, but I think that there's so much at stake in terms of the power of the Food and Drug Administration to use its knowledge and its experience to assess all sorts of drugs, not just mifepristone, but any existing and new drugs for the market, Jake.",

If this leak had not happened, it would probably have been invented the next day, unquote. What's your take on that? PRIESS:  I think that reveals more about the paranoid Russian mindset of always thinking there's a conspiracy behind the conspiracy than the most straightforward answer. Occam's razor really applies here. The documents lay out somebody who felt like he had access to these documents, wanted other people to see them and took extraordinary means to do so, first transcribing them, realizing that that was actually hard to do, would be easier just to print them, take them home and take pictures of them and then share them with friends, at least virtual friends.

Recently, CNN's Nick Paton Walsh and his team actually hiked the entire Darien gap for CNN's new program, \"THE WHOLE STORY WITH ANDERSON COOPER\". The Darien Gap, if you don't know, it's a dangerous 66-mile trek, through dense jungle with no roads that connect South and Central America. Every year, thousands of people attempt it, all to get them closer to the U.S., 3,000 miles away. Along the journey, CNN came across dozens, dozens of unaccompanied children. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ED LAVANDERA, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  When Black Lives Matter protests erupted around the country in the summer of 2020, newly released court documents revealed Daniel Perry intensely watched the chaos, quickly becoming angry. In a social media post, he described the protesters as a zoo full of monkeys. The unsealed documents include 76 pages of social media postings and text messages, most of these details were not shown to the jury that convicted the army sergeant of murdering protester Garrett Foster and raises new questions about why Texas Governor Greg Abbott is rushing a push to pardon this convicted murderer.

Another text said: I might go to Dallas to shoot looters. Perry's attorneys called the release of the documents a political move by prosecutors and said Foster also made posts advocating violence. In this 2020 post, Foster praised the burning of a Minneapolis police station. Perry's attorneys are calling for a new trial, saying they want to introduce evidence that Foster repeatedly instigated confrontations and was the, quote, first aggressor. When the murder happened on July 25th, 2020, Perry, now a 35-year-old Army sergeant, worked as a rideshare driver and had just dropped off a passenger near a BLM protest. Prosecutors say Perry drove into the protest and instigated a confrontation. Perry's attorneys say Foster, a 28 year old Air Force veteran, motion to Perry as protesters were beating on his car.",
