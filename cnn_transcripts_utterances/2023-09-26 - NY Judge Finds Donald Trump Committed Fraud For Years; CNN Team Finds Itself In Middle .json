      "sentences": "OUTFRONT nextBreaking news: fraud. A New York judge ruling that Donald Trump and his family repeatedly committed fraud illegally inflating property values by billions. Is this just the beginning of the end for Trump's business empire? We're going to speak to a Trump business insider who says it was Trump's M.O. to deceive, worked with him for years. Plus, our Fred Pleitgen suddenly found himself in the middle of the Ukrainian offensive not far from heavily armed Russian troops. An incredible report that you will see first this hour, OUTFRONT tonight. And we are live in southern Mexico where thousands of migrants are making their way north, some held at gunpoint. This is an OUTFRONT exclusive this hour. Let's go OUTFRONT. (MUSIC) And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, we begin with the breaking news: fraud. The judge finding Donald Trump engaged in repeated fraud for years. It puts the existence of Trump's entire business at risk tonight. And a New York judge is ruling that Trump and his sons are liable for providing false financial statements over a decade, right? And here is -- here's the judge's ruling. It is a complete rejection of Trump's arguments that he did not lie about the value of golf courses, hotels, high-rises, his own apartment, Mar-a-Lago, arguments that a judge in New York is ruling tonight are bogus. The ground-breaking ruling coming just days before the case was going to head to trial. That means that the trial itself will mostly focus not on whether Trump did it but on what he's going to pay for having done it, the damages. And those could be massive and transformational. The New York attorney general is asking for a quarter billion dollars in damages. And the judge's 45-page opinion is blistering. Just on here, obstreperous the word they used to describe Trump and his lawyers, using the words bogus. Again and again, you see this. And the judge breaks down fraudulent example after example. Judge Engoron writing that Trump is accused as just one example of inflating the value of his triplex apartment at Trump Tower by three times, overvaluing it by as much as $207 million. Now, in this case, the judge writes, and I quote, a discrepancy of this order of magnitude by a real estate developer seizing up his own living space for decades can only be considered fraud. And the judge continues to say if Trump's business fraud, quote, this is a fantasy world, not the real world. But it is important to note that this is the entire world that Trump created and sold the world through \"The Apprentice\" reality TV series, a world that he sold voters, and a world, frankly, that vaulted him to the White House.

That may sound esoteric, but what it could mean is that the Trump Organization actually ceases to exist entirely in the state of New York.Now, this is an incredible thing to say. And it is an important and ground-breaking moment that we are in. I want to get straight to Brynn Gingras in New York outside Trump Tower.

So, Ryan, you know, we go through here, Park Avenue, 40 Wall Street, Mar-a-Lago, Trump Tower, 7 Springs. Every time they're overvalued by hundreds of millions of dollars. I mean, it adds up to billions. It's incredible. RYAN GOODMAN, CO-EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, JUST SECURITY: It really is astounding. And the judge says that there is conclusive evidence of this. That's why it does not need to go to trial. It's an open and shut case, according to the judge. And that means that we're just going to be determining, as said, damages up to at least a quarter million dollars or more. But the big point is also what the judge orders on the basis of this, which is that all of the certificates of these businesses are hereby canceled and there's a dissolution of these companies. He says it, within 10 days, the parties have to recommend to me who will be the receiver, because it's going to go into receivership. So, I think that's a huge impact. BURNETT: And that could be the Trump organization itself, these business certificates. Do we understand from the ruling exactly what that means?",

Again and again and again, that's the incontrovertible evidence. HARRY SANDICK, FORMER ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY: That's right. And this statute only applies to kind of persistent fraud. It's not about somebody who makes a mistake or even does fraud once. It's about a business that's engaged in persistent fraud. And that's what he's determined here. And he very carefully reviewed the contentions on both sides. There was a lot of evidence on the attorney general's side he concluded and on Trump's side it was sometimes just Trump's, you know, subjective view that I think this is worth more than everybody thinks it is.",

There's other aspects of it that just show this to be kind of a house of cards.

You have to have corporate standing in the state that you're doing business, and it can be revoked very easily. So, forget the financial side of it for a minute. They could step in and say we're not going to allow you to operate.

And we don't all know about it because we're all working and doing other things that people in New York maybe -- maybe would know about.

General, let me just start with you because you just saw Fred's incredible reporting with that drone unit. The team leader unit there called Groove tells Fred that, since Ukraine doesn't have an air force, a modern one at this point, that they are the air force. We've talked a lot about drones since day one here. But can they win the war at this point with this air force? LT. GEN. BEN HODGES, FORMER COMMANDING GENERAL OF U.S. ARMY EUROPE: I have to say I was impressed with Fred's reporting there. I mean, he could smell it and feel it really well done. Of course, there is no one weapon that's going to win anything. But the Ukrainians are the most adaptive soldiers I've ever seen. They clearly have a level of tech savviness that is unsurpassed I think by anybody's army.

But when you see -- so, that opens the door. But you see the video Sokolov's leaning back in a pillow. He ppars for a couple of seconds. Doesn't say anything. Do you trust this?

They are so good, especially on the video side of things in terms of doing these deepfakes and all sorts of other techniques that they've really developed over the years of doing cyberattacks.So, you know, you start from the perspective of if the Kremlin says something, that's good reason right there to doubt it. But then when they start saying things like, no, no, this is very important, general was not killed. And then they've got him, I don't know, he looks a little propped up on pillows to me, but that's just me. The real important thing here is that they managed a pretty successful attack, apparently, the headquarters of the Russian navy on the Black Sea. So regardless of who was killed, and the reporting is roughly 30 officers, that's a significant enough of an event in and of itself.",

Rafael Torres Marti (ph) from outside Havana, Cuba. At 26, he sold his house, left behind his 6-year-old son and is traveling with his dad. He wants to go legally into the U.S. so he want dollars to go through this process here, get his documentation and then get to the northern border, and eventually cross. He wants to pave the way for the rest of his family to follow. Hido Duarte (ph) traveled from Honduras with his wife and their two young boys. He's done this before. [19:45:05] Four years ago, he lived in Minnesota, says  he was painting water towers, water tanks, and he said he was deported from Minnesota to Honduras and is now making the trek again. In the already impoverished state of Chiapas, Tapachula feels the migrant strain. It is overflowing. A lot of it is just waiting to get into an office and processed eventually. But you've got people from all over. We've met people from Haiti, from Cuba, from Honduras and they're here for many of them an unknown period of time. Last year, Mexico says some 77,000 migrants applied for asylum in Mexico. More than half of them do it in Tapachula. This year on track to be nearly double that. A record high, not everyone sees it as a burden. And for some of the Mexican locals, all these people who are not from Mexico are a business opportunity, too. Look over here. You can see some of the stands that are set up to sell food, vendors. To get to Tapachula, it's an hour's day or a day's walk from the Suchiate River, Guatemala on one side, Mexico on the other. And in the shadows of the official crossing between the two countries, an armada of rafts casually ferrying group after group. She says it's a really, really hard track. You can tell they just have such a rush of emotion when they get to this side. And some of them come ready to just continue on. Others like Mikele Marchan (ph) and her husband Javier Dien (ph) using this as a moment to catch their breath. They're having their first child, she's five months pregnant. Days earlier, they crossed the treacherous jungle terrain of the Darien Gap connecting Colombia and Panama. All they own now fits in this small bag. They were robbed and held at gunpoint for hours. But that does not compare, they say, with what they saw. Oh, my god, they're just describing passing through the Darien Gap and they said several people had already passed away. A lot of kids they saw the remains and he says children who were abandoned. Those images haunt Susana Alemar (ph), describing the journey she made with her four young kids. But even amidst her tear-filled pain, little ones lighten the load. He had a little shampoo left in his head. His 12-year-old sister Sophia (ph) helping clean shampoo out of his hair as he then turns the questions on me. She says I am older than her dad. Curiosity brings their siblings and cousins and Joe Andre (ph) takes over the mic, telling me why they left Venezuela. Six years old, he even speaks of Venezuelan economy is bad. But as they share, disturbing memories surface. They're talking about -- these are children, mind you, having gone through the Darien and the bodies he's describing seeing a blonde woman. Sophia's pain as she remembers saying good-bye to loved ones. A little heartbreaking the friendships that she's lost. So much behind them, yet, far from over.
