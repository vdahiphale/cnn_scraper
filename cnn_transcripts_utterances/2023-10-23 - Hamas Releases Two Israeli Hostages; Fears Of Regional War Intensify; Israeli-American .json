Well, now, both women are free. They've been released by Hamas after more than two weeks in captivity. Medics from an Egyptian State- affiliated media outlet say that both were in stable condition. They are in a Tel Aviv hospital tonight. But their husbands, who were kidnapped with them, are still being held by Hamas.

Can you just walk us through a little bit about what this debriefing must look like? You know, they were with the paramedics today, but then what happened? What's the next couple days like for them? O'SHEA: Well, first and foremost is to get a medical check. That's the first part of what's called the repatriation process. First and foremost, make sure their health is taken care of. But there -- even if they weren't shot or wounded in the -- in the initial kidnapping or their captivity, they are going to have mental scars. Um, the shock of coming out -- I -- we had very few successful emissions in Iraq over my two years. But -- but I was able to do some repatriation debriefs and be a part of watching these, uh, these hostages come out of a -- in one case, Jill Carroll had been held for 83 days in captivity and it is shellshock.

These hostages who have been repatriated, as you're talking about, might be able to give information about their surroundings through their sensory experience. But what kind of a challenge does Gaza present to a rescue effort for the rest? O'SHEA: Gaza presents a challenge for hostage rescue forces, unlike anything I've seen in 20 odd years. We have pulled off host rescue missions over the last 20 years. We have the greatest special operations forces on the planet. But the difference between, say, Gaza and Iraq and Afghanistan, we own the night. We had, you know, forward operating bases everywhere. We could fly at night, so to hear helicopters at night was common. So, the critical thing for host rescue is a couple things. Number one, proof of life. You don't want to send hostage rescue forces in to go after a dead body. Obviously, put their lives at risk. Second, attend as a grid. You want to know exactly where those hostages are held because the element of surprise is critical. A group like Hamas, you can assume these are armed gunmen. They're standing watch. And the moment they hear something, the first objective for them would probably be to kill the hostages. So, that stealthy insertion is critical. In a place like Gaza, one of the most densely-packed places on the Earth, you've got apartments that are 10, 12 stories high, the hostage could be held at any floor in any room, and you want to know exactly what room and what floor in that apartment building is, or in these, you know, cavern systems and underneath the city in the -- in the maze of these supposed tunnels. Uh, if they're held there, it's going to even make a rescue even more challenging. Uh, and they've got the (INAUDIBLE).",

The people who lived in the communities that were attacked by Hamas, they say they won't come back. And Israel is very concerned about that. They want, of course, people to live in peace and security if possible. Just all in all, the pressure on the Israeli government is to go in. But they've been holding off. It's already Tuesday morning. It's 17 days since the atrocity, as the Israelis put it. I think they're able to hold off. Apparently, there has been pressure from the United States to keep delaying to give a chance for some hostages to be released. That might again be by negotiation through Qatar. In this case, apparently, through Qatar and Egypt. So, negotiation would be fine. And if the Israelis get more intelligence and can try a raid or two to rescue some people, they would try that.

It's because of so many different complexities.Hamas uses civilian areas.

Egypt has billions in aid -- billions in loans that it would love to see forgiven for doing the international community, doing the U.S. the favor of allowing a number of Palestinians through that checkpoint. And Hamas is a Sunni militant group related to the Muslim Brotherhood, which the current Egyptian leader overthrew. They don't want to see Hamas strengthened either.
