This is the second time that the same building housing government agencies, ministries, perhaps close to the defense industry, has been hit in just three days. That's clearly no mistake.And while Ukraine is not openly saying they are behind these drone attacks, it is, obviously, their message to say they can hit with pinpoint accuracy parts of Russia's defense infrastructure. Quite a different story, though, while Russia has called these acts of desperation and acts of terrorism, there is certainly, I think, a feeling amongst Ukrainian civilians here that it's actually desperation that they are on the receiving end of, night after night civilian targets hit here by Russian barrages. And in fact, while you mentioned Kryvyi Rih, the hometown of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, being hit now with six dead there and over 70 injured, Kherson, recently liberated from Russian occupying forces, that saw four dead from shelling yesterday, and just now a hospital there hit where a doctor was killed and a nurse injured. This is just the daily repeat cycle of Russian brutality upon the Ukrainian civilian population here. And while Ukraine's president says that the drone attacks on Russia are a sign that the war is slowly returning to Russian territory, there is still intense fighting along the southern front here. We saw it ourselves yesterday, and the Russian chief of staff Valery Gerasimov appears to have visited that front line. It's vitally important for Russia's war effort. It's continued presence, frankly, here at all, and those attacks are intensifying and so are the barrages, one against the other across the Ukraine Russia border. Phil, Poppy?",

PHILIP BUMP, NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, \"THE WASHINGTON POST\":  It's impossible to spin that as a positive. The thing that you just showed that I'd be most worried about if I were the Trump camp is on that graphic where you saw this big surge in donations after the Manhattan indictment that then became a much smaller surge in donations during the indictment for Mar-a-Lago. If that's the pattern, the pattern is I'm being targeted, give me all your money, and he gets a lot money, and then I am being targeted, give me more money, and he gets a little less money, that's potentially problematic, because he needs to keep raising money.

The decision comes after months of deliberation and is sure to anger Senator Tommy Tuberville, who is continuing the hold on senior military nominations that is now impacting more than 300 flag and general officers over the Pentagon's abortion policy.Let's get some perspective now from Sarah Streyder. She's the Executive Director of Secure Families Initiatives. She's also a military spouse herself. Sarah, thank you for taking the time. I think, you know, there's a lot of discussion about National Security implications. Obviously, the Marine Commandant is now an unopened position or an unfilled position to some degree as well. And I understand that I didn't want to address that. But I'm mostly interested in military families. I think, well, disclosure, I'm an Army brat. I understand what it's like when you're in the middle of a relocation process or in the middle of a promotion. There are schools, there are housing, there are finances to deal with right now. Do you see a tangible effect on the families of these military officers? SARAH STREYDER, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, SECURE FAMILIES' INITIATIVE: Oh, absolutely. On the 300 families directly impacted, this is taking folks who have given decades of their life to service and saying thank you for your service. We're going to hold your career hostage. I mean, to your point, this affects the spouses who have already had to uproot their personal and professional lives over a dozen times. It affects kids who only want to do is get to the next duty station so they can try out for fall sports. And now in their, let's say junior or senior year of high school, they can't even do that. It's attacking the wrong people. Because these 300 families whose entire lives are uprooted. They don't have control over the policy that the Senator is so upset about and it's so unfair.",

It would take an awfully long time, that would be a divergence from kind of normal course with these types of promotions. Have you talked to Democrats about doing that? Why is that not an option?",

But speaking of normal order, I would ask the Senator to do the same for his own grandstanding. Rather than hold up these promotions for hostage, work with your colleagues to pass a law that might codify the policy that you're so fired up about. I mean, the fact that the senator hasn't chosen to use normal legislative channels, probably indicates he does not have the personal or political support for his grandstanding.",

All of that happens right away, because you never know when your orders are going to get escalated.You start saying goodbye to folks back home, you start quitting that old job and looking for your new one. And so, to get partway through that process, and then all of a sudden being told you're on an indefinite limbo, you might be stuck in a hotel somewhere.
