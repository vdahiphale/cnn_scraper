The high pressure that's been here over the four corners region, near Nevada jut sort of drifts a little bit but that heat dome stays massive. And it blocks any of these winds and rain that can cool things off. And things are going to stay 10, 15 degrees above average -- that's Fahrenheit -- above average, for the next at least week.And we're talking the hottest times of the year. So it's take your hottest time of the year, add 10 to 15 degrees Fahrenheit and that's where we are. Nearly every day this week in Phoenix, will be a record high. That's scary. And what's even scarier are the lows -- 94, 95, 94. Those are -- would be in the top five to ten hottest nights Phoenix has ever had. Any one of them. And you've got seven in a row.

The next several days here, going through actually next weekend. If you're in the Northern Plains, and even in the Northeast, you've been dealing with a lot of rain.

The Secretary of State, Treasury Secretary and now the U.S. climate envoy John Kerry. Kerry and Xie, they have a history. They've met more than 50 times. They worked together in COP26 in Glasgow back in 2021. They made real progress there. They then met on the sidelines of COP27 in Egypt last year. Then in January of this year, they talked via video link. So their communications, you know, they continued despite strained relations. But this face-to-face meeting earlier today, very important in resuming the joint working group on climate cooperation before COP28 which will be taking place end of November in Dubai. Kerry said it was imperative that China and the U.S. make real progress in the next four months.
