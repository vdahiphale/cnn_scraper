And this was several years before his Alzheimer's diagnosis. And I want to read you some of what Tony told me that night.He said, life goes fast. It goes fast. I'm 90, but I still feel like I'm about 35 years old. The audience has always made me feel accepted. I've been sold out throughout my whole life, performing throughout the world. It's a great gift and I'm very honored to have had a great life entertaining people. And Lady Gaga was there that night, John Travolta, Katie Couric, Regis Philbin. I mean, the list goes on and on. I just remember how kind he was and obviously being able to see him perform. And all of the younger generation that got to know his music because of the albums and the tour that he did with Lady Gaga. I've reached out to her for a comment, and we are waiting to hear back. Obviously, a devastating blow. She gave an interview about a year or so ago after his Alzheimer's diagnosis was made public and she just said it was devastating to watch him go through this. And you heard Anderson Cooper, just a little bit ago, talking about spending time with Tony and interviewing him for \"60 Minutes\" and how hard it was to see him go through that. But then, on the other hand, he could remember the music and he could perform and it was just spectacular what his mind was still capable of being able to do. And, obviously, this is a massive blow to the music community and to all the people all over the world who have loved Tony and have had the pleasure of enjoying his music over the last several decades.",

So, all of the generations that have grown up or have enjoyed Tony Bennett at one place or another, whether it's a wedding or a birthday party, where you've listened to Tony Bennett's music, it's - it's -- he's just one of those artists, like Frank Sinatra, that when you hear it, you know that's Tony Bennett.Just to point out, he had his first number one single in 1951 with \"Because of You.\" And he made music industry history by being the oldest performer twice to have a number one album on the Billboard Top 200 albums at the age of 85 and 88. So, if that doesn't motivate you to just keep going. He received 20 Grammy Awards, including the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, two Emmy Awards, was named a Kennedy Center Honoree. I mean the list goes on and on. And like Anderson Cooper was saying a bit ago, he served as a foot soldier in World War II, and he became a life-long pacifist and a humanitarian. He marched with Dr. Martin Luther King in Selma, Alabama, in 1965. A very big supporter of human rights for everyone. And so, you know, his publicist confirming this morning to CNN that he passed away at the age of 96 at his home, surrounded by his family. He's survived by his two sons and his daughters. He has nine grandchildren. He's lived a full life.",

And so I think that perseverance, the will to live, his pure talent and I think, yes, his openness from his family and himself to share this, to let people know that they are not alone and that, you know, they have been advocates for this and, yes, he was diagnosed in 2016 with Alzheimer's.

I know that you've said that you think an indictment is going to be coming next week, this third criminal indictment. But when you look then, if you move forward from that, how do you think the calendar then lines up and the complications that come with it? With -- you've got multiple indictments, the possibility of more charges coming in Fulton County, Georgia, and adding in the very real thing of the political calendar at the very same time. How do you handle that as a prosecutor? DANYA PERRY, FORMER PROSECUTOR, U.S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK: Yes, this is a complicated one. Courts and prosecutors and defense lawyers are used to conflicting schedules, of course. And defendants can be very busy. They can be very wealthy. They, you know, can have other -- other trials. But this one, obviously, there's an intersection between our criminal justice systems and our political system. That is, of course, unique. And so the prosecutors have been pushing for quick trials. We've seen that in the Mar-a-Lago case where they're requesting a trial later this year. But, of course, there are already some cases that are already on the docket. We've got a trial in New York, a civil trial, brought by the attorney general in New York. That is slated for later this year. And then we've got the criminal case out of the district attorney's office in New York in early next year, in March. And then there are a couple civil trials in between. So, there is going to be some pairying (ph) and some discussions, I imagine, between the judges' chambers about exactly how to sequence these and how to prioritize these.

There is almost zero chance, I think at this point, that an indictment will not follow, and follow quickly.So, the grand jury, however, can continue with its work. It has additional evidence it can receive. It will take the testimony of additional witnesses. And that could be because they could be exploring additional charges and perhaps a later superseding indictment, or they could be looking at charges against additional defendants. That would kind of make sense because I'm imagining that special counsel Jack Smith will want to get the indictment against Mr. Trump issued as quickly as possible for the reasons we said, to try and slot in on the very complicated trial schedule docket.
