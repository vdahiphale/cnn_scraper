Both Kamala Harris and Donald Trump make their closing pitches in the battleground state of Pennsylvania. Plus, a historically tight race. We take a closer look at the key states that may decide who wins the race for the White House. And survivors of deadly flash flooding in Valencia confronts Spain's king and queen as the country prepares for yet more heavy rain. But first, tonight, we are in the frenzied final hours from the culmination of really what has been an unforgettable U.S. presidential race, one that included the stunning decision by the sitting President to step aside if you remember, the incredibly quick rise of the Harris campaign and two apparent assassination attempts on Donald Trump. At this hour, the former President is in Pennsylvania for the first of two rallies there today before heading to Michigan for his final campaign stop. A short time ago in North Carolina, Trump veered off message and talked about former first lady Michelle Obama. This is what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  And Michelle hit me the other day, I was so nice to her out of respect, I was so nice, she hit me the other day -- I was going to say to my people, am I allowed to hit her now?

The second thing is immigration. This has been something that voters have prioritized as one of their top issues. And Trump's argument there, too, is essentially the border is insecure under Democrats and a Trump administration would change that. We're really in a point in this election cycle where both the Harris campaign and the Trump campaign are trying to energize their base more than focus on arguments that are meant to reach out to swing voters.

      "sentences": "Well, the Vice President and her team are trying to tap into some of the good vibes that set off hercampaign a few months ago by essentially projecting optimism on the campaign trail, and now these closing hours. Now, the campaign has always said that it has been operating a wide map, meaning that they have been trying to work every battleground state and sort of inching any sort of victory that they can in multiple districts, but also in these battleground states. Now, Pennsylvania in particular however has always been crucial to their multiple paths to victory. So, that is why she is here. This is why she is going to multiple cities in the Commonwealth today. And I spoke to a senior campaign official who told me this quote, \"they are trying to touch the whole gamut of what makes up Pennsylvania.\" What does that mean? That means the red rural counties. That means the Latino voters, that means the cities, the suburbs essentially trying to reach all of the voters that they can in the sort of limited time that they -- that they have, especially trying to convince those voters who are still on the fence as to who they want to vote for. Now, they are very much also depending on their ground game, since the very beginning, campaign officials have said they have a strong infrastructure on the ground, door-knocking, canvassing and working -- having field offices in many districts, including those that have voted for former President Donald Trump. They think that that's going to be the payoff, that they think that's going to get them to victory here in Pennsylvania. Now, of course, that remains to be seen, but it has come up repeatedly in conversation with campaign officials. Now, again, I think it's worth underscoring that Pennsylvania is really the converging of all the different strategies we've seen in the Harris campaign employ over the last several weeks, essentially going and appealing to Latino voters, there's a large percentage of Latino voters here in the Commonwealth. But that also includes trying to shave off those GOP votes where they can in those districts that have formally voted for former President Donald Trump. And then also, bringing in their coalition. So, this is a unique place, not only because it could prove decisive for the Vice President and her campaign, but also because it is a place where you can see all the strategies that this campaign has tried to employ and hoping -- they're hoping that it pays off for them tomorrow.",

Each come with a lofty number of electoral votes and crucial, of course, for the candidates to win the White House. The latest poll of likely voters from the \"New York Times\" shows no clear winner across those battlegrounds as you can see. Harris and Trump seemed to be neck-and-neck in both Pennsylvania and Michigan.

I want to welcome back Zoe Clark in Michigan, radio political analyst and Solomon Jones and radio host from Philadelphia. Zoe and Solomon, great to have you back on the show, happy election eve. I'm sure you are both very excited to see democracy in action in less than 24 hours. Solomon, let me start with you.

A lot has happened since we last spoke, but as we've just outlined for our viewers, they're still very much neck-and-neck, just putting aside that Iowa poll.

Israeli opposition leaders say the Intelligence was fake and that part -- part of a scheme to thwart a ceasefire and hostage deal.

This is Hezbollah's seat of power, a major flash-point in Israel's bombing campaign. But this is also home to some 1 million people, most of whom are now displaced. (on camera):  Israeli strikes across the country have damaged 34 hospitals according to health authorities. Eight of these have been forced to close. Now, while the majority of these hospitals weren't directly hit, they were inside a blast radius known as a kill zone. (voice-over):  Let's look at this more closely. The bombing campaign focused on three areas, the southern suburbs of Beirut, the Beqaa Valley and the country's south, which borders Israel. We analyzed over 240 Israeli airstrikes in the first month of Israel's countrywide offensive. Our team measured the potential reach of fragments from each one of these attacks. Experts call this a kill zone. A 340 meter radius around the target where shrapnel can tear through buildings and people. This calculation is based on the types of bombs we know Israel is using in Lebanon today. In the southern suburbs of Beirut, our analysis found that every single hospital was within the kill zone of an airstrike, and health authorities say every single hospital has been damaged as a result. In the Beqaa Valley, two hospitals were found within these kill zones. In the south, where whole villages have been flattened by Israel's bombardment, there were six. CNN was able to verify 19 hospitals that fell within these kill zones. Health authorities say a fifth of Lebanon's hospitals have been damaged. Many fear this is only the beginning, with dozens of Lebanese health and emergency workers killed in just a month according to the Health Ministry. There are echoes of the apocalyptic situation that is still playing out for hospitals in Gaza.",

I mean, I think you are seeing dramatic increases in defense spending in Europe and in Japan and other countries are trying to step up, but there are just limitations, I think, to how much they can do in the short-term, especially because defense industry has atrophied since the end of the Cold War all over the western world. And so, we have to work together with our European allies and other allies to support in battle democracies like Ukraine. If the United States suddenly drops out of that coalition, and we suddenly have a president who is sympathetic to dictators rather than to Democrats, I think that'll be a very dangerous development.
