That was a major sticking point that ultimately helped to collapse these negotiations back in August, as the Israeli prime minister insisted that troops must remain there, and Hamas demanded the opposite.So we are seeing progress. We are seeing exchanges of ideas. And again, the positivity is coming not only from some of the mediators, from the United States, but also Hamas, which yesterday said that they believe a deal is possible. A separate Hamas source saying that there was a positive and optimistic atmosphere about these negotiations. But they were also cautioning that new Israeli demands could stall any further progress. And that is indeed a consideration. In the meantime, though, the war is very much continuing in Gaza. In just the last 24 hours, the Palestinian ministry of health has reported that 38 people have been killed and 203 people injured. The fate of those 100 hostages still hanging in the balance as well.",

      "sentences": "Good morning, John.We are learning a little bit more to put into a more clearer picture of this child's experience here at the school as well as her personal life. And what we're learning from court records obtained by \"The Washington Post\" is that she had a turbulent childhood, John. Her parents married and remarried at least three times. There was a separation agreement that required joint custody, and as part of that, John, she was shuttled between houses every few days. She would spend two days with one parent, two days with another parent, three days with another parent. And so the picture that is coming into clearer focus now is one of a pretty disjointed home life. Further, CNN has spoken with a student whose locker was right next to Natalie Rupnow's. And what we know from law enforcement is that she went by Samantha, and this child who spoke with CNN said she didn't even know that her name was really Natalie. She called her Sam, and she described her as having -- not really having a friend group. And so, John, what this taken together all suggests is that she had this very difficult home life. She seemed to be, according to this child, somewhat alone at school. And as we know, this all ended in an absolute tragedy. One of the big questions here, John, is whose gun was it? Law enforcement tracing that firearm. Police have not told us who that gun belonged to. And the other question, John, is, of course, how she got it. And then further, whether or not anybody specifically inside that building was targeted. Police addressed that very question yesterday, saying that as far as they're concerned, everybody was a target. Everybody was an equal danger. And the ripple effect here for parents and students will continue. Here's what one father told CNN. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

That indictment, including that rare first-degree murder charge, and rare because it really requires special elements related to the crime and can come from just a narrow list of aggravating factors. That's why it was so serious, what we heard from the D.A. yesterday.Mangione also indicted by a grand jury for murder in the second degree, Kate, as a crime of terrorism. So right off the bat, I want you to take a listen to how D.A. Alvin Bragg really described the severity of these charges that he's bringing against Luigi Mangione now.

A spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections, Kate, we learned as of yesterday, Luigi Mangione has received 157 deposits into his prison commissary account. We also learned as of yesterday morning, Mangione received 33 emails and six pieces of hard mail. That's up from just two pieces of mail that we reported he'd received back on Monday night. Still, though, the only visitors he has had has been his attorneys.But, Kate, I want to turn now to what we're expecting to see tomorrow. Like I said earlier, this whole court area is probably going to be very, very busy tomorrow because Mangione is expected to have two hearings early tomorrow morning. The first one is going to be on those lesser Pennsylvania charges, and then the second hearing is going to happen right after its expected to be on extradition. But CNN's Kara Scannell reported that Mangione is expected to waive this extradition hearing. And then that means that he could be on his way back to New York basically as soon as court is over. So we're going to see what ultimately plays out tomorrow. But this Pennsylvania chapter of this story may conclude tomorrow morning. Kate?",

She's on the righthand side of the screen, and she's wearing this t-shirt. It is the same t-shirt that was worn by both Columbine shooters.

      "sentences": "Well, it's really fascinating that the picture tells us two things, really. The first is that we know she had some familiarity with weapons. We know that her father and his comment to the picture indicated that he and his daughter attended the shooting range frequently. None of that is necessarily nefarious. All kinds of children across the country are taught about firearms by their parents. But nevertheless, it shows a baseline level of familiarization with weaponry.But the t-shirt, I think, is really significant. The chances that her interest in that band, which as you mentioned, is an older actor who was popular long before she was born. The chances that her interest and the interest of the Columbine shooters in the same band is a coincidence I think are infinitesimal. We know that the Columbine shooters are revered by young people who are interested in or focused on the subject of school shootings, certainly the ones who go on to actually commit school shootings. Many of them refer to Columbine. They have a history of researching Columbine. Some of them actually visit the site. So if we find that this t-shirt act is an expression of an interest in and maybe research of those school shooters, that tells us a lot about what she was thinking in the days, months, maybe even longer time period before the shooting took place, that it was a level of premeditation and planning that went into this. So I think it's a very disturbing detail at this point.",
