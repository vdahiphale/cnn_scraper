The Rafah Crossing open briefly Saturday to let this first convoy of humanitarian aid through after days of waiting. UNICEF says it brought in enough water for 22,000 people. But keep in mind, that will last for just one day. And it's far short of the 400 humanitarian trucks the U.N.'s World Food Program says entered Gaza daily before the war. And officials telling CNN the situation in Gaza is catastrophic. People are starving and more supplies need to be allowed in as soon as possible. There were more Israeli airstrikes, shelling, and explosions in Gaza today, including near Rafah. All of this unfolding as tens of thousands of Israeli troops are gathering at Israel's border with Gaza. Israeli military chief of staff telling IDF commanders that the military will enter Gaza and initiate an operation to take out Hamas. So let's go straight to my co-anchor this, our Sara Sidner, who is in Tel Aviv, Israel for us. And, Sara, you've been telling me that it's been very quiet where you are today.",

We are now in exactly two weeks since the October 7th surprise attack. They say that only the issues -- about 3 percent of what is used to get into Gaza before the crisis has been able to make it in. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Hospitals in Gaza are crumbling. Everything is running out, from surgical equipment to medicine. And the tiniest lives are left hanging in the balance. We need power, we need access to clean water, this doctor says. Without basic services, this will be a humanitarian catastrophe. Already seven hospitals and 21 primary health care facilities here are out of service, according to Palestinian officials, because of shortages. After intense diplomatic efforts, prayers of relief at the Rafah Border Crossing as a trickle of aid was allowed in from Egypt. But the 20-truck convoy is only a drop in the ocean of need here, equivalent to just 3 percent of what entered this enclave daily prior to the conflict. More than 200 additional trucks of assistance remain stalled on the Egyptian side according to the U.N., and every hour costs lives. And so far no civilians can leave the enclave. Ten-year-old Palestinian- American Aiden is among those trapped. AIDEN BSEISO, PALESTINIAN-AMERICAN IN GAZA: And we have no place to go. All the streets are bombed. They're literally gone.

We have a team obviously of UNICEF staff in Gaza. And they have been, over the last two weeks, using the (INAUDIBLE) supplies that we had repositioned to re-provision the health centers, keep the only desalination plant that is still working to provide water to go in.But, nevertheless, as you have heard, as we have heard, over one million people have been displaced, 300,000 children displaced. That means that they are not in their homes. And the fundamental needs right now are water, food, and medicine, and fuel. So, for example, in order to live in a healthy community, you should have 50 meters of water a day for drinking and washing and cooking. Right now people are down to less than three liters of water per day. The health center is running out of supplies. We have babies in incubators. And if the fuel runs out those incubators stop working, you can imagine the consequences. We are very concerned. And yes, indeed, some trucks went over the border today. But we are calling very strongly for a sustained humanitarian corridor, that brings supplies in every day. We want all the border points to be open. And if we're talking about that fact we want to be able to ship in the pipeline supplies that we have ready which are water, water system supplies, medicine, medical supplies, and of course other agencies have food and other badly needed commodities for these lifesaving humanitarian response.",

These are numbers that Hamas is spouting out. And I'm old enough to remember just a few days ago when Hamas immediately claimed 500 to 800 people were killed in an Israeli airstrike on a hospital, and it turned out there was no air strike, the hospital wasn't bombed, and the death toll was considerably lower.So if possible let's treat with extreme skepticism what Hamas is claiming. We know that it is waging a war of misinformation in order to gain international sympathy through the media. And we should treat that with all caution. Now, of course, while minimizing threats to our own forces, these are our children who are conscripted at the age of 18 and going into the army to protect their people. Like you say, personally I have many friends who are doing reserves now because they've simply been ripped away from their ordinary lives to guard our borders. We will of course continue doing whatever is necessary to minimize civilian casualties inside the Gaza Strip. Because we don't want more people to be hurt, that's why Israel has been urging civilians to temporarily evacuate for their own safety the areas that are going to see especially fierce fighting. The areas were Hamas has embedded its terrorist infrastructure underneath civilian areas. And it's regrettable that Hamas has been stopping them from evacuating, stopping them from getting out, and there was an interview with Khaled Mashal just the other day on Al-Arabiya in which he said, you know, we're willing to sacrifice our people for the cause of jihad. Now we don't want people to be hurt. That's why we are doing everything that we can to get civilians out of harm's way. But at the end of the day, Hamas, the terror regime backed by Iran, has ultimate responsibility inside the Gaza Strip. It's been the government there for 16 years, and this is just part of the horrible, horrible conditions that we're having to deal with as we advance with this campaign to destroy Hamas, the organization that perpetrated that massacre on the 7th of October, the worst terror attack in world history after 9/11, because we have no choice.

And, of course, in expressing that is on the diplomatic front, we have seen that vocal condemnation, but it has certainly been expressed on the popular front as well.We have seen huge protests taking place across the region here in Amman. We've seen hundreds gathering on a nightly basis on the streets outside the Israeli embassy. Just yesterday, we saw thousands of people participating in a march through downtown Amman, protesting in solidarity with the Palestinian people, calling for an end to Israel's aerial bombardment of the Gaza Strip, and protesting against the humanitarian catastrophe that we are seeing unfolding in the Gaza Strip. Now, of course, it is not just happening in Amman, but this is a cause that is felt very close to home for many here. More than half of the population in Jordan are of either Palestinian or Palestinian descent. We've spoken to people at these marches, who have loved ones, relatives, and family members inside Gaza. They tell us that they're checking their phones every couple of hours, calling them to see if they are still alive. That is the reality for many here in Jordan. And indeed, across the Middle East. We have seen protests erupting in Lebanon, Libya, Egypt, where typically these protests are not sanctioned by the state, yet we saw hundreds gathering in Tahrir Square, a remarkable site there. And they're happening further afield as well, from London to Washington, DC. This is a growing movement in opposition to the situation we are seeing in Gaza. But as many begin to fear that we could see a ground incursion, that will certainly trigger further protests and further popular response to this. But, of course, this has been a situation that Arab leaders have been very vocal about as well. You mentioned the Cairo peace summit. We have some pretty strong words from King Abdullah of Jordan, a key player of course, on the diplomatic front when it comes to trying to find a resolution to this ongoing war and Israel's ongoing aerial bombardment of the Gaza Strip. He condemned the violence that we are seeing both in Gaza and the West Bank as well as in Israel. But he also had these words to say about the situation. He said the relentless bombing campaign underway in Gaza as we speak is cruel and unconscionable on every level. It is the collective punishment of besieged and helpless people. It is a flagrant violation of international humanitarian law. It is a war crime. And this is a sentiment that we have heard echoed by rights groups, by NGOs on the ground, by doctors who are still operating in Northern Gaza, despite the fact that we have heard that evacuation order from the Israel Defense Forces. Doctors from Doctors Without Borders have told us that they refuse to evacuate because they cannot evacuate hundreds of their patients. This is the reality on the ground in Gaza, and this is drawing a fierce response across the Middle East.",

Frankly, I think the IDF is pretty much determined, as you very well know, to enter into Gaza now. It's only a matter of time. But perhaps just signaling to the Israelis that they are prepared, that they are ready, that they are willing to enter into this fight, might perhaps change the intensity and the magnitude of the ground invasion itself.
