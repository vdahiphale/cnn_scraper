So far, the prosecution's star witness has testified about his work for Trump, zeroing in on two instances where he worked with \"The National Enquirer\"'s David Pecker to catch and kill negative stories about Trump. And that includes a false allegation from Trump's former doorman about Trump supposedly having fathered a love child.

With me is CNN legal analyst -- affairs correspondent, the chief, Paula Reid. And CNN correspondent Kristen Holmes is also here. Ladies, I just actually got out of the courtroom. And let me tell you, it was a kind of a surreal moment to see Michael Cohen inside this courtroom with Donald Trump. Obviously, people have been anticipating this. This is the star witness. We have heard so much about him. But what struck me immediately was just how deferential he still seemed, in the sense that he acknowledged it being an honor, he said, to be asked to work for him. He talked about feeling like he's on top of the world when there was praise that was given from Donald Trump. And he was so paced in a way that he did not interrupt the prosecutor, that he was hoping to get every question, answered it directly. He was really, really prepared to have this moment.",

You -- there's a lot of questioning out there throughout the country of how these people stay with Donald Trump, given all the potential legal hurdles they might eventually face. And this is because he somehow has a ability to bring people in to where they feel happy when they get some sort of praise by him. They're looking for the ultimate kind of scrap of acknowledgement. And that's really what you saw from Michael Cohen. But part of that also is the fact that he has to say that, because we have already heard it from other witnesses. Remember, all these other witnesses testified to the fact that Michael Cohen, they were telling Donald Trump he would jump in front of a bus for you. He would take a bullet for you.

      "sentences": "Well, Michael Cohen is on the stand today all morning.And his demeanor has been very measured, very even. He's mostly been looking at the prosecutor when he's answering these questions. He only looked over at Donald Trump when he was asked to identify him. Otherwise, he has been very focused on the prosecutor, speaking very slowly, very in control of the message and the story that he is testifying to. Donald Trump, during his testimony, for the most part has been leaning back in his chair, sitting back with his eyes closed. At times, when text messages were up on the screen, we saw Donald Trump lean in to read some of them and when Michael Cohen had testified about Melania, because one of the questions that he was asked was about making this payment, the \"Access Hollywood\" tape, the news of the Stormy McDaniels story -- the Stormy Daniels story about to become public. And Cohen had said that Trump didn't care what this meant for Melania. He was focused on the campaign. And Trump had made a face kind of reacting to that. That is consistently the types of things we have seen him have more reflexive reactions to during this trial. He had it then. But, for the most part, he has been occasionally passing a note to his lawyer, but really sitting back up with his eyes closed. The question that everyone's kind of doing joking about it is, is he meditating? How is he able to be so kind of in control of himself while this testimony has been taking place throughout this trial? But with Cohen and Trump on the stand, there has not been a moment where it looks like they have made any eye contact. Cohen, entering and leaving the courtroom, has kept his face forward, his eyes kind of looking a little bit around him, but not at all looking the direction of Donald Trump. And Trump, when Cohen is entering, has often been talking to his attorneys, sometimes passing notes to them. So we haven't seen him lock eyes with Michael Cohen. And, right now, the mood in the courtroom is pretty calm. I mean, there was a lot of expectation that maybe Cohen would be more bombastic in his testimony. He has been very measured so far, and so has Trump's reaction up until this point, as we're getting now into the mechanics of this $130,000 payment and some of the testimony that would be the most damaging to Trump and most helpful to the prosecution's case, because Cohen is talking about how Trump wanted him to delay making this payment until after the election, saying that, if he'd drag it out as long as possible, saying, if I win, it's not relevant. If I lose, then I don't even care. But he wanted this payment either to be made to keep the story silent or to drag it out so he didn't have to make the payment at all. And we're just getting to this point of tension here, getting into this. But Cohen has already said several times that Donald Trump was doing this for his campaign, and not his family, which is what the prosecution has to prove in this case, not only that it was falsified business records, but that Trump was doing it to commit or conceal another crime, which they say is related to the election -- Laura.",

That was not the case here. But you're absolutely right. We're getting right into the meat of the matter now of whether or not it's just him suggesting or whether, as he described at the very beginning, Kara, right, his job was to report to Donald Trump, that his job was to ensure that his comforts were first and foremost, no one else's.

One, I think that Michael Cohen's testimony has been quite clear, even following it along with the updates from in court. Laura just said the same. Jurors can understand where he's going. Number two, he has given various accounts of this in various forms in the past, congressional testimony and testimony he's given to investigators. And there's no obvious inconsistency yet at this point, no major inconsistency. And, three -- and this is a classic prosecutorial tactic -- they're backing him up with texts, with checks, with documents, with recordings at every possible turn. Now, the real test, of course, will come on cross-examination. And, to that end, I think where they're going to attack Michael Cohen is say, fine, no -- nobody questions you had a series of texts with Keith Davidson. Nobody questions you had a phone call with Pecker. But the key part of Michael Cohen's testimony, I was keeping Donald Trump informed, that largely rides and falls solely on Michael Cohen's word. So I think that's where they're going to focus on the cross.",

They're not going to be able to establish evidence that there were additional affairs. It's not good for information like that to come in front of the jury, right, because they are hearing all of this, and they are drawing their conclusions about the defendant and these witnesses and so on. Now, to Elie's point, so far Michael Cohen has been quite credible, at least in terms of what the prosecutors needed him to do up until this point. Now, the rubber meets the road in the next portion of his testimony and then in cross-examination. In the next portion of his testimony, that's where it comes in really what happened with respect to Stormy Daniels, how the scheme was structured, what Donald Trump's intention was with respect to the payments, and so on, and then was there -- can he provide any evidence of efforts to falsify business records?
