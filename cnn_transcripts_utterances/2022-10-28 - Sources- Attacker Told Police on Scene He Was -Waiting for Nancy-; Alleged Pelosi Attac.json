He also makes references to Mike Lindell, the MyPillow guy, who has, obviously, been very vocal and spreading election conspiracies, as well. So again, the motive here, at least according to this individual social media footprint, is coming into focus. Police have him in custody. We know that Mr. Pelosi remains in the hospital as well. He is expected to make a full recovery. But has undergone treatment. That, according to our colleague, Jamie Gangel. And finally, as you mentioned, what is so chilling are the words that this suspect allegedly spoke as he entered this residence behind me, \"Where is Nancy? Where is Nancy?\" It appears he was looking for the speaker of the House, encountering her husband who was here, that they engage in some type of altercation. Police arriving and tackling that suspect. Both of them going to the hospital. And the suspect being charged with multiple crimes -- guys?",

I mean, think this has been years, frankly, in the making, of building and building of accelerating political rhetoric and also, political violence.I mean, this is -- these conspiracies already produced violence on January 6th and so it's no surprise that would only continue. Especially because now, the honest truth is that these conspiracies have actually been totally mainstreamed in our political system and this is the consequence of that. It's real. We've heard these warnings not just from people on the outside but also members of Congress themselves who are scared for their wellbeing, and that of their families. Because they are receiving threats, threats that are not just about free speech, that are about people who intend to do them harm. And in this case, someone was injured seriously enough that he was sent to the hospital. It's a real warning sign I think for all of us as a nation.",

And this has been a message, just preserving and fighting for democracy he's been homed in on and focused on with voters and the message he'll be sending as well.

Our reporting is that this individual seemed to have been sharing conspiracies about the last election about -- conspiracies that come out of our politics, about COVID-19, and all of the sort of like rings that emanate from that. The conspiratorial nature of our politics right now is something that is not being condemned by our political leaders. That's the reality of the situation. In fact, especially on the right, they are fueling it. Using the anger and disillusionment of conservative voters to push, you know, their political ends and also to push election lies. And we just have to be up front about the fact that that's happening. It might be advantageous to them in the near term. But in the long term, it's dangerous for everyone. It wasn't just Democrats who are at risk. For example, on January 6th, Republicans were at risk, too. You saw Kevin McCarthy running and hiding, other lawmakers running and hiding from the mob as they breached the capitol. The condemnations should have come years ago, and they haven't. They haven't because, at this moment, it works for them. But there are consequences to it for all of us.",

But I think these fringe voices -- which Abby is so right when she says they have arrived in the mainstream. They've very much part of the mainstream viewpoint. So, no, I don't think rhetoric will change. We only have to wait until the next rally that former President Trump will be doing in the next couple days. But, no, I'd be stunned if rhetoric changes. And it's -- it exists on both sides of the aisle without question. The election denying and conspiracies are coming from one side and they simply are not being denounced. They've -- if you look at candidates up and down the ballot running for secretary of state and other things, they are embracing these. So they are absolutely spinning up people, who once upon a team and there has always been fringe believers, but now they have something to latch on to. But I think the short answer to your question here, the bottom line is, no, I'd be surprised if anything changed.",
