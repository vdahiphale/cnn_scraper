      "sentences": "Hello, I'm Kristin Fisher, and welcome to CNN NEWSROOM.And we begin with this monster winter storm. Its core is hovering over the Great Lakes and its trailing arctic air is causing widespread power outages and dangerous travel conditions just two days before Christmas. Life-threatening wind chills have permeated all the way to the Gulf Coast. Over 70 million Americans are experiencing below- freezing temperatures. That includes the entire state of Texas. This video is from Kentucky where the governor has just confirmed three people have died as a result of the storm. And this from our affiliate WHBQ in Memphis, Tennessee, their high today, 16 degrees. It's usually around 52 this time of year. The city is now enforcing rolling blackouts to reduce the strain on their power grid. And damaging winds have knocked out power to over a million customers nationwide. And look at this. The storm system causing heavy flooding in parts of New England. Just a harrowing sight for a region expected to hit freezing temperatures later tonight. And the FAA is having to issue ground stops at airports that were previously untouched by the forecast. We're going to have much more on that in a moment. But first, we're going to go straight to Chicago now where CNN's Omar Jimenez is at O'Hare International Airport. There's widespread flight cancellations everywhere, but what's the status? How bad is it at O'Hare?",

      "sentences": "Yes, at O'Hare, look, this is one of the world's busiest, so obviously, with a system like this that really came over the Midwest and plains, this is a place it's going to be affected pretty heavily. So, we talked about the total numbers across the country. You've got one of the 4000 cancellations, over 4500 delays.If you just take a look at the board up here in -- at O'Hare, you can see that it lines up largely with the -- what the airport has said. They've seen more than 420 delayed -- cancellations at this point and that their average delay in arrival time is around 35 minutes, which of course, when you think about delays and arrival times, you think about how connections could get disrupted. And then, of course, that could lead to cancellations. We were just talking to a couple a few minutes ago who they had plans to do a big family trip all the way to New Zealand. But, of course, they had to get from Texas up here to Chicago, that Chicago's leg was delayed, they got here, that flight was canceled, they're being rerouted through LA trying to continue on. There's a line downstairs of people who check their luggage in to go for a flight, sat here for hours, and now we're trying to figure out where their luggage actually is. And those are sort of the snippets of what people are dealing with, of course, just days ahead of the Christmas holiday. And, of course, the holiday stretches all the way to New Year's. People are trying to get to either warmer places because we are well into the negatives outside. I'm inside where I don't need a jacket. But well into the negatives outside, so people trying to get to warmer places but more importantly trying to deal with family members in this very important stretch of the year.",

That's all the reason why we felt safe and confident enough to be able to walk down the street because if a car were to come up, it'd be very difficult for us to see it or for them to see us. So, we're obviously keeping a close eye on both streets here.But I have to tell you, we have seen, like I said, perhaps three vehicles in the last hour or so, we've seen some local officials obviously on patrol. But aside from that, it seems that people are certainly getting the message to stay at home. And it's not just for the next few hours but potentially into tomorrow. Real quick. Power outages is a big issue right now here in Erie County, New York. In fact, two warming centers that were set up by authorities even lost power because of these high winds, and with it the risk of downed power lines. And so, they are in the process of relocating some of those folks who are warming up in those warming centers to other locations. But aside from that, county operations here, they're basically frozen, no pun intended, until the conditions could get better and until utility crews can get back out there. We recorded a wind gust of about, close to 80 miles an hour here in Buffalo earlier today. Certainly, you're not going to get crews in those conditions. So, they want to wait for things to calm down, which may not happen until tomorrow evening -- night, maybe even on Sunday on Christmas morning.",

WADE KAPSZUKIEWICZ, MAYOR OF TOLEDO, OHIO: Well, actually what Polo was going through in Buffalo is if nothing else, an interesting lesson in science and geography. Buffalo and Toledo are both on the exact same great lake. Buffalo is on the far eastern tip of Lake Erie, we're on the far western tip. Unfortunately for the folks in Buffalo, that means they get the lake effect snow and we don't as much. We get snow but not nearly. Since we're on the west side of the lake, it's not nearly as bad. So, snow, we feel like we've caught a little bit of a break here. We probably have only had an inch or two of snow. Now, we are dealing with 60-mile-an-hour winds. Temperatures that have dropped dramatically. This time yesterday, it was 45 degrees here in Toledo. Right now, it's four below zero with wind chills. It's as low as 30 below zero in some places.

Completely different story for us in the southeast. Of course, we've got the arctic air, but it's -- the sun is out. But that sunshine is completely deceiving. You know, we're monitoring the temperature here as a -- as a good weatherman should do. It's 20 degrees here in Atlanta.To give you an idea of how cold it is, we brought out a wet towel a couple of hours ago and it's frozen solid, but that gives you any indication of how cold it is out here. Any water that was on the ground, that flash freeze that occurred here, 35-degree temperature drop in eight hours in Atlanta, that froze that water on the roadways. And I could see that myself driving into the CNN Center today. But in Memphis -- in terms of Memphis, the mayor just a couple of hours ago, you know, talking about how the city and the county, Shelby County was going to have mandatory rolling blackouts just because of the strain on the grid. Thanks to this arctic outbreak, of course, that's been paused, but they are asking people to conserve energy. Temperatures in Memphis right now at 10 degrees, but if you factor in the wind, it's negative nine. Now here in Atlanta, this temperature drop was dramatic. And for people who aren't prepared for that, we're talking about frozen pipes and the potential to lose power, of course, not being able to heat your homes as well. So, a 35-degree temperature drop in eight hours is quite impressive. And, Kristin, that cold front is moving to New York, could bring the first flakes of the season to the Big Apple in the next hour or so. Kristin.",

It doesn't just focus on the violence on January 6.I mean, their evidence that they lay out in support of this pretty bold conclusion begins before the election even happens. I mean, they argue that these false claims of a victory that this was all premeditated that the former president was being encouraged to say that he won, even if he didn't. Another really interesting finding is, after the election, this report really gets into a lot of detail about the efforts to pressure state officials. In fact, that this investigation uncovered that the former president and his associates engaged in more than 200 attempts to pressure state officials. They also allege that Trump spearheaded this effort, especially to pressure officials in states that had GOP-led legislatures, including Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Arizona. Now, it moves on to just talk about how these false election claims really spurred many of the president's supporters to the Capitol on January 6 with violence unfolded. And it was interesting to read about what witnesses, people who were inside the White House that day, Kristin, what they told investigators about their observations of the former president as he watched this unfold on TV. And many of them expressed their disgust at the fact that he was not only not calling for help for those in the Capitol but also using his time and energy to tweet against the former vice president. Now, the recommendations here by the committee, including that Trump should never hold office again. And they also want to see reforms to the electoral counting process, which is something that looks like up on Capitol Hill, it might happen. FISHER: So, you just said 200 attempts to pressure state officials. But what does the report say about how the election and state officials were targeted?",

Because it's not just something that's included in the report but this is a specific aspect of this alleged scheme that could have criminal consequences. It's also a reminder that again, this wasn't just confined to what happened on Capitol Hill on January 6. This was something that allegedly took place over months and spanned out across the entire country.",

This is the Milwaukee River. You can see that part of it is frozen and covered in snow but not all of it is frozen. There's some steam rolling off the river right now. That is because the water temperature is actually warmer than how cold it is outside. Now, by the time this is all said and done, we're going to have 86 hours straight with wind chill below zero. The cold and wind are a brutally dangerous combination. You know, we've been driving around outside all day trying to find people, people that are working, those first responders, and everyone's got on multiple layers like I do because this cold weather is just so dangerous. Now, we've had a lot of airport cancellations as well. We've been at Milwaukee's airport for the past few days. 20 cancellations alone today. Some people stranded at the airport for days and unfortunately, we are not finished yet. Christmas morning, it could be negative at 22. It's going to be cold this weekend. So, we are still under that winter storm watch right now. So, we're kind of just waiting for things to get better. But again, the good news, we did not get as much snow as anticipated.
