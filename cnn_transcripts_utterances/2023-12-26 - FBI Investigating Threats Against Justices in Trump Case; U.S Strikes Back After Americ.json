Federal investigators tell CNN they are joining forces with local authorities in Colorado now. This is after a series of reported threats were made against the state's Supreme Court justices who recently ruled to remove Donald Trump from the 2024 GOP primary ballot in Colorado, saying that he was part of an insurrection.CNN's Katelyn Polantz joins us now. Katelyn, what are you hearing about these threats? How specific they are and what the FBI is saying about all of this?",

So, the ruling from these justices in the Colorado Supreme Court to remove Donald Trump from the primary ballot because of his insurrection participation in 2020-'21, that ruling came on Tuesday, and then on Thursday, the Denver police did have to respond to what they said was a hoax report at one of the justices' residences.And so from then, there has also been generally law enforcement looking into the discussion about these justices on online forums, particularly some general discussion among extremists and people who are pro-Trump talking about them. No specific threats to the justices in those forums, from what we understand, but a general violent discourse, something that has been on the rise online, especially through the Trump years and after and especially when there are political cases like these. So, the FBI is now coming in and they say, through a spokesperson, the FBI is aware of the situation and working with law enforcement. We will vigorously pursue investigations of any threat or use of violence committed by someone who uses extremist views to justify their actions regardless of motivation. And this comes just a couple weeks or days after the Justice Department was out there publicly saying that there has been truly an unprecedented rise in the amount of violent rhetoric, especially toward public officials. And we have seen this year many, many threats and arrests of people making threats toward federal judges, toward Supreme Court justices, toward judges involved in Trump cases as well as election workers and members of Congress.

We had very good technical people who could get behind those anonymous postings to the people, to the I.P. address, to the residents. We would go and interview them.Sara, the real problem here is making a case. And if you say, I want the four judges who voted against Trump in this decision to die, and I want them to die soon, under the law, that may not be considered a threat. It's all about context. On the other hand, if you said, I am going to the judges' houses to kill them, that would be a threat under the law. So, a lot of this has to do with going out, finding the people if you can, interviewing them, doing an assessment. Is this person dangerous? But remember what we live through. This is a two-way street. We had a man with weapons show up at a Supreme Court justice, Brett Kavanaugh's house, with a plot to do harm to him. We had a home invasion at Nancy Pelosi's house. Esther Salas, a judge, a federal judge out of Newark in New Jersey, had a man come to her house to kill her, who instead killed her son and wounded her husband. So, when you get behind all of the vitriol and the online language, there is a reality here. Threats against U.S. federal judges are up 100 percent over the last few years, and the U.S. Marshals investigated 4,500 of them last year that they considered serious enough to merit attention.",

Major, thanks for coming in. So, the defense secretary called the strikes necessary and proportionate. What do you see in this attack, though, from this Iran- backed group in Iraq? MAJ. MIKE LYONS (RET.), U.S. ARMY:  Well, it's the first time we've seen them admit that it was a critical injury to a soldier. And I think this is where this situation is escalating. I think you've got to look at the tactical situation on the ground. How does an airbase not have air defenses against the suicide drone attack? So, I think if you're the commander on the ground there, the first thing you want to do is to get those kind of defenses in there to protect U.S. forces, because it must have been very surgical if they knew where these Americans were on that base. Now, you flip the switch, go back to where the attacks, the attacks that we made back on them were their facilities again, the logistics, their capabilities of launching these drone attacks. They were more in Central Iraq too. They weren't anywhere near that airbase. I would argue that we're playing whack-a-mole here, that we've got to go after these troop formations and the leadership. We're going after logistics again, and those logistics can be easily resupplied by the Iranians, which is what they'll likely do.",

Go back to 2020. They have that on their hands already. So, the deterrence is still not there and I get the proportionality piece of it. They don't want things to escalate.

As much as his campaign advisers would want it to be the economy, jobs, foreign policy, he keeps going back to the fact that he honestly is worried that he will end up in jail.

The juxtaposition in my party, we should think about the fact that there are next generation options that we have. Not a single vote has technically been cast yet. And we're very much careening into running somebody who will likely lose head to head to Joe Biden only because he cannot get out of his own way. The messaging, the rhetoric, the extremist policies, we're not really litigating a lot of what he's laid out for a second term agenda yet.

He's doing the groundwork. He's going to have a better showing than people think, but none of the polls show that yet, for sure. And all of the signs that I talk to in folks in the Republican Party, and I think The New York Times and others have seen, is that people are sort of getting off the boat or preparing to get off the boat or looking for other alternatives because this just has not really become anything. I mean, you know, a lot of donors looking to Nikki Haley or looking to other alternatives on the Republican Party. You don't see a lot of enthusiasm for him. I mean, 2023, he entered, you know, winning the governorship in Florida by almost 20. You know, Trump had had a disappointing showing in the midterms with a lot of the candidates he endorsed losing. He then had dinner with Nick Fuentes, a white supremacist. A lot of folks thought DeSantis had a chance in that moment to knock Donald Trump off, but that just has not happened.
