So the workers say they're concerned not just about their own burnout -- that they're being spread thin -- but also about patient health care, right? That's a really big issue.Kaiser Permanente, for its part, says hey, wait a minute -- this is not unique to Kaiser Permanente. So they said in a statement, \"Every health care provider in the nation has been facing staffing shortages.\" They point out that millions of people -- and we can pull up the statement for you -- millions of people have left the health care industry over the Great Resignation. And they say we're not unique to this. Now, in terms of the strike, the company does say we have made contingency plans so that health care doesn't suffer. But I should say this issue of staffing shortages -- it's not just unique to Kaiser Permanente. It's not even just unique to the U.S. because remember over the summer we saw the health care workers in the U.K. also strike. So I should say in the 10:00 hour on \"CNN MAX\" -- a little shameless plug here -- we are going to be talking to the director of the union. And I'm really curious to learn sort of what solutions the union has for these companies because it's a pretty complex issue. You have increased demand because of a -- of an aging population.

Today, the actors' union and major studios are set to resume talks for the first time since the actors went on strike 2 1/2 months ago. It comes one week after the Writers Guild and studios reached a tentative contract agreement. As both sides go back to the bargaining table they're still divided on key issues like streaming revenue share, pay increases, and artificial intelligence.The two strikes have had a huge financial impact. More than 100,000 behind-the-scenes workers have been without jobs. Major studios like Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery, CNN's parent company, have seen their stock prices drop. And analysts say the global box office will lose as much as $1.6 billion in ticket sales.

That's not something writers have to worry about. And then actors also have other unique issues. For example, they want people to be able to do more tryouts in person as opposed to having to do tapes themselves, which they say are more costly, et cetera. HARLOW:  John Oliver has quite a take.

And CNN's chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst, John Miller. Sara, I want to start with you because you spoke exclusively with the stepbrother almost immediately after this happened. How is the family reacting right now? SARA SIDNER, CNN ANCHOR, \"CNN NEWS CENTRAL\":  You know, the first thing is they're extremely frustrated that it has taken 27 years to get to this point. But what gets them even more is that this person has been in the orbit of this investigation for 27 years, since the very beginning. He was questioned by police. He admitted that he was in this car -- the white Cadillac where the drive-by shooting emanated from that killed Tupac Shakur and injured Suge Knight. And so, they can't quite understand why now and why it has taken so long. In his memoir that you just mentioned, the 2019 memoir was published by Duane -- he is known as \"Keffe D\" -- Davis. And in that memoir, he says all these things. He talks about revenge. He talks about the fact that his cousin -- or his nephew, excuse me, had been beaten up by Suge and by Tupac and that they were going to go after them -- that they were looking for them. And here is what he says that really sort of nails this home. He says, \"One of my guys in the back seat grabbed a Glock and started busting back.\" He means firing back. \"First shot skimmed Suge in the head. I thought the mother f-er was dead. As the rounds continued flying, I ducked down so I wouldn't get hit.\" So, Tupac's family cannot understand why this investigation has just now come to the point where this man has now been charged in the killing of Tupac. Listen to what his brother, Mopreme Shakur, had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAURICE \"MOPREME\" SHAKUR, BROTHER OF TUPAC SHAKUR:  He obviously thinks he's innocent. But at the same time, if you're following up on a crime and you have a main suspect, and then this guy who they just indicted has been with him and has been telling the whole -- the same story the whole time for 27 years, why are you just finally now considering that he was so close to the number one suspect? I watch \"LAW &amp; ORDER.\" I'm not a cop.",

On this question of why this wasn't followed up on, a former police detective who had investigated the case before, told CNN Friday that Davis had confessed to having a role in the murder back in 2009. But that confession was under something known as a proffer agreement, which means they couldn't use it against him. Even -- Davis even wrote in his memoir, quote, \"I sang because they promised I would not be prosecuted.\" How does that play into all of this?",

At this point, he has said a lot of things. There's a lot of things out there that he's said in the public view and we'll see where the case goes. Meantime, the family is just -- all these things are coming back. All these hurts. All these frustrations are coming back at this time.",
