All this extra water that we're getting, Kasie. I can tell you for weeks, it's been very dry here; that we've had rain for the last 48 hours. More than seven inches of rain has fallen in the metro Atlanta area. And like he said, there's those active water rescues that are happening right now. We're still trying to get the numbers of how many people have been rescued. Do we know of several different apartment complexes that have been impacted? And of course, we haven't even gotten close to first light yet. And this rain continues to fall. Power outages throughout South Georgia have made things pretty difficult for people in terms of being home, but this storm is really impacting Georgia in a different way. It's not often that the city of Atlanta deals with a tropical storm warning. So now, we're seeing the impact of some gust of winds, power outages, and the heavy rainfall. And the real concern here is the large trees, because they're all over the city. You don't want them falling on power lines or into homes. We know several trees --",

But these, again, are -- are live rescuers in -- in Atlanta here. You know, boots on the ground in -- in these stormwaters, trying to help folks who are trapped. There's the dog. There he is. Very grateful to them. And Ryan, I'm so sorry that I interrupted you. Again, I think it's important to tell our viewers that this is this -- you know, this is ongoing.

As somebody who's lived in this area for quite some time, we know there are several creeks that sort of overflow every time there's a heavy rain. Well, then you have to triple that right now. And then you add on the fact that the storm water drains have to be cleared, because there's always debris in that area. So, the rescues that we've been told have been ongoing.

I'm in Hickory. And we've been seeing rainfall and high winds since yesterday, flooding in the North Carolina mountains as Helene was well offshore. The other thing saying that really sticks out to me is that the Tampa Bay/Clearwater area, the St. Pete area experienced the highest storm surge since 1993, if my facts are correct on that. And this should be a real wakeup call to that area. We have to have serious conversations about the culture of preparedness within our citizenry, particularly on the Florida West Coast. But, you know, right now, FEMA has been well ahead of the storm as Administrator Criswell, you know, had said earlier. They've been pre- deploying teams and equipment, personnel and capability forward and advance of this storms. Most importantly, what they do is, you know, they're putting urban search-and-rescue teams strategically located in areas ready to go for the response side.
