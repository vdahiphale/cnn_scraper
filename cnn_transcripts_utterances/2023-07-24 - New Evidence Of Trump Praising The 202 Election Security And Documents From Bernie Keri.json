It's now a focus of the special counsel as the January 6th grand jury is set to reconvene tomorrow amid growing anticipation that Trump will be indicted.Also tonight, mass protests in Israel as Parliament passes a divisive law to strip the nation's highest court of critical oversight powers. CNN of course is in Jerusalem where the backlash against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his plan are clearly intensifying. And here in the United States there's more breaking news. The U.S. Justice Department just filed a lawsuit against Texas Governor Greg Abbott after the Republican defied a request to remove floating border barriers designed to keep migrants out. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer, you're in \"The Situation Room.\" And let's get right to the breaking news. On a newly revealed focus of Special Counsel Jack Smith and his investigation of 2020 election interference. CNN senior legal affairs correspondent Paula Reid is here with me in \"The Situation Room\" along with CNN national security and justice reporter Zachary Cohen. Zachary first to you, tell us more about this Trump Oval Office meeting back in February 2020 and why it's now all of a sudden becoming a focus of this criminal investigation. ZACHARY COHEN, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY &amp; JUSTICE REPORTER: Yeah, well, remember, this is right at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. And you know, Trump is in the Oval Office with several of his top national security officials who are walking him through how they plan to protect the 2020 election from widespread fraud, all the things that Trump would later go on to baselessly claim were happening. But, you know, at the time, Trump was so impressed with what he was hearing from his top officials that he suggested that the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI hold a press conference in parts so he could take credit for the work they were doing. Now, sources tell us, you know, a few months later, Trump obviously took a very different approach publicly. He was basically claiming that mail-in voting was a source of widespread fraud, that, you know, things like Venezuela was hacking voting machines. All these things that his officials two months later, or previously had told him, were not happening. So, multiple officials, former officials have been asked about this February 2020 meeting where Trump takes a very starkly different perspective on election security than he did throughout the later parts of 2020 and into 2021.",

Now, one of the people on this team was former New York police commissioner Bernie Kerik and his lawyer just handed over all of the work product from that team. And that's significant, Wolf. Much of this has never been seen by investigators because up until now they've tried to assert privilege over this.They've argued that Bernie and others, they were working as part of a legal team so it should be privileged. They kept it from the January 6th committee but it's a little different when Special Counsel Jack Smith comes a calling. He's been in talks with Bernie Kerik to sit down for an interview and as part of those talks, they agreed that they would get the Trump campaign to waive privilege and they handed over, I'm told its thousands of documents. This includes witness statements, research that they did. Now, in addition to these previously undisclosed documents, I'm told that Bernie Kerik has finally scheduled an interview with the special counsel. That'll happen in the next two weeks. But it's a reminder that even if there is an indictment of former President Trump this week, the special counsel's work will continue well into the summer.",

And his attorney, you know, is doing the right thing, checking with the Trump campaign.Curious to me, he's checking with the campaign versus another Trump personal lawyer on the team.

But in a statement from Vanita Gupta, they say this floating barrier poses threats to navigation and public safety and presents humanitarian concerns. Now, Wolf, this is the outcome of Texas Governor Greg Abbott defying a request by the Justice Department to remove these barriers on his own. He said instead today that he would see President Biden in court. Now, the White House has also weighed in on this, calling the Texas Governor's actions on the border, quote, dangerous and unlawful. And to give you some context here, Abbott launched an operation on the U.S.-Mexico border in 2021. And over the last two years, officials within the Biden administration were watching what he was doing, including, for example, sending migrants to Democratic led cities without coordination, as well as having more Texas National Guard and Texas troopers along the Texas-Mexico border. But this really came to a head over the last week when there were concerns about the mistreatment of migrants. And the Justice Department went on to say that there would be an ongoing assessment about that mistreatment. Now that is separate from today's lawsuit, but what it goes to show is that this feud is just continuing to escalate over this very delicate political issue of the handling of the U.S.-Mexico border. And Wolf, I got to tell you, when I talk to officials, it's not just about the mistreatment of migrants that they're concerned about, it's also about interference and federal government operations. Agents over the last month have been sending more and more reports to headquarters about what they were seeing on the border and observing with Texas, which they have historically worked well with when it comes to operations along the Texas-Mexico border. So this political feud, Wolf, really coming to a head in the courts, and we'll see all of that play out over the next few weeks and months when it comes to what happens next with these floating barriers.",

They want him talking to people that traditional retail politics that they really have come to expect in these early states like Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina. And all of this is happening as we got some new state polling from \"Fox Business\" yesterday that really gives us a nice snapshot of where things are. And if you take a look in Iowa, former President Donald Trump is just up there very high, leading the pack. And then some 30 points behind is Governor Ron DeSantis and the others. It's a similar situation in South Carolina. And what this tells us, Wolf, is that these candidates have got to find a way to break through. And so far, that's not happening. When you look at that polling, a lot of them looking to that debate stage, we're now about one month out from that first Republican debate where they think they can break through.",

How confident are you, Governor, that you will be on the stage in Milwaukee? ASA HUTCHINSON (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Actually, a growing confidence because some momentum has shifted our director, you know, you've had the \"Fox Business\" poll. And we also had additional poll that came out today, the Rasmussen poll. And it's my understanding that that actually will put us as qualifying for the debate in terms of the polling numbers, and that was a significant boost for us. We still have to meet the objective of the donor qualification, which is 40,000 unique donors. We're not there yet. I fully expect to be there. We're working every strategy to make sure we have those individual donors for that debate stage. And of course, Asa 2024 is where you go to make sure that we can qualify.",

It's a state very similar to Arkansas in terms of the importance of small communities, the importance of the agricultural community. I relate there. I look forward to campaigning there.
