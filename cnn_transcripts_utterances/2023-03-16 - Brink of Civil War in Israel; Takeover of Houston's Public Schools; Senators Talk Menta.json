Opponents say that would undermine completely any checks and balances in Israel. Protesters even painted a red line on the road leading to Israel's supreme court. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu just rejected a compromise proposal from Israel's president, Isaac Herzog, who is warning that this country is on the brink of civil war. You cannot overstate the significance of this in the region and for the world.Our Hadas Gold is live in Jerusalem. Hadas, you're in the middle of the protest. What can you tell us?",

One of dozens of protests today, what's been deemed a day of disruption.It's been almost three months long now of hundreds of thousands of Israelis taking to the streets on a regular basis to protest against this judicial overhaul. I have to say, it's probably one of the longest and largest such demonstrations in Israeli history. The protesters here today, they are young people. They say that they are worried about what this judicial overhaul would mean for their future, for the protection of minorities, for the independence of the judiciary, because this overhaul would allow the parliament to overturn supreme court decisions and would drastically change how judges are chosen. But supporters of the reform say that it's needed to help rebalance the branches of government. And, as you noted, the Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, laying out a compromise proposal, warning that the country is potentially on the brink of civil war because of the divisiveness over this issue. Take a listen. PRESIDENT ISAAC HERZOG, ISRAEL (through translator): I'm going to use a phrase I haven't used before. An expression that there is no Israeli who is not horrified when he hears it. Whoever thinks that the real civil war of human lives is a limit that we will not reach has no idea. Precisely now, in the 75th year of the state of Israel, that this is within touching distance.
