FREEMAN (voice-over):  A police dog with the U.S. Border Patrol tactical unit, named Yoda, was released on the armed fugitive.

Failing to do so would put thousands of federal employees out of work and put significant pressure on the U.S. economy.Our next guests -- they are pushing bipartisan legislation to end the government shutdowns altogether. There's an actual legislative solution here that they've put forward. Joining us now, Sen. James Lankford, a Republican from Oklahoma. And, Sen. Angus King, an Independent from Maine who caucuses with the Democrat. Senators, I appreciate your time. I want to dig in on the bill in a second. But just to start with the idea, Sen. Lankford, that right now you guys -- this isn't a new thing -- neither the countdown clocks towards a shutdown nor this legislation. You've proposed this several times. You guys have been talking about this on a bipartisan basis for several years now. Do you feel like this moment is different because it seems like some of your colleagues in the House aren't just considering a shutdown; some of them seem to actively want it at this point. SEN. JAMES LANKFORD (R-OK):  Yeah, I don't know that anyone really wants a shutdown. We do want a solution to some of the issues that are going on, especially debt and deficit. All of us see the debt and deficit issue and we're always looking for what is the moment that we can actually address this accelerating debt and deficit. But this is an issue on ending government shutdowns. We've talked about it for a long time. We do need to have the debate and debt and deficit. We do need to do the hard work of that, but we don't need to have a government shutdown. We have government workers that are not getting a check. We have chaos across the country as people can't call federal agencies. It actually spends more taxpayer money than it saves by any -- by a far amount. So it's wasteful on the taxpayer, it's difficult on the federal workers, and it's difficult on the American people. Let's have the debate on debt and deficit but let's hold the American people harmless in the process.",

Everybody says yeah, that's a great idea, and then it never kind of moves forward.Why do you think that this legislation -- this proposal hasn't gained traction after the eventual solving of the shutdown problem? SEN. ANGUS KING (I-ME):  Well, I think the problem is we get through a shutdown and everybody sort of relaxes and says oh, that's done and we'll move on. The reality is this is becoming a regular occurrence and, as James Lankford said, it's very damaging to the economy. Thousands of jobs in Maine -- people aren't there to answer the phone. Mortgages went down 13 percent during the last shutdown because there wasn't anybody there to process the federal piece of the mortgage -- of the mortgage process. So it has a really serious impact. We're -- we believe that this may be a moment when people are going to start taking a solution seriously. And what we're basically proposing is that there's no travel money.
