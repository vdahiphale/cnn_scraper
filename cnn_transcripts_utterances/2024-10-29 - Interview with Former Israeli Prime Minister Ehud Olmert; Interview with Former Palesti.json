Writer George Packer tells Walter Isaacson the three factors that will decide the election. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. We have nothing to help but our bare hands, those words of utter despair in Gaza after a strike on a multi-story building this morning killed almost a hundred people, the health ministry there says. Palestinians at the scene said bodies were everywhere, some being buried immediately in makeshift graves because official burial places are too dangerous to access. More than a year of war in Gaza and now in Lebanon has killed tens of thousands of people. And although ceasefire talks are once again underway, a breakthrough seems unlikely. On Sunday, Egypt had reportedly proposed a two-day ceasefire only for Prime Minister Netanyahu's office to say they had received no such proposals. Moreover, according to Israeli media, Netanyahu's defense minister, Yoav Gallant, has warned that his boss -- he's warned his boss that the war is lacking in strategy and needs a reset. Amid all of this, an unlikely pair, two former senior officials, Israeli and Palestinian, are proposing what they argue is a way out of war. Ehud Olmert served as prime minister of Israel while Nasser Al-Kidwa was foreign minister for the Palestinian Authority. And together, they formulated an outline for peace, which they proposed here in London over the weekend. So, gentlemen, welcome to the program. I mean, I'd really like to start by acknowledging the extraordinary situation that we have with you two sitting here together, an Israeli official, a Palestinian official at a time when war is raging, and nobody seems to be able to talk to each other. So, since you're here, Prime Minister, just give me -- before we get to the nitty gritty, why have you decided this now?",

There is no question about it. They did something absolutely terrible. And there was -- it was an inevitable reaction that Israel had to make. But we achieved most of what we can achieve in the military operation. We destroyed the Hamas, we destroyed the tunnels, not 100 percent of them, but enough. We destroyed their weapons, their rockets, their bunkers, their command positions, everything. Now, what happens is that we lose Israeli soldiers, we lose innocent Palestinians living in the Gaza embedded with the Hamas and, of course, it is a main reason for the growing number of innocent civilians being killed, but we are not going to get back the hostages if we will not stop the war. And the time is to stop it today, right now, and to make an agreement that will bring back the hostages There will be Palestinian prisoners released, no doubt. And then, we will have to pull out from Gaza altogether. And there will be a military force and an administration force. Two different things. They will take over Gaza and they will provide for the security that there will not be any further military terrorist attacks from Gaza to the State of Israel. And then, the question remains, what are we going to do with 6 million Palestinians? This is a question that we have to ask, not Dr. Al-Kidwa. He sure has this question from his side, but from our side, what are we going to do with 6 million Palestinians? We have to find a solution. Now, there is not any solution other than a two-state solution. And that's what we, based on what I have proposed to Abu Mazen in 2008 when I was prime minister, that's what we have to do now. We have to try and bring it back to the center stage, to the international discourse, to the ministries, prime ministers, governments everywhere to bring it back and deal with it.",

I know that Israel and the government has issues, but on the issue of humanitarian aid, the United States, for instance, has said, gave Israel a deadline, if you don't allow humanitarian aid in within 30 days, then we might have to reconsider the terms of us giving you weapons.

So, whether it is done through UNRWA or whether it is done in a different way, it's a minor issue as long as we do it. OK?

I wonder whether you also feel the same way about, you know, former or current leaders on the Palestinian side, whether it's Hamas, what have they done to their own people, whether it's the P.A., which hasn't been able to do much, frankly, and hasn't done much and is terribly divided, and whether you think there is any constituency for the bold plan that you two are trying to, you know, put front and center now? AL-KIDWA:  Yes. Listen, there is no doubt that we need a real and serious change of leadership on both sides. This government -- this Israeli government has to go and this Palestinian leadership have to go. And of course, we are going to have different situation in Gaza in terms of the governmental structure responsible for the situation there. So, there is no doubt about that. What Ehud Olmert is saying is really good. It's something that I'm proud of. I thank him for. The problem is that the Israeli government thinks otherwise and does things differently. So, if we take UNRWA, for instance, I think the problem for the government is not what some very few employees of UNRWA might have done, but I think the real goal is to destroy UNRWA for political reasons, for what it represent as an organization, take care of Palestinian refugees. Same thing about Gaza. Of course, Hamas did things that the Israelis want to punish Hamas for, there is no doubt about that. But, you know, the amount of destruction, the total destruction of Gaza that has been happening, the amount of killing the amount of injuring that took place is beyond belief, and I think it goes beyond the announced goal of destroying Hamas or punishing Hamas. It goes, I think, to the point of punishing the Palestinian people generally, and especially those who live in Gaza.

Abu Mazen rejected it last time. Why do you think it has any more currency now? Dr. Al-Kidwa. AL-KIDWA:  I don't think that Abu Mazen rejected the plan, by the way. I think Abu Mazen did not accept the plan, and that is bad enough. So, there is no need to create things that do not exist. And yes, of course, the -- what we are proposing is very similar to what was proposed and negotiated between the two sides and almost reached an agreement then. I hope that they had reached that agreement. Unfortunately, it was not done. You know, we agree -- I agree. We didn't invent the wheel -- I mean, the way forward is known. We need to stop the war in Gaza and we say how. And we need to have an overall, solution political solution in the form of two states, Israel and Palestine living side by side on 19th civil border with some swap off territory to solve big part of the problem of settlements.

So, that's about six months ago. It was the height of the summer. There were all sorts of, not just the killings from the military offensive, but also there was lack of water, lack of food, the heat, I guess, was causing, you know, its own diseases and things. Can you just walk us through what you had to deal with and what Gaza was dealing with last time you were there? DR. ATTAR:  I mean, I'm lucky that I get to come home to Chicago. But one day in June, we had 350 people killed and about 700 wounded in one hour. And the hospitals were just overrun. And the local Gazan staff, I mean, we worked for three nights straight. We did about 60 surgeries in three days. Many of the staff just -- they slept in the operating rooms on the floor, getting maybe two hours of sleep, if they were lucky, here and there. And that wasn't even including -- those were just all injuries from explosions. So, it was just amputation after amputation after amputation.' I remember there were these two kids, one we had to do an immediate amputation through his hip joint, and we didn't have enough blood to transfuse. So, he -- all we could do is just sit back and watch him die because we didn't have enough blood to transfuse and his brother was in the next operating room. He died for the same reasons, we didn't have enough blood. And then, the next day, we treated a 13-year-old kid. He lost his parents in an explosion, and he had a shrapnel body, a charred face. We amputated his leg and we could still smell the burnt flesh as we were operating. And those were just the injuries. That didn't include all the patients that were in the hospital from starvation or malnutrition, just due to lack of food and lack of water. So, every day felt like a horror show. Every day, my scrubs were soaked in blood. Every day just felt unsustainable and unbearable, but it didn't feel like it was ever going to end. But, you know, the local Palestinians, they have to live this. They've been living this way for over a year. You know, volunteers like us, we get to go home.",

We've seen these really horrible pictures of citizens of this building in Jabalya, and we're going to put it up, who were ordered to evacuate via the Red Cross help. And men, women, and children left the building. And then, the women were sort of told to move on with the children and their belongings and the men were stripped and basically gathered in a group and the picture's been verified. And we hear from one of the men who's 27 years old that they just didn't know quite what to do. They decided they had to -- here's this picture -- remove themselves, their kids and try to get out of it. But look, there's old people in this picture. There's young kids in this picture. What have you -- did you ever come across that, these men who were sort of separated and then sent through, I guess, metal detectors or whatever it might be, but kind of humiliated the way they're sitting there in the cold and the freezing cold now? DR. ATTAR:  Yes, every hospital I worked at, you'd meet a doctor or a nurse, a local Palestinian doctor or a nurse that had been through that. I met -- I remember, one orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Obeid (ph), in Awda Hospital, I don't know where he is or what happened to him, but I worked with him, I saw him save a lot of people, but he also had a story, too, of hospital being raided, and they were -- all the males were stripped and handcuffed.

It is a majority Latino city with one of the largest Puerto Rican communities in America. Correspondent Kristen Holmes is at the Trump rally site. Kristen, welcome to the program. And amidst all of this backlash and amidst the seriousness of the stakes in Pennsylvania, what are people there telling you, particularly in the wake of that Madison Square Garden rally? KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, where we are right now, Christiane, I mean, this is an area where people are here to see the former president. So, everyone that we are talking to is excited to see the former president. They have shown up here to talk to him today. We haven't had a chance to go outside of this bubble, given all of the security. But I will tell you, Donald Trump's campaign is seriously concerned about whether or not there is going to be real backlash. Now, Donald Trump, obviously, this is not his first time, or even second time, third or fourth addressed with controversy. So, his team was hoping this would kind of go away at some point, but it just really hasn't. And Donald Trump tried to address this with an ABC reporter. This was their version of him talking about these comments. And what he said exactly, and I'll read it to you. He said, I don't know him. This is about the Puerto Rico comments. Someone put him up there. I don't know who he is. When given the chance to actually denounce these comments about Puerto Rico, he didn't take that opportunity. I was told that conversation was supposed to be his response to those comments that were made. Instead, it kind of seems like a vague disassociation with what happened. Obviously, Donald Trump wasn't the one who made these remarks. But when I reached out to another campaign source asking how they felt about being in Pennsylvania, they could rattle off the statistics of Latino voters in the area that we are, the amount of voters that were Puerto Rican. So, they're clearly tracking this very closely. They've also -- they enlisted the shadow senator from Puerto Rico to speak at Allentown because of this. They're trying to do this outreach. But a lot of the people who are publicly speaking out against these comments, they want to hear from the former president himself.",

Once a thriving community of mostly Democratic union workers, the population has now dwindled. And though an influx of Haitian immigrants is revitalizing the town, they're being blamed for its troubles and they're being targeted by Trump's lies.

One was that its famous Pyrex factory, which has been making glassware since the 1890s, was going to shut down and move some of its operations to Ohio. 300 plus good union jobs were going to disappear from a town that had been losing industrial jobs for 50 years. So, it was just one more blow to a declining industrial town on the Monongahela River. The other Charleroi story was that Donald Trump found out about Charleroi and learned that 2,000 Haitian immigrants had arrived over the past few years to a town that had really declined all the way down to about just 4,200 people. So, it was a pretty significant increase. And he began saying in speeches that Charleroi is being destroyed by the Haitians, that crime was rampant, the town was bankrupt. How do you like your beautiful Charleroi now? So, I thought, well, these two things are both crucial elements of the election. One is about immigration and about demagoguery and the other is about decline and inequality and the Rust Belt. So, I thought I should go there and see what it's really like.",

Charleroi was a Democratic town until roughly 2016, it may have begun to turn red earlier, but 2016, I was told, was a big turningpoint when Trump began to articulate the anger at trade deals, at immigration, at other forces, globalization that were -- that people there felt were responsible for the decline of the town. So, Democrats and unions were the voice of workers in a place like that until, I would say, the 1990s when NAFTA and the forces of globalization and the new Democrats under Bill Clinton really lost the voice to speak for those workers, stopped seeing them, you could say. And the workers felt that maybe there's no difference between the two parties. That's what happened over the last 30 years. And Democrats lost their standing as the champions of the working-class. And so, people in a place like Charleroi who no longer hear it from the Democrats, who hear instead that the party is becoming the party of the college educated, they look to the Republicans who may not be doing anything economically to help them, but who are at least giving them scapegoats and culture war issues that they can blame for their troubles.",

There's a whole new population of taxpayers working in rather low wage jobs that American workers basically didn't want, like in food preparation factories. There's bakeries and markets opening, there's entrepreneurship, there's life. And I was told by the borough manager and the borough council president that this was just a great gift to Charleroi, to find that a younger population was coming, was working, was working hard and the workers at the Pyrex factory said they had about half a dozen Haitians working there and they were the hardest workers at the factory, even as those same people were complaining about schools and traffic and things like that.",

He's only 40. He's a Navy veteran. He's a lawyer. He's very well educated. Very thoughtful. But he has staked his political fate in a district that's quite even, and where he might not win re-election. It's one of those 50/50 districts that have become so rare. He stakes his future on a return to a Democratic message that we are with the workers, we don't want corporations to be raiding our towns and our factories, stripping them for assets, and then moving on and leaving behind broken lives. And that's -- it's a strong message that he tries to hit home, going door to door in speeches, et cetera. One thing that happened in his district was that train derailment in Ohio, it was just across the border from his district and some of the chemical gases spread into his area. And he has made regulation of rail freight one of his signature issues, and has sort of use that as a way of saying, so, Republican Party, are you prepared to regulate rail freight or are you going to go with what your donors in the Koch Brothers Network want you to do, which is to keep it deregulated? So, that's a sort of economic message that doesn't really address immigration head on, but that essentially tries to say there are larger reasons for your troubles than these 2,000 hardworking immigrants in your town. There are much bigger forces at work, let's pay attention to them and not scapegoat people who are really simply trying to live the American dream here.",

Josh Hawley of Missouri is another. And it's sort of a submerged part of Trump-ism. Trump talks that way when it suits him, but when he's in power, what does he do? He cuts taxes for corporations and rich people. And the question is whether the Republican Party is serious about actually defending the economic interests of the working-class, or if they're using it as a way to turn their party into a working-class party, which many Republicans want without ever really shedding the legacy of the small government, low tax, low regulation, Reagan, Republican Party. And the other half of that question is whether the Democratic Party is capable of reclaiming that mantle after years and years of becoming the party of the professional class, which doesn't really see places like Charleroi at all and has forgotten about them.",

      "sentences": "I think it's been happening for several decades on the Democratic side with Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama was another meritocrat whobelieved in the meritocracy and in the value of higher education. And on the Republican side, it was a revolution with Trump. It happened in 2016. Until then, the Reagan dogma had held the party in its grip and nothing else really could get through. So, we now have a Republican Party that claims to speak for workers, and it is winning working-class voters from all races. That's a big change that's happened in the last cycle or two. And it has kind of defied the norms of American politics. Black voters voting for a Republican is not something that was supposed to happen. It's happening. It's a big problem for Democrats, and Latino voters in even greater numbers. But as I said, I am skeptical that the Republican Party is prepared to use government, because that's what we're talking about. This -- the anti- government gene is so strong in the Republican Party that to use government and to govern well rather than simply tearing down the administrative state in order to bring jobs, to bring chip making and manufacturing and green energy jobs to places like Charleroi, or to keep the jobs that are there, the few industrial jobs that are still there, and to support unions, because those are the voices of workers. I'm very skeptical. I just think it goes against too many of the interests of the Republican Party, too many of its reflexes, too many of its donors. So, I think, in a way, the working-class is up for grabs and I don't see either party claiming it. I don't see either party being able to make it a true realignment, which would last for a generation or two. That to me is where American politics is going to be played out, which party can claim to speak for people who work for a living and make an hourly wage. And right now, I think it's up in the air. And I don't see either party making its claim in a way that's going to last as a realignment.",

Trump was a New York celebrity and a TV star and had begun to make a name for himselfas a denier of Barack Obama's citizenship, a birther. He's not in the book. But Trump-ism is in the book. The landscape that Trump walked out onto and claimed is in the book, because it's about communities that are in decline, institutions that are failing to support the people they're supposed to support. It's about loneliness, how Americans seem to be trying to make it in -- against the odds without any help from either government or union or church or corporation. So, I wrote it in places similar to Charleroi, like Youngstown, Ohio, which is a more -- a bigger and more dramatic example of industrial decline. It wasn't hard to find people who said the middle class is gone, the game is rigged for the elites and the powerful, and my children are not going to have as good a life as I had. Those became the mantra that I heard over and over. And did I hear that in Charleroi? That's all I heard in Charleroi. So, of course, Charleroi is not Seattle or Washington or Austin, Texas, the country is regionally dividing dramatically into the Charlerois of America and the Austins of America. And that in itself, to me, is part of our unwinding. We don't feel that we belong to the same country. We don't -- people of different parties don't feel they belong to the same country. And our elites in media and politics seem to have figured out that the best way to get ahead and make a name and make money is by feeding that, not by trying to overcome it, but by feeding it.
