Good to have you both with us this morning. So let's start with you, Mia Love. As we look at those comments, look, we know and I'm sure you know all too well, politicians can change. You can call it flip flopping, you can call it a change, call it whatever you want, it does happen. Does it strike you at all that there is no comment on this from the governor's office?

And so it's interesting that he didn't really want to answer a question about this, which would suggest maybe he hasn't evolved or changed on it, but he also recognizes the political peril of doubling down on it, because this just isn't an issue. It's not a winning issue politically.I also think that there are ways to deal with Medicare that don't involve private -- privatizing it, which is what he's suggesting. So it's essentially saying, let's just throw everything, you know, into the market and not -- you know, he talks about how the free market should be handling this, which is very perilous, right? It's not a guarantee. And so what people like about Medicare, what people like about Social Security, which he also mentioned, is that it's guaranteed it's not -- it's not dependent on what the markets are doing.

So you'd have to assume there's going to be dozens and dozens of cases where these officers were involved. Other officers who we don't even know that are under investigation by the Memphis Police Department and could potentially be terminated. But anything associated with this unit now, any arrest or anything that they were involved in, is going to fall under some kind of scrutiny certainly within the justice system, and by defense attorneys whose clients have been arrested by anyone in this unit in Memphis. So, you know, after some time, finally the district attorney announcing that they're going to review cases specifically tied to these five officers, but it's no doubt, guys, I think it's going to grow as we learn more about these officers, as we learn about other officers who were involved in the arrest.
