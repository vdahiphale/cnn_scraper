The GOP race of the Granite State thought to be a two person affair, Donald Trump and Nikki Haley. If Trump becomes the first non-incumbent Republican to win both the Iowa caucus and an open New Hampshire primary, he will be the de facto nominee of his party. But New Hampshire could prove more hospitable for Haley. It's less evangelical, and home to more libertarians and Independents. So Haley is all in and so too are many institutional forces, which see time running out to stop Trump. But are some of those efforts backfiring? Mark Halpern in his Wide World of news newsletter regularly chronicles this phenomenon which he calls \"the sad irony of those members of the media and the Democratic Party who most worried about a Trump second term acting in ways that actually make it more likely he will win.\" Here's an example, on Monday MSNBC had the kind of all-night extensive coverage of the Iowa caucus that we've come to expect of cable outlets, but when it came time for Trump to make his acceptance speech, the network didn't air it. Instead, Rachel Maddow said this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RACHEL MADDOW, HOST, MSNBC'S \"THE RACHEL MADDOW SHOW\": At this point in the evening, the projected winner of the Iowa caucuses has just started giving his victory speech. We will keep an eye on that as it happens. We will let you know if there's any news made in that speech, if there's anything noteworthy, something substantive and important. The reason I'm saying this is, of course, there is a reason that we and other news organizations have generally stopped giving an unfiltered live platform to remarks by former President Trump. It is not out of spite, it is not a decision that we relish, it is a decision that we regularly revisit. And honestly, it is not an easy decision. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

This followed allegations by one of Trump's codefendants, Mike Roman, indicted for his role in the fake elector's plot that Willis is in a romantic relationship with Wade, an outsider lawyer and former judge who she hired to manage the case for which he's been paid more than $600,000 despite never previously having tried a felony criminal case in Georgia. The judge ordered Willis to file a written response by February 2 and to appear at the February 15 hearing, which will be televised.

This is something that is seen as something serious. They've also made specific allegations that Nathan Wade may not have been properly hired, that it didn't go through the proper hiring process, and therefore may not have been legally sworn in as a special prosecutor. Now, that starts to be a problem when you talk about the role that the special prosecutor played.Also, are there any violations of the State Bar of ethics here? Those will all come out in that court hearing. And so, we're just not there yet. But it has really up into the momentum that Wade and Willis and their entire prosecution team had going into this. This had felt like a very buttoned up case, they had gotten all of the indictments they were seeking from the special grand jury, a lot of that had to do with Nathan Wade's work. And then they've also gotten four plea agreements. So it was something that felt like it was moving along really quickly and very successfully for the prosecution.

So far, No Labels has gained access in 14 states including key battlegrounds such as Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina, worth 123 Electoral College votes.
