But now this 60-day truce is set to take effect in a matter of hours that will see the withdrawal of Hezbollah forces from Southern Lebanon, up to some 20 miles north of the Israel-Lebanon border. Israel will also withdraw its forces, which have been along some of the first lines of villages in Southern Lebanon for just over a month- and-a-half at this stage now. And the Lebanese military then moving into those areas and will then monitor and enforce this ceasefire going forward. And it is expected to build into a lasting truce if indeed the two sides can get there. And there is, of course, a major question mark over that, especially as the Israeli prime minister insists that Israel will have the right to enforce any violations it sees itself. Listen.

He actually went to a meeting with the Israeli prime minister this evening as the Israeli cabinet was about to convene to vote on this matter. He said that it was a very contentious meeting that he didn't leave any more convinced about the safety of his community of following the ceasefire agreement following his discussions with the Israeli prime minister. What is clear is that, for now, before that agreement goes into place, Northern Israel and Southern Lebanon remain a very dangerous place, as the Israeli military continues to conduct airstrikes in Southern Lebanon, also just now issuing evacuation orders for the southern suburbs of Beirut.

      "sentences": "Well, I think I'd say a few things about that. First and foremost, as your opening indicates, none of this was inevitable. It was not inevitable that this deal would come together. And it was, in many ways, the persistence of President Biden, of our diplomatic team and of negotiators from the two countries involved that led to this moment.But there were predictions that this conflict could go on for months, even for years. And so, fundamentally, this is a far better outcome than I think many predicted. Second, and this is really important, this is a good day for the people of Israel and the people of Lebanon. Notwithstanding the comments that you read earlier, this gives at least the prospect of people who have been driven from their homes by the fighting, hundreds of thousands of people on both sides of what's called the blue line that separates Israel from Lebanon now have the chance to return to their homes. And that is not a small thing, but implementation of this agreement will be key. And we will be very vigilant to any attempts to disrupt what the two parties have committed to as part of this process today. And then third, and I think this is also important, and the president really underscored it in his remarks, we are going to test whether this creates space for further progress either towards a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza, and towards the broader effort toward regional integration ultimately, including normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia that the president and our team have been working on for many months, including long before October 7th. We are going to test that proposition and see how far we can take this momentum. MARQUARDT: I do want to ask you about Gaza in just a second, but I want to get your reaction to some comments from Trump's incoming national security adviser, Congressman Mike Waltz. He just tweeted that, quote, everything is coming to the table because of President Trump. To what extent do you think that is true, that Trump played a big role here and the Israelis being willing to make this deal now with Hezbollah?",

I won't say too much about this, but I heard lots of predictions that this deal would not come together because perhaps the government of Israel or the government of Lebanon would only want to do this deal in the context of a new administration, in the context of after the transition. Actually, the opposite ended up taking place. Now, you're reading me a comment that suggests actually the deal only took place now because there's going to be a new administration.Frankly, I don't put a lot of credence in either of those views. I think this deal was the result, as I indicated, of some incredible persistent diplomatic work by our government, by the other governments involved. And, fundamentally, I think it's also important to point out that the threat that Israel faced across the border that Hezbollah unleashed on Israel on October 8th, the day after the October 7th Hamas attacks, and that Israel has faced ever since then, Israel dramatically diminished throughout the course of recent weeks. And I think that work backed by the United States is a big part of why we got to this agreement today.",

Nothing in this agreement reduces Israel's ability to defend its sovereignty, its people from the threat that still exists, by the way, across the border, even though it has been diminished. And the United States will continue to stand up for that, notwithstanding this agreement, which we believe fundamentally makes both countries safer and the people on both sides of the blue line much safer than they were before today.",

But Israel also faced a horrific threat across its border, a threat that, in this case, it did not provoke. That threat came to Israel on October 8th in the aftermath of the October 7th attacks, when Hezbollah chose, it's stated in solidarity with Hamas to begin attacking Israel and Israel ended up being compelled to defend itself.So, I'm not going to get into the puts and takes of who did what to whom during the course of this conflict, certainly not on the day in which a deal has been reached to resolve it. I acknowledge very much so that there has been horrible suffering in Lebanon and in Israel. And we're very glad that as of 4:00 A.M. local time tonight, that that suffering should be brought to an end and we will be working on implementation of this deal.",

Actually, I think the reaching of this deal, the conclusion of this deal further isolates Hamas.And so what we will be testing is whether that leads to a negotiating position that can allow us to finally reach an end to the war in Gaza through the only way that we believe it can ultimately end, which is a diplomatic agreement that leads to a ceasefire and a deal that gets the hostages home at long last. They have been gone far too long. As I think everybody knows, Hamas, unfortunately, has been refusing to engage in recent weeks, perhaps in the hope again that the distraction of the Israeli military or the eruption of these other conflicts would take the pressure off of it. I think, definitively, it is clear today that that is no longer going to be the case. And so we will see whether this creates the space and the momentum to try to get a deal there too.",

He first goes for the chaos before the real solution. And to me, it also demonstrates that he doesn't really understand what the solution is. He doesn't understand immigration policy. He doesn't understand drug policy. It's a huge demand here in the United States for fentanyl, and that's why a lot of it keeps coming over. And there's also a huge demand for workers.

Now, it's not unusual for state authorities to work with federal authorities along the border. That has happened for years. But this operation went a step further and the federal government so that they were ultimately disrupting what they were doing at the border. Of course, this included busing migrants to Democratic-led cities, blocking a part of the Texas-Mexico border to federal agents, and also setting up those buoys in the Rio Grande. And that also resulted in lawsuits by the Justice Department.

And we need to make sure that we're living up to those values equally to all of our partners and countries around the world.And so I don't think we should be sending offensive weapons until we get, you know, ceasefire agreements in Lebanon, in Gaza, until we make sure that the Israelis are actually operating in the same way to protect civilian harm that we would. And a lot of our documents show that has not been the case. In fact, we're still seeing not enough aid going into Gaza. And I have real concerns about that and real concerns what our continued support for offensive weapons means moving forward. Now, that doesn't mean that we shouldn't support Israel. I think we should continue defensive weapons, Iron Dome, all of that. But we should be more sort of strategic about how we're engaging in this partnership.",
