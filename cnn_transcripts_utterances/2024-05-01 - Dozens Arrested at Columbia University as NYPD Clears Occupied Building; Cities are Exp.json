CATHERINE CORTINOVIS, LA SAMARITAINE RESIDENT (through translation): Welcome. The first time I saw it, I was so emotional that I burst into tears. BELL (voice-over): And this is the building she was able to move into. Reopened amid great pomp in 2021 after some 16 years of renovation, the Samaritaine is one of the French capital`s most iconic spots for luxury shopping and dining, not to mention its five-star hotel. But the Samaritaine was also obliged, as part of its reconstruction, to include 96 apartments for the city of Paris to let at modest rates.",

If you want Paris to stay a living city with people inhabiting in the city, you must develop a lot of social holdings. BELL (on camera): Across Europe, there`s a danger of cities turning to museums and ordinary people being pushed out. But here in Paris, there`s the added particularity that this was a city entirely redesigned in the mid-19th century. And that`s exactly what gives it its beauty, but also what makes it difficult for the city to adapt to the needs of the 21st century. (Voice-over): Already, it is one in nine Parisians that benefits. People like Zina, whose place in the Samaritaine development allows her to live close to the Central Paris hospital where she works. ZINA HADJAB, LA SAMARITAINE RESIDENT (through translation): As they say, it`s an open-air museum, it`s pleasant. It`s really a good place to live. BELL (voice-over): An open-air museum that is now seeking to help those who keep at schools and hospitals running to be able to benefit from them too. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

This is the much talked about Xiaomi SU7. Yes, it has an aerodynamic design. It can accelerate very quickly. Its battery can take you for about 500 miles. But, its most distinct point is this touchscreen. You can use it to control almost whole aspects of your life. It can turn the lights in your home on and off. It can even start the coffee maker. This isn`t just about performance. Geopolitics plays a role too. Elon Musk flew to China over the weekend on a surprise trip and met Chinese Premier Li Qiang. Musk has his biggest overseas Tesla factory in Shanghai. So, he has big stakes in China. According to state media, Li said that China is open to foreign business and wants to make it easier for global companies to come here. In addition, Musk said Tesla`s Gigafactory in Shanghai is its best performing. Tesla wants to be an even bigger player in the Chinese market in addition to its American base.",

All cars will be electric in the future.STEWART (voice-over): As a piece of American technology, Tesla faced lots of restrictions in China out of security concerns. Until this visit, Tesla cars were sometimes not allowed to enter airports, government compounds and other sensitive areas. Well, this time, after Musk met Li, Chinese authorities announced that such restrictions on Tesla cars are no more because the company`s China-made vehicles have passed the country`s data security requirements. (On camera): As Elon Musk looks for success here in China for Chinese carmakers looking to break into the American market, that may not be so easy. Top U.S. officials have expressed concern that Chinese cars could potentially collect data and send it back here to Beijing, a potential blow for China, the world`s largest auto exporter.
