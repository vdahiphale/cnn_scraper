I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. As world leaders gather in Washington to mark NATO's 75th anniversary, unprecedented challenges face the alliance. First and foremost, a raging war in Europe, now into its third year. NATO is stepping up with more critical air defenses for Ukraine after Russia's deadly strike on infrastructure, including a children's hospital in Kyiv. Already more Patriot missile systems are headed there, and the U.S. secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has announced that F-16 jets will finally be flying over the skies in Ukraine this summer. Speaking as the summit started last night, President Joe Biden gave a full-throated endorsement. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  In Europe, Putin's war of aggression against Ukraine continues, and Putin wants nothing less, nothing less than Ukraine's total subjugation. Before this war, Putin thought NATO would break. Today, NATO is stronger than it's ever been in its history. When this senseless war began, Ukraine was a free country. Today, it is still a free country, and the war will end with Ukraine remaining a free and independent country. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We have seen at the last weekends in France that the extreme right didn't succeed in ruling our closest friend and partner in Europe, France. We have seen that the cooperation between democratic parties is the best resilience. And therefore, in these times of insecurity, also for many, many people in our society, we have to stand up to our responsibility of cooperation, of trust. And also ensuring that we stay united, besides all the differences we might have as democracies, because this is normal.

And also, counter fake news on social media way stronger than we did in the past as democracies, being resilient against this propaganda. And we have to do a better job in this because all together as a democratic parties. And coming to your second part of the question, obviously, the world is a total different one than at the last German national elections, in the light of Russia's war progression. And now, also, with regard to the dramatic situation in the Middle East, it needs more diplomacy and not less, because otherwise, others will fill this gap. And therefore, in these times of crisis, I believe that political responsibility means, as a foreign minister, not being tied up in a candidacy for German chancellorship, instead, continue to use all my energy as foreign minister to my role of building trust and building cooperation, building reliable structures, because so many partners around the world and in Europe count on that.

And therefore, obviously, he was speaking on his own behalf and what he said. I mean, in Ukraine, stop defending yourself, telling this to the victim, telling this to the victim of an aggression, which is in total breach, not only of the European Union peace order, but of the charter.

After nine months of war, the U.N. is now declaring a famine does exist in Gaza. And we don't know but there's constant talk about a ceasefire or release of hostages something, but it hasn't yet materialized. What do you think is going to be the next steps?

And therefore, the Biden plan is the only way to come out of this total disaster. I was recently there, gave a speech at that security conference at Herzliya, and made clear that if you look at the suffering of the people, and one mother of a hostage told me that it doesn't bring back my own child, my own son. If another mother loses now in Gaza, their child. And this is what we have to do to end the suffering for both sides, to see the humanity, making clear that the terrorist attacks from Hamas have to stop, that the hostages have to be freed, that humanitarian aid has to come in, that we come to a ceasefire, and that we do not lose the sight of a lasting peace plan, meaning a two-state solution. I know that it's really hard, and you can sometimes really lose the trust in the future, but I think there's no alternative on that than building a future altogether.

And therefore, the funding of the P.A. has to go on because, I mean, if schools are not running anymore in the West Bank, because the financial guarantees, which the Oslo guarantees gave to the Palestinians are not there anymore. This won't secure the security of Israel and same goes for the northern front you mention. I have been speaking to both sides again and again. I end here so often, especially from the people, but also from the governments. We don't want to have another war between Israel and Lebanon, but we shouldn't slide into another war. And this is the danger we are currently on, that it's a tit for tat. And therefore, again, diplomacy and also the efforts of the special envoy, Hochstein, from the United States is so important.

And so, we felt it was time to dig into this a bit more. Is there any truth to this statement? And in short, there is. Not because, as you say, you know, 90,000 kids a year are born thanks to this technology. It is widely supported by, you know -- it is, I think, nearly nine in 10 Americans are in favor of IVF. So, it would be a hugely unpopular thing for Republicans to go after. But the reason why, you know, it is on the table and it could become America's next cultural war is because it is a logical -- being uncomfortable with IVF is a logical extension from being uncomfortable with abortion. Particularly the sort of most ardent parts of the prolife movement have always believed in this concept that a, basically from the moment of conception, a fetus has the same rights as you and I. And we saw this play out in Alabama earlier this year when the Supreme Court there made a ruling that, in effect, overnight suddenly led to a panic where IVF clinics stopped providing IVF. And so, yes, we think there is something to this statement. We don't think it's about to happen tomorrow, but it certainly could be on the table, yes.",

So, it sort of shields the IVF sector, if you will, as well as those using it from the consequences of the personhood of the idea that fetuses have rights.

So, there's a lot of pressure from the pro-life side on Republicans to have a more morally consistent position on this. I don't think IVF will be enough to break this coalition, but I think this underlying issue of personhood will come back again and again. And in fact, you know, you mentioned the party platform as we get ready for the Republican Convention, the party platform have adopted the new language on abortion, which I know has been presented in the press as sort of a softening of Donald Trump's position on abortion.

And those who work in the IVF field, right from the moment that Roe versus Wade was overturned two yearsago now, said, you know, lobbying abortion back to the states also will put IVF on the table. So, by removing the protections of Roe, it has been left up to every state to start dealing with these questions of where does life begin? What does that mean for the medical practices in our state? So, there is a direct connection with abortion. I think that the big parallel that you hear IVF providers talk about a lot is that they worry that in conservative states or states that are anti- abortion, pro-life you will start to see -- you won't see many ban bans, but you'll see an eroding of access. And we saw that during the protections of Roe. You'll remember, you know, in theory, abortion was legal everywhere in America, but in practice, there were many states where it became harder and harder for women to access abortion, all sorts of extra regulations were put in place that made it harder and harder to access. And the big fear is that you'll see a similar chipping away of access to IVF, perhaps even to contraception in some of these similar states. And yes, that is the big fear. So, whether that's by regulation, by being stricter about how embryos can be treated, perhaps, how many embryos you might be allowed to create for IVF, whether you can freeze them, whether you can destroy them but -- whether you can genetically test them. But there's also -- you know, there's also the kind of knock-on consequences of the chilling environment that's been created due to abortion bans. So, we've heard from states with strict abortion bans that they are struggling more and more with getting OB/GYNs. Again, you can see a knock- on for fertility doctors. So, it's not that hard to see how, in some of these states, even if as we expect, IVF will broadly remain legal or become harder and harder to access in a country where, by the way, it is already very expensive to access IVF.",

What I saw in -- and sorry, to your question on the election, I think next it's quite clear who this helps. It helps Democrats. The Republican position on these issues is not in line with the majority of Americans. What I saw in Arizona -- in fact, the Arizonans, I think it was a few days ago, handed in these signatures for their ballots initiative, and they've managed to collect I believe over 800,000 signatures, most in the state's history for this petition to protect abortion. And so -- and they are one of many states that have done this. So, in November, we will see a number of states, including Florida, including Nevada. And if these signatures are -- if enough of them are verified in Arizona, you know, important swing states, not just voting on a president, but also voting on their state's constitution and whether it should have a protection to abortion. So, that really matters. That really, really matters. And what was inspiring to see in Arizona is just how broad a coalition these grassroots movements are finding to get -- because basically they have to collect signatures from ordinary Arizonans, and I saw a range of people signing, this is not just your classic reproductive rights people signing them, it's libertarians, it's, you know, Trump voters who are very angry about the state getting into these kind of issues.
