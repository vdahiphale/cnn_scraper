      "sentences": "Hello, again, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me. I'm Fredricka Whitfield.All right. The countdown is underway for Donald Trump. The former president is just hours away from two major legal threats colliding in New York. Tomorrow is the deadline for him to post a nearly half billion-dollar bond in his New York civil fraud case. His attorneys have asked an appeals court to allow him to post a smaller bond or none at all. But the court has not reached a decision yet. On Friday, Trump claimed he has the cash to cover the bill, but his lawyer told CNN that Trump does not actually have that cash on hand. Meanwhile, New York's attorney general has already filed judgments in Westchester County and New York City where Trump owned properties. The first indication the state is preparing to seize his assets if he can't pay up. This all playing out as Trump is expected to appear in a New York courtroom tomorrow where a judge may set a date for his hush money trial involving a $130,000 payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels. All right, let's begin with exclusive CNN reporting on yet another Trump legal case. This one, the Georgia election subversion trial. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis is speaking to CNN about the timeline in that major trial and efforts by the former president to get it delayed. CNN's Zach Cohen joining us now. So, Zach, what is Willis saying?",

She has for now seemed to survive that. Judge McAfee has said that she can remain on the case. But it's still an open question as to whether or not an appeals court will take up that ruling and could potentially overturn it. But for now Fani Willis is trying to shift attention back to the caseitself, back to the criminal charges against Trump and the co- defendants in Georgia. Take a listen to what she said when she spoke exclusively to CNN yesterday about the state of the case as it stands. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He owes about $454 million plus interest in this civil fraud judgment. You know, Trump insisting that he had the cash in a Truth Social post last week.His lawyer then kind of contradicting that to CNN saying, no, he didn't mean that he had that money on hand.

So if it moves forward, what's interesting is she wants to pick a trial date, which could in fact conflict with the January 6th trial date if the court -- the Supreme Court rules on absolute immunity and denies Trump's motion.So right now, it's not clear when the trial date will be, but she's moving forward.

He's trying every which way. His Truth Social is going public allegedly. It's not clear where the transparency will be, whether the SEC will be looking at it.I don't think Letitia James wants to go into the real estate business. She may have the -- she may file leans on these properties and have the New York Supreme Court hold it. But she's looking for cash as well, which is easier to monetize obviously. But it's a fairly complicated situation. It's easier for her to put liens on properties in New York than it would be for her to go out of state, for example, in Mar-a-Lago in Florida.

CNN Anchor and Chief Washington Correspondent Jake Tapper reports justice delayed the story of C.J. Rice on the whole story with Anderson Cooper -- Jake.JAKE TAPPER. CNN HOST: Fred, I've been reporting on C.J. Rice's case for years, including a cover story for \"The Atlantic\" in 2022. And my dad, one of his fiercest advocates, who was actually his pediatrician, testified in court, back in 2013. that C.J. Rice was not physically capable of committing the crime that he was accused of. He was wounded. He had been shot a few weeks before and could barely walk. Unfortunately, C.J. had a horrible defense attorney, and he ended up in prison for a crime that he did not commit. I have finally gotten to meet him in person as a free man. On Monday, he was officially exonerated by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. One of the most moving parts of tonight's documentary, about C.J. Rice and his imprisonment and exoneration, deals with the relationship between C.J. and my dad, who's 83, and their correspondence since 2016. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) C.J. RICE: (INAUDIBLE) in 2017. Dr. Tapper: hopefully, as this letter reaches you, everything is as good as can be, given any and all circumstances. DR. TAPPER: May 2019. Dear C.J.",

Who's going to be lucky? All right, one of the most popular brands of bottled water in China has become the target of an online boycott, but it has nothing to do with taste or price tag. CNN's Marc Stewart explains. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MARC STEWART, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): If you live here in China, there's a good chance you're drinking Nongfu Spring bottled water. It's the country's biggest maker of bottled water and sold on almost every street corner, including here in Beijing. The company is owned by China's richest man, but his wealth has been shrinking fast in recent weeks, thanks to an unexpected backlash. Zhong Shanshan is facing online attacks, accused of being not patriotic enough, in part, because of the designs of some of his product packaging. On the bottles, you can see a temple. You can see a crane. Some Chinese people feel these images are inspired by Japanese culture. Now, that's upsetting to some people, because of longstanding animosity between the two countries. Some Chinese people even claim the red bottle tab resembles the shape of the Japanese national flag. CNN has reached out to Nongfu Spring for comment. (voice-over): A perfect storm that has triggered a nationwide boycott, with people uploading videos of themselves pulling Nongfu Springs water off stores shelves, all in the name of patriotism. All of this is proving to be a heavy blow to business. The online campaign has cut into Nongfu sales as well as its share price, wiping about 3 billion off its market capitalization since the end of February, according to a CNN calculation. But views on the streets are much calmer. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (translator): We should have a fair and just attitude. We shouldn't be intensifying conflicts. That serves no good for our own government either.",
