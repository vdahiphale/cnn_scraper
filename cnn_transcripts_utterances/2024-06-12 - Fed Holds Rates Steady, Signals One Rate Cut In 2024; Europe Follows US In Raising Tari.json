Those are the market and these are main events: Fed officials predict just one interest rate cut this year down from three with inflation cooling, but slowly. The EU announcing extra tariffs on electric cars from China. And CNN speaks to auto workers in battleground Michigan about who they plan to vote for in the US presidential election. Live from New York. It is Wednesday, June 12th, I'm Julia Chatterley, in for Richard Quest, and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. And a good evening once more. Tonight, the US Federal Reserve says it sees only one rate cut this year, even as it makes progress on inflation. The Fed announced at the end of its two-day meeting earlier, it is holding rate steady as expected, its members received fresh inflation data too, this morning. The report showed no price rises over the past month. The Consumer Price Index rose 3.3 percent though over the past year. Fed Chair Jerome Powell just finishing his news conference. He says the Fed is looking at a wide range of data and it is not enough for them to lower rates at this moment. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I mean the inflation report out this morning that was better-than-expected, right? That was dovish. We really saw some significant progress. Prices didn't budge for the first time in almost two years on a monthly basis, and even Jerome Powell during his press conference, he said that this report was almost -- was better than almost anybody anticipated. But the Fed -- the Fed did sound more hawkish both during the press conference and especially in those projections. We knew that the rate cut projections had to come down, right? They were expecting three cuts back in March, but they went all the way down to just one interest rate cut, and that is a far cry from the six cuts that a lot of people had been anticipating when the year started, and that's because obviously inflation has been more stubborn than expected. The Fed had to mark up its inflation projections. They are now calling for PCE to be at 2.6 percent for this year. Again, their target is two percent, so they're not there yet. One thing though I do think that we sort of need to remind our viewers and really ourselves, is that this is not an exact science, right? The Fed does not have a crystal ball here. They would admit that, their track record on forecasting inflation, forecasting rates has not been great. And it hasn't really been great for investors or for economist as a whole. So I think we do need to be humble about what comes next. Big picture, some progress today when it comes to the cost of living and inflation.

The CPI is little more heavily weighted towards things like housing. The PCE, a little bit less so, and so they're going to be looking at that when that number comes out at the end of the month and I so think they need to see continued progress on inflation coming down and they're going to need to see the employment rate move up a little bit, see the job market cooling off a little bit, then I think they'd feel comfortable moving in September.

I think that is going to start to bite towards the end of the year, and I also think -- we always hope that the Fed can just move the dials perfectly so that the unemployment rate will just go up to 4.1 or 4.2 and stop there. It is very rare that they can just make sure that if they stopped where they want it with the unemployment rate going up a little bit more, and I think that -- I think there will be a little bit of weakness and I think that is going to lead them to cut towards the end of the year.",

Theunemployment rate is still four percent, that's a little bit higher than it was before, but oh, my goodness, if you look over the last 50 years, four percent is a really low unemployment rate. Job growth has still been reasonably strong. Inflation has been coming down. But households is still hurting because although now they're starting to have their wages go up faster than inflation, for a couple of years that didn't happen. And so they still feel that they are a bit behind and that's made people a little let weary and a little bit cautious. So, we will have to see how things evolve and unfortunately, I am not that optimistic about any good shocks coming.

The European Commission announced it is imposing additional tariffs of up to 38 percent on Chinese EVs. It comes, of course, after US President Joe Biden quadrupled import duties. Now Chinese EV exports to Europe have grown in recent years, this chart from the researchers at the Atlantic Council, the bottom part in blue shows exports to the EU. It grew from under a billion just four years ago to $13 billion last year. Anna Stewart is with me now. Wow, Anna, if it kept up at that pace, it would be a real problem, but that certainly argues why the European Commission is taking action today. What impact is this expected to have first and foremost, because they are trying to balance protecting manufacturers in Europe with a green energy and future mandate.",

There is more of a spectrum here from the EU ranging up to 38 percent, although that is on top of a 10 percent tariff which already exists, and it takes place in July. But there is room for negotiation here, Julia. So for Tesla, for instance, you'll see it says TBC on your screen, and that is because Tesla is still negotiating what that tariff should be based on what subsidies it is receiving at this stage. And then in November, the EU will decide whether or not to make these tariffs more permanent, or whether or not to ease back on them. So it certainly leaves more room, I guess for negotiation between authorities in Brussels and Beijing. But you're right also about the balance because there is an issue here potentially for particularly a market like Germany, they sell a lot of cars to China and car parts, and so there is a big fee here about retaliation and already we had a comment from the Chinese Ministry of Commerce who have accused the bloc of creating and escalating trade tension.
