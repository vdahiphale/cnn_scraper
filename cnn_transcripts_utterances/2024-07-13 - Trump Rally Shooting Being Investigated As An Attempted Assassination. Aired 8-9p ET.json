I knew there were close and then when I saw someone get hit and go down that's what I knew it was probably serious.You know, it's like confusion. It's just massive confusion, you know, throughout the event. I saw Donald Trump get hit. It looked like he had -- he was either -- I had everybody else running my camera at the time, but it looked like he was just turning to the -- he was turning his head to the side and look like he got grazed and the right ear with a bullet, kind of saw that go on and then I looked down, I saw the man died on the bleachers. There's just complete pandemonium like every, you know, there was a bit of a delay like there was a lot of confusion but immediately, it seemed like more gunfire erupted. I couldn't figure out where that was coming from and then, you know, there's a state policeman there. I believe a SWAT team showed up relatively quickly. They jumped those side, there's a fence. It was next to the bleachers. They jumped the bleachers. I'm sorry, clear on the bleachers and then I helped carry the body of the man down on the bleachers and I took them to attend behind the bleachers. We put a towel over. He said, but he is deceased.",

The other half of the crowd knew it wasn't, was trying to push your press for on the rest of the crowd that this is serious.And I think everyone got the idea of very quickly that it was dangerous situation and everyone just started hitting the deck, and, you know, kudos to the Secret Service again, when you're in these situations, a second feels like its an hour, but it seemed like authorities were there very quickly. It just seemed to me, like, I was sitting there, it seem like rounds came from behind and they got this. They hit the gentleman in the head. You've got a gunshot wound to the head and I believe was injured and then I saw Trump, President Trump get hit and looked like it was right ear, but it seemed initially everyone was like half the crowd was in shock and the other half plot was some type of weird joke.

It puts in perspective there's a real cost for that. I mean, there are some people that really want him dead. And to me, this is just ridiculous, like we have a lot of political violence in this country. It comes from all sorts much from, it comes from everywhere. And it just needs to stop. Yeah, JFK, RFK, Martin Luther King, now, you're going to attempt the life of Reagan and now you have an attempted assassination of Trump. It's just ridiculous. And it just -- you know, I don't think it's a gun problem. I don't think it's a violence problem. I think there's a lot of anger three people that just have too much interest in politics.

And I think this is -- this is a result of that. People came today, you know, we're very happy. We're here to support Trump but you can, you can sense -- you can, you can -- when you talk to people in the crowd, you know, there's a tenseness.

You could also hear some words from the former president initially when the Secret Service you saw the former president after the first few shots touch his right ear, then the Secret Service rushed realizing what was happening, rushed to cover him. They held him down on the ground as there were more shots.It was once you heard some Secret Service agent saying, what -- what are we going? Where we going? Then you heard them saying that the shooter was down. We are clear and the shooter had been neutralized. They then say, you then hear the former president saying, let me get my shoes. Apparently his shoes may have been knocked off as they knocked him to the ground. And then you here at some point, the former president saying, wait, wait, wait. And that's when you see him raised his fist, and a mouth to the crowd. It seemed the words fight, fight, fight. He was then whisked off again, raising his fist. The former president has blood on his ear in the side of his head when he was taken away. He was examined at a local hospital. And according to his campaign is fine. But again, at least one person who came to see the former president has been killed. So is this suspected gunman shot by the Secret Service. Another great attendee we believe has been seriously wounded. We've just gotten the statement from President Biden. He said, quote, I have been briefed on the shooting at Donald Trump's rally in Pennsylvania, and grateful to hear that he's safe and doing well. I'm praying for him and his family and for all those who were at the rally as we await further information. Jill and I are grateful to the Secret Service for getting him to safety. There's no place for this kind of violence in America. We must unite as one nation to condemn it. Now the president is expected to speak on camera shortly. We will bring it to you live, which has got an a two-minute warning on that. So well bring that bring you that as we wait.

DAVID MCCORMICK (R-PA), U.S. SENATE CANDIDATE (via telephone): Yeah. Well, thank you I was in the front row, so the president was speaking out to the -- to the crowd. Look like a big crowd. I think I was told to 15,000 or so. And I was seated to his right in the front row and he had actually just announced me and invited me up to the stage and then said, no, no, I'll have you come up in a few minutes and about a minute or so after that -- we heard a series of shots. I think seven or eight shots just pop, pop, pop. I was a former Army guy. They sounded like a small caliber weapon, but obviously I'm not sure about that. And it was like all of a sudden just chaos the Secret Service immediately covered the president, jumped on top of them and the crowd, obviously, all what immediately to us to the ground to people on their knees are laying down on the ground and then the president got up and was surrounded by the Secret Service. You see this. You could see him just with a little bit of blood on him. It is sort of fist came out and defiance. And then -- and then over my shoulder behind me, it was clear that somebody had been hit. And so, people around this gentleman were trying to administer first aid and he was clearly this person was clearly injured. It seems severely there was a lot of blood and eventually some police officers came up and carried him to where I hope he got to urgent care and obviously praying for him now. So that was what I saw. I saw the immediate attack on the president and I saw the fact that this person behind me was injured. But you can imagine what that kind of incident happening. Very hard to know what's coming. In fact, I'm not sure whether it was one shooter or two shooters.

They are going to move the president on the stage to a secondary location, only when it is safe.The worst thing that they could do is move from one terrain feature into another terrain feature that is de-stabilizing, like, right? They don't do not want to move of the president, the former president, off the stage to the limousine where there could potentially be a secondary attack. That's why these tactical assets were also very important. Again, being able to immediately address a secondary threat as they're moving the president. So, yes, we heard the audio, but again, I know the way that these agents train. I know the way that I was trained for these -- these moments. There were going to do things very systematically. They practice for this, you know, thousands of times. And what we actually witnessed was the near flawless execution of all of that practice in overtime. COOPER: Jonathan, also, I mean, obviously, the Secret Service has snipers in events like this. I assume they happen the highest vantage points at any place that they are. How would it be possible for somebody to have gained even if it's off the -- you know, not in the actual close enough to go through the metal detectors. But just off-site to gain a sniper position.",

Those are the closest ones that are around. The next layer out are those tactical elements. It's that the counter snipers, the counter assault teams that are there to address the near horizon long-range threats that may present you to one of the protectees. So what we do know is that the time to exposure, the moment that that threat was identified again, after probably that first shot, the almost immediate engagement of that threaten that threat was neutralized within seconds from the audio that we heard, and then from CNN's own reporting.",

Now, Anderson, what I'm also learning is that Biden campaign officials huddled only minutes after this incident unfolded in Pennsylvania, where they decided that they would stop all outbound communications and also pull down TV ads. Now, the campaign also sent a note to staff telling them to refrain from commenting on social media. So, the campaign responding also quite rapidly this afternoon as we were learning details of what occurred there in Pennsylvania. Now, I will also note Anderson as a reminder to viewers, the president is not here at the White House. He is at Rehoboth, at his Delaware residents. That is where he delivered remarks. He was in church when this incident unfolded, leaving only moments after when at the time reporters asked him if he has been briefed, he had said no, but we know now that he has been briefed and briefed repeatedly by senior U.S. officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.

And violence is not appropriate.That is what he should say -- again, the fact that he came out right -- as soon as he got out of church, and as soon as he could while he is in Rehoboth is critical. I just want to make one point. I've heard a few people say just to put this in historical context, that this is reminiscent of 19 -- in the 1980s when Ronald Reagan was shot and that is true when you look at the highest office of the land, or if somebody who was going for the highest office in the land. But political violence has been -- we've seen political violence in a very nefarious way, just in the past few years. I mean, Nancy Pelosi's husband was at home sleeping and somebody went into his house with a hammer and hit him on the head with it. In 2011, 6 people died, 13 injured, including the congresswoman who is just holding an event for her constituents. I'm talking about Gabby Giffords. And so this is obviously a much different scale, a much different point in time. This is a man who was president, who wants to be president again. But the notion of violence and the rhetoric and the intense anger that people are feeling bubbling up into violence is something that has been happening over the years and it's not just going back to '80s, to the '80s or even to the '60s.",

They worry about division breaking out in this country. It is interesting that listen, that's 48 hours ago when they were voicing that. To Dana's point, the idea being that this division and even the violence in this country, you don't have to go back to the '80s, for incidents. And of course, there's January 6, just a few years ago. But as you hear from international leaders, for instance, Justin Trudeau, here's the Canadian prime minister. He said, political violence is never acceptable. Similar statement a short time ago from Keir Starmer, the UK prime minister, just for a number of days. They are saying similar words to what we are hearing from U.S. officials. Of course, you heard President Biden say it's sick, it's sick. I've been hearing from a number of lawmakers, Representative Mike Lawler, Republican from New York. He says this level of hatred and violence cannot continue. Representative Mark Green in Tennessee, Republicans, such violence has no place in our country. You were hearing those words, not just I think because they believe that's the right thing to say, I think we were hearing those words because lawmakers in this country, but world leaders feel that there is a genuine risk that breaking out here.
