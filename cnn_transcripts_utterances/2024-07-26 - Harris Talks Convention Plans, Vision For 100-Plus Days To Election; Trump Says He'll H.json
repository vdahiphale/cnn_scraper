Harris nearing the 100-day mark until the election with a new big endorsement from the Obamas.Also tonight, Donald Trump says he is planning to return to the Pennsylvania city, where a would-be assassin tried to take his life. What we're learning about the rally and the former president's reasons for going back to Butler. Plus, Trump's running mate is stirring up more controversy. Senator J.D. Vance now accusing Democrats as a whole of being anti-family and anti-child, as he attempts to explain his now viral comment about childless cat ladies. Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world. Wolf Blitzer is on assignment. I'm Pamela Brown, and you're in The Situation Room. And let's get right to the breaking news, a new window into Kamala Harris fast track presidential campaign, the vice president speaking on a call with donors just a short time ago. CNN's M.J. Lee has details from the White House. What are you learning about this call, M.J. M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yes, the vice president called into a meeting of her National Finance Committee this afternoon, where she thanked some of the top donors to the party for their support. I spoke with one donor who was on that call, and they said that the call was really about the vice president and top campaign officials sort of laying out their vision for the 100-plus days that are now left until Election Day. They made clear that when it comes to the vice president's calendar, of course, a key priority is going to be the vice president traveling the battleground states. They also made clear that they are quickly reshuffling her schedule and the events on her calendar had given her new role that is now just five days old. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I'm ready. Let's go. We're going to have some fun with this too. We are not playing around. LEE (voice over): A whirlwind five days for Kamala Harris who is swiftly marching towards the Democratic nomination for president. Since President Joe Biden's decision to drop out of the 2024 race, Harris working at breakneck speed to raise a stunning amount of cash, lock in major Democratic endorsements, like this one on Friday. BARACK OBAMA, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: We called to say, Michelle and I couldn't be prouder to endorse you.",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's right, Pamela. We still don't have any details as to what this is actually going to look like. Just moments ago, he posted on Truth Social that he was going to hold another rally honoring both the firefighter who lost his life as well as several of the victims in Butler, Pennsylvania.Still unclear if it would be at the same location. Just a reminder that we do know Secret Service has urged Donald Trump's team not to do outdoor rallies. They've also been reconsidering the entire security apparatus around Donald Trump. But this is something that now the former president has put in motion. But I do want to go through just overall, what is happening on the Trump side when it comes to this campaign, because today was a very quiet day for the former president. He sat down with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, the first time the two of them have sat down together since Donald Trump left office and since their relationship had soured. And I will tell you, Pamela, I went into the room briefly. They allowed reporters and ask a few questions. It did not seem as though there was any tension between Netanyahu and Donald Trump. And, in fact, I asked what would happen? How would their working relationship look in the future? If Donald Trump were to be elected in November, and he said there was never any issue. Of course, as we know, that's not true. Trump had soured on Netanyahu after Netanyahu congratulated President Joe Biden on winning the 2020 election, something that Trump viewed as disloyal. Now, on the other side of that, I also asked about Kamala Harris's remarks after she met with Benjamin Netanyahu. Netanyahu told me that he hoped that didn't impact any of the ceasefire talks, and Donald Trump said he believed that those were insulting, those comments were insulting to Israel. Now, the other part of the campaign that's kind of an offshoot that's happening right now is a little bit of a cleanup act, and it actually doesn't involve former President Donald Trump, but instead his running mate, J.D. Vance. He has gotten a lot of pushback, I know we've talked about it a lot today, on these comments that he made when he was running for Senate in Ohio back in 2021, essentially saying, referring to several Democratic women, as well as others, leaders, as childless cat ladies. Again, obviously, that has gotten a lot of pushback. Now he is saying that those comments were sarcastic, that they're being taken out of context, that people are focusing on the sarcasm part of them, not the substance, that Democrats are fundamentally, quote/unquote, anti-family. Take a listen to what he said back in 2021 and what he's saying today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. J.D. VANCE (R-OH), VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: We're effectively run in this country via the Democrats, via our corporate oligarchs, by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made. Having children, becoming a father, becoming a mother, I really do think it changes your perspective in a pretty profound way. But this is not about criticizing people who, for various reasons, didn't have kids. This is about criticizing the Democratic Party for becoming anti-family and anti-child. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But it has been many days where he has had to cede the spotlight to Kamala Harris and to Democrats, in general. It's the first time that that's really happened in about 15 months, 16 months, since he was first indicted in March of 2023, and it is an unfamiliar feeling for him. We also know that Donald Trump loves attention, whether it's good for him or not, and he often tries to find a way to get back in the headlines. His team seems to have found its footing on what it is going to say about Kamala Harris. They are, as Kristen was saying, distracted by the criticism of J.D. Vance, you know, that most of them think will level out, but it has been an unwanted distraction. They also, I think, are figuring out how they're going to try to attack Kamala Harris. You saw Trump do it in his rally. He's going to describe her as a radical liberal or a dangerous liberal. And I think we will start seeing ads to that effect pretty soon.",

And I think that that's kind of where they are right now, where Vance went on Megyn Kelly's show to try to explain what he said. He doubled down on it, in a way.And also, just to be clear, I mean, I think a lot of times when politicians make past statements, and it gets attention, they want to back away from some of the things that they said. One of the things he talked about was women who had to live with their own choices to not have children. And that's been one of the most problematic parts of this, is the sort of deriding of women who may, for whatever reason, choose to not have children. And he didn't back away from that today, even though he tried to say that he was being mischaracterized. So, I don't think this goes away anytime soon. It's just -- it's not a helpful message in general. I'm not sure that J.D. Vance is really on the ticket to try to win over women necessarily, but for a campaign that is trying to build on momentum from an RNC last week that was very triumphant in a lot of ways, this is incredibly unhelpful to them.",

I think he's very focused on Kamala Harris and the change at the top of the ticket for the Democrats.You know, will he eventually look at the news coverage and start saying something that has historically been the pattern? That is not happening yet. But there are a number of Republicans not in the Trump world who are concerned about the fact that there are so many headlines around this and wish that it did not exist. I think Abby's exactly right that it's just unhelpful when he had had a really successful convention, you know, that had a lot of viewers.

Thanks for joining us, Mitch. I want to start off at this endorsement. Go ahead, you know, about from Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, this phone call and the video that was released today. We know that she said on the call, she'll be hitting the battleground states. What is the campaign's path to victory? Is it an Obama-style coalition of voters? What swing states are your top targets? MITCH LANDRIEU, NATIONAL CO-CHAIR, HARRIS CAMPAIGN: Well, first of all, it was a great endorsement. I thought the video was wonderful and you could see the wonderful relationship between him, Michelle Obama and, of course, the vice president have known each other for a long time. It caps a week of almost unrelenting optimism from the Harris campaign when on Sunday we started off, of course, with President Biden saying that he was going to pass the torch to a new generation. And in a very short period of time, almost a perfect 48 hours, the vice president managed to consolidate all of the Democrats that were feeling really, really uneasy about President Biden's chances. And, of course, throughout the entire week, you have seen all of the coalitions of the Democratic Party come together. And now today, with the announcement of the endorsement of President Obama, we are really one team, one fight, and ready to go. So, you're going to see 100 and, you know, a couple of days sprint, one that you've never seen before. I think most of us at political junkies have never seen what we're in right now. So, we're making history together. But this week has been a great week for the vice president. It showed her organizational skills. Of course, you saw her on the world stage with Bibi Netanyahu. And, of course, you've seen her now raise more money than anybody's raised in this short a period of time and gather as many volunteers as has ever been gathered in the history of politics in the country. So, we're off to a big start, but this is going to be a close election. It was always going to be a close election. Everybody's got to show up, got to do the work.

They're actually more in play than they were before. And we are going to make sure that we hit all of those.Now, what has been happening over the last four, five, six, seven months, an organization that the vice president helped build and is going to inherit, is we have thousands of offices on the ground in those swing states, and now they're bursting at the seams and they are ready to go. And so we will execute the plan as it was designed. Of course, the vice president will change it as she sees fit.

The fact of the matter is that the vice president started off, as you know, as a prosecutor, prosecuting criminals in San Francisco. She went after the bad guys. She put sexual abusers in jail. She put business frauds in jail. When she was the attorney general of California, she ran literally the largest law firm in the country and, in many instances, the world.And what I think she was trying to say there, and I think that many criminal justice experts would say this is true, that you can both be tough and smart on crime, that police officers are critically important. And if you look at her record along with the president, they have actually funded the police. They are the ones that put money not only into the FBI, the DEA, the ATF, the U.S. Marshal's office and U.S. attorneys, but they funded police departments with real cash and put real cops on the streets. So, she believes in police officers and she understands that sacrifice. But I think it is also true that when you're dealing with criminal justice, you have to make sure that you can decide whether somebody is bad or good, not by the color of their skin, but by their behavior. And that when you're dealing with mental health, when you're dealing with substance abuse, when you try to find alternatives for offenders that are not serious offenders, you can actually create a safer system. It's not just about police officers. And I think as a matter of fact, the proof is in the pudding, we have had crime actually go down really a lot during the Biden-Harris administration. And, of course, it was really high during the Trump administration. And so when you put them both together and you're tough on crime and you're smart on crime, you can accomplish both things and make the streets safe.",

It was one of three mass shootings, by the way, on July the 13th. It was not even the worst mass shooting by an AR-15.
