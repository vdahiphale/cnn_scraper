A lot of the times you`ll just get just a little piece of a tail sticking out from behind a tree or something and you stop. These things are very, very camouflaged. Just relax. SUAREZ (voice-over): Despite that, Codey Quinton captured a 10-foot Python last year. It`s all part of Florida`s annual Python Challenge where amateurs and professionals seek the thrill of a capture and cash prizes. The hunter who catches the most Burmese pythons can take home $10,000. The snakes first showed up in Florida in 1979 brought here as pets and likely released into the wild by owners when the snakes grew too big to keep. They aren`t picky eaters. Small mammals and birds are among their favorite meals. According to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, since 2000 more than 21,000 Burmese pythons have been captured and killed. But experts estimate tens of thousands of them are still thriving and threatening the Everglades ecosystem. And wildlife officials say the area has seen a decrease in the number of small mammals like raccoons and rabbits as a result. The challenge is intended to help solve that problem. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
