The Palestinian Authority, though, says that it is working to root out, you know, militant activity, in the city of Jenin in particular. And this was one of the heaviest Palestinian security operations in the West Bank that we have seen in quite some time that has taken place over the course of roughly the last two to three weeks. What we have traditionally seen over the last year has been intensive military operations by the Israelis in some of these cities in the West Bank that are hotbeds of militant activity. It has been much more rare to see the Palestinian Authority security services go in and conduct these activities. And one of the reasons for that may be that that they are trying to show the incoming Trump administration, in particular, that they are capable not only of rooting out extremism inside the West Bank but also potentially to show that they are capable of having a governance role inside of Gaza in a postwar scenario. The Israeli government, of course, has opposed the entry of the Palestinian Authority to govern Gaza following the war. But the Palestinian Authority has repeatedly made a case for governing inside of Gaza, potentially even as part of some kind of a unity coalition with other Palestinian factions, including discussions around a potential role for Hamas as well -- Becky.",

He documented the horrors taking place inside his hospital in the wake of a renewed Israeli offensive. He was a familiar face to many, near and far until a week ago.

The Israeli military has said Abu Safiya was, quote, \"apprehended for suspected involvement in terrorist activities and for holding a rank in the Hamas terror organization.\" And Israel says Kamal Adwan and other hospitals have been used by Hamas in their war effort, although it did not provide evidence to support its claims. Well, CNN had been in regular contact with Dr. Abu Safiya since October before he went missing. He told us the military had fired on the hospital on a daily basis and raided the facility at least six times since the 5th of October. Numerous medical and humanitarian organizations have called for his release, saying it is a violation of international law. One group inside Israel, Physicians for Human Rights, said it had requested a lawyer to meet with Abu Safiya to assess his condition and the circumstances of his detention.
