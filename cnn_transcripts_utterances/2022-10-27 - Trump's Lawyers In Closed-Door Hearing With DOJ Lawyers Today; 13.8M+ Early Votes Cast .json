President Biden hits the road, as we hit 12 days to election day. A handful of key Senate contests are tossup. Republicans now increasingly confident by capturing the House, early voting way up. Some Democrats do see some hope there of defying midterm history.Plus, get this quote, security is a joke. We have some new CNN reporting shows millions of your tax dollars, Aramark to protect election workers have not been spent and it leaves the people who count your votes, vulnerable to threats. And Donald Trump sets campaign closing rallies in Iowa, in Pennsylvania, in Ohio and in Florida. His election lies echo across this year's Republican campaigns, a new snub of a potential rival more proof, Trump is thinking 2024 combat. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, 45TH U.S. PRESIDENT: And now, in order to make our country successful, safe and glorious again, I will probably have to do it again. But first we have to win a historic victory for the Republican Party this November. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That are part of a big battle with the Justice Department in a secret dispute. Stemming from that unprecedented FBI serving of search warrant at Mar-a-Lago.CNN spotted Mr. Trump's lawyers and several Justice Department prosecutors known to be working on this highly sensitive case this morning. Let's get straight to CNN's Kaitlan Collins for more. Kaitlan, what do we know? KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN ANCHOR, CNN THIS MORNING: Yes, John. This is really interesting, really for what we don't know because you see these three attorneys here going into this federal courthouse in Washington this morning. Jim Trusty, Lindsey Halligan and Evan Corcoran, they are the three that are primarily handling the Mar-a- Lago documents investigation. And what's notable is where they are, they are in Washington today, going into this courthouse for the sealed proceeding, where they're in the room with Justice Department, prosecutors and the Chief Judge Beryl Howell. But typically, John, we see them in court in Florida. We have seen them in front of the special master in Brooklyn. We have not seen them before, based on my knowledge covering this closely going into the D.C. courthouse. And so, it raises a lot of questions of what this secret proceeding means. And what they are at dispute over in the courthouse right now, which we believe is still going on. We have not seen the attorneys for the former president exit yet. They did not answer reporters' questions going in for why they are there today. But it does come as we know what's really still at the heart of this investigation, which is the documents that Trump took with him when he left office to Mar- a-Lago. And the concerns that the Justice Department has made quite clear they still have, which is whether or not all of those documents had been returned to the possession of the federal government. And they have made clear, they do not believe that they are and so they are in this proceeding right now. We are still waiting to find out what exactly is going on behind closed doors here because we've seen other Trump attorneys and Trump former aides go into this courthouse. A lot of them talking to the grand jury about this investigation that has been underway. We haven't yet seen this legal team that is the legal team of counsel of record, when it comes to this investigation going into the D.C. federal courthouse. So, a lot of questions raised by this appearance, John?",

And you can feel the anxiety on the ground, talking to voters rather it's palpable.It's not to say that other issues are not driving voters to the polls. Still, the abortion issue was actually kind of surprising to me, given the state of the economy right now. How in Arizona, I was with a Republican candidate in one of those toss up districts and he was going up to voters just to say please, you know, vote for me the way he should. And he unsolicited said, what do - he solicited what do you care about? And the answer from several the women he talked to was abortion. And it's, again, it's not to say that the economy is not driving, but it also was an indicator and a reminder to me that in these districts, you were saying the numbers, early voting numbers are high, Democrats are saying, OK, well, maybe that's a good sign. It might be a little bit of a saving grace, because they had this abortion.",

The question is, will it happen in 2022? If you look, though, at some of the fundamentals, the president's approval rating, normally the north star and the midterm election, this is our CNN averaging the poll of polls, approval 41, disapprove 56.That believes Joe Biden about where Donald Trump was about where Barack Obama was a little below where Barack Obama was, and they both lost the House in their first midterm. You make a key point, when you show the Democrats, you know, defending in all those House districts, defending in some of the Senate races now, that forces the money to go to defensive races not trying to get takeaways",

A, I've been covering midterm elections for a long time. And this one may be - it may be different. We may get ticket splitters again, because you have incumbent governors in Ohio, for example, and in New Hampshire and in Georgia, who are running for reelection, who seem OK.

And, you know, one of the things I've been struck by as we talked earlier about President Biden's approval rating.If you look under the hood, he doesn't have amazing numbers with young voters, even with some Democratic voters, he doesn't pull as high with his own party as a Donald Trump did in 2018.

His super PAC, if you look, has come in late, it's a relatively modest amount of money, but they've spent about $3 million in Arizona. This is for ads in the final month of the campaign. About $2.6 in Pennsylvania, $2.6 million in Georgia, $2.3 million in the Ohio Senate race, Nevada Senate race $2 million, Michigan governor's race $1 million up late to the game.
