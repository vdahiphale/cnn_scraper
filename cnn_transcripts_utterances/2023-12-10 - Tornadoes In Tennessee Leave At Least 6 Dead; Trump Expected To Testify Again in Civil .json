He got very mad at the prosecutor for bringing up his very high fee as well as sort of disagreeing with his points. I don't think it will move the needle that much. But I do think it's very smart of the court to allow that testimony as well as Trump's testimony because it helps make a good factual record.

Per university statement, she will remain tenured faculty at the university's law school and stay on while they find an interim replacement. As we've reported, students, faculty, really the community in general said they lost confidence in Magill after Tuesday's congressional hearing in which she and the presidents of MIT and Harvard failed to explicitly say that calls for genocide of Jews would immediately violate their universities' codes of conduct. Moments after Magill's announcement, Scott Bok said he, too, would be stepping down as the chair of the university's board of trustees. In a statement, Bok wrote: Former President Liz Magill last week made an unfortunate misstep. He then goes on to write, following that, it became clear that her position was no longer tenable, and she and I concurrently decided it was time for her to exit. Bok also defending Magill, calling her a good person, a talented leader, and, in his words, not the slightest bit antisemitic. Also interesting in Bok's statement, he offered some potential insight into what may have been Magill's state of mind at the time of that disastrous hearing. As Bok wrote she was not herself at the time she was being questioned by lawmakers, that she was, quote, over-prepared, over-lawyered, and she provided a legalistic answer to a moral question, and that, Bok says, was wrong -- Amara, Victor.

And the president himself has even weighed in on this issue when reporters asked him about Republicans' allegations that he met several times with his son, Hunter Biden's business associates, he called it a bunch of lies.

So, the vote could come this week to formalize this impeachment inquiry. There is no evidence that Republicans have produced that connect the president to anything that would be illegal or wrongdoing, that was on the part of Hunter Biden. They see this from a political context, of course. Do you think it pays off politically for House Republicans? CHARLIE DENT (R-PA), FORMER U.S. CONGRESSMAN: No, I really don't think this is going to pay off for House Republicans. Look, they've made a very compelling case that Hunter Biden should be impeached. Of course, the problem is Hunter Biden is not a federal official. And they have not yet made the case that Hunter's nefarious actions somehow financially benefitted Joe Biden. So I think that's fundamentally their problem. I think they're just doing this to say they can impeach Joe Biden because Trump was impeached. I don't think it's particularly good politics. I don't think it will help them much. It may not hurt them that much, but I think it's a misguided effort, and I don't think the look is particularly good, given the fact they're still dealing with, you know, Ukraine funding, Israel funding, Taiwan funding, the border, and of course, the government is still not yet funded for the year.

He is the most underestimated president we've ever had, and he always comes out on top.That doesn't mean that he should not and the administration should not take these things seriously, all these challenges, and they do. They're not leaving anything to chance. But I think there is a huge danger for Republicans to overstep here. I agree with Charlie. This is not something that will help them politically. It could also backfire because they're going to be attacking a president who has a son, and throughout all of the situations that they'll be pointing out in terms of when he got in trouble, Hunter Biden got in trouble, it was when he was at the height of the issues that he's had with addiction and drugs. Millions of families can relate to that. So many American families have tragically gone through this exact same thing. They can easily see a father in President Biden who loves his son, wanted to help his son throughout his difficult times, the empathy that he has towards his son.

It wouldn't have been a hard -- had this statement been made by any other ethnic group, LGBTQ Americans, I suspect there would have been an unequivocal condemnation. It didn't happen. But I can give you some context for Philadelphia. Several blocks from Penn's campus, a falafel shop, the owner was protested against because he was a Jewish Israeli. It kind of sounds to me like Kristallnacht, except they didn't break the windows, thank heavens, but this is what's going on. And many of these campuses now, I mean, the cultures are very far left. I think these presidents are afraid to put some of that v these radical elements on these their campuses. That's what it looked like to me. There's many people on campus don't feel safe, many Jewish Americans don't feel safe on campus. A lot of people right of center have never felt welcomed on these campuses. And I think it's an inflection point for these universities to really think about academic freedom and their inability to condemn hate speech, you know, to confuse hate speech and free speech is just almost incomprehensible.",
