      "sentences": "360\"Tonight on 360. The former president stays silent a day after exclusive CNN reporting he is on tape admitting he kept a classified document about a potential strike on Iran. Also tonight, how President Biden is doing after a tumble on stage while visiting the Air Force Academy. New details on what caused it. Later, a conversation with a Sherpa guide who saved a climber barely clinging to life in the so-called Death Zone on Mount Everest. Good evening. We begin with a surprising new turn of the story CNN was first to have about the former president caught on tape admitting to people without the proper security clearance and he kept a classified document and might have even been waving it around -- waving it around as he spoke. We're going to talk right now with Kaitlan Collins and CNN's Alyssa Farah Griffin, who joins me now. Earlier today, former President Trump was shouted questions about CNN's exclusive reporting, did not answer those questions. What does it say to you? I mean, this is the former president who speaks out about just about everything he did, and yet, he has remained silent so far. KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN ANCHOR: Yes, and he has commented on the documents, as he did multiple times at our townhall, and I remember after that, when I'd asked him if he'd ever shown the documents to anyone, and he said, not really. We obviously followed up with members of his legal team, asking about that comment, and so we do know at this point that they were aware during that townhall of this audio recording where Trump was talking about what we believe is classified information with other people, making clear he couldn't show it to them. So they have been aware behind the scenes that this is something that was in the special counsel's possession. I think it's notable that he stayed silent on it today. He only commented at one print outlet, \"The Cedar Rapid's Gazette\" saying it was fake news, but not really disputing the heart of the reporting. I think this has caused a lot of consternation among members of his legal team. I don't think all of them were fully aware that Jack Smith's team had this recording, but it raises real issues because you've seen Trump's attorneys last night, one who is still on his team today, one who is no longer on the team, having a difficult time explaining their past explanations and standing by them, because they're undercut by what he says in the document according to what our sources are -- or on the recording -- according to what our sources tell us.",

I mean, obviously the former president's argument hinged on this notion of he could declassify anything, and that anything that he had in his possession had been declassified. But in this, he obviously acknowledges that he knows that he can't simply classify things. There is a process. I've said before when I was serving in the West Wing, there were a number of times he wanted to declassify documents and he ran through the hoops of trying to do that.Talking to his national security adviser, his then director of National Intelligence, and I can think of a number of cases where we weren't able to declassify something because of the hoops he would have to jump through. He knows how this process works. It's a very flimsy sort of argument he is hinging on. What we also can't forget in this is we're not talking about you know a keepsake like a love letter from Kim Jong-un, as absurd as that sounds, we are talking about war -- potential war plans with Iran, something that's actionable military intelligence that has impacts on US troops abroad, on US Intel agencies that is sitting at a country club in New Jersey. Like this is the height of irresponsibility, recklessness, and if we have any laws governing how we handle classified documents, this is a rock-solid case.",

I'm told that document is not from General Milley it wasn't produced by him, that it actually predates since he was chairman of Joint Chiefs-of-Staff, which I should note was also he was handpicked by Trump to be the chairman of the Joint Chiefs-of-Staff. That was in 2019. So the indication was that it came from before then. So I think there's questions about that. But I think it also -- that's the other thing here. That a big part of this is it was Trump trying to settle a score here because he was mad about the reporting that made it sound like he wanted to take military action in Iran. He said something to the effect of, if you could see what I have, it would undermine what was being portrayed as Milley's position in this story. So I think that's the other aspect of it, and I'm curious, obviously, what the special counsel is looking into when it comes to that of Trump using it.

They may disagree with it, but they still have to go write up that document and present options to them, right? It doesn't mean that it's going to come through, and certainly I know of plenty of examples, it doesn't surprise me that perhaps it might have been related to Iran because this wasn't the first time that this came up.

According to local media, thousands in Florida and around the country took part in a wide range of activities to protest the law aimed at undocumented workers in Florida that puts more requirements on those who aid or employ them.Governor DeSantis called it the most ambitious anti-illegal immigration legislation in the country. One Florida farmer told CNN's Gary Tuchman that he is concerned the law could lead to a shortage of workers to do the kind of jobs that this farmer says few Americans actually want. So Gary Tuchman decided to see just how difficult those jobs can be.

He sent thousands of men to their death so far, but what game is he playing now? Feuding with the Kremlin's top generals. And later, an almost impossible rescue from Mount Everest death zone, where temperatures can reach more than 86 degrees Fahrenheit below zero. I'll talk with the sherpa guide who risked his own life to save a stranger struggling to breathe and carried him on his back down the mountain. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [20:41:49] COOPER: A number of important updates on the war in Ukraine tonight. A missile attack overnight on Kyiv killed two women and a nine-year-old girl. The husband of one of the women killed said that the doors, the shelter they were trying to enter, were locked. Ukrainian officials announced today that since the start of the war, 484 children have been killed, another 992 injured. They also said that more than 19,500 children have been deported, though, officials cautioned that number could be higher. As for the war in the east, another explosion in the Russian border city of Belgorod. The governor of the region said it appears to have involved a drone. Social media video shows a plume of smoke rising from a downtown location and broken windows in a high rise building. And today, the leader of the Wagner mercenary group fighting in eastern Ukraine, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said his group's next assignment maybe in Russia, defending its territory. And in the latest and ongoing public feud with Russian military officials, he asked Russian prosecutors to investigate whether senior defense officials committed a crime. Now, for weeks, as you may know, Prigozhin has increased his criticism of Russian military leadership. He routinely now appears in these self-produced videos, where he dresses up like one of his mercenary fighters and verbally attacks Russia's top generals. The question is, what's his end game? CNN's Melissa Bell takes a look at the man behind the powerful mercenary group. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MELISSA BELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): For months now, Yevgeny Prigozhin has been leading the charge in Ukraine and stealing the limelight. YEVGENY PRIGOZHIN, HEAD OF WAGNER PRIVATE MILITARY COMPANY (through translator): Guys, don't bully the Russian military. BELL (voice-over): The taunt typical as he announced the withdrawal of his Wagner mercenaries last week after claiming the first Russian advance in Ukraine in months. Power on the ground that has translated into far more open political confrontation with Moscow. Long known by his nickname as Putin's Chef, the oligarch shared the Russian president's humble beginnings in the tougher neighborhoods of St. Petersburg. Reportedly a former convict, he used Putin's rise to build a vast catering empire. As Putin set his sights on Crimea and eastern Ukraine in 2014, Prigozhin's forces were there. The Wagner mercenary group that he founded became known as Putin's private army, operating on his behalf, but in the shadows across the Middle East and Africa for years. But it took the chaos of the 2022 Russia invasion of Ukraine for Prigozhin to take center stage himself.",

PRIGOZHIN (through translator): All these divisions can end up in a revolution, just like in 1917. First, the soldiers will stand up, and after that, their loved ones will rise up. BELL (voice-over): With Prigozhin's very thinly veiled threats, he's also now clearly hoping that Russian society maybe ready for a message even more hardline than that of the man who helped bake him.

There have been so many questions these last few months about why there has been no rebuke from Vladimir Putin, even in the face of such outspoken criticism on the part of Yevgeny Prigozhin.The key to that is that Prigozhin is himself far more hard line even than Vladimir Putin. If it were up to him, there would be mass mobilizations. Any semblance of democracy, any veneer, would be swept aside in the name of winning the war in Ukraine. That is Vladimir Putin's problem. He cannot be cracking down both on the Alexei Navalny's, the more moderate, reformist parts of Russian society, and taking on the ultra-nationalists like Yevgeny Prigozhin. So, in a sense, he is faced now with the man on whom he's come to depend in Ukraine, making it more and more clear that it is perhaps also Vladimir Putin that now depends on Yevgeny Prigozhin inside Russia itself.
