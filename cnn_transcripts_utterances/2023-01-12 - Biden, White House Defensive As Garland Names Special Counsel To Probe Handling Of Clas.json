And the question tonight for Biden is, why are Americans only finding out about this now?Plus, Republican Congressman George Santos under even more scrutiny tonight over a mysterious $700,000 contribution to his campaign, concerns about how, where it was spent and where did it go. So, what do his voters think? We'll talk to them. In a story you'll see first OUTFRONT, Russians speaking out against Putin's war, one calling it a terrible mess, complete chaos, all of this on camera to CNN. You'll see it first here. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, on the defensive. More classified documents and a special counsel.

The tense White House briefing coming just a couple hours after Attorney General Merrick Garland named Robert Hur, a former Maryland U.S. attorney who worked in the Trump administration as the special counsel in the Biden administration. Hur's appointment literally coming hours after the White House announced more classified documents were found at Biden's home in Delaware. President Biden's lawyer said, quote, all but one document was found in storage in Biden's garage and one document was in stored materials in an adjacent room. Biden today had this to say about handling the classified documents properly, oddly saying the garage is also where his prized Corvette seen here in a 2020 campaign ad is locked and stored. So, this appears to be the garage where the documents were found. Take a look at this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "As I said it was a bit odd of an explanation.But, look, here's the thing, we're just learning about all this week, and that is by choice and design. The first batch of documents were found on November 2nd at Biden's office in Washington, D.C. They were given to the National Archives the next day. On November 4th, the DOJ was notified. Now, during all of this, the public was told nothing. Then on December 20th, Biden's attorneys informed DOJ that additional classified material was found in Biden's garage. And then today, word of another document found last night at his Wilmington home. Now, here's the thing, with all of this, it was not until this week that the public was told any of it. And frankly, the only reason they told it broke in the news. The news broke on Monday of documents found at Biden's office. The White House statement that came out only acknowledged those documents even though they were well aware other documents were found in the garage. Well, it took the news media a couple days, that comes out and here we are. So, we do not know why they didn't say anything, contemporaneously or when the news of the first documents broke. But with the revelations of more documents, Trump and Republicans are trying to draw parallels. Look, it's easier to do that when there's less transparency even though the situations are not the same. Even though from the little we do know, we do know of significant differences, Biden had what's described now as a small number in two locations. Trump had more than 300. There's a major difference now, the items were found and returned, of course. Biden's attorneys found them, handed them over immediately, notified the archives. DOJ was notified. Trump, of course, as you know only returned some documents after a request was made by the national archives, didn't reveal them all even after a subpoena and FBI search. And finally, the Biden team, of course, is cooperating while Trump is now under investigation. So let's begin with Evan Perez OUTFRONT live in Washington tonight. And, Evan, you've been talking to your sources at Department of Justice. This story has moved very quickly today. We've got a special counsel now. What are you learning?",

Margaret, let's start where Evan ended, reporting that obviously special counsel had been recommended, but it was the handling this week that they did not disclose all the documents when the first batch came to light, that according to his source sort of tipped the -- tipped the scales here for Garland to go the direction of a special counsel.",

I think this has been an interesting development for this White House.They've gotten some criticism throughout the administration for not being necessarily as transparent as they could, as forthright as they could. That's certainly not the same as the criticisms of the Trump administration which was on a different level when it came to press. But on the Biden administration there's been a desire to be more forthright and to come out with that information on a number of fronts. I think this is an example of a White House being a little like cute by a half. To your point, since they had gone through the procedures, it was a different level of time line there could be communication with the public, and I do think that's where the questions are going to be for this White House right now.

But it's a problem for him.And in addition, you know, here you have a situation -- I mean, nobody's trying to defend what Trump did at all, and he typically responded, you know, in a irresponsible, you know, brash, sort of combative style that doesn't do him or anybody else any good. you know, assuming the narrative that the Biden lawyers were putting out is accurate, which is always something where you have to nail that down, but assuming they contacted NARA immediately and made the disclosures and are cooperating and they continue to provide full cooperation, which by the way would normally include a full interview of the president under these circumstances since it's his intent that governs. You know, will they -- will they do all the cooperation that's required? That would be up to the special counsel. But it does make -- it does make it slightly less likely in my view that these will be the grounds that Trump gets charged on. On the other hand, as you know I've always been a champion of the idea let's prosecute him for the, you know, unprecedented and unconstitutional cling to power offenses that he committed.

I dealt with him frequently or several times I guess when he and Rod Rosenstein were together at the Justice Department, and Rod was Rob's assistant, you know, and then he was the U.S. attorney in Maryland. So he has the investigative and trial experience to do a good job here. I think he has the independence as well. I think, you know, the problem is that no matter what people want, this shouldn't be a fast result because you have to look into who else had access. You know, we know Hunter Biden listed Joe Biden's home including his garage with his address until late 2019. You know, who else had access? Was any use made of it?

Now, Putin has demoted the man in charge of the land and replacing him with Russia's top general, Valery Gerasimov, whose close to Putin and Russia's defense minister, Sergei Shoigu, often accompanying them to military exercises and briefing Putin on the war in Ukraine. The move comes as analysts say Russia seems to be gearing up for a massive spring offensive after mobilizing more than 300,000 people late last year. But also with its top brass under fire as the only gains Russia is making around the town of Soledar in eastern Ukraine are coming thanks to the private military group Wagner. Wagner's boss, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has ripped into the army's leadership, essentially calling the generals running the war incompetent, and now in an audio message making clear he is the only one who can give Putin some wins. I want to emphasize that in the storm of Soledar no other units participated than Wagner. Wagner is known for extreme brutality. This video purports to show the mercenaries advancing around Soledar, passing the bodies of dead Ukrainian troops. Many are convicts recruited from Russian jails with the promise of freedom if they survive. It's not clear whether the army's change of command is a move to counter Russia's pressure and many folks on Moscow's streets certainly weren't keen to comment. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator):  We have a president. Let him think for us. We have full faith in him, and we trust our military. (END VIDEOTAPE) PLEITGEN (on camera):  Some voices from Moscow there. And, Erin, tonight, Yevgeny Prigozhin taking another swipe at the Russian defense ministry after the Russian army said some of its forces had also taken part in the battle for Soledar. A telegram channel affiliated with Wagner put out a video allegedly showing two Russian soldiers that they had not fought there and only Wagner forces who are on the ground there.
