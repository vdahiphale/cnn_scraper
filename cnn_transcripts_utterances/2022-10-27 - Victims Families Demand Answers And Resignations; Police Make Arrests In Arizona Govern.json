It is unlike just about anything that we've ever seen in the wake of any other such tragedy, never mind accountability, and many points since May 24th, these grieving families haven't even gotten the simplest answers from anyone involved in what was by any measure, in almost every imaginable way, a colossal failure. And that cruelty of officials playing keep away with the truth, it continues. At a meeting today of the Texas Public Safety Commission, Department of Public Safety Director Steve McCraw, was supposed to deliver what they call the director's report on Uvalde containing an updated timeline and other new information. Instead, he provided neither. With the families of the murdered victims in the room, he did not deliver a director's report. He failed to deliver on that promise and family members in the audience responded. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And again, laying blame on others and saying it was more than just one person, there were several factors and mistakes that were made and that's sort of been his tone. You know, I tried to ask him, even off camera at one point he was walking around, I went over to talk to him: \"Where's the director's report?\" He's like -- at one point he said, \"Well, today, we wanted it to be about the families.\" Well, the only reason why the families came was because they were expecting to get some kind of information from him. And you know, it's just time and time again, Anderson, we keep talking about this and I don't understand how it is that they don't understand what these families are going through and what it is that they want. The families have been very clear about this. It's so cruel for them to -- for these families to have to sit there and explain themselves time and time again, and then wind up with nothing, they get nothing out of it. And it's just at some point enough is enough for them and you could see that today with them -- Anderson. COOPER: I mean, disrespectful is just the start of what it is. You know, these are families who are going to these meetings because nobody is coming to them with information. They're going to these meetings trying to get information wherever they can. I don't understand why it has been so long and we still don't have all the answers. I mean, I don't understand why there isn't a public report that has already been made.

Whatever word is proper in this situation, Anderson, but he knows he has a problem because of what he said to me about resigning.So how does he get out of that? Because there are now people who were with DPS that have been fired, that have been suspended, that are under investigation for failing to do their duty, getting inside that classroom and saving those kids and so he has a problem on his hands. And so now, what he is saying is, well, what I really meant was that I would resign if we failed as an institution, but quite frankly, the word \"did not fail\" and \"Uvalde\" should not be in the same sentence, right? I mean, it's very clear, there were failures here all around and it was a stunning moment, it really was, to have him sit there and say this to the families. And Anderson, as you know, and we've been doing on this show, and we've been doing this together, you know, the reporting that we're doing, continues and the things that we are learning paints even a more disturbing picture of what went on here. And you know, when I spoke to the Mayor of Uvalde, back in July, he was the first person and I mean, I found it hard to believe this, but he was the first person to come on the record and to say that there was a cover up here. He still believes that. I spoke to him today and he is saying to me that you are now seeing that. What you're seeing McCraw, do what you're seeing the Texas DPS do is a cover up. He is going to have more to say at some point, but you could clearly see this community and these families just continually getting frustrated and angry and it just sad now because the grief just does not stop. It will never stop. But it is being made worse by the fact that these officials are bringing them in. They invited them, \"Come we want you here.\" And then they give them nothing.",

The local sheriff says the men are not breaking the law, but it's not sitting well with some voters. And last night Drew Griffin had a video of a voting machine breach in action, are two men last year tried to copy election data pretending they were from the Department of Defense wearing bulletproof vests and failed to justify claims of voting irregularities in the 2020 election. And new tonight, election workers across the country are saying they are concerned about the lack of federal spending on security ahead of midterms. Millions of dollars that could have been used to protect election workers and improve security in their offices, they say has not been tapped. One election worker in Madison, Wisconsin telling CNN quote, our security here is a joke. Joining me now is Richard Barron, who was the Director of Elections in Fulton County, Georgia.
