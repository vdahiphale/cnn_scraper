I'm Rosemary Church.Just ahead, U.S. President Joe Biden is warning that Israel should not try to occupy Gaza as an Israeli ground invasion now seems all but inevitable. Mr. Biden added that he believes Israel has to respond to the Hamas attacks that killed 1,400 people, those comments as tens of thousands of Palestinians flee south after the Israeli military urged civilians to leave northern Gaza. The Palestinian Health Ministry says more than 2,600 people have been killed and is appealing for humanitarian aid as conditions deteriorate in Gaza. Aid deliveries have been piling up on the Egyptian side of the Rafah border crossing. The only viable way in or out of Gaza. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has promised that it quote, \"will be open\" but the U.S. embassy in Israel warns the situation at the crossing will remain fluid and unpredictable. CNN's Clare Sebastian is following developments. She joins us now live from London. Good to see you again Clare. So, what is the latest on this Hamas-Israel war from both side of the border and what are you hearing about the possibility of the Rafah border crossing into Egypt opening up this hour. Apparently, the IDF hasn't confirmed that rumor but we are hearing that possibility.",

A spokesperson for the Hamas controlled government media office in Gaza saying that they have not received any contacts or confirmations from the Egyptian authorities regarding the intention to open the Rafah crossing today so we watch and wait to see what happens there, but of course, the onus is heavily on that border crossing as the humanitarian situation inside Gaza spirals. We're hearing about the health system potentially running out of fuelin the next few days. We're hearing of a lack of shelter in the south where Israel has told hundreds of thousands of people to evacuate to as it plans to step up its bombardment and potentially a ground offensive in the north of Gaza. The phrase from the head of UNRWA, which is the U.N. agency, which is most active in Gaza is that Gaza is being strangled. So, there is growing outrage and alarm from the international community on the situation in that region. In terms of the Rafah crossing itself, we did hear from Secretary Blinken, who is in the region today. Rafah will be open, was his comment in Egypt, on Sunday, but as I say, we don't have anything concrete on that as of yet. The U.S. is under intense pressure to do something here, given that up to 600 Palestinian-Americans are trapped within Gaza. Intense focus on this not only because of people trying to get out, but of course aid trying to get in. It is currently trapped on the Egyptian side of the border, Rosemary.",

He also called for a rejection of violence and the release of prisoners on both sides of the conflict. WAFA says his comments came during a phone call with the president of Venezuela.

      "sentences": "Yes, it is in fact very difficult to imagine how Israel could achieve its objective of total annihilation of Hamas without killing many more thousands of Palestinians. And that's partly because of the fact that the Gaza Strip has been placed under blockade for about 16 years now. And so, it has become one of the most densely populated places in the world. Neighborhoods and buildings are tightly packed together. The health infrastructure is already woefully inadequate. So, peoplein Gaza have a lower life expectancy by about 10 years than most people have in Israel. And so, we've got about half a million Palestinians taking shelter in schools run by the U.N., but even these are inadequate, and the U.N. has warned that they are at risk of running out of water. Hospitals in Gaza are also severely at risk of being overrun. And so, things have been made worse by the fact that Israel has also laid siege by cutting off electricity, water, fuel and food. And so, this means that the humanitarian situation in Gaza is already extremely precarious. And asking 1.1 million people to move south in a place that is about the size of Seattle or Detroit is not entirely feasible. And the fact is that Israel's strategy is not only morally and legally questionable, but it's, I think, a fundamentally bad strategy in the sense that by inflicting large amounts of civilian casualties in order to defeat Hamas is ultimately self-defeating. Because by killing Palestinian civilians at scale, Israel is simply providing Hamas with its next generation of fighters by pushing people to the brink of desperation. It's essentially nurturing this narrative and intergenerational memory of oppression. I think it's a self-defeating strategy.",

And by provoking an Israeli overreaction, Hamas, I think, is hoping to dent any international support that Israel might be able to garner.

When the United States steps back, what happens is you create a power vacuum and all kinds of people try to enter that power vacuum. And the biggest shift became a contest between Saudi Arabia and Iran as a how it would fill in that power vacuum and the way the Saudis tried to do it in cooperation with the Israelis who also were trying to move in as well as by the way the Turks and the Russians a little bit, but the Saudis tried to ensure that their concerns and interests are taken care by forging this new alliance between the moderate Gulf Arabs and Israel. That scared the, you know, Iran, Hezbollah, Hamas, all these actors that thought they're being marginalized now. And most importantly, the Palestinians, particularly Hamas, felt they were being marginalized because what Bibi Netanyahu was trying to do was essentially ignore the Palestinian issue, make peace with the Arabs. And as a result of that, Hamas and perhaps some of Hamas' sponsors, but certainly Hamas decided we're going to burn the house down. And this is their way of trying to burn the house down. And so, part of what's going on here is that you have had a kind of power vacuum which all kinds of people have been jockeying for influence and Hamas is watching all this and they're playing the card they have, which is the most brutal sadistic card, but that's -- it's there for it to get attention.

The one where we have not heard Chinese officials say is Hamas. They have not named Hamas in any of their condemnations and pronouncements since the heinous attack the group launched against Israeli civilians on October 7th, and that's also reflected in their state media coverage since they were very much focused on the Palestinian suffering after the Israeli counterattacks. Not so much and barely missing the Israeli casualties during the initial stage of the latest conflict. Now, that is perhaps because like most Arab nations, China has actually long viewed Hamas as a resistance organization, not a terrorist group. That, of course, has not gone unnoticed but Israel and its allies, especially, including the United States. But despite Beijing's claim of neutrality, and their insistence that China has no self interest in this conflict other than being on the side of justice, and peace, if you read their statements after Wang Yi's multiple phone calls with regional powers over the weekend, they are very much focused on the Palestinian cause. That's something, of course, they have supported for decades, their messaging for a long time, but domestically and internationally, is they are a staunch supporter of the Palestinian statehood, and while Israel is being portrayed as a puppet state of the United States, despite much closer economic ties between the two countries. So, that is why some analysts say, at the end of the, day their calculation may be scoring points with the wider, broad sort of China's overall interest better on the international stage and also a reflection of China's lack of expertise and experience in dealing with this region despite some recent inroads especially after that deal they brokered between the Iranians and Saudis. So at the end of the day, they tend to fall back on to their default positions despite the disappointment and anger from Israel -- Rosemary.",

We had three missions: one, to let Israel know we're for them. Two, to find out what Israel's needs are, and we had intensive discussion of the military, diplomatic, intelligence, and humanitarian needs the Israel had.
