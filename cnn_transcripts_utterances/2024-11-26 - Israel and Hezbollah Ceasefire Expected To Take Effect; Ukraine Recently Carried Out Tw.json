Also, tonight is corporate America turning its back on DEI policies. We will discuss why Walmart and others are trying to roll back more than just prices. Good evening, John Berman here in for Anderson. The breaking news, one hour from now, a ceasefire to end more than two months of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah is supposed to take effect. Thousands have been killed, hundreds of thousands displaced. And it's all supposed to stop in 60 minutes. The deal came together today after one of the most intense Israeli strikes yet around Lebanon's capital Beirut. At least 25 people were reportedly killed. President Biden announced the deal from the Rose Garden this afternoon. He says it is designed to be permanent. Israel and Hezbollah will have 60 days to withdraw from the fighting area. The president said he hopes the deal puts pressure on Hamas now to make a deal as well. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

That means Israeli forces, which have been on the ground in Southern Lebanon for the better part of the last two months now withdrawing from that area.Hezbollah forces set to withdraw north of the Litani River, some 20 miles North of the Israel-Lebanon border, and the Lebanese military, now moving into those areas in order to monitor any ceasefire violations going forward. The United States is set to now lead a monitoring committee alongside France and other countries to ensure that neither side is violating terms of the agreement and to enforce effectively this agreement. Israel, though, is saying that it will maintain the ability to act of its own volition to enforce this agreement, to enforce any violations of Hezbollah, to this agreement in Southern Lebanon. The United States and Israel supposedly have a side agreement that discusses that. President Biden would only say that Israel has the right to self-defense, but the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, is far more adamant about Israel maintaining unilateral ability to strike against Hezbollah.",

Seventeen years is quite a long time.It doesn't mean that this will be the same in this case, especially that the Israeli prime minister says that he will enforce this ceasefire with Israeli military action if needed. This means that if in two days or two weeks or two months, Israel sees any violation from Hezbollah, it will act. This will mean in my opinion, that Hezbollah will fire back, and then this whole cease fire will collapse this is why I think 'A' I'm not sure Hezbollah will be -- will violate this deal so easily. And 'B' I don't see Netanyahu rushing towards a renewal of the fighting in the north especially when we know that Donald Trump is about to assume office in less than two months.

I think it's very clear that Israel will maintain that ability operationally and I am told that Israel did get some assurances from the United States in this side letter between the US and Israel that if Israel had not received those assurances, I was told, they probably would not have moved forward with this agreement, both because it was needed from a political perspective here in Israel and also, of course, from an operational one on the ground.",

I would be highly surprised. Mainly because the basic terms haven't changed and this means that Hamas wants to know that if it cuts a hostage deal with Israel, this means the end of the war and withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and Prime Minister Netanyahu still refuses that. So, it is possible. I can see a scenario where maybe they can get the first phase of this deal meaning a release of a dozen or two dozen hostages in return for 40 or 42 days of ceasefire.

Kremlin controlled TV ripping into US and British officials lobbying to give Ukraine more firepower. (UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE speaking in foreign language.)

If the US and its allies continue to give Ukraine longer distance weapons and allow Kyiv to fire those weapons deep inside Russian territory, the West is playing with fire.

So I'll talk about Walmart because I've actually had some interactions with Walmart when I worked at the White House.Walmart was the first private employer actually to ban the box for formerly incarcerated individuals when it was not an extremely popular thing to do, which really set a trend in the corporate America ego, like, zeitgeist, where, you know, criminal justice reform was somewhat of a new approach to the work. And so, to see them do this with DEI, am I surprised? No. Am I disappointed? Yes. Often, when social movements happen, there is a backlash. Whether you look at the civil rights movement, whether you look at the women's rights movement, whether you look at the Black Lives Matter movement, there is backlash that often happens with progress. The question is, how do you sustain it if you want to see the movement move forward? So, Walmart does well on Ban the Box, but then Donald Trump and they move back on DEI. DEI is not a bad word. It is about leveling the playing field. But I do think some of the messaging that has been around DEI that has been done quite well by the right is why we find ourselves in this predicament with the Walmart. I'll also just say the Supreme Court decision on affirmative action played a huge role in this. Many people -- many legal scholars have looked at that decision that it should only be applied to higher education. But when that decision came down, a lot of people said that it was going to have a rampant effect across institutions that it really is not discussing, but that's what happens when your highest judicial institution makes a decision.

And the identity politics, I think to many in this country feel like it became so front and center. And I juxtapose Hillary Clinton in 2016. I'm with her. I'm going to be the first woman. I'm going to shatter the glass ceiling really leaning into that. It was notable to me that Kamala Harris wasn't really talking about that. They weren't leading with, I'm a woman, I'm a woman of color, I'm going to be the first. But to me, that was almost a tacit understanding by her campaign that people were sick of vote for me because I'm X. It's more, I want to vote for you because you're the most qualified person.
