Today, the spokesman for the Kremlin said he was unaware of this proposal, but a Western official confirms to CNN that talks were chance in Moscow for us. Matthew, what are you learning about this?",

      "sentences": "Well, Brianna, it's been rumored for some months that Alexei Navalny, the late Russian opposition leader, was part of the negotiations for a prisoner swap. Those talks have been underway for some time between the United States and Russia to try and get U.S. citizens in Russian prisons freed, people like Evan Gershkovich, the Wall Street Journal reporter, and Paul Whelan, a former U.S. Marine.But this is the first time that the Navalny team has come out public and said and admitted that Alexei Navalny was being discussed and was sort of part of that negotiation. More than that, they say that the negotiations had reached the final stage just the day before Alexei Navalny was pronounced dead at that Arctic penal colony. And what Navalny's team are saying is that he was essentially taken off the negotiation table by the Kremlin to prevent him being freed, prevent him being swapped, being killed. Of course, that's something the Kremlin have categorically denied. They've described allegations that they were heading to do with his death as obnoxious. I've spoken to the Kremlin over the course of the past day, and they said they got no idea. They never heard anything about this proposal or this agreement being made about swapping Navalny. Nevertheless, it is potentially, and you've seen there, that there are some confirmation that you've been telling us about, about how this was something that was being discussed. It is a very interesting twist in this ongoing tragic saga about the latest opposition leader. Now, just some other bit of quick news, which is at the end of the week, Navalny's team said they're going to be staging a public memorial, a public farewell to Alexei Navalny, his funeral. They're not giving us the exact day, probably Friday, possibly Thursday. They haven't found a venue that will host it yet, but it will be an intensely political event. And so, it could be a flash point for anti- Kremlin, anti-government protests across the country. So, we're watching that very carefully. Brianna.",

Can you walk us through some of the complexity of these negotiations when they're politically charged like this, because I imagine it would have taken a great deal for someone like Alexei Navalny to be released, being seen as such an enemy of the Kremlin.D'AMICO: That's that's really the last couple of negotiations, both in Israel and Russia. You're dealing with politicians who actually have other agendas when we're negotiating with groups. Even if it's a terrorist group, you understand what they're really looking for, what they want. You get down to it. Obviously, the family wants them back. And you're dealing, I think, at a more level plane with that. But when you bring in a politician like you look at Netanyahu, he's making claims. Well, is he trying to save himself or is he really trying to release the hostages? When you look at Putin, you look at an ego that is so big. Would he like you said, would he really let this guy go if he was just so hated by him? So, the politician throws a different level in the negotiations. And I think it makes it like 10 times tougher because you just don't understand what their end point is. When you have straight up negotiations, I think that's basically you understand what they want. You understand what you want to get out of it.",

CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yeah, I think that's absolutely true, Brianna, because if you don't have this kind of aid, you have to look at Ukraine as being very vulnerable in all of these different areas. Not only do you have the Russian-occupied area here in red, but you also have the Russian border right in through here. You have Belarus, which is a Russian ally here. You have Russian troops in Moldova that could potentially act up very soon and potentially be used as part of a Russian effort to annex this part of the territory. So, and then of course, we also have this area right here around Odessa. It's very vulnerable because there's very little coastline left that the Ukrainians have to move their grain through the Black Sea.

It is extremely graphic and disturbing. I have watched the video. I can tell you at the beginning, at the start of it, you can see Bushnell walking up to the embassy on the street in his military fatigues. He's speaking calmly to the camera.I want to read a portion of what he says. He said, quote, I will no longer be complicit in genocide. I'm about to engage in an extreme act of protest but compared to what people have been experiencing in Palestine at the hands of their colonizers, it is not extreme at all. This is what our ruling class has decided will be normal. He then goes on to pour some sort of accelerant, it looks like, on his head out of a water bottle he was carrying. And then he lights himself on fire, Boris. And as the flames engulf him, you can hear him yelling, free Palestine, free Palestine, again and again until finally he collapses. And that is when officers, you can see them race in, one of them with a fire extinguisher in their hands trying to put out the flames. But it takes time. And as we have learned, Bushnell died in the hospital at some point later on. And look, it really speaks to the tensions that are continuing to escalate around the war in Gaza, not just across the world, but here in the United States. We saw a similar incident in December when someone self-immolated lit themselves on fire outside of the airport. Israeli consulate in Atlanta. But this feels different.
