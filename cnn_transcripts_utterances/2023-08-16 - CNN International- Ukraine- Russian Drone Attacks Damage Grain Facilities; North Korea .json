I'm Bianca Nobilo in London in for Max Foster.Just ahead, Ukraine accuses Russia of targeting food supplies following a drone attack on the Odesa region. We'll have the very latest. Then, North Korea acknowledges for the first time that U.S. soldier Travis King has crossed into its territory, claiming he was escaping, quote, racism within the U.S. Military. And we'll have a report from Maui, Hawaii, where the death toll from the wildfires now stands at 106 as officials warn that it could take weeks to identify the victims. Ukraine's grinding counteroffensive against Russia is inching forward, making slow but gradual gains. Kyiv claims its forces are consolidating their positions and have recaptured a southern eastern village in the Donetsk region. Ukraine, meanwhile, is once again accused Moscow of weaponizing food after overnight drone attacks damaged grain facilities in the south. It comes as a cargo ship left a key Black Sea port of Odesa for the first time since Russia abandoned the U.N.-brokered grain deal last month. CNN's Nada Bashir joins me now. Nada, let's return to those drone attacks and the impact they've had. And also what news you have to share about Russia's potential self-sufficiency when it comes to drones.",

      "sentences": "Well, we've seen the Russian Armed Forces relying heavily on these drone attacks, particularly over the last few weeks. And since that grain deal really fell through over the last month. And we've seen repeated drone attacks against the port of Odesa and other port infrastructure across that region.But now we are learning from new intelligence from the U.K. Defense Ministry that they believe in the coming months, Russia could secure self-sufficiency on that front. Now, for the main part, they have been relying on Iranian-made Shahed drones. They began importing these drones last year. But according to the U.K. Defense Ministry, they have now, they believe, begun deploying domestically produced drones based on the model of that Iranian-made Shahed drone. Now, this local manufacturing of these drones will essentially give Russia self-sufficiency on that front, that is believed to be the goal over the next few months, although at this stage, they are still relying on those Iranian-made drones and also on components and other weapons from their overseas partners and allies. And, of course, we've seen that in the missile attacks across Ukraine as well. Just yesterday, we heard from Ukrainian officials saying that they found 30 foreign chips within Russian-made missiles, it's a missiles that they believe were manufactured within Russia just in the last few months. So that is a huge concern. Ukraine is calling for more stringent measures, more stringent sanctions to ensure that foreign-made technology isn't getting into Russian hands.",

In state media, it said that Army Private Travis King had admitted that the intrusion was illegal. King dashed across the military demarcation line from South Korea into the North during a tour of the DMZ last month. A defense official tells CNN that the U.S. remains focused on King's safe return. King's mother, meanwhile, is appealing to Pyongyang to treat her son humanely. CNN's Paula Hancocks has the latest from Seoul. Paula, this is a remarkable story because the values of North Korea are antithetical to those of the United States. What could possibly have motivated Travis King to decide to do this?",

And they have pointed the finger squarely at the Rapid Support Forces, which, you'll know, 20 years ago there was a genocide in Darfur, and many blamed the Rapid Support Forces made up of the Janjaweed militia, who were described as the devils on horseback. And some are saying, it seems, that they have returned to finish the genocide that they started 20 years ago. And the situation is just very grim.

Meanwhile, Bianca, we are also learning about the potential strategy of defense from these defendants. Former Chief of Staff for former President Trump, Mark Meadows and his lawyers filing a formal petition to try to get a change of venue and moving it from a state court to federal court. He and his attorneys argue that anyone accused of a crime while allegedly working as a federal official should have their criminal proceedings moved to a federal court. And here is what they're saying in part of that filing saying, quote, \"Nothing Mr. Meadows is alleged of in the indictment to have done is criminal per se, arranging Oval Office meetings, contacting state officials on the President's behalf, visiting a state government building, and setting up a phone call for the President. One would expect a chief of staff to the President of the United States to do these sort of things\". Of course, Meadows has two charges in this indictment, one, with racketeering, the other for a violation of oath of office from a public official.

And now, new footage shows the moment an experimental sea drone detonated under the bridge. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh has this exclusive report.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It's become the most beleaguered symbol of Russian occupation. This weekend, Moscow saying this incident was just a smokescreen foiling a Ukrainian attack on the $4 billion Kerch Bridge, the link between Russia and occupied Crimea that Putin seems to dote on. Now CNN has obtained exclusive footage heralding a new way of warfare of another earlier devastating Ukrainian seaborne drone strike there in July from the Ukrainian security services, the SBU, who say they did it and more will follow. This is exactly what the drone pilot saw -- thermal imagery -- the water rippling as up to a ton of explosive approaches the bridge. The feed then obviously went dead as it hit the concrete. Russian officials said two civilians died in the attack. Cameras on the bridge captured the first blast on the road section. The cursor shows the drone moving in, and another on the railway tracks at about the same time. Ukraine has been coy. Some officials saying these huge blasts are from, quote, \"an identified floating object\" -- but no longer. The head of the Ukrainian security services told CNN this is just the start. VASYL MALIUK, HEAD OF SBU (through translator): Sea surface drones are a unique invention of the security service of Ukraine. None of the private companies are involved. Using these drones, we have recently conducted successful hits of the Crimean Bridge, a big assault ship, Olenegorsky Gornyak; and SIG tanker. WALSH (voice-over): This, another Ukrainian drone attack on the Russian amphibious assault boat, Olenegorsky Gornyak, on which Ukrainian officials said 100 personnel were on board. It was a remarkable feat carried out by a growing fleet of what they call the \"Sea Babies.\" Hundreds of miles away from Ukrainian bases and right in Russia's coastal heartland, it put the Black Sea's east suddenly at risk. MALIUK (through translator): These drones are produced in an underground production facility in Ukraine. We are working on a number of new, interesting operations, including in the Black Sea waters. I promise you it will be exciting, especially for our enemies. WALSH (voice-over): Ukraine's ingenuity again and again toppling the lumbering Russian Goliath. Nick Paton Walsh, CNN, Dnipro, Ukraine.
