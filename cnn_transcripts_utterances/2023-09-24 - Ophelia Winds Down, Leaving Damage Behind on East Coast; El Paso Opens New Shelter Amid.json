That is the real problem for Kevin McCarthy.They are still trying the same strategy that they have tried, the House Republicans, for the last couple of weeks, and it has gone nowhere. The strategy being, get House Republicans onboard behind one plan to try to improve their negotiating posture with the United States senate. But House Republicans are not united behind one plan. In fact, there are about seven or so holdouts refusing to accept move forward on a short-term spending bill to keep the government open. But McCarthy is still trying to convince those members to come along. Now, even if they were to get that out of the house, it is going nowhere in the Senate, because Republicans are putting spending cuts in there, border security measures, other things that Senate Democrats simply do not like, which means that they'll move closer and closer to that shutdown deadline. And, Victor, all of this comes as there is pressure from McCarthy's right flank not to cut a deal with Democrats, because of the warnings that they can actually seek a vote for his ouster. One member could call for a vote for his ouster. And yesterday when I spoke to one of Kevin McCarthy's closest allies, Garrett Graves, about that threat, that continues to loom, that people like Matt Gaetz, the congressman, are pushing, essentially, what Garrett Graves told me, he said he is drafting his own resolution to kick McCarthy out of the speakership and may put it on the floor just to get that shall off the table.

And also the key issue, of course, Ukraine, funding for the war for Ukraine. Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, told me last week that he plans to try to push in the Senate plan funding for Ukraine. The White House has requested $24 billion. Mitch McConnell has been staunchly an advocate of that. You know who's not? Kevin McCarthy, who has said that he does not believe that this should be part of this proposal.

Now, this strike that has paralyzed the entertainment industry has also had a major economic impact. Some estimates indicate $5 billion in an economic impact. And this has affected not just Hollywood, but really many, many other industries. A lot of the writers that I've talked to have told me, look, we are ready to return to work. But after a deal is reached between these two parties, WGA members still have to ratify the new contract and furthermore, because the actors are also on strike, a deal doesn't necessarily mean that all productions will go back to normal. But some in the industry do believe that a deal with the writers could speed up that process for the SAG-AFTRA negotiation s negotiations.

And these both in the south, where, of course, the main thrust of their counteroffensive is going, but also in the east, as well. There's two towns called Klishchiivka and Andriivka, which were taken by the Ukrainians a couple of days ago, and they say that they've actually been able to make some headway out of those towns, as well, and are further pushing the Russians back. They do say that there is heavy fighting going on in that area. It's near the town of Bakhmut, but they've been able to fend off those Russian counterattacks, entrench themselves and continue to move forward. In the south also, a pretty important picture there as well. We, of course, were able to speak with a commanding general on the southern front who's in charge of that Ukrainian counteroffensive and he confirmed to us and Ukraine has since further confirmed that they've been able to push through a Russian line of defense near a town called Verbove which is in the south of Ukraine, on that sort of axis of attack. It's a pretty important development for them there, because they believe from there, they will be able to push further south and then possibly make some serious gains in the not-too-distant future. But, of course, they do say the Russians continue to put up that stiff resistance. And, you know, one of the things that you guys were saying in the lead-in is, of course, a reality here on the ground as well, is that especially in those areas that are fairly close to the front lines, you do have a lot of shelling that's incoming into some of these Ukrainian towns. You guys were mentioning, Kherson, two people were killed there by what they say was Russian artillery. Also in the Zaporizhzhia region, which is close to that southern front line, also one person killed and a couple of people who were wounded near Kharkiv. So, all of that is going on. Obviously for the civilian population, not easy on the ground there and certainly a lot of people who have been killed and wounded already as the fighting has been going on. Nevertheless, the vibe that we're getting from the Ukrainian military, Ukrainian soldiers that we speak to is that it's very difficult for them on the ground right now, but they do say their morale is high, and they also say that right now, the momentum, both in the east and in the south, is on their side, Omar.",

And it's still going to be coming down across portions of the mid-Atlantic and areas of the northeast. This is still a very slow-moving system. The center of it still mainly focused, most of it, over Virginia. Remember, it made landfall in North Carolina yesterday. So it hasn't really moved all that much.That means it's had a lot of time to dump a tremendous amount of rain. Taking a look at this Hartfield, Virginia topping out at over five and a half inches. Same thing for Portsmouth Virginia. But even in North Carolina, they had pretty significant rainfall totals. Raleigh picking up over four inches. A lot of other places across North Carolina and Virginia picking up four and five inches. Now the main threat for the flooding begins to shift a little bit farther to the north and east. The biggest concern is going to be coastal flooding for areas of New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland and Virginia. Again one to two feet of flooding possible there. Keep in mind, even for inland areas, you're also going to be looking at flooding. The main concern there is the heavy rainfall coming down. It's still going to be slow, although I promise it will eventually make its way out to sea once we get to late Monday. But from now until late Monday, you're still going to have all of these rain bands continuing to cross the mid-Atlantic and the northeast. This includes cities like Philadelphia, New York, even stretching up into Boston. Most of these areas likely to pick up one to two inches, but especially across New York, you could still pick up 2, 3, even as much as 4 inches of rain total before this system finally pushes out. Now that's one of the things we're watching. We've also got a potential atmospheric river event taking shape in the Pacific Northwest. And also severe thunderstorms across the central portion of the U.S. A lot of these storms are already ongoing. We've had a severe thunderstorm watch already this morning. That one has since expired, but it's likely to pick up an additional severe thunderstorm watch or even tornado watch as we go through the afternoon. Damaging winds, large hail, and isolated tornadoes all possible today. This includes Dallas, Shreveport, even down through San Antonio. The timeline, gentlemen, of what we're mainly looking at here is the continuation of those storms this morning, but the bulk of the severe storms once again this afternoon.",
