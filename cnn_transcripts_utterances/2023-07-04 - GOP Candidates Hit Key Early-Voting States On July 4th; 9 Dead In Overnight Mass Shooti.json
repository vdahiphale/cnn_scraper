From Iowa to New Hampshire to the White House lawn, candidates hit parade, kissed babies, and tried to make their case face to face with voters with one notable exception. Then, a burst of blast, but not fireworks. Three more mass shootings in Texas, Indiana, and Philadelphia are the latest sites of a uniquely American tragedy. Plus, hidden cameras in the women's locker room exposed a troubling pattern of sexism and abuse. In this case, it was the police behind the offense.

Today is Independence Day in America, but it is no holiday for the many who are hoping to become the country's next commander in chief. Republicans are all out on the campaign trail in the key battleground states of Iowa, New Hampshire, where voters pride themselves on getting to know their candidates before casting the first ballots in the nation. CNN is following these candidates as they celebrate the 247th anniversary of America's independence. Kyung Lah is in Boone, Iowa. Omar Jimenez in Meramec, New Hampshire. But we begin with Jeremy Diamond over at the White House. So, Jeremy, lest we forget President Joe Biden is a candidate in this race, also running for re-election here. So, how is he spending the Fourth? JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, he certainly is, Abby. And today, President Biden focusing on honoring military families and veterans, as well. The president in an hour's time is going to host a barbecue, like many Americans around the country. But this one will be with active duty military families. The president is also expected to deliver remarks to those military families, focusing on the 50th anniversary of the U.S. military becoming an all-volunteer force, also commemorating the 75th anniversary of the military desegregation as well as the integration of women into the force. But I'm also told, Abby, that the president is going to be hitting on familiar campaigns. Some of which we hear from the president in official events, but also on the campaign trail. This notion that democracy is not guaranteed but it must be fought for, and also the work that remains to unify the country and to live up to this -- the nation's founding ideal that all men are created equal. Now, the president will then host a broader celebration this evening at the White House where he will also be watching fireworks, we're expecting some musical guests at the White House including the Brothers Osborne, and my personal favorite on the list tonight, Neo -- Abby.",

And one thing that really hangs over all of these GOP hopefuls here is are they going to be able to make inroads with what polls have shown so far to be the leader in this fight, former President Donald Trump. And, of course, that's why they come here on the ground to meet folks on the ground and try to make, again, inroads to some of these early voters.

His plan is to hit six counties this week in an effort to do what he is calling the full Grassley.So, he's inside doing his event, shaking hands, answering questions about SCOTUS, about, you know, the path forward that he sees as a conservative future for the country. But, earlier today, we did see him running that parade route. And when I say run, I mean run. The former vice president many times broke into a full jog in this very hot and humid weather as he tried to shake as many hands as he could along a two-mile parade route. He is trying to say that he is well known but not known well. And, of course, he is well known for being the vice president to Donald Trump. And it's something that he's had to address nearly at every stop. He is proud of what his administration when he was with the former administration, what they accomplished. But he's also had to field some questions. Reporters did ask what CNN has reported, that in the days after the 2020 election, that Trump did pressure Pence to call Arizona Governor Doug Ducey to try to find votes. Take a listen to Pence's answer. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MIKE PENCE (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: And I was asked to check in with a few governors. But there was no pressure. I was simply gathering information, passing that along. And you know, frankly, it was a very routine time. We were trying to determine where the process was in places like Georgia, places like Arizona that were going through a review of their election results.

I think it's going to continue. He has spoken of this campaign as the final battle, right? He's adding this sense of urgency and this sense of really doom for the country if he doesn't win the election. It's working, 50,000 people came out for him in Pickens, South Carolina, with, you know, so much energy that people stayed overnight just to see him speak. So, he's speaking to his crowd. It works for him. Again, in a general election, will that bring people together? That is the question.

When you have someone like Tim Scott putting out a Fourth of July video saying, you know, don't cancel the founders, saying things like, you know, America is not racist, while it comes across as someone who is positive and optimistic, other voters see that as somebody who is putting their head in the sand about the realities of systemic racism in this country, about the realities of things that really impact people's lives.And people are looking for leaders who address those issues and who don't just say I'm -- I'm the token in the room, I'm happy to be here, I'm proud to be an American, but they're not able to really confront those difficult issues. So I'm not surprised that they're not addressing it. I'm not surprised that some of those candidates aren't addressing it, but they certainly are using their positionality whether it's Nikki Haley, you know, her background, or Tim Scott, we see the difference.

Militant group Hamas taking credit for the attack, calling it a response to Israel's military raid in the occupied West Bank city of Jenin, the largest incursion into the West Bank since the days of the Second Intifada. Israel says its aim it to dismantle the hornet's nest Jenin has become for militants. Overnight targeting underground tunnels used to store explosive devices in the camp.

We are still seeing reports of clashes and even in the last two hours or so an air strike, what the IDF said it's targeting armed militants.

We are expecting to hear from him in just a few moments at a Fourth of July celebration at the White House with active duty military families. He'll be honoring the military in his remarks. We also expect the president and likely the first family to be watching the fireworks on the National Mall tonight. As you know, the Truman balcony has a great view of the National Mall.

And they were in a bad way.And the rescuers from the marine mammal care center put them in a truck, take them to their center, and basically try and flush this toxin out of the sea lions. The problem is there are so many of them that that center is getting pretty full. Now why is this happening? Well, there's a toxic algae growing out there that is then eaten by little fish, those fish are then eaten by the dolphins and the sea lions. And it attacks their brains, lesions, seizures, confusion. Making them sometimes a little aggressive which is why beach-goers on this beautiful perfect beach day, the sun is out, cooling wind, are being told to stay away. Now, I swim in this bay pretty much every morning. And usually the sea lions don't come close to us. But about a week or two ago, one sea lion circled the group that I swim with and actually bit one of the people who I swim with. Their brains are being eaten away by this neurotoxin. Why is this happening? Well, it could be upswell of cold nutrient-rich water that's feeding this algae. It could also be what I call city juice. We've had a lot of rain here this winter which washes stuff off the streets of these coastal towns into the ocean, and also that is a nutrient for algae, city juice. Sounds horrible. It is. So, they are saying that people should stay away from them. You should also not eat shellfish because the shellfish could be contaminated. And humans can die. But listen, you can tell humans not to eat shellfish and stay away from the sea lions. You can't tell sea lions not to eat fish. So the only solution, take them to the center and keep them out of the water until they can prove that it's safe again -- Abby.",
