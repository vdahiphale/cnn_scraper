Follow along folks, because you're not expecting this one. CNN is projecting that entrepreneur Jason Palmer will win the Democratic caucuses in the American territory of American Samoa. Jason Palmer defeats President Joe Biden in the territory of American Samoa. Now, Palmer is an entrepreneur. He's an investor. He's previously worked with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Let's take a look at what we see here. It is with 99 percent of the estimated vote in, 56 percent of the vote went to Jason Palmer. That's 51 votes. That's just 11 ahead, but enough to win against Joe Biden, the incumbent president, who has 44 percent of the vote. So, that's 91 people turned out to vote, and a majority of them went to Jason Palmer, who now wins American Samoa. Dana, I know you've been preparing for this announcement for weeks, if not months.

Trump obviously is coming in and planning on speaking at this party that he's having at Mar-a-Lago.And one way -- one thing to watch is how does he handle Nikki Haley? Because, of course, in Iowa, we saw how he came out and he kind of dismissed her and Ron DeSantis. In New Hampshire, he was seething mad, didn't care at all about his own victory, was just mad that Nikki Haley was still in the race. After South Carolina, he did not mention her by name. And we know, for her part, she's also doing something different tonight, which is that she's not expected to make any public appearances. We've heard from her after every other election night.

They didn't publicly say what that figure would be, but it was really a delegate game for them. We'll have to see how that plays out by the end of the night here.But those who are close with Nikki Haley and her campaign have already begun having discussions about what is next for her. Their campaign is getting a lot of feedback on the discussion as to whether or not she should endorse former President Trump if she ends her own presidential bid. And there's one camp of folks who thinks that she should endorse him because it would be good for the party. It would show her as a team player. It would show some unity. But then there's another group who have voiced their opinion to the campaign as well who ardently believe that she should not endorse him because they don't think that it would be good for her. They think that it would give her flexibility to speak out against Trump down the road. They think it could potentially give her the option to build something on her own after this presidential campaign. Both of those sides have voiced those opinions to the campaign in recent days and weeks, I'm told by multiple sources. And the context here is that Nikki Haley initially made that pledge that she would stand behind. She would endorse the eventual nominee of the Republican Party, that was late last summer, in order to get on the debate stage. But in recent days, she has essentially said that she no longer believes that she has to uphold that commitment. And she's given two reasons for that. She said the RNC is not the same RNC as it was when she made the initial commitment. She's also pointed out that Donald Trump never made that commitment, so she doesn't necessarily have to uphold her end of the bargain here. So, that's an area for us to continue watching as we watch to see what her campaign will do after the results are all in tonight. Jake?",

He mentioned unity multiple times, which is what every single surrogate and Trump ally that has gone out tonight and urged her to drop out of the race has said for unity. And he made clear that this was focused solely on President Biden. He told a lot of lies in that statement, things that were not true. He talked about inflation in this country. He talked about energy production. As of late December, the United States was purchasing more oil than any country in history. So, that's not something that the White House often wants to tout.

This campaign, as we have said from the beginning, is going to be a very close campaign. It's going to be hand to hand combat. Every vote matters. Both campaigns are going to have to fight hard for this win.I would note for you guys tonight, because you've been covering most of the Trump results, that Nikki Haley is really kind of doing better than people expected to. And as was said earlier by John, she's winning in places where presidential elections are decided. And in that group of people, those folks are tired of Donald Trump taking the Republican Party as they once knew it. The party where the Cheneys and the Bushes and the Reagans and the Romneys and all of those folks used to live and eviscerated it. And it's one of the reasons that we think that we have a really good chance. And that's where we're going to spend a lot of time, as well as securing our base. And we're going to get after it. And tonight, you know, the campaign started up to this point. People didn't really think it was going to be Biden versus Trump. But here we are, and we're ready to go.",

But I want to come back to your Haley point in a minute, because I agree, huge target of opportunity for the Biden campaign in places that matter. However, where we are today, as Jake just noted, you say everything Donald Trump said, there was a lie. The American people remember his presidency. They remember he wanders about as far from the truth as you can get regularly.And yet at this moment, not only is he marching to the republican nomination, but if you look at the general election polling, he is stronger now than he was weeks and months ago, including your friend, Debbie Dingell, would say, I'm going to just touch here, that if the election were held tomorrow, goodbye, Michigan. I'll just start at that one. I'll just start at that one. We talked a little bit about this last week, about the uncommitted vote in Michigan, because the Arab-Americans out there are mad. A lot of the younger voters are mad. When, when will we see the president of the United States not sending the national security team out, not sending the campaign team out, but going there, spending the time, and I would argue, not at a big rally, but in a small room, taking his hits and answering the questions?",
