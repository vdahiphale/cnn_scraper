A total of eight House Republicans are opposing Johnson's two-tiered spending plan. Johnson's proposal would temporarily fund the government, setting deadlines in January and February for the passage of permanent department budgets. CNN Capitol Hill reporter, Melanie Zanona, joins us now. All right, Mel, that many Republicans against Johnson means he's going to likely need Democrats to avoid a shutdown. What does that mean?",

      "sentences": "Speaker Mike Johnson finds himself in almost the exact same position that his predecessor, Kevin McCarthy, did. He's going to need to rely on some Democratic votes here to avoid a government shutdown at the end of this week.Conservatives don't like this plan because it does not include spending cuts. It would extend government funding at current levels. But Johnson did try to give them a concession by the way he structured this government funding plan. It's going to fund the government in two tranches. First, four agencies will be funded until January. And then the rest of the agencies will be funded until sometime in February. But that clearly was not enough to win over conservative hardliners, who are balking at this plan. The question really becomes, what are House Democrats going to do? And so far, they have not exactly said what they want to do. They are keeping an open mind. They recognize this doesn't include spending cuts or include any policy riders. However, they don't like its complicated structure of this two-step plan. They also don't like it doesn't include money for Israel, Ukraine, Taiwan or the border, something the White House has requested. Meanwhile, the White House did put out a statement initially blasting this plan, but ultimately, they may have to swallow this at the end of the day. But before they get to final passage, Mike Johnson will have to clear a key procedural vote in the House. Typically, those procedural votes are done along party lines. But this year, conservatives have been willing to take those procedural votes down if they don't like the substance of the bill. So we'll get our first glimpse on the floor tomorrow when they try to do that procedural vote for that spending plan. At this point, it's unclear how they are going to act. But we'll see whether they are going to give Mike Johnson a longer leash to govern -- Bri?",

So this can have some significant impacts on travel and the impact of travel can also have an impact on top. We'll see if this plays out. It really comes during a huge Thanksgiving travel season. That is the forecast from airlines, from AAA and from the federal government. The TSA just said that the Sunday after Thanksgiving will likely be the busiest day for air travel ever. When you think about each day, the two days prior, 2.6 million expected on Tuesday, 2.7 million people expected at airports nationwide on Wednesday, the day before Thanksgiving, 2.9 million on Sunday. The best record was June 30th, 2023, 2.88 million people, the biggest number TSA has seen in its existence. When you think about that against the biggest number, 51 million people expected to travel 50 miles or more over the Thanksgiving holiday, it really is going just to be icing on the cake if the shutdown does come to pass.

The biggest question now is, why did this Secret Service agent fire a weapon at the people attempting to break into that government vehicle? The question is, was the agent's life in danger, because that would be the protocol for actually firing a weapon. The agent isn't allowed to just fire to protect that vehicle or to protect other property. But this incident really does highlight the severe uptick in crime around Washington, D.C. Motor vehicle theft is up 98 percent over the past year. Here's the statement on this. The most details we have gotten so far from the Secret Service. It says, \"On November 12th -- that was last night -- \"around 11:58 p.m. in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, D.C., Secret Service agents encountered possibly three individuals breaking a window on a parked and unoccupied government vehicle. \"During this encounter, a federal agent discharged a service weapon, and it is believed that no one was struck.\" That's from the spokesperson. He did continue to say that the people trying to break into that government vehicle did immediately flee the area in a red car. And then a regional lookout was issued to supporting units, including MPD here in Washington. The Secret Service is also saying there was never any threat to any protectee. A source confirmed with our team that the agent involved in firing this weapon is assigned to Naomi Biden's detail. She's the granddaughter of President Biden and the first lady. The oldest daughter of Hunter Biden. She lives in Georgetown. So, Brianna, few details being released. But we're expecting more as this investigation continues. Naomi Biden, nor anyone else in danger at all. So this investigation does continue -- Brianna?",

A judge had to issue a warrant and, in order to do that, they had to be presented with probable cause that some crime or evidence of a crime could be found on those electronic devices. What we don't know is whether the mayor is the one who committed that crime. As you said, he has not been directly named at any of these investigations. Then over the weekend, we learned just a little bit more about the investigation. \"The New York Times\" has been reporting that part of what investigators are looking into is whether or not the mayor, before taking office in 2021, used his power as Brooklyn borough president to influence and interfere with the local fire department. To ensure that the Turkish consulate would get permits that it was trying to acquire in order to open up their headquarters. Now as you said, the mayor has issued a statement saying that, as borough president, this is part of what he was supposed to do in office to help his constituents and his constituencies. And has, again, said over and over that he has nothing to hide and he will cooperate with officials. But this is getting more and more closer to the mayor every time, and a drip, drip of details coming out about this investigation. So certainly, a lot of questions for the mayor and his administration tomorrow, when we expect to hear from him to see if he will say anything more about what this investigation is about and why he thinks electronic devices were seized -- Brianna?",
