Well, be sure to tune in, the final two all-new episodes of \"THE MANY LIVES OF MARTHA STEWART,\" air tonight 9I'm Fredricka Whitfield, and we begin this hour with several developing stories around the globe. Right now severe storms are sweeping into California. An atmospheric river is inundating the state and expected to bring heavy rain, hurricane-force wind gusts and potentially life-threatening flooding. Nearly 40 million people are under flood watches right now and evacuations are underway in some areas. We have live coverage of this major storm. Also, new developments at the U.S. southern border. Republican governors from more than a dozen states showing their support for Texas. The state is feuding with the federal government over the border crisis and access to the border itself. Texas officials refusing to tear down barriers despite a U.S. Supreme Court order. We'll have the latest from the ground. And new reaction from the latest U.S. strikes in the Middle East. The U.S. and U.K. hitting at least 36 Houthi targets in Yemen on Saturday. Houthi rebels vowing to retaliate. And it follows U.S. strikes on Iran-backed militias in Syria and Iraq. A response to a deadly attack on U.S. troops in Jordan. All right. We begin with new evacuation orders over the threat of mudslides in Los Angeles County. The second of back-to-back storms bringing potentially life-threatening floods to California. And now portions of the Owens Brush Fire burn scar zone must evacuate through Tuesday. Strong winds and intense rain causing flight delays and cancellations at San Francisco's airport and leaving more than 180,000 without power across the state. CNN's Camila Bernal is live for us near at the Los Angeles River and meteorologist Elisa Raffa is tracking this major storm system from the CNN Weather Center. Camila, you first. It looks like the wind gusts are starting to pick up.",

But really authorities saying these are the last hours at least here in Los Angeles County where people can get ready for the storm. They are asking people not to travel if they don't have to. They're asking people to maintain just an eye on all of the information to make sure they have an emergency kit in place.And if you're under those evacuation orders, they are asking you to pack your things and go to a shelter or go to a friend's house. The concern here in Los Angeles area is anywhere near the river areas that flood and the Canyons, because of the high potential for dangerous debris, for landslides. And so people in those areas need to know or need to make the move as soon as they can. There are evacuation orders here in Los Angeles, further north in Santa Clara County, in San Jose, also in Ventura County and Santa Barbara County. Classes in a couple of districts in Santa Barbara County have already been canceled for tomorrow. So really authorities just telling people to keep an eye out and to be prepared because overall we are expecting power outages throughout the state. So authorities telling people to prepare to be without power, maybe for a few hours or even longer if that ends up being the case. The idea here is to get everyone as prepared as possible. Officials here in California say they already have about 8500 people ready to go in case things get worse. That includes swift-water rescue teams, helicopter teams, and just people ready to go in case the situation gets worse. In the meantime, though, there are many people here in Los Angeles, and around California, who are preparing, going to grab maybe sandbags from their local fire station because that really is some of the things that you can start doing now before the storm comes. I want you to listen to what one L.A. resident told me about what he was doing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

You could see the kind of plume there that just continues to pull into parts of central and northern California. And you see the little lightning strike. That's where the center of the storm is and it's deepening and it is intensifying and that's where those winds are picking up.A lot of the heaviest rain so far has been from San Francisco into Sacramento there. And that's where we've had problems in the air with some problems at the airport in San Francisco. Wind gusts have already been 75 to 80 to 85 miles per hour in some of those mountain peaks. So just incredibly gusty. And that's what's knocking out power. The latest count is over 180,000 customers in California without power. And again, the worst of it has not pivoted south yet to L.A. and San Diego, where you have those huge population centers, too. This is that high risk of flooding which is incredibly rare not just for California, but really for the entire U.S. Fewer than 4 percent of our days have that excessive high risk. But they are responsible for 80 percent of our flood damage and 40 percent of our flood deaths. And it's not just today. We also have a high risk that includes Los Angeles again tomorrow as that heavy rain just continues to pile into Southern California. So it's a multiple day event here. We're looking at dangerous and life-threatening flash floods, river and urban flooding, the mud debris and the landslides over the burn scars in the downed trees and power lines that we've already seen has knocked out that power. Look at the wind warnings. All of that deep red there gusts up to 80 miles per hour. The first time ever hurricane-force winds warning for the central coast of California. As you could see the winds really packing there today and into tomorrow. So you could see the rain and notice in Southern California how it lasts for days on end.

Now to put that in perspective, L.A.'s annual rain for severe rain the entire year they get about 12 inches so if we get six inches totals, that's six months' worth of rain.If we get anything more than that, we're getting near annual totals.

U.S. Central Command says the strikes were conducted in self-defense and included Houthi anti- ship cruise missiles that were preparing to launch. The strikes hit 36 targets across 13 locations. They were aimed at military storage facilities as well as other weapons used by the Houthis to attack shipping lanes in the Red Sea. A day earlier the U.S. launched a series of airstrikes on Iran-backed militias in Syria and Iraq, and that was in retaliation for last week's attack in Jordan which killed three American soldiers.

There has been a lot of progress in the last couple of weeks to move towards the next hostage deal and we know that the United States is -- the Israelis, the Egyptians, and the Qataris all agreed to this kind of broad framework that Hamas is now looking over and a response from Hamas could potentially come while the secretary of state is in the region.

And so that's not just by the way African-American voters. We're seeing it with Hispanic voters. We're seeing it with younger voters. And so the big question in any election in terms of the outcome, in terms of how well a candidate performs is always how enthused and how interested that base of support is going into an election. And so I think the Biden campaign has reason to be concerned. They're going to have to figure out a way to motivate those voters and to really encourage them. Now some of this will come naturally.

And what these governors are saying is that they're citing with what Texas Governor Greg Abbott is doing.Now I'm in Shelby Park. This is the park that the state of Texas took over a few weeks ago. Imagine your central park wherever you are around the country. This is their central park here in Eagle Pass. And what the state did overnight one day is they wrapped it with razor wire. And they blocked the entrances with gates and they plopped Humvees and soldiers with long guns. And so, this community no longer has access to their public park and border patrol was also denied access. So, I asked Governor Greg Abbott, his rationale for not allowing Border Patrol to gain access to this park since what he's arguing is that the federal government is not enforcing border policy. But how can Border Patrol enforce border policy, if they don't have access? Here's what he said. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. GREG ABBOTT (R-TX): To be clear, from the very beginning, and to this moment, they have access to the boat ramp, and they have access to the razor wire area if anybody's life is in danger.

CNN's Bill Weir embedded with a team of researchers exploring how the crisis is impacting wildlife. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): We finally get a chance to go ashore and are greeted by thousands of Gentoo penguins. (on-camera): How can you not love penguins? My little boy is obsessed with penguins. And I'm obsessed with penguins because they walk like my little boy, like toddlers on land. And they're so chill and curious. We had a log jam of the passengers on the ship because one penguin was standing in the middle of the trail. And we got to be respectful little local. This is their neighborhood, we're visitors. (voice-over): But our delight turns to worry. As we learn that these birds are building nests for chicks that have no chance of survival. The warming climate brought enough freakish spring snow this year that it delayed nesting season for weeks. Chicks born this late won't have enough time to grow feathers and fat needed to get through winter. (on-camera): Of course, what connects these little guys to the seals and whales is krill, that little shrimp like critters that needs sea ice to both reproduce and to feed, and the problem is sea ice is going away down here. And scientists are really concerned about what that means for the future these ecosystems. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It turns out that that is the one species actually thriving amid climate change. Why? Because they are moving with the changes. They're moving their nests further -- further south, other species like -- yep, Chinstraps or Rockhopper penguins are trying to raise their chicks in these flooded ancient nesting zones and their numbers are crashing.So, there's a lesson for humans here. A humpback whales are kind of like the Gentoos, the most adaptable whale, you see them in every ocean. We saw one about a mile from Times Square a couple years ago that came up the Hudson River. And but there's a limit to how they can adapt because of that sea ice. And because of that, krill. So tonight, I learned so much. I had my mind blown dozens of times making this special is beautiful, but also give us some real concrete signals of what's happening to our planet and we're all connected to these distant creatures as --",

So, you touched on that, you know, OK, while penguins are adapting it -- the food source is still really important. So, while they are adapting if, you know krill is -- is now in short supply or they're dangerous with that, what are they doing about food?[16:45:08] WEIR: Well, there's actually new stresses now. So, the whale, the whale industry, industrial whaling has largely gone the way of the dodo. It's gone extinct now. But now these, these big pots of whales are competing with krill fisheries.

There is enough krill and it would be great if we got more whales on the planet, the more the better. They -- they suck down carbon, they seed the oceans, they create marine life with their poo everywhere they go.So, this is sort of a call to action both to be aware of that, but there are already mechanisms in place to try to protect these places before they're all gone.
