Kennedy.And the Kennedy family matriarch recently passed away at the age of 96 after suffering a stroke earlier this month. Former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, you see there, are expected to speak as well during the service. So we'll be monitoring this moment. Back to the race for the White House. Former President Trump getting some help in Pennsylvania from one of the world's best-known and also most-controversial billionaires, it's fair to say. Elon Musk just posting that he'll be campaigning for Trump in the critical swing state, starting today through Monday. And new federal election filings show that the world's richest man is getting much more than his time to Trump's reelection bid.",

Dominic Patten joins us now live. He's the executive editor of \"Deadline Hollywood.\" Dominic, thank you so much for being with us. I think a lot of this new interest in the Menendez brothers is tied to the Netflix series that's really brought public interest in the case. And also celebrities that have long advocated for them. Including Rosie O'Donnell. Because in a recent interview, she said that she spoke to them and their lawyer. We have that sound byte. Let's listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ROSIE O'DONNELL, ADVOCATE FOR MENENDEZ BROTHERS: I called them after I spoke to Marc last night about doing this appearance. And I said, What's going on? And they said we -- you know, there hesitant to hope after being in jail, in prison for 35 years and being abused from his childhood up to that point.

Simpson, Harvey Weinstein, and many others. Celebrity advocacy -- Kim Kardashian has also been someone who has come to the Menendez's defense. That's been a huge part of this. But as you also mentioned, there has been the recent Netflix drama series \"Monster.\" But perhaps, more importantly, last year, there was a Peacock docuseries about the two brothers where what some are calling new evidence was introduced. Which is a letter from one of the brothers to one of their cousins detailing sexual abuse from their father, music executive, Jose Menendez. And there was also a letter from one of the members of the boy band, Menudo, talking about sexual abuse that he claims he suffered at the hands of the Menendez brothers' father. So all of this is bubbling up at the same time, which is also -- and I should point out, you mentioned that the D.A. has recently reviewed new discovered evidence. Well, it's not that new. They've had it for a year. A lot of people are here. On October 3rd, the D.A., George Gascon, who is in a very, very bad looking campaign where he's down over 20 points, went before the press to say, oh, we've got this evidence and we're thinking about doing something. And there's going to be a hearing in November. So there's a lot of inner politics -- inner L.A. politics going on here. I mean, this is L.A. You guys know, car crashes and the weather and true crime are the currency of the realm. And the Menendez brothers have certainly been delivering the dividends for decades.",

He's crazy.\" And, Dominic, advocates for the brothers, and this includes -- and we mentioned, some of the high-profile folks. But there's also Kim Kardashian, who's advocating for them.

      "sentences": "That's right, Brianna and Boris. You know, this does make sense because we know interest rates have been sky high for years. Bank Rate says the average credit card rate is above 20 percent, just shy of the all-time high.So this New York Fed survey finds that the average perceived probability of missing a minimum debt payment stands at 14 percent. Now, this is the fourth straight month where this number has gone up. And as you mentioned, this is the highest level since April of 2020 when millions of people were losing their jobs. Outside of the pandemic, you have to go back to January 2017 for a higher figure there. And just to note, this is measuring all debt. So, yes, credit cards, but also mortgages and car loans and student debt as well. And this is clearly a sign that some Americans, despite low unemployment and cooling inflation, some people are obviously still feeling financial stress, especially lower-income households. Because this survey found, for those making under 50K a year, they have a 20 percent chance of missing their payments. There's a 20 percent perceived chance of missing their minimum debt payment. That is more than twice as high as those making more than 100K a year. And we know that, to get by right now, a lot of people are relying on credit card debt. And credit card debt has never been higher, over $1.1 trillion right now. I think the good news is that, right now, paychecks are consistently going up faster than prices. So that really helps. And also the Fed has finally started to lower those sky-high interest rates.",

One thing is you can buy time by transferring that high interest debt to a 0 percent balance transfer card. For up to 21 months, you could have no interest on that debt. Sometimes you can also get a lower rate if you go with a personal loan. For homeowners, obviously, home prices are high right now, so a lot of them should be able to take out a home equity loan or a home equity line of credit. And I know it's easier said than done, but you can also try to lower your expenses or boost your income perhaps through a side hustle. But again, that's easier said than done.
