Alzheimer's affects 55 million people globally with one in ten Americans over 65 suffering from dementia.Joining us now is CNN medical correspondent Dr. Tara Narula. Good morning to you. DR.

And so, this was a global study that looked at about 1,900 patients who were given a subcutaneous injection of a drug called, I'm going to say this, gantanernmab, which is a monoclonal antibody that targets amyloid plax (ph) in the brain and tries to remove them. We've seen studies like this before on different types of drugs and, unfortunately, it did not meet what we call its primary end point, which was to show a significant reduction in cognitive decline. It also did not show as much promise in terms of the amount of amyloid that it was able to remove from the brain.So really disappointing. Roche, which is the drugmaker, you know, expressed their disappointment but also their hope that this adds data to the field which, you know, we've seen a lot of setbacks in terms of these Alzheimer's drugs.",

If you pick up the cancer early, your survival can be over 60 percent. Forty-four percent of people are caught in late stages. Guess what the survival is at that point? Seven percent.So, we really need to get the word out about annual screening in those people who are at risk. Those are people who are 50 to 80, who have a 20-pack year history, who are either current smokers or have quit in the last 15 years.

But there's still absolutely what I hear from not only Nevadans, but my own family, is --and I see it when I'm grocery shopping or filling up my gas tank, we still have those high prices. So, that is a priority to lower those costs, to lower the gas prices, to make sure we have housing that people really can afford, whether they are rentals or they're first-time home buyers. We still have housing prices that are too high.So, there is work to be done, and my focus and my legislation already is around lowering -- continuing to lower those costs. You know, we've done it already with the Inflation Reduction Act. And that gave me the ability to talk about how we can work together and show that we can get it done if we just put our heads together and we work together. You know, I think at the end of the day it's for everybody to focus on lowering these costs, and that's what I talk to Nevadans about. You know, we -- we lowered health care costs around prescription drugs and for the first time we capped the cost of insulin. We were lowering energy costs for so many families and homeowners. But there's more work to be done. And Nevadans get that.
