Kaitlan, thank you for that.The Gun Violence Archives says there have been more -- at least 160 -- 146 rather mass shooting so far in the United States this year. It's only April, right? We're only four months in. More than 200 people have been killed and hundreds more injured by guns in this country again this year, and this means that more Americans are experiencing gun-related violence as a victim, family or victim -- family of victim or witness. The new survey by Kaiser Family Foundation shows one in five adults, so that's 20 percent of American adults, say they have been threatened with a gun at some point in their life. CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta joins us now. They're so much stunning, but let's start with the headlines out of this survey. DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  This gives you a real sort of snapshot into the psyche of the United States right now when it comes to guns and some of the numbers you just mentioned there, but about 50,000 people die of gun violence every year, about half suicides, half homicides and the numbers have been going up. They went up considerably over the past few years. That's one of the concerns. But just in terms of the daily worry, how much people worry about this on a regular basis, how many people have been affected by this directly, that's what the survey really tried to get at. And as you mentioned, if you look at adults specifically, the experience with gun-related incidents, 17 percent have witnessed -- about one in five have witnessed someone gets shot. Close to the same number, a little bit higher, have had family members who have been killed by a gun, again, either homicide or suicide, 21 percent have been threatened with a gun. When you look at these numbers, I mean, they're pretty staggering. And keep in mind as you as you sort of think about this, that gun violence is now the leading cause of death among children and teens that surpassed car accidents over the last couple of years. And then if you ask this question, how often do people fear this? How big a deal is it in their sort of daily lives? What you come to find is that the numbers again have been increasing, but 40 percent worry about this sometimes, 10 percent worry about it almost every day and 8 percent worry about it every day. They're thinking about this more and more. So, the numbers have been increasing overall and America's perceptions of that have followed suit as well.",

      "sentences": "Yes. I'm going to show you some of these numbers, and I'm going to preface by saying this. It's been hard to collect this sort of data in many places. You can't even ask about guns in the household. You can't ask if a gun is present. You can't ask how the gun is stored. So, it's hard to get this sort of data.This was based on a survey, again, by the Kaiser Family Foundation. They found that the way the guns were stored, 36 percent are stored loaded. That's not how they should be stored. 44 percent stored unlocked and 52 percent stored in the same location as ammunition. That's one of the big concerns here is that, you know more houses have guns than before. The numbers have been going up. And how they are stored potentially being sources of danger again, especially for young people, that has gone up as well. So, that's one of the concerns here as we try and figure out solutions with regard to guns, simply addressing how they are stored, doing it as safely as possible is one of the things that survey focused on.",

You know, one of the things, Kaitlan, that stood out and sort of in this report, I'm going to show you some of the numbers, but about 20 percent, about one in five parents nowadays, they have considered moving their kids out of their current school because of the concerns about gun violence. Where exactly they would move, that's a little less clear. But that's how big a problem this is, how big a concern.When you talk to parents specifically about this, 38 percent said they worry about it sometimes, 13 percent almost every day and 12 percent worry about this every day. If you have children younger than 18 in your house right now, about a quarter of you think about this almost all the time, which is, again, staggering. This wasn't something that, you know, really registered as much certainly a decade ago, even a few years ago, but these numbers have been increasing. And not just the numbers of people who are dying by gun violence, close to 50,000 year, but the toll now on the American psyche. We haven't really gotten a glimpse of that in the past.",

That held up through the Clinton years, through the Clinton administration, and, actually, it was very unusual for presidents to even try and claim that they wanted to protect presidential communications like this.And so what Donald Trump is doing is the unusual thing, what the criminal investigators are doing here is pretty much in line with what they have been able to do historically.
