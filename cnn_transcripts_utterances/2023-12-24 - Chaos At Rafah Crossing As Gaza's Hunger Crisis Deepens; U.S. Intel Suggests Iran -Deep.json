This is new video obtained by CNN showing a chaotic scene at the Rafah Crossing near the Gaza-Egypt border earlier today.Gunfire can be heard as crowds are seen running in different directions. People are growing desperate with little access to basic essentials like food and water. The United Nations warned this week that roughly a quarter of Gaza's population, some half million people, are now starving. Let's go straight to CNN's Will Ripley live for us in Tel Aviv with more on all of this. Will, what's the latest on that situation at the Rafah Crossing? It just looks like total chaos?",

      "sentences": "Well, you have people, 80% of Gaza's population who've been displaced, many of them multiple times and a lot of them have now come to the south where supplies are scarce, living conditions are horrific and aerial bombardment continues.But this situation here is basically when you combine months of anxiety and stress and it all comes to a boiling point. In that one area, the Rafah Crossing, which is in southern Gaza, the lifeline essentially between Egypt and the line of aid trucks that can try to come in, a few dozen trucks coming in over the course of today. People so desperate to get their hands on the supplies that they rush the trucks and they try to grab what they can. And you see in some of these videos, people have just huge bundles that they are either carrying on their shoulders, you know, grasping in front of themselves, trying to make a run for it. And then at some point, on top of all of that chaos, somebody opens fire and then there's multiple gunshots that you can hear, you know, and people in the crowd then panicking as a result of that. You can only imagine starving people who are panicked and stressed and then they get in a crowd situation, this whole nightmare that they're living through. Just listen, just take a moment and listen to this. And what this means, unfortunately, is that the aid that needs to go in in an orderly fashion and be distributed in an orderly fashion likely will not get to the majority of the people who actually need it, because a lot of the aid is lost when there's a looting situation like that. And it just gets lost in the shuffle, lost in the crowd. And it's not going to the children and to the people who are, you know, living in tents who've had to endure several days of horrible weather here. Finally, the sky is clear today, but we had torrential rain and thunderstorms throughout much of the weekend, a time that hundreds of thousands of Gazans were once again told that they had to relocate because the Israeli military is now intensifying its efforts, not just in the north, but now in central Gaza and even moving towards the south, trying to gain operational control, take it away from Hamas. And then you have a situation like this, a true humanitarian catastrophe unfolding on the streets of Gaza, the desperation evident in this video that we have obtained. And still very difficult to get a lot of information out of Gaza because there's barely internet, barely electricity, much of the time, hard to get a signal out. And so, so much confusion and so much panic and so much desperation right now.",

      "sentences": "All right, Kevin Liptak, Will Ripley, thanks to both of you on this very busy Christmas Eve. Thanks so much. Here in Washington, Donald Trump is arguing that pressuring election officials to overturn the 2020 election was within his official responsibilities as president. That argument was part of a brief file last night in which attorneys for the former President asked an appeals court to dismiss his criminal election subversion case one day after the Supreme Court refused to decide for now whether he is protected from prosecution.In the filing, Trump's attorneys argued that, quote, \"President Trump has absolute immunity.\" The judicial branch cannot sit in judgment over a president's official acts. The legal wrangling could push a verdict into the heat of the 2024 campaign, or even after the election, in which case, if reelected, Trump is all but certain to try to pardon himself. Let's discuss now with Ron Brownstein, Senior Political Analyst and Senior Editor at The Atlantic, and Julian Zelizer, a Senior Political Analyst and Professor at Princeton University. Guys, happy holidays. Thanks so much for being with us. Ron, I mean, Trump claims he has absolute immunity. That legal argument so far has not convinced the courts. I mean, it strikes me as a historically ignorant because, I mean, why would Gerald Ford have pardoned Richard Nixon? If presidents have absolute immunity, you don't need to be pardoned. But walk us through this. What's your sense of it?",

This is a specious argument that if a president has absolute immunity, you could literally shoot someone on Fifth Avenue as president or call in a fighter strike on an American city as president.And it is likely that eventually the Supreme Court is going to reject this argument. I think most people who, you know, follow the court closely believe that. The question is when and how far they allow Trump in his core strategy really throughout his career, long before he was president, to use delay as a weapon in the legal system. Jim, I can imagine a world I know we're not supposed to think of the court like this, but John Roberts operates a little like a legislative leader who tries to put together packages that appeal, you know, sometimes to incompatible interests by including ideas that either side would reject in a legislative bill. And you can imagine an outcome as he did with the ACA back in 2012, where they allow Trump to appear on the ballot, throw out the Colorado ruling, but also reject his claims of immunity and allow voters to have the information before the election about whether a jury of his peers finds him guilty of these serious charges.",

I think the intent here is not necessarily even to win in court, but to keep this going longer and longer and pushing it further into the election cycle. President Trump -- former President Trump doesn't want this resolved. In some ways, his campaign is about the cases. And so the longer this drags out, the further we are from conviction in his mind, he's in the best position politically.",

I mean, Trump's goal is to have it not be resolved because we see in polling that it may sound incredible given how much information is out there, given what people saw with their own eyes, but there is a significant slice of voters that say, that a conviction might matter to them more than an indictment has for Trump.And, you know, John Roberts and the rest of the Supreme Court, they live in the real world. They know what Trump is trying to do, trying to push this out as far as he can so it is not resolved before the election. And they have a choice to make, whether they want to be complicit in that or not. And I've got to think that, you know, Roberts, as much as possible, wants unanimous decisions on these kind of momentous questions that 5-4 back in 2000 was really the beginning of the Supreme Court's dissent in the eyes of the public into becoming seen as a more partisan institution. I think he would like to avoid that. And it may be the way to avoid that is to, you know, in essence, join these two -- these two rulings. I'd also point out that, you know, the idea that clearly the indictments have helped Trump in terms of the nomination. But Joe Biden's approval rating is under 40% and the two of them are running even. So the idea that there is no resistance, no cost to Trump for his behavior really isn't supported by the facts.",

His earning power has diminished considerably. So no shock there. As to whether anyone gets paid, that's the question.

A number of states have advanced legislation targeted on AI in campaigns. Now, in Florida, a group of Republicans have proposed a bill that would force political candidates who use generative AI in advertisements to acknowledge that. Now, ironically, the most powerful person in Republican politics in Florida is Governor Ron DeSantis, who he himself has gotten in hot water for using AI in his presidential campaign. There was an ad his campaign tweeted out with a deepfake audio of former President Trump. Another video the campaign tweeted out had a fake AI photo of Trump with Dr. Anthony Fauci.
