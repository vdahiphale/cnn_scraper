      "sentences": "Former Vice President Mike Pence testified before federal grand jury on Thursday for more than five hours. That testimony would have been about what happened after the 2020 election leading up to January 6th. All of those conversations, he directly would have had with Donald Trump, the president at the time, at a time when Donald Trump was pressuring him to overturn the vote. Pence refused to do so. Pence has also spoken about those conversations publicly. Is written about them in his book that he has been on a tour about now. He is talking about them really regularly. But never before has an investigation, has a grand jury and have prosecutors gotten Pence under oath to reveal exactly what he thought, what he felt, and what was said to between him and Donald Trump on those crucial days as part of this investigation.So, this is a really significant moment in the January 6th criminal investigation being led by special counsel Jack Smith at the Justice Department. It is also quite a momentous moment in history. There was never before been a vice president called to testify under subpoena about the president they served alongside. That didn't happen in Watergate with Richard Nixon, it did not happen with Whitewater with Bill Clinton, which both had very active grand juries. So, this is different. It also is a very crucial moment putting Mike Pence here, because of the Justice Department had to fight for this testimony. They went to court over this. Donald Trump tried to block the testimony. He tried to limit what Pence could say about the direct conversations. He lost those court battles. Mike Pence also went to court to fight on this and did not want to testify under subpoena. But he did get a little bit of leeway from the court, being able to protect what he was doing when he was the presiding officer on January 6th. But today, that federal grand jury did hear from Mike Pence for more than five hours, one-on-one, the grand jurors would have been able to ask him questions. They would've been able to piece him into the investigation. A very active investigation that they have heard from many, many witnesses on. And how the prosecutors will take that testimony and see how it fits, try and fit it in to potential charges as they look towards the future. It will become at least part of the record of what will now be known about January 6th to the Justice Department and potentially to the public later on. Katelyn Polantz, CNN, Washington.

CNN's Oren Liebermann reports.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Tonight, 21- year-old Jack Teixeira in custody, after appearing in court for his detention hearing. Prosecutors portrayed the suspected leaker of classified documents as a risk to flee, incapable of the trust he promised to uphold as a member of the Massachusetts International Guard. There is no integrity to share his character because there can be none when there is such a profound breach of trust, said Nadine Pellegrini from the U.S. attorney's office. In a dumpster at the Teixeira's home, authorities found a tablet, a laptop and an Xbox. They'd all been smashed. Prosecutors said it was a way of stopping them from fully understanding the seriousness and scale of Teixeira's conduct. BRIG. GEN. PAT RYDER, PENTAGON PRESS SECRETARY: The department is looking not only at our intelligence processes and procedures as it relates to security or sensitive information and, who has that information. But also looking at the process by which we clear and vet individual for security clearances. And that work is ongoing. LIEBERMANN (voice-over): Authorities say he had an arsenal of weapons just feet from his bed including rifles. AR and AK style weapons and a bazooka. His room was decked out in military camel and paraphernalia. In a recent online chat, uncovered by investigators, Teixeira said he would kill an (expletive) ton of people. Because it would be culling the weak minded. And that he wanted to make an assassination van. He also asked another user what type of rifle would be good to conduct a shooting in a crowded urban or suburban environment. Teixeira's lawyers argued in court that he poses no danger and is not unique in collecting weapons. Some people are car guys, some people like boats, and some people like guns, his attorney said in court, defending his client. As the Pentagon defended the process that led here. The leaked documents have exposed classify U.S. intel including about the war in Ukraine. Documents have revealed the limitations of Ukraine's air defenses and manpower. While also detailing Russia's efforts to recruit more troops to plug its military's ranks. Valuable info, the prosecutor say other countries would covet. And authorities warn that Teixeira may still have more sensitive information hidden away and could still be capable of causing extraordinary damage to U.S. national security.",
