That team is already prepared. They were prepared for trial the day after the indictment came down. They have got their witnesses lined up, they have got their trial notes prepared.

It does raise huge questions for the role of lawyers in their clients and exactly what is something that would be considered criminal conduct. But John Eastman wasn't just giving legal advice, he also appeared remotely at a state Senate hearing in Georgia. His words carry significant weight.So he was not simply sending emails and having meetings with Donald Trump, he was playing a public role in a public hearing in Georgia and giving advice to state senators that even the Department of Justice at the time he was saying was inaccurate and false.",

I don't want to be part because there's so much conduct well beyond I was acknowledgeable about, certainly well beyond that I may have taken a part in. So, it makes sense for them to try to sever.That becomes somewhat of a nightmare to a certain extent for the prosecution because a lot of the overlap, even if it is not exactly the same testimony and evidence, you're going to have to do it multiple times.
