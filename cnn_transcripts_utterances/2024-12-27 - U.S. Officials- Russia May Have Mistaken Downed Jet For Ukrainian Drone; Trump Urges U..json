A U.S. official saying Moscow's air defenses potentially misidentified the jet as a Ukrainian drone. This as a survivor is now offering a chilling new account of the disaster.Also this hour, Elon Musk is at the center of a new feud within President-elect Trump's MAGA base. We're gauging the fallout as Musk joins with Vivek Ramaswamy in defending certain visas foreign workers, putting them at odds with ardent supporters of Trump's immigration crackdown. And the CDC reveals that the first severe U.S. case of bird flu in humans shows mutations and that could make it easier for the virus to spread person to person, adding to fears of a broader outbreak.

He is asking the court not to weigh in that to put a pause on this so that his administration can look into this. I want to read you what he wrote in this legal briefing today. He said, quote, he wants the court to put a pause in the ban's effective date to, quote, \"to allow his incoming administration to pursue a negotiated resolution that could prevent a nationwide shutdown of TikTok, thus preserving the First Amendment rights of tens of thousands, or, excuse me, tens of millions of Americans, while also addressing the government's national security concerns.\"Now, we do know that in that Trump, in his own brief took no position on the underlying First Amendment questions posed, opposed by the case, but again saying that he wants to be able to see if he can find some sort of resolution once he is in office. Now, to give you a little backdrop on, you know, Donald Trump and his relationship with TikTok, he has kind of been back and forth on this issue. When he was first in office back in -- you know, before leaving office in 2020 or 20, January 2021, he had initially called for a ban on TikTok. However, over his campaign, the 2024 campaign, he kind of vacillated on whether or not he believed there should be a ban. And then earlier this month, he said during a press conference that he's actually warming to TikTok, noting that many young voters who use the social media app voted for him and kind of signaling that he may be reversing course on that TikTok ban that is before the Supreme Court. And then later that day earlier this month, following that press conference, he met with the TikTok CEO on this issue, all to say that there's been a big question about Donald Trump would handle this. It's very clear now in this briefing to the Supreme Court, which is one of the biggest cases before them right now, that he is saying, let's push pause on this. I don't want there to be a ban. I want to be able to deal with this on my own once I am sworn in on January 20th.",

And Isaac Dovere, let me start with you. Trump has previously wanted to ban TikTok. So what do you make of his reversal now? EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER: Well, it's something, as Alayna was saying, that we saw coming down the road during the campaign. The question is why Donald Trump has made this change in his position. Is it because he is embracing a medium that is popular among younger people and saying that's where a lot of his voters were and wants to be popular in that way? Is it because of some arrangement that he wants to have with the company, which has obviously ties to the Chinese government in ways? What is going on is it maybe related to donations or promises that were made during the campaign? We'll have to find out more of what this is. But there is no question about it. Donald Trump had a clear position on TikTok that is now the reverse of the position that he's taking with the Supreme Court brief.",

What does that tell you about the series of meetings that Trump has had with all these tech CEOs since the election?CHARLIE DENT, (R) FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE: Well, Trump clearly is listening to a lot of these tech CEOs. The fact that Donald Trump wants to expand visas for those who graduate from American universities or those with STEM degrees, I think that actually is a good thing, particularly with advanced degrees. But what it's also telling me, too, about TikTok is that Donald Trump, I think, is in a bit of a conundrum. On the one hand, you know, he wants to be tough on China. And the United States would never -- I should say, China would never allow a company with close ties and National Security Agency to operate freely within China. That's the same argument being made about TikTok in the U.S. that the Chinese government has far too much influence and control over that company and its operations here in the United States access to people's data. And there are a lot of national security hawks within the House Republican Conference and across the whole conference who highly object to allowing TikTok to operate. So Trump's got himself a little bit of a conundrum here, both on TikTok and on this immigration policy, where he espouses a hard line but also acknowledges real needs in terms of bringing in legal immigrants.",

Kellyanne Conway showed him some very convincing polling during the campaign that showed that TikTok was super popular among American youth. It's where they get a lot of their news. And it also is where it kind of plays into this theme that the voters and who Donald Trump is speaking to and how he built this unique coalition to win the election is not necessarily listening to legacy media. They're on social media, they're on TikTok, they're on YouTube, they're on all of these other platforms getting their information.And so he wants to maintain that First Amendment right of people being able to be their own media, as Elon Musk has been saying on X lately. However, I think that when he goes in to take a look at this, he's going to revert back to the same place where all of us are saying that TikTok is still the same national security issue that it has been. This, to me, says that this is a way to keep his campaign promise by speaking up in defense of TikTok now. And then once there's a review, he can revert back to his original position of TikTok being bad for the country.",

If he wants to live up to the promises, he is going to upset a lot of people who were backing his campaign for other reasons. And now he needs to figure out, can he pull this off? This was a question that was asked repeatedly during the campaign, how would you go about these mass deportations? And has been asked since he won of, well, is it going to be separating families again? Are you going to kick out everybody in a family if there's one person in the family who's not a documented immigrant?How this goes is going to be very, very difficult to pull off, even if not for the political problems of trying to get everybody on the same page. But that is clearly going to be part of this, too. And you see this in the divide right to where Elon Musk is on this. Obviously, Musk, a pretty important and prominent supporter of Donald Trump, breaking with other prominent supporters of Donald Trump.

But if we move into Saturday, people are getting on the road. Rain up and down I-95. There's the thunder and lightning across I-20 just to the west there of looks like Nashville and also into Birmingham. But then on Sunday, it doesn't get any better. We're still going to see the rain here across D.C., Boston, New York City. And even if we don't see rain in New York most of the day, it'll be a low cloud day. And that could slow down the airports as well. You know, it doesn't take very much. Now back out to the west where it has been one storm after another and people may be snowed instead of skiing. And they may just -- they have to take the next week off, too, because there has been so much snow, between 3 and 4 feet of snow in these ski resorts. The problem with tomorrow is that there will be some wind around as well. But let me move you here. This is today we're going to see the rain and snow and then above about 4 or 5,000 feet, it really begins to snow. So for -- for Casper and Jackson Hole and all the way over towards Steamboat, all the way through Tahoe, of course, because that's a higher elevation, that's when the heaviest snow is going to be occurring. All of these purple spots are above a foot. And some of these mountain passes could be very difficult to get through if you're driving, Wolf.",
