Look, there's an extraordinary disparity between all the denials from Moscow, about how this man is not one of the largest arms dealers in history, particularly in the '90s. And the massive efforts they've put in over decades now, to try and get him back to Russia.A lot of this feeds into his activities in the '90s. I've seen videos of him with notorious figures in Africa, and there's been a weight of evidence accusing him of being one of the most significant figures trading arms around conflicts in the '90s and in the early 2000s, all of which he has denied. But still, we've seen this persistent bid for Russia to provide him legal aid to keep them out of American hands. The original sting that caught him in Bangkok was, in fact, DEA agents pretending to be Colombian rebels, asking him if he would sell them weapons that could potentially be used to harm Americans. That's what got him arrested in Thailand and eventually, after a long legal struggle extradited to the United States. But major theory about Viktor Bout is perhaps he knows people close to Vladimir Putin, in his time in Africa when maybe they served in Africa too, and that maybe the Americans wanted to put pressure on him for better information. Or maybe to, they wanted a broader sense of global justice, about the arms dealing that he's been accused of proliferating across conflicts around the world. Here's more of what we know about him.

You know, this speech was first and foremost celebratory talking about how Griner has been through hell, the President said, over the last few months, and now she's able to be reunited with her family. And when he -- Cherelle Griner take the podium even before she was able to say any words, she literally let out a huge sigh of relief. And she said, I am just so overcome with the motion.But I think you hit the nail on the head. He made sure that the speech was also in large part about addressing Paul Whelan. He said we have not forgotten about him. We are not giving up and we are going to keep negotiating in good faith. And I just want to give you a little bit of our reporting from this morning on sort of the backstory of why Paul Whelan wasn't included in this deal. A U.S. official telling me that they, of course, have been trying for months to make sure that Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan were both a part of this deal. This is what they ultimately wanted. But the Russians made clear as we got into the recent days that they were only willing to negotiate for Griner, that they essentially treated the two cases very separately based on the different things that each person was accused of. Now, the U.S. administration kept pushing for Whelan to be a part of this deal. But ultimately, they got to a point where the Russians made it so clear that he could not be a part of this deal, that they were only willing to give up Brittney Griner. And so they ultimately had to make the decision to accept this deal. This official telling me, quote, it was a choice to get Griner or nothing. And a different senior administration official told me this morning, this was the only deal we could make right now. So I think the question now is, look, if Viktor Bout wasn't enough for Paul Whelan, what is going to be enough? That is going to be the problem and the discussion that is certainly already ongoing in the administration, because obviously, they wanted both of these people. They were not able to get both.

I mean, she went through a list of everybody who's ever helped class act, maintains that poise. But she wouldn't leave that microphone without talking about the other people left behind.There's a fraternity and sorority of people who are -- have loved ones who were being held in horrible conditions. We don't think about them every day, they think about them every minute. And that solidarity has not been broken. You know, I think that his brother, also class act.",

His brother has been left behind repeatedly, but he still sticks up for the one who's coming home.So we need to be like that as a country. If they can stand together in this much pain, we should be doing the same thing. But, you know, today is going to be a joyful moment. And for all the pain, for all the criticisms, a joyful moment for the black women who led a movement to get one of their sisters home. This was a grassroots movement. They had to push to get male athletes, to get us to take it seriously. But they have triumph. And here's the deal. If you can bring one home, you can bring to home.

And I think that Biden and Kamala Harris, this is one of the things that they're going to be, I think, the most proud of. I think Americans can stand together on this one. But where we say that right now, when she comes off that plane, when she walks off that plane, when her wife hugs her, when that moment happens, that is going to be decade defining. People will remember that and it should show us what we can do when we stand together. It can show us what we can do when we don't give up on people. We give up on too many people. We give up on each other in politics all the time. We give up on our kids, we give up on our relatives. You're blocking people on Facebook and Twitter.
