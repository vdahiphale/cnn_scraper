An unseemly split over tanks risks the ironclad unity the NATO alliance has demonstrated in support of Ukraine. Among some allies, led by Britain, Poland, Finland, and the Baltic nations, there is a sense of striking while the iron is hot before Russia regroups for unexpected spring offensive. And at the heart of the drama is this tank, the German Leopard 2. The nimble, flexible Leopard with all-around protection, requiring low maintenance, is top of Ukraine's wish list. But the German chancellor is dragging his feet. More than a dozen countries own those tanks, like Poland, which says it will send them to Ukraine, throwing down the gauntlet to Berlin. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MATEUSZ MORAWIECKI, POLISH PRIME MINISTER (through translator):  We will apply for such consent, but this is a secondary topic. Even if we did not get this consent in the end, as part of a small coalition, if the Germans were not in this coalition, we will still hand over our tanks, together with others, to Ukraine.

Sasha (ph), a travel agent turned volunteer, will help him collect what he can for the journey to Kyiv. It is time to be with family. I want to see my grandchildren, I have four, Anatoly (ph) says. And my son just got drafted. Neighbors will look after his chickens, goats, and dog. That's all, he says. Let's go guys, they will start shelling now.

That he has success on the battlefield behind him and he's got wind at his back, and that's what we're focused on. And every nation inside this coalition of the willing, as we might call it, is providing capability. Sometimes it just finances, financial support to help Ukraine get into a better position. The strategy on the battlefield, that's got to be up to Mr. Zelenskyy and his military leaders. He's the one that's going to determine where they are going to strike, when they are going to strike, and with what force. What we are trying to do is in advance of those operations, and we expect that the fighting is going to continue throughout the winner, it's been a violent winter in the Donbas, and into the spring.

We have Mr. Putin continuing to strike civilian targets with cruise missiles and drones that he's buying from Iran. And we know, as you rightly pointed out, that he is regrouping and preparing himself for more aggressive operations to come in the next few months, probably in the spring when the weather gets better. So, we know we are at a critical point. President Biden has called this an inflection point. So, that's why we -- that's why you are seeing so much energy being put in by the allies to get Ukraine the kinds of capabilities they need for these combined are maneuvers, operations, that we think they're going to be conducting, probably, in the next few months.

But if you look at the leadership now in the House of Representatives, the Republican leadership, as well as in the Senate, both sides of the aisle, both Chambers of Commerce -- Congress, there is a lot of support, and we are confident that we're going to be able to keep that up. I would remind that just before the end of the year, Congress appropriated another $45 billion of assistance for Ukraine. More than half of that, Christiane, is dedicated to security assistance, weapons. And so, that will definitely take us for many months coming forward, to make sure that we can keep pace with the operations that President Zelenskyy is conducting, and try to make sure that they are in the best position possible heading into the spring.",

We know that Iran has provided Russia with literally hundreds of these drones, these attack rounds. But that relationship is going the other way and we are, you know, we're concerned that Russia could be providing military capabilities and support to Iran in return. And so, it's not just a Ukrainian problem. It is not just a problem on the European continent now. This burgeoning relationship between these two nations can half spillover effects in the Middle East if Iran were able to garner from it, additional capabilities and benefits from Russia. So, there is a real geopolitical concern here, that is why we are calling it like we are seeing it. I -- you know, we went out last week and made clear that we had intelligence that the North Koreans were also supporting Russia by providing missiles and rockets, and that kind of thing. And of course, the -- right directly to the Wagner group. So -- I mean, Russia is reaching. They don't have a lot of people they can reach out to, but they are reaching out to some countries.

At that time, some of our allies were very much afraid of the possible escalation. I think we have this discussion already gone, somehow done. And there's fear for escalation is very much limited.
