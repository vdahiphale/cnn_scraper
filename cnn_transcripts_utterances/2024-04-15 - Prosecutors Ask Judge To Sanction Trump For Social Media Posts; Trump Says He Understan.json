And right now on day one, he's being faced with this decision. Did Donald Trump violate this gag order and how does he respond? If so, he's deciding clearly after the lunch break.

People look at the Trump case very carefully and under a microscope because for obvious reasons. But -- it is quite loud here.But, obviously, Juan Merchan for 15 years, has handled difficult defendants before. And they're dealt with defendants who have acted out in courtrooms, defendants who are alleged murderers, rapists. This is what we do. It is the landscape in which we toil. So I don't think this is a huge lift for Juan Merchan, for Judge Merchan. I do think, however, that if it were me, certainly, I would warn the defendant again. Doing a contempt proceeding at this point will slow everything down. It doesn't really benefit anyone.",

The defendant, in any criminal case, is entitled to hear any of those sidebar conversations if they involve issues for which the defendant could give input. So if it's strictly legal, the defendant has no right to be there, but if it's anything with a factual basis, the defendant does have a right to be there.And, logistically, I think that's a challenge for a Judge Merchan to make sure that the defendant has that opportunity if it means clearing the courtroom or going in the back as we often do. Logistically, again, it's hard here because you have Secret Service, you have court officers and a lot of lawyers. So that makes it a little more complicated.",

It's really the most generous way to describe it. It's always a little bit crazy. Paula and I have spent a lot of time down here.Today feels especially more so. I mean, some of his former supporters are just circling the courthouse really. As he is inside, he just left without speaking. But one thing the judge was just doing was reading Trump his rights and telling him that if he disrupts this trial, that the judge has the right to exclude him and even potentially jail him if that happens, what would have the -- what's the threshold for something like that?",

In other words, if a defendant, by their conduct, cannot follow the rules of the courtroom, cannot follow the rules of the staff in the courtroom, speaks out over the judge, a defendant can forfeit their right to be present.And if the defendant continues to do that I would say he would find himself in a bit of trouble. Judge Merchan is not going to tolerate it. He is a consummate professional. He is a fair and just jurist. And he will do everything he can to ensure that the defendant gets the fair trial to which he is entitled. And if that includes taking him out of the courtroom because he, you know, he destroys the process or infects it deleteriously, he will do that. And warning the defendant is the only standard. If the defendant knows and persists, he can be waltzed out not to return. He can be jailed too. We'll see if that happens.",

The war cabinet held a meeting that got heated at times, according to sources. And an Israeli official telling our Jeremy Diamond they reviewed potential military responses and remain determined to act.CNN's Clarissa Ward joins me here in Tel Aviv. There's obviously a lot of different considerations in any kind of response, both not only the nature of the response itself, but the timing involved as well. CLARISSA WARD, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Right. I mean, they met for three hours today, three hours yesterday. They are obviously taking their time to consider precisely how they want to respond. They are facing a lot of pressure internationally. There is some goodwill on Israel's side on this, but there are also strong voices of caution saying, please, let us not escalate this. Let us not risk a regional conflagration. And particularly, from some of Israel's allies in the region. At the same time, you have these domestic political considerations. You have the hard right elements of Netanyahu's coalition who are saying we've got to hit them hard. There needs to be a deterrent. So I think there's several, you know, possible options that they would be looking into a direct attack on Iran sort of a tip for tat, focused on military targets and asymmetrical attack, maybe looking at one of Iran's numerous proxies in the region. They could potentially opt for a cyberattack. At this stage, we don't know, but we do have the sense from everything we're hearing from Jeremy's reporting that you just referred to, that there is some kind of urgency. There's a desire to move quickly while momentum is on the side and while there is still some goodwill from the international community on the side.",

We're not talking about the difficulties and, you know, criticism that the war has taken.So I think there's an understanding for Israel that the conversation has shifted. It's in a more favorable place for them, and they want to take advantage of that. They want to exploit that. They probably do not want the attention to go straight back to Gaza and the atrocities that have been taking place there and the suffering and the very real difficulties that they have been facing there as well. So, I think there's a sense that they want to keep control of the conversation, reframe the narrative to their advantage. How and -- you know, would they go about that, remains an open question.",

Trump's lawyer, Todd Blanche, made the argument a short time ago that Trump is within his rights, that Michael Cohen has criticized him.The big difference is Michael Cohen is a witness here. Much of the morning focused on, I would say, two fronts. One is, what is going to be permissible related to Michael Cohen? And, you know, there is going to be, I think, extensive arguments about that going forward. And he is the key witness here, Trump's former personal lawyer and fixer. The other was that Trump had to sit and listen to prosecutors essentially turn his own words into weapons against him. Whether it was tweets about Michael Cohen when he was president that prosecutors say were aimed to intimidate Michael Cohen, or whether it was Trump's words on the infamous Access Hollywood tape in which his vulgar language about grabbing women's genitals was read by prosecutors. And Trump just sat there, still. But it really underscores that this trial is going to be filled with personal discomfort for Donald Trump, who has often been able to just attack and then walk away. This is going to be much harder for him here.",
