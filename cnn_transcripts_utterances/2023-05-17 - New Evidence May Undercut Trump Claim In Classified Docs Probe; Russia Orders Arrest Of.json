Plus, Putin's crackdown tonight, issuing an arrest warrant for an Oscar-nominated film producer who has spoken out against Russia's unprovoked invasion. That Russian producer is OUTFRONT. And Elon Musk tonight ripping into people who work from home, calling it morally wrong. So what does Kevin O'Leary from the hit television show \"Shark Tank\" think? We'll find out. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, Trump knew. CNN reporting exclusively tonight that the National Archives is set to turn over 16 records to the special counsel and that these 16 records show Trump and his advisers were well aware of the proper process to declassify documents. And as we know from the results of the raid on Trump's Mar-a-Lago, that process was not followed. The National Archives records directly contradict Trump's main defense, which, again and again has been that he has unilateral authority to declassify documents. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Ty Cobb, Trump's former White House lawyer, a regular guest on OUTFRONT, and one you'll hear from in just a moment, has long said here, if you've been watching, that the special counsel's probe on classified documents could wrap as soon as May, and that Cobb expects a criminal indictment against Trump. Now, I'm going to talk to Ty in just a moment, along with John King for the political impact of all of this. But, first, more on this exclusive reporting from Paula Reid in Washington.

And according to this letter, though, that was obtained exclusively by our colleague Jamie Gangel, the archives reveals that these 16 documents, these are records documenting communication between the former president and some instances his top advisers laying out the when, why, and how you go about declassifying records.And that is significant because we know from our reporting that the special counsel is investigating possibly charging multiple crimes including the possible mishandling of classified documents. And in order to do that, you would need to establish that someone knowingly took these materials without going through the proper authorization. Now, the former president and his lawyers, they have put forth multiple, sometimes conflicting explanations for why he took these documents down to Mar-a-Lago. He has said that they're automatically declassified because he's a former president. He also said that he had a standing order to declassify them. His lawyers also separately argued that the problem was the process, and some of these materials were inadvertently packed up. But, depending on what these records show, this could undermine all of those defenses if they can show that the former president was on notice of the procedure and knew that it applied to him. Erin, the special counsel may need to wait a bit to get their hands on these documents I'm told that it is possible the former president's lawyers may appeal this decision, file for a court intervention here. They have not been very successful trying to keep this kind of evidence from the special counsel. But I'm told that they may do it anyway just to try to protect constitutional and presidential protections.",

This is all governed by a case called United States versus Espy. But the Espy criteria are set out in the letter that transmitted these documents, which is they're important to the grand jury, and they are not easily found elsewhere.

They don't need that to prove the obstruction. Trump could be right that he can declassify these things between foot massages, but the reality is that's just -- that's just not the truth. The simple truth is there is a process, apparently, 16 different government officials reminded him of the process at least that impacted them.

JOHN KING, CNN HOST, \"INSIDE POLITICS\":  Well, the legal conversation is one thing. The political conversation happens, Erin, as you know, for years on a very different track. I reached out to a handful of Republican strategists, one very close to Trump, the other people who wish Trump to varying degrees to go away, yesterday, or last month or last year or before. They all answered with the same answer. I'll read you one of them because they were all very consistent. They don't care, all caps about these investigations, no impact.

They keep coming at me.He does that on a daily if not hourly basis to try to keep his people in his track. I'm not saying this has helped him among Republicans. There are a lot of Republicans who say, oh, lord, if he's the nominee again, every time there's another one of these stories, it just reinforces the E. Carroll story. Suburban women are one of the reasons Joe Biden is president and Nancy Pelosi was speaker after the 2018 midterms. Now, that just rappels a constituency that has left the Republican Party if it's about Trump. They're not coming back, a lot of Republicans will tell you. The legal jeopardy, independents, soft Republicans, does bother them. But core Republican base voters -- remember, Trump has redefined, repopulated almost the base of the Republican Party.
