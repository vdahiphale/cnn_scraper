      "sentences": "Hello, and welcome to CNN Newsroom. I'm Bianca Nobilo in London, in for Max.Just ahead, the very latest developments from the Middle East. International concerns are growing over an expected Israeli ground assault in Rafah where an estimated one million people are crammed into a tent city, seeking refuge. Then, violence spreads in Pakistan where polls have closed in a widely watched national election. We'll have a live report as we wait for those initial results. Plus, incredible pitches from Iceland where a volcano has erupted for the second time this year. Egypt is sounding the alarm about an Israeli military operation into Rafah, close to its border with Gaza. The foreign ministry says targeting Rafah packed with more than one million Palestinians crammed into tent cities is dangerous. This as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says soldiers will soon go into Rafah, which he calls Hamas' last bastion. The U.S Secretary of State also voiced concern about Rafah in meetings with Netanyahu and other top officials. Antony Blinken is wrapping up a four-day nation trip to the region after Netanyahu has rejected a Hamas response to a proposed ceasefire plan. The Israeli Prime Minister called that counterproposal \"delusional\". Meantime, a Hamas delegation has arrived in Cairo for talks on Gaza. CNN's Jeremy Diamond joins us now from Tel Aviv, following all of these strands for us. Jeremy, let's focus on Rafah, the concerns of the international community about the possibility of more attacks in that area, and it just underscores the issues that Israel says that it has trying to root out Hamas without hurting civilians that they have not succeeded at.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. There is no question that an Israeli military operation into Rafah, ground operation, would put 1.3 million people who are now sheltering in a city that is typically inhabited by about 300,000 people at very, very serious risk. Rafah has been viewed as kind of the safest part of the Gaza Strip, although there still have been airstrikes in Rafah since the beginning of the war. And now, the concern, as telegraphed by top Israeli officials, is that Israeli ground forces may be moving into Rafah. Right now, the ground defensive is mainly concentrated in the second largest city of Gaza in Khan Younis, which is just north of Rafah. But, once they complete that operation there, the thinking is that the Israeli military in the coming weeks may choose to move into Rafah.The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu making very clear yesterday that he has directed the military to begin making plans for that. And in fact, I'm told that hurts the Halevi, the top Israeli General. The Chief of Staff of the Israeli military briefed Secretary of State Tony Blinken yesterday on Israeli military plans to move into Rafah in the coming weeks. And so, as a result, what you have is people sounding alarm bells. A spokesman for the Egyptian Foreign Minister today raising serious concerns, saying that a military operations into Rafah would pose dangers to the people who are sheltering there and also raising concerns about the fact that Rafah is so, so close to the Egyptian border. And Egypt has repeatedly made clear that the displacement of Palestinians who would be forced to flee into Egypt as a result of Israeli military operations, that that would be a significant red line that could potentially lead to a total rupture of Israeli-Egyptian relations. The U.S. Secretary of State, I'm also told by two Israeli officials, raised serious concerns about that kind of a potential military operation into Rafah during his meetings yesterday with Israeli officials, asking repeatedly what Israel's plans are to mitigate the risk to civilians in such a densely, densely populated area. We've already seen in the last 24 hours several airstrikes in the western part of the city of Rafah, killing at least 14 people, according to a local journalist on the ground. So, for now, we are seeing airstrikes there, but we have yet to see any kind of movement of ground forces in that area. And one of the main questions, Bianca, is, is this a negotiating strategy by Israel? Are they trying to get Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas in Gaza, to agree to a hostage deal on Israel's terms, or is this actually a real military operation that is preparing itself to enter that city where, again, 1.3 million people are estimated to currently be living there?",

The government shut down internet and phone service on Election Day, saying it was trying to cut down on terrorism. Still, there were multiple reports of attacks on polling stations leading to at least two deaths. The election pits three-time former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif against 35-year-old Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, the son of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. Popular former Prime Minister Imran Khan is in jail and he is barred from running again. CNN's Anna Coren is tracking the vote for us.

      "sentences": "There are quite a lot of expectations that Colorado could be deemed an outlier in this situation. So, what has happened here over the past several months leading up to the primary elections of 2024, which are already underway, is a lot of challenges across the nation have popped up from voters and others challenging Donald Trump's ability to be listed on ballots as a candidate. That's because this law that emerged after the U.S. Civil War, the 14th Amendment of the Constitution, it says that people who are insurrectionists are not fit for office.Colorado became one of only two of the 50 states to make a decision to say Trump fits that profile. He fits that under the law. And we as a state say that he is not eligible to be on the ballot or that votes cannot be counted for them if voters choose to vote for them because he is not eligible to hold that state's votes for the office of the presidency. The big question now before the U.S. Supreme Court is, can Colorado do that? Donald Trump's legal team says that if Colorado can do something like this, it would unleash chaos and bedlam across the country. Other courts could follow this. Other state officials could follow Colorado's lead. And they potentially could be excluding not just Donald Trump but others in other future elections from the ballots if voters wanted to vote for them. Now, the Colorado Secretary of State is going to be arguing today. She says, yes, Colorado can do this, and the Supreme Court should give a state that level of power if they follow their processes, as the Colorado Supreme Court did. Now, there are other things to be watching for today. We are not expecting a decision out of the U.S. Supreme Court. But, the nine justices will be asking a lot of questions of all of the lawyers that will be arguing before them. Trump isn't there in person. This is going to be quite a test for the legacy of the Supreme Court.",

Four people were arrested today as part of the investigation into the alleged attempted coup in the wake of the 2022 presidential election. Two of his aides are among those arrested, according to CNN, Brazil. No comment from Bolsonaro at this point. We'll bring you more from Brazil as we learn it.A prominent challenger to Russian President Vladimir Putin has been barred from the country's upcoming elections. Boris Nadezhdin hoped to take on Putin as an independent anti-war candidate, he said. But today, Russia's Central Election Committee said that Nadezhdin didn't have enough legitimate signatures to carry on with his campaign. And in just hours, we'll hear from Russian President Vladimir Putin in an interview with controversial American journalist Tucker Carlson. The sitdown is Putin's first with Western media since he invaded Ukraine two years ago. Carlson says he plans to release the interview Thursday at 6 p.m. Eastern Time, and he defended his reasons for giving Mr. Putin a platform. To discuss both of those stories, let's bring in CNN's Fred Pleitgen. Fred, beginning with Boris Nadezhdin and his campaign, which has now ended to take on the Russian President, these upcoming elections, was that credible the claim that the signatures he had were not legitimate? Any response from his camp?",

But, I am more interested to get your thoughts on how Ukrainians will receive that. Would there be a worry that by giving Putin that platform in America, to the world, that he might be able to make arguments that can challenge the case for providing funding, the UK and NATO, for Ukraine in their war effort?",

      "sentences": "Well, I think the Ukrainians are certainly concerned about that, and I think they fully believe that that is exactly what is going to happen in that interview. Although, of course, right now, we don't know what exactly Tucker Carlson asked Vladimir Putin, how tough the questions actually are in that interview. But, right now, of course, there is generally a big concern in Ukraine right here about some of the way that U.S. politics is shaping up. Of course, the Ukrainians have seen what's been going on with Congress, like for instance that supplemental falling through yesterday already in the Senate, not even reaching the House of Representatives. Also, some sort of standalone bill for Ukraine not yet tabled yet.So, there is a lot of things that Ukrainians are concerned about. And they do believe that within the Republican Party in the United States that Vladimir Putin is getting more credibility, if you will, among some of these politicians, especially those who are close to former President Donald Trump. And certainly, they believe that Tucker Carlson is also very close to former President Donald Trump. And I think some of the messaging also, Bianca, that we've seen from the Kremlin is certainly something that I would say stokes a bit of concern here in Ukraine, because the Kremlin came out quite clearly and said the reason why Vladimir Putin is not speaking to, as the Kremlin called, a traditional Western media, like for instance us or other U.S. or international TV channels, but to Tucker Carlson is because they believe it's beneficial. Let's listen to what the Kremlin said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DMITRY PESKOV, KREMLIN SPOKESMAN (TRANSLATED): We receive many requests for interviews with the President. There is no desire to communicate with such media outlets. And there is hardly any point in it. There is hardly any benefit from it. He has a position that differs from the others. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Of course, Vladimir Putin has one of the biggest platforms in the world. Things that he says at international conferences are usually broadcast. We use his soundbites all the time. We and other networks have asked for interviews with Vladimir Putin multiple times. So, in this case, it's not the Western media not bothering to speak to Vladimir Putin. It's Vladimir Putin only wanting to speak to Tucker Carlson, Bianca.",
