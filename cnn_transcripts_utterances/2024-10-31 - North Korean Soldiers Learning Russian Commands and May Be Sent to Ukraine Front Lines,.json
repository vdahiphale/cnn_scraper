      "sentences": "Well, South Korea`s spy agency just revealed some striking details about North Korean troops inRussia. They are training to fight in the war against Ukraine, and that is according to NATO, the United States, and South Korea. But lawmakers who were briefed by South Korea`s National Intelligence Service here in Seoul say that North Korea may be trying to hide from its own people that these deployments to Russia are actually happening. So, let`s take you through what we know. We have two lawmakers briefed by South Korea`s spy agency, the NIS. And the NIS says that North Korean families of these soldiers are being told the troops went to a, quote, \"military exercise,\" not to Russia, not to Ukraine. The lawmakers add news of these troops going to Russia has spread within North Korea despite the regime`s effort to contain the truth. And they say there is some, quote, \"unrest\" among North Korean residents and soldiers about why they`re making this sacrifice for another country. That certainly would be remarkable considering North Korea tolerates virtually no dissent against the regime of Kim Jong Un. We also heard from South Korea`s president on this subject today. Listen to what he said. YOOON SUK YEOL, SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT (through translator): This illegal military cooperation between Russia and North Korea is a significant security threat to the international community and could pose a serious risk to our national security.",

Analysts tell us that North Koreantroops could potentially come back home with more knowledge about modern warfare than ever before. The secretary General of NATO has also said that North Korean troops are already in Russia`s Kursk region. That is where Ukraine has had a foothold in Russian territory since August. The Pentagon is also saying that it assesses there are about 10,000 North Korean troops who have been deployed to train in Russia. Pyongyang and Moscow have neither explicitly confirmed nor denied these troop deployments. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Pop quiz, hot shot.What was the most popular Halloween candy in 2024, according to candystore.com? Hershey Kisses, M&amp;M`S, Reese`s Peanut Butter Cups or Candy Corn? If you said M&amp;M`S, you are correct. Did you know that M&amp;M`S were exclusively sold to the military, enabling the heat-resistant and easy-to- transport chocolate to be included in American soldiers` rations during World War II? Let`s take a look at Halloween by the numbers. First, spending, about 72% of Americans plan to celebrate Halloween today, and from pumpkins to candy, costumes, decorations and parties, folks are set to spend a jaw-dropping $11.6 billion. That`s nearly the entire estimated value of the Yankees and Dodgers, the teams in this year`s World Series, combined. Here`s how that $11.6 billion in Halloween spending breaks down. $3.8 billion on costumes and on decorations, $3.5 billion on candy and half a billion dollars on greeting cards. On average, these numbers break down to a little more than $103 per person in Halloween spending this year. 37% of the spending happens at discount stores, 33% at Halloween specialty stores, and another 33% comes from online orders. And that $11.6 billion in Halloween spending this year is actually down slightly from the $12.2 billion in 2023. How about this year`s most popular costumes? For kids, it`s ghosts, witches, princesses, and superheroes. The adults? Well, they`re going with witches as this year`s most popular costume, along with vampires, cats, pirates, and Batman. Hit me up @coyware on social. Let me know what you`re rolling with this year. And on social, that is where you will see, what I was told to be by my daughters this year. Today, CNN will introduce its five finalists for CNN Hero of the Year, which celebrates everyday people making extraordinary impacts in their communities. We`ll introduce them to you on tomorrow`s show. Now, last year`s winner was veterinarian Dr. Kwane Stewart, who founded Project Street Pet, an innovative program providing free pet food and veterinary care to animals belonging to people experiencing homelessness. Dr. Stewart`s initiative has created a ripple effect of positive change for pets and their human companions in need. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DR. KWANE STEWART, 2023 CNN HERO OF THE YEAR: The dog food pantry, which I launched here in Los Angeles, in Skid Row, is taken off. It`s been getting low fairly quickly, so it tells me there`s a lot of pets that are getting what they need. Anyone who lives in this area can come through when they want and take as much dog food as they need to care for their pet. We keep cat food down here too. We`ve given somewhere in the neighborhood of 800, 900 bags of food. I wish I could be out of business, out of work. As our homeless crisis gets worse, and it is getting worse, we know that. More people are on the streets, have a pet. He`s a nice dog, huh? How old are you? When I`m able to care for these pets, keep them healthy, and keep them with their owner, their owner stands a better chance of themselves getting off the streets. Their pet companion is instrumental in that. Hector, how you doing, man? Some stories on the streets, the people I meet, the dogs I help, we will see months later, a year later, and the change, the reform. It`s pretty magical. Hey, baby. Like Rain, Rain was a little tiny runt with crooked legs.",
