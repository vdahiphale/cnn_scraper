If they're right and they have in fact taken out Hamas leaders and are continuing to do that. If Hamas feels that their back is against the wall, there's no question in my mind that they're going to ask for help and they'll turn to Iran, obviously turn to Hezbollah, all of Iran's proxies in the region from Iraq down to Yemen. And so I think the potential for a possible expansion of this war is real.",

You're going to have to use human intelligence as well. That's pretty much what we did in going after Al Qaeda after 911. And we could not have been able to establish those targets without the help of drones, but also without the help of human intelligence, people on the ground. So I'm hoping they can get that kind of combination working with them because that is the most effective way to make sure that you are accurate in going after Hamas.",

I think it's very important for the United States at the highest level to stay in touch with the leadership, not just in Israel but in the countries that adjoin Israel.Look, this is a situation where the issue is going to be, is the price right for Netanyahu? He obviously is in the middle of a war. His tanks are there, his troops are there, they're going after Hamas. He's not particularly interested in slowing that process down. We all understand that. On the other side, Hamas is holding these hostages and very frankly, they don't care a lot about the human side of these hostages. The question is going to be what kind of price do they get if they're going to release the hostages? So right now, I don't know that the price is right on either side. What could possibly help is to be able to develop an approach where you want Hamas to release the hostages, but in return they're going to get the release of Palestinian prisoners that could, I think, be a possibly the kind of price that might result in that kind of deal being fulfilled.",

He did not get out and shake any hands or anything like that. But you can see the tail end of the motorcade.We are at the bowling Alley. It was the first site of the pair of mass shootings that happened a little bit over a week ago now. And from where these people are standing across the street, what we've seen line the curb are memorials to the people that, of course, the 18 that were killed here. Also signs of strength and support. A lot of signs with hearts on them. A symbol of the state of Maine with a heart over Lewiston. A sign that simply just says to being nice. Pointing to of course, the sensitivity of the time and what this Community has been through. The President was just at right before he got here at Wendy's Bar and Grill, which was the second side of the pair of mass shootings that happened, again, that night a little bit over a week ago. What we're expecting him to do here is he's going to give some remarks, obviously talking about what happened in the community, support from there. But he's also been meeting with first responders, nurses, other people on the front lines of the response that particular night. We're also expecting them after the remarks, to meet with members of the families of some of the people that were killed here as well. This visit really it seems, to provide support to those that are trying to figure out how to process this. It's not like it's ancient history. They are still grieving. Trying to figure out when they are going to bury some of their loved ones. Still, people are in the hospital recovering from what happened. So this is very much still fresh. One person I spoke to who was at this memorial a little bit earlier, talked about why she was glad that that President Biden was here and it simply was because it showed to her that people at the highest levels of the U.S. government are paying attention. Now, as we have seen time and time again after the number of mass shootings in this country, it's often difficult for real policy to change over at Capitol Hill and beyond. But that will likely be some of what we hear President Biden talk about. He's talked in previous times about the need for changes and for Congress to pass legislation to make meaningful impact on gun violence. But of course, all of that is still secondary to some of the pain that people here are still going through. And what is something that is still very raw.",
