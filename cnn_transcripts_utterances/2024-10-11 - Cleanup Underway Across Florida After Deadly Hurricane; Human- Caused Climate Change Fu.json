If you're just joining us here are some of today's top stories.Former U.S. President Donald Trump will rally in both Colorado and Nevada in the coming hours. Following his stop in Michigan on Thursday. Vice President Kamala Harris, fresh off campaign stops of her own in Arizona and Nevada, set to participate in the Jewish voters for Harris Walz high holiday call just ahead of Yom Kippur. President Joe Biden says there's been a robust response from the federal government to hurricanes Milton and Helene. He also condemned price gouging and misinformation in the wake of both storms. Biden said Trump who's been amplifying that misinformation should quote get a life. And the death toll from Hurricane Milton is now at least 15 people, more than two and a half million customers in Florida remain without power. According to poweroutage.us. the Red Cross now has a place on its website where families who can't find loved ones can submit a request for help. Disaster cleanup efforts are in full swing across the state of Florida. During the storm, there were reports of dozens of tornadoes touching down one of them in a Fort Myers neighborhood. And in that same area, homes lost their roofs and fences at one airport were torn apart. Jessica Thompson is the CEO of All Hands and Hearts, a nonprofit focused on communities impacted by disasters. And she's with us from Fort Myers in Florida. Thank you so much. Can you give us a sense of the damage, first of all, because you know, that only becomes apparent days after these events.",

But still, there is a significant amount of damage out there, both from storm surge, flooding from the rain and this tornado outbreak as well.

But not everyone is convinced, as Bill Weir explains.

But as families reel in private grief, it's the material loss that is so obvious everywhere in Pinellas County, from the tower construction crane that crashed down on neighboring buildings, to Tropicana Field, peeled like an orange by Milton's winds. The Tampa Bay Rays already have plans in the works to build a new stadium with taxpayers kicking in hundreds of millions of dollars.

CNN's Anna Stewart has the details from London. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANNA STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It was a surprise visit by the Prince and Princess of Wales and the first public engagement for the Princess since she announced she had finished her cancer treatment. They're seen here in Southport, a town in the northwest of England, which experienced a shocking incident in July. A man attacked young children with a knife at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class. The Prince and Princess visited the bereaved families of the three children killed in the attack. They also met with members of the emergency services who responded on a day to offer their support. The King visited Southport back in August, and it's clear today that the royal family don't want the town to feel forgotten as the weeks and months pass. The Prince and Princess of Wales posted a message on X after their visit, saying: We continue to stand with everyone in Southport. Meeting the community today has been a powerful reminder of the importance of supporting one another in the wake of unimaginable tragedy. You will remain in our thoughts and prayers. The Princess of Wales is back at work but is expected to keep her workload light as she continues to recover. Anna Stewart, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
