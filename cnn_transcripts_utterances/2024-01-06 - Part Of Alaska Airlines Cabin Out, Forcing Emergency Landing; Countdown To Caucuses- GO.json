Alaska Airlines is now grounding its entire fleet of Boeing 737-9 MAX planes after a terrifying trip on Friday. Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 had just taken off from Portland, Oregon, when a section of its cabin ripped off. Leaving a gaping hole as you see right there in the jet, with more than 170 passengers on board. One passenger captured the scene during the very tense but silent moments after the incident happened. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WHITFIELD (voice over): They are all nearly paralyzed in fear there. the plane was only airborne for about 20 minutes before the pilot made an emergency landing back in Portland. One person was taken to the hospital with a minor injury. Another passenger describes the harrowing ordeal. EVAN SMITH, PASSENGER, ALASKA AIRLINES FLIGHT 1282: I understand talking to a lady who was sitting in the row immediately behind where the panel blew at, that there was a -- you could see later that there was a two windows Section panel that blew out. it's about as wide as a refrigerator and but two thirds as high. And she said there was, I guess, a boy and his mother was sitting in that row and his shirt was sucked off him and out of the plane. And his mother was holding on to -- onto him. And she said her own little boys phone went out too. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

More on that in a second.That's really happened in a bang, seven minutes into the flight, at 16,000 feet. This plane experience what is technically known as a rapid decompression. The high-pressure breathable air inside goes rushing outside, the cold thin air outside comes rushing inside. And you heard about that boy who had his shirt pulled off, the oxygen mask came down, the pilots had to deal with this very quickly. And I want you to listen to the calm from the new air traffic control recordings we just got. Step one, fly the airplane; step two, run the checklist, descend back down to breathable air.

I just -- it's hard for me to imagine regardless of the fact that Alaska uses that or does or does not utilize that particular section as emergency exit. That was a service door. Pete, did a great job of pretty much describing, you know, what that was all about. But at the end of the day, it's a plug-type door is what we call it. It's like, like a bank vault.

So, they had enough oxygen, it would have gotten a little dicey had they'd been up there longer, but -- or have been at a much higher altitude. That's the other part of it.It's good that it came off when it did. The -- and then, once you start with the oxygen mask, you start a checklist, like Pete said, then, you come down very quickly. However, one of the caveats of coming down is to -- is to say, well, should we come down fast? Or do we have a possible structural integrity issue. And guess what, they probably thought they did, got a call from flight attendants and say, hey, this side of the fuselage has a big hole in it. So, they probably took a little more time than they would have, when I looked at the FlightAware data, they could have come down a lot faster.

He was admitted to Walter Reed Medical Center on New Year's Day for complications following an elective medical procedure. The Pentagon didn't mention the hospitalization for four days and made no mention of it at a press briefing on Thursday. And a short time ago, a National Security Council spokesperson said President Biden was informed of the Secretary's condition but didn't say when that occurred. CNN's Arlette Saenz is covering all of this for us. Arlette, what do we know about Austin's condition?",

Donald Trump's political future now rests with the highest court in the land. The U.S. Supreme Court said Friday it will review Colorado's unprecedented decision to remove the former president from the state ballot, claiming he should be disqualified under the 14th Amendment's insurrection clause. It's a decision that could significantly impact this year's presidential election and puts the nine justices squarely in the middle weeks before voting starts in the early primary contests.I want to bring in now Seth Waxman for more legal perspective. He's a criminal defense attorney and former federal prosecutor. Seth, great to see you and Happy New Year.",

      "sentences": "Yes, sure. Them jumping into this fray is an incredibly important step given this election cycle that we're now heading into. And we should also point out that this is the third anniversary today as you and I talk of the attack on the Capitol, and that begs the fundamental question of whether Donald Trump engaged in an insurrection or rebellion against this country. Now, myself and many other legal scholars believe that this Supreme Court may try to avoid that significant question and use what have been called kind of procedural off ramps or procedural issues to avoid the ultimate question.So some of those procedural off ramps may include the idea of whether Donald Trump qualifies as an officer under the 14th Amendment. And if he doesn't, then he would still appear on the ballot and would not be disqualified. Another off ramp may be that it this is a congressional issue, and Congress should issue legislation to address who appears on the national ballot, and that's under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. But in any case, practically speaking, I find it somewhat difficult to believe that there are going to be five Supreme Court justices, three of whom had been appointed by Donald Trump, who will remove Donald Trump from this ballot, given that a large portion of this country certainly seems to want to consider him as president. And ultimately what this may cause is a boomerang effect. While there's a lot of negativity, in legal pleadings, and in discussions about Donald Trump right now, if and a month or two from now, the Supreme Court issues a ruling in his favor, he will certainly wave that opinion around as his vindication and use that as a political platform to say that he did not engage in an insurrection and is innocent. Now whether the opinion actually says that or not, you know, we've seen Donald Trump go to that playbook before and I expect that he would use it to his full advantage politically.",

But if you're looking at the side street here, it gives you a sense of what a lot of conditions or conditions are going to look like on a lot of streets still snowy, icy. And all we have seen, Fred, throughout this early part of the afternoon these roads getting more and more slick. The sidewalks are definitely slippery. If you look outside this business, you can see some owners, homeowners, different people took the initiative and assaulted the sidewalks trying to stay safe, Fred, but it's definitely coming down early this afternoon.",

This is a message Secretary Blinken will take to those countries, you mentioned, to the Emirates as well where he'll stop to Qatar as well to Saudi Arabia to Egypt. So this is a very, very important message.But when he gets here to Israel, it will be more specific. It will be about security along the northern border with Lebanon, which is tense, as you just mentioned today, but it will also be about the humanitarian situation in Gaza, making sure that enough humanitarian supplies can get into people there and reach the people there. Here we're talking about food, water, medicine -- medical supplies as well. And also enable the people of Gaza to be able to return to their homes, particularly in the north, a lot of homes there are destroyed, but people still want to be able to get access to go back there. That will be part of it. He will also listen to what Israeli officials have to say about their plans for a day after he was going to push them to make sure that the civilians in Gaza are not only getting humanitarian supplies, but that they are safer, and that there is a realistic plan for the day after when the hostilities end in Gaza, to turn the situation into one where there is a political authority and there can be rebuilding that can begin. And the Israelis have been laying out some ideas about that. But I suspect that on that Secretary Blinken will want to drill down because they are quite ambiguous at the moment.",

We don't have details beyond that.But of course, this was a very careful strike by Hezbollah targeting what is very clearly a military post in the north of Israel. And they've announced that it's in connection with the killing of that Hamas leader in Beirut earlier on in the week. If they were to expand, then that will obviously raise the tensions at the moment. And that fear of an escalation could come into play. But another analysis at the moment could be that if Hezbollah had really wanted to escalate tensions, above the sort of accepted threshold, if you will, they could have fired more missiles, they could have fired more accurate and heavier missiles at that particular base. And in this case, it appears as if it is a strike back but below a threshold to certainly trigger a bigger response from Israel at this time.",
