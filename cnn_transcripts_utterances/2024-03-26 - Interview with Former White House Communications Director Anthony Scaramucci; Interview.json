      "sentences": "Indeed, the president vowed that federal funds would pay for the whole rebuild. Getting that bridge and the port and those dependent jobsback up and running is crucial for President Biden. It goes to the heart of the economy as well. Meantime, his opponent in the upcoming presidential race, the Former President Donald Trump, spends much of his time in court defending himself against a series of criminal charges, fines, and upcoming trials. Trump made history, of course, when he became the first U.S. president to be impeached twice. And now, he's making history again. Becoming the first former president to be criminally prosecuted. On April 15th, Trump is set to face trial in Manhattan on charges of paying hush money to cover up an affair with Stephanie Clifford, AKA Stormy Daniels. True to form, Trump says he's the victim of persecution, using those lines to get the MAGA faithful to fork over their cash for his campaign and his defense. Trump faces three other criminal indictments, including over attempts to overturn the 2020 election. But for now, only the Manhattan hush money case looks set to go to trial before November. Anthony Scaramucci was once a dedicated Trump supporter and spent a notorious 11 days as the White House communications director. But since 2019, he's opposed the former president's reelection. And he's now joining us from Las Vegas. Anthony Scaramucci, welcome to the program. You know, we want to talk to you because it's important for, I think, everybody in the United States and watching around the world to try to understand how to inform their own thinking about a potential second Trump presidency. And since you were there for a good, good long time, we thought we'd start by asking you based on what he has already done in office. But first, I want to start with the trials. As we mentioned, what's just happened, he was given a bit of a lifeline yesterday, the amount of bond that he was told, like nearly half a billion dollars was reduced. On the other hand, he was told that a court date on different charges would actually be coming on April 15th. So, where do you think he stands politically and, you know, with his faithful right now?",

And so,he now has his daughter-in-law taking charge of the RNC. And in the fine print when you're sending money to the RNC, it says, well, the first stop for that money is going to be the president's political action committee, and it may be used for his legal fees. And so, as long as you're disclosing what the money is going to be used for, in the United States, you can use the money for those reasons. And, of course, what Mr. Trump did after the election, he lied about the election results. He had a very large group of people in the U.S. believing in election denialism, including his friend, Ronna Romney McDaniel. And what he did was he raised a ton of money off of that big lie. And he's used a lot of that money for his current legal fees on these four different cases. So, you can use the money. But the danger for him, and I think he knows this, his Facebook ads are down about 85 percent. His Instagram ads are virtually nonexistent. And if he doesn't get up on the airwaves and in social media and scale, he's not going to reach enough people to beat President Biden. And so, remember, this will be down to a few swing states. President Biden will win the popular vote. Mr. Trump has never won that, but it will be a battle in three or four swing states. And without the advertising, it's going to be very hard for him.",

First of all,these aren't well-resumed people, these loyalists. And, secondarily, Mr. Trump has always been a status seeker, and he's somebody that will want resumes in his cabinet. And, unfortunately, if he does win, and I predict that he won't, there will be people that will be gravitated to the American government, much the way many of us were where we thought there was a call to service to serve the American people, and not realizing the full insanity that Mr. Trump represented. And so, people will do that. Obviously, Kevin McCarthy is flying around with him on the Trump plane. He could potentially be his chief of staff. John Paulson, who is a hedge fund billionaire, has been cited to be potentially the treasury of the secretary -- secretary of the treasury. So, I don't buy the argument that he'll just be loyalists. Mr. Trump doesn't have that type of personality. He'll bring in people that he thinks are well-resonated.",

So, if I remember rightly when I was covering the first term, his only term, he basically promised to solve the Israel-Palestinian conflict with the deal of the century. He said he would end the Ayatollah's regime in Iran by pulling out of the nuclear deal and applying maximum pressure. Of course, none of that happened. He now says he could settle the Ukraine war in 24 hours. Nobody actually believes that's possible. Does he have a worldview that shapes foreign policy?

Kim Jong Un of North Korea, and then went to three meetings with him in which he promised that the two of them had a lovely bromance that was going to end the Korean Peninsula conflict. But I spoke to -- and of course, it didn't happen. The former South Korea foreign minister told me that the Hanoi summit and all of those, you know, in 2019 or whatever, she said it was a debacle, and this is why. Here's what she said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KANG KYUNG-WHA, FORMER SOUTH KOREAN FOREIGN MINISTER:  The president has tremendous desire, intention to do something, but there was very little backup at the working level. And this is -- you know, this is the typical Trump leadership on these issues. Will, but very little follow up and support from the working level.

The 60 or 70 years ofthis type of engagement that we've had with North Korea is the best that we could do. And I don't think if he tries to re-engage with the North Korean dictator that anything positive is going to come out of it. The Israeli-Palestinian issue, I think, is more tender and way more sensitive. Remember, Mr. Trump loves Vladimir Putin. He speaks about him in these grandiose terms. He wants to be part of the axis of autocracy, which is why he's always praising these dictators. We have to remember that the Putin regime is very close to the Iranians. And the Iranians, as you know and I know, they have in their constitution the exportation of their revolution, but they also want to wipe Israel off the map. And so, his buddy Putin has an ozy from the Iranians. And Mr. Trump is very, very transactional. So, all the stuff that he said about Israel in the past, it's not impossible for him to back a truck over the Israeli nation or the Israeli people. And I think people have to understand that about him. He turns on everybody. And so, this is a very dangerous thing. He would be horrible for Israel, particularly because of this relationship that he wants to have with Putin and the, and the ozy that Putin has to Iran.",

Jomana Karadsheh has this story on the disaster of airdrops that are trying to help. And a note, of course, they are disturbing scenes to watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  As they spot a plane and the aid begins to drop, they run as fast as they can. It's the rush of a people so desperate, so hungry, who would do anything to feed their children, now on the brink of starvation. This is what survival in Gaza has come to, fighting for food, that little bit of aid that makes it into the north, where manmade famine now looms. People chase parachutes that fell into these choppy waters. It is desperation that drives them into the sea. What you're about to see next is disturbing. It's the reality of a war growing more cruel by the day. The fastest, the fittest emerged with boxes of American-issued meals ready to eat. Others didn't make it out alive. People gather around the thin, frail body of a man who drowned trying to reach that aid. Twelve people drowned, according to paramedics. The parachutes fell into the water, Abu Hammad (ph) says, but people went to eat. They went into the water and drowned. The current was so strong, they didn't know how to swim. It's what you do when you have nothing left to lose. Iman (ph) goes in swimming to get food for his children. He returns dead. This man says, bring us aid through the land crossings. Our children are dying. We are dying. What are you doing? Where is the world? The world has been piling up life-saving aid into trucks stuck at land crossings. Seemingly powerless in the face of Israel that's accused of using starvation as a weapon in this war. A charge it denies. Forcing the International Community to resort to dropping aid from the sky. Several countries carried out aid drops on this day, deliveries that have been criticized for being ineffective, insufficient, and unsafe. Earlier this month, another air drop disaster, when a parachute failed and eight packages came crashing down, killing at least five people. It's a war that's testing humanity. And many say this is what failure looks like. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He's terrible at recruiting overseas spies until he figures out how to match people. And matching comes from what researchers have discovered that we tend to think of a discussion as being about one thing. But actually, every discussion is made up of multiple kinds of conversations. And those kinds of conversations tend to fall into one of three buckets. There's practical conversations where we're talking about plans or solving problems. There's emotional conversations where I tell you what I'm feeling and I don't want you to solve my feelings, I want you to empathize. And there's social conversations, which is about how we relate to each other. And very often, super communicators know that you have to be having the same kind of conversation at the same time in order to connect. So, if I come home and I start complaining about my day to my wife and I'm having an emotional conversation, and she responds with practical advice and says, why don't you take your boss out to lunch and get to know him a little bit better? That's not going to solve the problem for me. In fact, I'm not going to be able to hear what she's saying. It's only when we're having the same kind of conversation, when we match each other, that we'll really be able to communicate. And then we can move from emotional, to practical, to social, back to emotional together.",

And he was terrible at it. He kept -- he would go to these embassy parties and try and buddy up to people. And they would say things like, I know that you're trying to recruit me as a spy. I'm going to report you to the authorities if you don't stop right now. Now, eventually there was this woman who came to town, who worked for her foreign ministry in a Middle Eastern country. And so, Lawler goes up and he introduces himself and then he gets to know her. He befriends her. And eventually he says, I'm working for the CIA. Will you work with me? And she panics. She says, no, look. in my country, they murder people for that. I can't participate in this at all. And so, Lawler goes and he tells his bosses, I tried to recruit this woman and it didn't work. And they say, look, you're going to get fired, my friend. You got to recruit someone. You've been here for almost a year. So, he convinces this woman, Yasmin, to have one more dinner with him. And instead of trying to make arguments to her, instead of trying to charm her or win her over, he just decides, look. this is pointless. It's not going to work. I'm just going to be as honest as I can be. And he starts telling her how disappointed he is in himself, how he understands that she's about to go home. And she feels like she's wasting her life because he feels like he's wasting his life. All he ever wanted to do was be a CIA officer. And here he is, terrible at it. And it's at that moment that Yasmin is able to hear what he's saying. And she says, I can help you. I can become an asset for you. And she ends up being the best resource in the Middle East over the next 20 years. But Lawler was only able to recruit her. She was only able to hear what Lawler was saying when he was authentic and honest and when he engaged in this reciprocal vulnerability. When she shared something about himself, he shared something true about himself. And in doing so, they were able to forge a connection. And this is true for all of us. All of us have an instinct towards reciprocal vulnerability. When we are vulnerable ourselves, when we hear other people's vulnerability, we trust each other more, we like each other more, and we end up communicating much, much better.",

Asking, oh, what made you decide to go to medical school? What do you love about practicing medicine? When you ask those questions, what you're really asking is, tell me who you actually are. Tell me something about yourself, about what you care about. In general, the principle is, asking about the facts of someone's life can often be a dead end. Asking how they feel about their life invites them to say something meaningful and real. And they've actually started teaching this in schools to teachers. When teachers encounter a student who's having a problem, they'll often say to them, do you want me to help you? Do you want me to hear you? Or do you want me to hug you? And what they're really asking there is, what kind of conversation do you need to have right now? And tell me who you are. Tell me what's important to you.

Our heart rate is similar. And more importantly, what's happening inside our brains becomes more and more similar. We become what's known as neural entrained. And this neural entrainment, it feels wonderful, right? That's why having a great conversation feels so good. And what we know is that the more entrained we become, the more our thoughts become similar, the more we can understand each other, the more we hear each other. And that makes sense, because when I explain to you what I'm feeling or what I'm thinking, and you experience that emotional a little bit yourself, or you experience that idea, that connection is at the core of communication. That's what we mean when we say, I connected and I communicated with that person. We were on the same wavelength. And it's actually hardwired into our brains, not only to be able to achieve this entrainment, but to crave it, to want it. You know, The U.S. surgeon general said that being lonely is the equivalent of smoking 15 cigarettes a day. And 15 cigarettes is a lot of cigarettes. When we are connected to other people, when we are entrained with them, when we ask them questions and we reveal vulnerable things about ourselves, when we're authentic together, that is when we feel a real connection to someone else.

And they wanted to see if they could just have civil conversations. And before the conversation started, they taught them this one particular skill known as looping for understanding. That's really useful in conflict conversations. And it has three steps. The first step is ask a question, preferably a deep question. The second step is once that person has replied, repeat back in your own words, which you heard them say. And the third step is ask if you got it right. Now, the reason why this is so powerful is because it proves that we're listening. And you're right. We are living in a world right now that seems polarized and divided, and it seems like you go online and people are just screaming at each other rather than having conversations. But there is a way around that, which is that when we prove to each other that we are listening, when we prove to each other that we want to understand that my goal is not to convince you that you're wrong and I'm right, my goal is to understand how you see the world and explain to you how I see the world. That's when, all of a sudden, we can start making those breakthroughs. And the thing is, we have been doing this for centuries. If you think about the United States and the constitutional convention, this nation was born in people who hated each other, coming together for months and having these fights and these arguments, but also listening to each other, listening well enough that they could write a constitution together. We are at our best when we want to communicate with each other, when we want to communicate with people who believe different things. And part of that communication means not only explaining how I feel, but asking questions and listening to how you feel. And as long as we remember that, as a nation and as a world, we will be OK.",

And within 45 minutes, people were calling each other, Jack (INAUDIBLE) did not see us, right? It all fell apart once they went online. And the reason why is because, oftentimes, we forget that different forms of communication have different rules. In fact, when telephones first became popular about 100 years ago, there were all these studies that said, oh, people will never be able to have real conversations on the phone because you can't see each other. And what's interesting is that at the time, they were right. If you look at early transcripts of telephone conversations, people use them like telegrams. They'd send each other shopping lists and stock orders. But of course, nowadays, we can have some of our most meaningful conversations via the telephone. And it's because we've learned the rules of telephones without being aware of it. When we talk on the phone, we over-annunciate our words a little bit. We put more emotion into our voice because we know that the other person can't see us. These are instincts that we've learned in using the technology. And digital conversations are similar. When I look at my teenage kids, they have no problem communicating online. In fact, they have some of the most meaningful conversations via text and emojis. But for those of us who grew up in a slightly different world, the key is to remind ourselves that different forms of communication have different rules. If I'm talking to you on Facebook, I can't assume it's the same as if we're talking face-to-face. If I'm sending you a text, that's different from sending you an e-mail, that's different from giving you a call. And when we remind ourselves that different forms of communication have different rules, it becomes fairly obvious what we ought to do in each form of communication. We should be more polite in e-mails. We should be less sarcastic. We are going to make it through this period. And digital communication is with us to stay. And it's going to get healthier and healthier and healthier the more that we think and we remind ourselves that different forms of communication require different skills and different rules, and the more we observe and respect those.",
