We have now learned that a federal judge is convinced that Donald Trump may have used one of his own defense attorneys to break the law when federal agents were trying to retrieve those top- secret files stored at Mar-a-Lago in Florida. So this means the attorney may need to testify again and answer questions that he previously refused to answer by claiming attorney- client privilege. Trump has not been charged in the documents case, but this may prove significant in the obstruction probe being pursued by Special Counsel Jack Smith. So this all comes as Trump prepares for possible indictment in a separate case here in New York, in the Stormy Daniels hush-money case. The grand jury is set to reconvene on that today. We're waiting to see if they will decide to indict and pursue criminal charges. So they're two different things, but two huge developments overnight. We're going to break it all down. Straight to the big news in the Trump classified documents case. A key deadline passed just moments ago at the top of the hour. Kaitlan, this is extraordinary in so many ways.

We're learning that emails between Stormy Daniels and one of Trump's lawyers have been turned over to the district attorney and the communications apparently dates back to 2018 when Daniels was looking for an attorney to represent her. And Daniels' lawyer claims that disclosed confidential information that Joe Tacopina, who would later become Trump's lawyer, right? Well, Tacopina denies that there is a conflict or that confidential information was shared with his office. And he says he neither met nor spoke to Daniel's. But I want you to listen.

Whether or not this rises to a conflict of interest that would require some sort of limitation on Tacopina's role or even disqualification from representing Trump. And the big question, as you said, was whether or not Daniels shared confidential information that could be used in this case and used against her. If this were to go to trial, could any information that was given to Tacopina to his law firm be used against her in a cross- examination, for example? Or would it give Tacopina and Trump a leg up? Now, talking to Stormy Daniels' current attorney, Clark Brewster, he believes that there is confidential information that was shared between Daniels, Tacopina and his firm. And he at least believes that it rises to the level of needing to be reviewed. And as you said, Tacopina says that there was no wrongdoing. There's no conflict of interest. But again, pointing to your own interview with him in 2018 when he suggests that there was an attorney-client privilege established between he and Daniels, suggesting that he had had some sort of interaction with her all of this, raising a giant question mark right now and again, it'll be up to a judge to decide what level this rises to.",

But that doesn't necessarily mean that he's going to side either way. And if he doesn't, of course, Kaitlan, the next step would be that we see these two sides, Dominion and FOX, square off in court on April 17. Of course, there is a chance that they could settle before then, but at this point, so much has come out on both sides that there's not really much incentive, unless one party believes strongly or another that they could get a smaller lawsuit or a better, more favorable amount. You mentioned $1.6 billion. That's a pretty hefty price tag, especially considering the fact that Dominion's not that big, you know. I think it's about 100 million or so in revenue every year.",

But unless we were talking about all the cases involving Donald Trump, this one also involves Donald Trump, because it has to do with his election lies about, you know, winning, that he's saying that he won the 2020 election.Let's talk a little bit more about the judge, what the judge is possibly thinking here. The judge overseeing the case hit FOX's lawyers with a lot of tough questions yesterday about the network's embrace of election denialism in 2020, at one point, even suggesting that it could have been -- and I quote here -- \"a bigger story that a president who lost an election was making all these unsubstantiated, false allegations.\" What do you glean from the judge's thought process, based on that line of questioning?",

How can you argue that you should be covered by neutral reportage, that you should be protected here? And at the same time, there's been so much proof that's come out that FOX's personalities and leadership knew that what they were putting on air was false. And they knew that the guests that they were having on air that was supporting some of these claims were not spewing the truth.And, in fact, in a lot of the things that have come out in the recent weeks with some of these defamation suit depositions, has been that the hosts have called these allegations crazy and nonsensical. And so I think the judge is really skeptical of FOX here. It doesn't necessarily mean he's going to side with FOX, but I think it makes it a lot harder to, you know, imagine FOX getting a win before this thing goes to trial. LEMON: Yes. The hosts are calling what Trump was alleging, Trump and his acolytes, what they're alleging, saying that it was nonsensical and they didn't believe it. But that's not exactly what they were portraying on the air.",

BRIG. GEN. SHANE MORGAN, COMMANDING GENERAL, ARMY'S FIRES CENTER OF EXCELLENCE: Our assessment is that the Ukrainian soldiers are impressive and absolutely a quick study, due to their extensive air defense knowledge and experience in a combat zone. It was easier, though never easy, for them to grasp the Patriot system operations and maintenance concepts. BERTRAND (voice-over): But the stakes are so high that CNN was not allowed to film or photograph the training, an effort to protect the Ukrainians who will be back on the front lines in just a matter of weeks and to shield the U.S. from blowback from Moscow, U.S. officials emphasizing that the Patriots are purely defensive and not a threat to Russia. COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: It's a point defense system. It's got to be placed in a location that is defending a target like a capital city, Kyiv or a port city like Odessa. So it this is not a weapons system that can be moved around on the battlefield based on changing threats. BERTRAND (voice-over): The systems will, however, help defend Ukraine against near daily missile barrages by Russia.
