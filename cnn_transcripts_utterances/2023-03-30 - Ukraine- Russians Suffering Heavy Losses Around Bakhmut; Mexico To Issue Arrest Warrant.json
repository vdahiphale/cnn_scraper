Officials say in just one day, nearly 100 Russian soldiers were killed. Though they acknowledged Russians have had partial success in their attacks. Still the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman says it's the Russians who are paying the highest price, here he is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GEN. MARK MILLEY, CHAIRMAN, JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF: These forces are very undertrained. They're essentially doing frontal assaults into machine gun positions etcetera and they're getting slaughtered, the Russian troops are. Ukrainians are doing a very effective area defense that is proven to be very costly to the Russians for about the last 20-21 days. The Russians have not made any progress whatsoever, in and around Bakhmut. So, it's a slaughter fest for the Russians. They're getting hammered in the vicinity of Bakhmut and the Ukrainians have fought very, very well. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Thanks so much for being here with us again.So, I want to go back to General Milley's comments about the Russians getting \"hammered\" in Bakhmut. Is that the way you see things there? And what does this long stalemate mean for Ukraine? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST (on camera): Yes, Kim, it's good to be with you. It's really both sides are the ones that are getting hammered in this particular case. But the Russians are definitely getting the worst end of the field, at least at the moment. So, as far as the state of play on the ground is concerned, the Russians are basically surrounding Bakhmut on three sides. And they're trying to close the gap in the west by attacking the towns in that particular area. So, they have certain advantages, but they're not being able to really prosecute those advantages. And right now, the city of Bakhmut has lasted a really long time. And this lasted longer than the siege of Stalingrad did in World War II. And we're approaching eight months now for the siege of Bakhmut and that is a very long time for the Russians not to be able to move forward in this place. So, in essence what we have is a basic area where the sides are really in a stalemate right now.",

The Pope has had some health issues recently including colon surgery and chronic knee pain.CNN's Delia Gallagher has the details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DELIA GALLAGHER, CNN VATICAN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): The Vatican says Pope Francis had been complaining in the past few days about some respiratory difficulties, and on Wednesday afternoon, he went to Rome's Gemelli Hospital for what the Vatican calls previously scheduled tests. Those tests revealed that the Pope has a respiratory infection. They have ruled out COVID but they say that he will need to stay in hospital for medical attention for the next few days. Now, we saw Pope Francis on Wednesday morning at his weekly general audience in St. Peter's Square. He seemed to be speaking and breathing just fine. But of course, he is 86 years old and when he was a younger man, he had part of his right lung removed due to respiratory illness. This begins an important Easter week, one of the busiest weeks in the Vatican on Sunday for the Pope. He has scheduled masses and other events but for the moment, we will be monitoring his progress in the hospital. Delia Gallagher, CNN, Rome. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

All right. Still ahead, a potential risk to humanity. Tech leaders warn of the dangers artificial intelligence poses to society. Coming up, why they say we need to slow down before it's too late.

They're calling for a pause on developing the most powerful A.I. systems for at least six months.The letter comes just two weeks after the firm OpenAI announced an even more powerful version of the technology behind the viral A.I. chatbot tool, ChatGPT. Even the CEO of OpenAI signed onto the letter. It reads, in part, quote, \"A.I. systems with human competitive intelligence can pose profound risks to society and humanity. Recent months have seen A.I. labs locked in an out-of-control race to develop and deploy even more powerful digital minds that no one, not even their creators, can understand, predict or reliably control.\" More than 1,000 tech professionals have signed the letter, including Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak; SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk; and former U.S. presidential candidate Andrew Yang; as well as our next guest, professor emeritus of computer science at the University of Southern California, Paul Rosenbloom. Thank you so much for being here with us. I mean, the warnings in this letter are quite apocalyptic, I guess I'd say. What concerns you the most?",

They're enormously broad in terms of what they know and in terms of the kind of capabilities they have, but they're very shallow. And so what can happen is they don't know what they're doing. They can't reflect on what they're doing. They haven't been educated. They just sort of induced what they know from large bodies of information. And so there's a sense in which they're both extremely powerful and extremely unsafe.",
