It just isn't feasible for such a large portion of the population to move so quickly. Alex Marquardt, I see the weather turning worse behind you, as well. Thank you. Well, nowhere that's safe, no place to go, and a situation that is getting increasingly apocalyptic. U.N. officials are again sounding the alarm about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and warning that if further aid isn't allowed in, an even more hellish scenario will unfold if that's possible. A shortage of aid isn't the only threat facing civilians in Gaza. A spokesperson for the U.N. Children's Fund says exposure to the elements and the fighting are also a massive worry.

BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on-camera): Yes, well those descriptions are very apt. I mean, right now it is cold, it is rainy here in Jerusalem, and it's going to be cold and rainy in Gaza, as well. And what we know, what we've seen, is that tens of thousands of people have set up makeshift camps outside of Rafah, other parts of the southern Gaza Strip, by the road. Basically, they're using plastic sheeting to try to make shelters. They have no access to water. There's no water sources available. So, if you want water you have to find something that's not going to be nearby. There are no stores, there are no health facilities. Basically, they are on their own in the wilderness. And the situation is bound to get much worse as the weather deteriorates as it is as I'm speaking. And so, people are just happy to do what they can to just get the slightest bit of food. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WEDEMAN (voice-over): Desperate times call for desperate measures. And in Gaza, if that means looting the local bakery destroyed overnight by an Israeli airstrike, so be it. Look at the people, says Ikram Rai. They are doing this out of hunger. It was the Baraka Bakery. Baraka is Arabic for blessing. But now Gaza is under the curse of a war. It was the last functioning bakery in Deir Al Balah. The people's basic needs, striking it as a kind of terrorism. Once the sun came up Monday, people of all ages descended upon the bakery, taking away bags of flour, cooking oil, scraps of wood to use for cooking and heating, and just about anything else they could carry away.

Speaker Mike Johnson put out a new letter to the White House today making those demands very clear. And the problem is that does not square with what's happening in the Senate. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, as we've just heard, is demanding that Congress move forward with aid to Ukraine and tie that aid to aid for Israel. House Republicans, meanwhile -- the Republicans controlling the House, want aid to Israel to be voted on separately, so that Congress can work on these issues about tying Ukraine aid to the border. So, these are very sticky issues here, Bianna. And the issue is -- the big issue here is that time is of the essence and Congress is taking the time, trying to figure out these border talks. But the White House is saying that there is no time. They're demanding action now. So, President of Ukraine, Zelenskyy is going to be speaking remotely to both the Senate and the House today.

And part of the reason for this is just the way in which Gaza is laid out.Not only do you have Hamas fighters that are interspersed and intermingled with the civilian population. You have a lot of support for Hamas within that population, and you also have all kinds of equipment -- the tunnels. You have a very Byzantine type, structural system underneath as well as above ground in these areas. And as far as Khan Younis is concerned, that area of course is where a lot of the refugees from the north came. Now, those refugees, those very same refugees, are being told to move back either to the north or somewhere else, and that is really complicating things. So, these operations are going to be extremely difficult to conduct by the Israelis. But in terms of scope and scale, it's going to be very similar to what you saw in the north may even be a bit more intense, just because I think the IDF, the Israeli Defense Forces, they feel that they're closing in on many elements of Hamas that they are actually actively targeting.

For the layman, I mean, that just seems like a poor phrasing of words in general. His clarification was he doesn't have the exact numbers. But from a military perspective, can you help explain the point he was even trying to make? Yeah, it's really difficult even from a military perspective. Of course, I'm looking at it from the U.S. point of view. But having said that, you really want to minimize civilian casualties and having two civilians die for every single combatant that you kill, that's not a good ratio by any one's math. And the problem that the Israelis have, of course, is, you know, basically a geographical and a structural one. But the fact that they're dealing with this really requires them to be far more precise than they are right now. And it's difficult to do it, but this is not something that I would hang my hat on. This kind of a ratio, I think, it's really a failure in terms of the ability to protect the civilian population, which is actually a primary obligation of any military force. It's an absolute failure to protect that civilian population and that is something that is really difficult to justify if not impossible.",

The SEC -- they say that they don't comment on the existence or non-existence of investigations. We did reach out to the Israeli equivalent of the SEC. And that regulatory authority said that they are aware of these findings, that it's being, quote, \"thoroughly checked\". And then they say they've worked with all relevant parties in Israel and abroad. Now, I did speak to one of the professors here, Joshua Mitts at Columbia and he told me that he's very confident that this short-selling activity is extraordinary and exceptional, that it's not just the product of ordinary trading. And I did ask him about who he thinks could have been behind these trades. And he said that, you know, it's very speculative to link it to Hamas although that is obviously one possibility. The professor also said that it's possible this is someone who had overheard what Hamas was doing or something else is possible here, as well. Well, what was so chilling, Bianna, is that Mitts told me that he's confident that this is just the tip of the iceberg, that there was actually a lot more trading going on behind the scenes than the researchers were even able to see.

Ever since Israel responded to the attack by Hamas on October 7th, the frequency of anti-Semitic attacks across Italy has increased according to the National Commission of the Fight Against Anti-Semitism. Cobblestones marking Jewish people who were deported to concentration camps have been vandalized in Rome. An anti-Semitic graffiti has appeared in Genoa, Ravenna, Milan, Florence and elsewhere. Here in the Jewish ghetto in Rome, thousands of Jewish people were taken away to concentration camps 80 years ago. Today, the commission says, security is at an all-time high.

She recently told Italian Parliament that she's worried about indifference to anti-Semitism today. Authorities are worried, too. GIUSEPPE PECORARO, NATIONAL COORDINATOR FOR THE FIGHT AGAINST ANTI- SEMITISM: The indifference is because when people aren't interested, they are afraid to intervene.

That's the main driver of hate on these campuses. I mean, so between Brandeis and U.F., you've got some models, but the plan is simple. Number one, adopt a standard definition of anti-Semitism, the IRA definition. And then number two, enforce your own codes of conduct. Suspend students who bully and intimidate and threaten their peers. Number two, it's simple. Eject the students who are serial offenders, like those from Students for Justice in Palestine. And number three, rework your DEI programs. As you were just saying, can you imagine a world in which 73 percent, three quarters of Jewish students have directly experienced or seen anti- Semitism? This is a national outrage. The problem is our university presidents aren't addressing it. And there's another important stat. Only 18 percent of Jewish students who have done their DEI programs have even been educated about anti-Semitism. So, four out of five have done DEI training, Bianna, with nothing about anti-Semitism.
