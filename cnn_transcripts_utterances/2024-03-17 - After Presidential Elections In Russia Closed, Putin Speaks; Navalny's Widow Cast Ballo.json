He is expected to win, keeping him in office until 2030 and continuing as Russia's longest-serving leader since Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin.

      "sentences": "Yeah, it was it was a very short victory speech, even though the final results haven't come in. It looks like this has been a landslide victory, as expected for the Russian president, who secures a fifth presidential term. And these were short comments at his campaign headquarters. He walked into the room. He thanked the volunteers that he said had worked very hard for the good of the country. And then he made a short address to his supporters in the auditorium, talking about how there were many challenges to come. But how -- now that the country was united, that essentially that the country couldn't be defeated as long as people stayed together.He also said that the election -- the election means -- I'm just reading some of my notes here. The election means that we have the trust of the people and we have their hope that we will finish what we have planned. And so, this is Vladimir Putin taking these successful election results, however orchestrated they've been, and using it to claim that he now has a resounding mandate from the Russian people to press ahead with his policies. For instance, the special military operation, as he calls it, the war in Ukraine, and the other policies that will have to be taken in order to address the Russian economy, the sanctions in the country and things like that, some of which are going to be very difficult for the country to endure. And so, this is the first reaction we've seen of Vladimir Putin since these preliminary results started coming in. But, of course, this speech was undoubtedly planned sometime in advance because we all knew that Vladimir Putin was going to win this election without any doubt at all, because there were no opposition figures that were allowed to stand in this country, which has become increasingly repressive where opposition and dissent to Vladimir Putin has been silenced. And we remember the opposition leaders have either been exiled, have either been jailed or in the case of Alexei Navalny, is dead. He died in an Arctic prison colony last month. And so, this has been a big victory for Vladimir Putin. But it does only, you know, reflect an incomplete part, I think it's fair to say, of the political views inside the country.",

We saw polling stations being firebombed, hit with Molotov cocktails, individuals going into the polling stations and pouring dark ink, dye or paint into the ballot boxes to ruin the paper ballots that were cast there.And earlier today, there was a show of mass defiance across the country with supporters of the late opposition leader Alexei Navalny gathering at an act of defiance, which the opposition called midday against Putin, where people came at exactly midday in the various time zones across the country to cast their ballots at their registered voting stations. [17:05:00] And, you know, we were at one in Moscow where there was nobody at 10:00 to midday. And by midday, there were 150 people there.

That's a far greater proportion of voters that Vladimir Putin seen in any of his four previous presidential wins as well. And so, look, what Putin is now doing is saying, look, I have the mandate of the people. The people have spoken. The power in this country rests with the voice of the people. That voice has now been heard. And he's taking that as a mandate.

People only showed up a couple of minutes before midday for that midday against Putin protests.Well, in other places around the world, and especially here in Berlin today, it was very much on public display, that dissent, especially among some people in the Russian diaspora. It was quite interesting because around midday, there were a lot of people who swarmed the Russian embassy here in Berlin to go vote. And it was an interesting mix of a crowd because there were some people who were clearly pro-Putin inside that crowd. But there were also a lot of people showed up with anti-Putin banners, banners supporting Ukraine. There was even one woman with a blue coat with the yellow writing, the colors of the Ukrainian flag on it, calling for support for Ukraine and then going into the Russian embassy to cast her vote. But by far the most prominent person was the widow of Alexei Navalny, who stood in line for six hours to cast her own ballot. And here's what she said after she came out of the ballot. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YULIA NAVALNAYA, ALEXEI NAVALNYS WIDOW (through translation): You are probably wondering what I wrote on the ballot papers, who I voted for. Of course, I wrote Navalny's surname, because it just can't be so that a month later and already during the presidential campaign, Putin's main opponent, already in prison, was killed.

We don't know when it will start, but we do know that just last Friday he approved the military plans, he approved the evacuation plans.

That is all we know at this point. But there's more than half of the population of Gaza that is currently sheltering in dreadful conditions in Rafah itself. We have many NGOs, including the United Nations, warning of areas of Gaza being on the brink of famine.

Today, authorities are releasing information confirming that he's been charged with murder -- the killings of those three relatives of his, including his 13-year- old sister in Pennsylvania. It is now believed that he initially carjacked a vehicle, or at least the driver of a vehicle, in Trenton, Pennsylvania yesterday, rather, in Trenton, New Jersey yesterday, and then drove over the state line to Pennsylvania, committed those murders allegedly, carjacked another individual, and then drove back to Trenton, Pennsylvania, where all of that played out. Not only is he facing those murder charges in PA, but also neighboring New Jersey today. We heard from the attorney general. They laid out a very long list of charges. These are quite significant, because they really tell us more about the potential firepower that may have been at the suspect's disposal. The attorney general is saying that he's been charged with several crimes, possession of a firearm without a serial number, receiving stolen property, possession of large-capacity ammunition magazines, and also possession of hollow-point ammunition. The attorney general there in that state, Paula, saying that it's still unclear whether or not he's already hired a defense attorney or has legal representation.

He was in good form today on the questions about our relationships and long relationships with the Irish.What surprised me about the speech was that he did not really come to grips with nor take advantage of the forum on two critical issues. One is on immigration, the importance of immigration in American history, give strength to the idea that the migrants who are on our borders now, we ought to have enough sympathy and respect for them as human beings to get this problem solved on the borders and to fully integrate the migrants or immigrants who qualify. So, that's one issue. I think it was frankly, the opportunity was missed. But the other surprise to me was how little was said about Gaza and bringing supplies in and what the future is going to be with Raffa. These are very, very tough questions. But as you know, Paula, the 20th century was marked by the degree of resistance in Ireland to rule by the British well over three decades. That resistance was very strong. And the spirit of that resistance rests there today. So, I thought he would take advantage of that. I thought President Biden would take advantage of this to see if he could lay out a message that is sympathetic to the Palestinians. They're very pro- Palestinian, Palestinian in Ireland, but show that there can be a bridge between the Palestinians and the Jews and the others who live in the Middle East. And I think that's something, had he spent more time at it, I think he would have been more successful in building relationships where we really desperately need more relationships.",

We know that that was a principal concern of the Irish prime minister that he brought to the president. We didn't hear the Irish PM forcefully bringing it up in his public remarks with the president, but we know that behind the scenes that that is a key issue. And so, I was surprised that he didn't raise that issue more. Yes, he said that there needs to be a ceasefire in tandem with a two-state solution as well as bringing all the hostages back home, but it was just sort of an aside and not really a central focus of his address, which surprised me.
