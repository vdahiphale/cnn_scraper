Well, now his attorney is saying that this should all be barred by the statute of limitations, and let me tell you why.Back in 2003 there was a new law that was passed by Congress. It's called the Protect Act. And what this does is it essentially eliminates the statute of limitations for sex crimes involving minors. Well, now R. Kelly's attorney is saying that since this conduct of - that R. Kelly committed happened in the '90s, that was before 2003 when the Protect Act was passed. So, she is saying that you should not be able to charge and convict someone if this was before 2003. Now, I reached out to R. Kelly's attorney, Jennifer Bonjean. Here's what she tells me, Kate. She says, quote, \"laws are generally applied prospectively. The 2003 amendment that expanded the statute of limitations was not intended to apply to Mr. Kelly's alleged conduct from the 1990. Statues should be strictly construed and prosecutors should not be permitted to ignore the intent of Congress, even when the defendant is R. Kelly.\" So you're seeing there that she's saying because he is a celebrity and because this is a high-profile case that he should be treated like everyone else.",

Sara Sidner is in Chicago this morning. And this is CNN NEWS CENTRAL. BOLDUAN: The already supercharged sprint to selecting a running mate for Kamala Harris is picking up more speed. The Harris campaign says they will announce the VP by Tuesday. That is when the vice president and her running mate will kick off a tour of battleground states starting in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Then they move - will move on to Detroit, Michigan. Also on the calendar, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Nevada, Arizona and Georgia. Harris was in Atlanta, Georgia, last night where she spoke at a high- energy rally during which she leveled a new challenge to Donald Trump to face her on a debate stage. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S. (D) AND U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: But he won't debate. But he and his running mate sure seem to have a lot to say about me. And, by the way, don't you find some of their stuff to just to be plain weird? I do hope you'll reconsider to meet me on the debate stage. Because as the saying goes, if you got something to say, say it to my face. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And she's also asked her advisers who would be the best governing partner if she were to win in November.Now, some of the people on that list include Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, as well as others like Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. Now, we are told that no formal interviews have been conducted yet, but that is also expected this week. Of course, they are on track to reveal who will be her running mate by Tuesday. That is when they will - there will be a rally in Philadelphia kicking off a travel blitz for the vice president and her running mate. That includes Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona, and Nevada. Notably, Kate, all of those states, minus North Carolina, were ones that President Biden narrowly won in 2020.

Donald Trump and Kamala Harris were both actually invited to this before Biden dropped out of the race. But it was only Donald Trump who accepted to come in person. Kamala Harris, according to NABJ, could not schedule this. She had to tight of a scheduling and wasn't able to do it virtually either. They are still trying to work that out.The controversy, of course, surrounding the fact that Kamala Harris, if she were to become president, would be the first black American female president of the United States. And her not being here instead of Donald Trump, who has had a lot to say about black Americans, and this particular city, and the way he has treated, for example, black reporters, has been somewhat of a controversy here. But this is something that NABJ does every single time it has its conference. They always invite the presumptive nominees for president to come and speak. They've been doing so since 1976. And I wanted to let you hear from the president of NABJ, who talked about the controversy. This has caused some of the, for example, a board member to leave the organization saying that she will no longer be on the board partly because of this, and a few other issues. But here's what he had to say about the controversy as to letting Donald Trump speak when they do not have the other presumptive nominee. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But there is a concern already because Donald Trump has already started to try to use this as he is trying to garner more black votes at some of the black population has voted for Donald Trump more than in the past. And here's a little bit of what he put out. He said, \"President Trump accomplished more for black Americans than any other president in recent history.\" That is, of course, disputable. He talks about, for example, unemployment when it comes to black Americans. And during his administration it was true that unemployment was lowered for black Americans than it was previously. But the Biden administration has seen an even lower number of unemployment for black Americans. So, there will be a lot of fact checking that is expected on the stage live as it happens. It will be published on NABJ's website and elsewhere. I do want to let you know, there will also be a protest that is planned here. We're not sure how large.

Israel has not claimed responsibility.But minutes ago, Iran's U.N. mission in New York just warned of Iran's, quote/unquote, \"special operations\" in response to the assassination of Ismail Haniyah in a statement that has just been released, saying, I'll read in part, this statement is just coming in, so I'll read it with you together. \"The response to an assassination will indeed be special operations, harder and intended to instill deep regret in the perpetrator.\" CNN's Alex Marquardt joins us now.

Very dangerous territory.What I'm hearing from a variety of sources this morning, Kate, is that the U.S. did not get a heads up. The U.S. had no role in this. The U.S. certainly not coming forward saying that Israel was behind this assassination. And that is something that we've heard from Secretary Blinken. He's the only senior U.S. official so far to talk about what happened. He said he didn't want to speculate, but that the U.S. had no role and they had no awareness. He's traveling out in Asia. We would expect to get more reaction throughout the course of the day. Sometimes the U.S. is given a heads-up, like they were yesterday when Israel went after that top Hezbollah leader in Lebanon. But we are really in an extraordinary moment, Kate, where Israel has now carried out strikes against Lebanon, against Iran, against the Hamas leader, all in the past 24 hours, which could have major implications. We saw back in April Iran attack Israel with more than 300 drones and missiles after an Israeli strike on - on a - on an Iranian embassy complex in Damascus. This is arguably much more sensitive. So, there is a real concern now that this war could really spiral out of control, go well beyond Gaza. Kate.",
