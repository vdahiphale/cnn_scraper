From Bethlehem to Ukraine to Ivory Coast, Christians are marking the day with festivities.And for Jewish people around the globe, Hanukkah begins at sundown, the first of eight nights celebrating the Festival of Lights, noting it's actually rare for the first night of Hanukkah to fall on Christmas, only happening about every 15 years. We'll have more on Holidays later this hour. But now turning to the day's news. We are tracking the aftermath of a fiery plane crash in Kazakhstan. Miraculously, authorities say 29 people, including two children, survived the disaster, but at least 38 others were killed. The flight was traveling from the capital of Baku to southern Russia when it crashed near the city of Aktau. One witness said bloodied survivors emerged from the wreckage of the plane, which burst into flames as it hit the ground. An aviation watchdog says a bird strike may be to blame for the emergency, but the cause of the crash is still unknown. Former FAA safety inspector and CNN safety analyst David Soucie joins us now from Denver, Colorado. David, Happy Holidays to you. Thank you so much for taking the time to join us. Obviously, a tragedy here in this crash, much is still unknown as the investigation has begun. But what do you make of what we do know? And do you think that a flock of birds could have been the factor here for the plane crash?",

The aircraft not only went up and down like with power issues, but it was going left and right. It was pretty much out of control for a good amount of time before the accident.So I'm not there with the bird strike yet. But it certainly is a tragedy and it's a tragic accident to have had to Experience that for these folks to come through that for 20 minutes to wait to see what's going to happen and then to have survivors is truly a miracle on Christmas Day.",

And so what happens is the energy, this is much like you said, it's very rare. But in the Sioux City accident, which is many years ago, the aircraft did something similar which is where the tail breaks off of the aircraft. So all the energy from that impact is transferred and absorbed by the front part of the aircraft wings forward.The tail of the aircraft you can see in some of these videos is a long distance from where the initial impact site is. And that energy is all dissipated by the time it comes to rest. There are survivors, in this case, 22 survivors that were able to walk away from that tail section.",

In terms of investigating how this happened, in addition to the black box, do you expect investigators to be perhaps speaking with surviving passengers, given how rare that was, just to get more insight into what happened, perhaps the moment before the plane actually crashed?",

So it's important the investigators look to the facts and keep it that way. With regard to the criminal investigation, Azerbaijan and the folks in that region do see every aircraft accident as a criminal investigation. That's how they start it.In the FAA, we don't do that. We don't bring in the FBI or anybody else until we see other issues that have to do with other than the aircraft operations or the mechanics of it. So over there, it's not uncommon for them to open it as a criminal investigation.",

According to officials, the attack took place overnight into Wednesday which with explosions reported across the country, including in the northeastern city of Kharkiv where at least seven missile strikes were reported and six people injured. Ukrainian authorities say Russia launched more than 70 missiles, including ballistic missiles and more than 100 attack drones, of which 50 missiles and a significant number of drones are said to have been intercepted.However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has confirmed that there were hits with at least one person killed. Zelensky said President Putin chose to carry out the attack on Christmas Day, describing Russia's actions as inhumane. Ukraine's energy operator, meanwhile, says it was forced to impose emergency blackouts in several parts of the country. This, of course, comes after a series of attacks by Russia in recent days, including an attack on the capital, Key Kyiv, which was targeted on Friday. Ukraine's largest private energy company said this marks the 13th time this year that Russia has carried out a major attack on Ukraine's energy sector, leaving the country in a precarious position as the war grinds into a third winter.

But first, here are the headlines we're following this hour.Afghanistan's Defense Ministry is vowing revenge for what it calls a cowardly attack of aggression by Pakistan's military. Taliban officials say aircraft bomb four sites in eastern Afghanistan, killing at least 46 people, mostly women and children. A Pakistani security official says the attacks targeted militants belonging to the Pakistani Taliban. Finland is investigating an outage in a cable connecting its power grid with Estonia. The S Link 2 interconnector allows the free flow of power across the Baltic Sea. It went out on Wednesday, and officials fear it could have been an act of sabotage. There have been numerous outages of power lines, gas pipelines, and telecom links in the Baltic Sea in recent years. Brazilian authorities are investigating a deadly bridge collapse that happened on Sunday, killing at least four people and sending trucks loaded with hazardous chemicals plunging into a river in the northeastern part of the country. The trucks were carrying huge quantities of pesticides and sulfuric acid, raising concerns about environmental damage. Authorities are warning residents not to drink or bathe in the river's water. Well, Christmas Day in the UK Means all eyes turn to the royal family. King Charles and much of his family marked the day by attending a service at St. Mary's Magdalena Church in Sandringham Estate. And the King also delivered his Christmas message, a traditional dating back to the 1930s. He thanked the doctors and nurses who helped Catherine, Princess of Wales, during her cancer fight earlier this year. And he also wished for peace all over the world. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Levinson retired after 17 years as pastor at St. Martin's Church in Houston, Texas, the largest Episcopalian church in the U.S. He served as a spiritual advisor to President George H.W. Bush and First Lady Barbar Bush and preached at both of their funerals. He's the author of In God's Grip, What Golf Can Teach Us About the Gospel and of the Go, A Vision for Tomorrow's Priests and Pastors. And he joins me now from Birmingham, Alabama.Reverend Russ, this is so good to see you. Merry Christmas. I can't think of anyone else I would rather talk today than you, so I appreciate the time. Listen, we've known each other for many, many years. I'm Jewish, you're Christian. This could be the start of a joke, but it's not. It's our reality. And we have over the years sent each other messages commemorating our own respective holidays. And what's unique about today is that we have Christmas and Hanukkah, the first night of Hanukkah coinciding for the first time in, I think, nearly 20 years. Talk about the significance of celebrating both of these holidays today. REV. RUSS LEVENSON, AUTHOR, \"IN GOD'S GRIP\" AND \"GO\": Yeah. First of all, it's very good to be with you again, Bianna. Very grateful to be invited to be with you and appreciate our friendship over the years. And, of course, we're all praying for the Texans today because I know you're a Houston fan. But outside of that, I do want to say it really is a remarkable event. I've been watching your NewsHour, and it's great to see these messages from around the world, whether it be King Charles in England, what's coming out of the Vatican, all kind of a unified call, of course, for what the great three Abrahamic faiths believe and proclaim, which is that the great value of faith for each of us, regardless of our tradition, is to find a way to love one another and treat one another with care and kindness. You and I come from the same strain as the Islamic faith. We all have Abraham, is a patriarch in our faith. But of course, the Hebrew scriptures speak lovingly of the importance of loving our Lord God with all of our heart, soul, mind and strength, and loving our neighbors ourselves from Deuteronomy. And then Jesus, of course, said the same thing. He quoted that. And then on the night before his own crucifixion, he reminded his followers that the most important thing they could do, the way in which others would know they were followers of him, would be to love and care for one another. And that was, you know, I have a lot of things that are connected to my Christian faith that are important. We have creeds and we have ways of worship and particular things that we believe unique to our faith. And that's my job, to proclaim that. But at the end of the day, it was the word Jesus who said, on this Christmas Day. if you want to know you're a follower of me, then you're called to love other people. And that love shows no bounds. And so it crosses the boundaries of creed, of race, of geography, of the way in which we come to our Lord. You know, it's your faith, it's the Hebrew faith that proclaims a lot of the rabbis. There was this common belief by Rabbi Joseph Ben Levi, who wrote. Whose name I carry a little bit of, who said, a procession goes before each person created in God's image, which is what you and I both believe. A procession goes before each procession of angels goes before each person proclaiming, behold the image of God. And what if we, on this day when Christmas and Hanukkah fall together, remember that everyone is created in God's image and we are to treat each other in that way. Sorry, I've been retired for a while, so I haven't preached in a while. This may go on for an hour.",

      "sentences": "Yes, you know, this is the time of year when I often think about people who've had loved ones passed from this life to the next and are going to their first special holiday moment without that person. And so they do feel lonely. And yet I think the message of our fates is that we have a God who understands that loneliness, who loves us in that loneliness, and who seeks to be present in our loneliness. I mean, the great news of my faith is that God thought enough of us not to remain in heaven, but to be incarnate in the child Jesus and come and be among us.But again, I think that we're called upon as people of faith to continue to find ways to reach beyond ourselves. And I'll be the first to say I am not perfect. I don't always practice my faith. I'm not always kind. There are days when I'm not as loving as I should be, but I don't get an off because of that. And I think you've heard me quote before, and I use this a lot. When I had my St. Martin's years, a great poem by the poet Edwin Markham, 20th century poet, he said, \"Hated, despised, a thing to flout. They drew a circle that left me out. Love and I had the wit to win. We drew a circle that took them in.\" And every day we have the opportunity to draw larger and larger circles around those that we, whose lives we touch. And so often, in my own prayers. I'll pray in my own prayers. I'll pray that, you know, let me somehow be a blessing to those I encounter today. I'm sure there are plenty of days when I fall short of that, but I think if we are open and keep our eyes open, we will see those people who are lonely. We will see those people who need our love. We will be called to reach out to those people. And in a time, and you again, you and I have talked about this in a time when we still have a lot of division in the public square over whatever it is. And I don't want to go down that road on a special day like today. But, you know, it's never the wrong decision to be kind. It's never the wrong decision to care for others. It's never the wrong decision to love.",
