      "sentences": "Well, Kate. It's a very significant ruling because for the first, time the Vatican has authorized priests to offer blessings to same-sex couples. Now, the Vatican was keen to point out this. These blessings should not be in formal church settings, and they should not confuse the church's teaching on marriage being between a man and a woman, but it is a very important development because it changes the church's approach on this question of ministry to LGBT Catholics.In the past, the Vatican has said that same-sex couples cannot be blessed because the church cannot bless sin. However, now this ruling is saying that there is a possibility to bless couples, that those people who seek blessings should be helped -- should be offered -- should be given them. Of course, it's also stating at the same time that the church's teaching on marriage still holds. But I think this is a very significant development given the past rulings by the Vatican against same-sex couples. And of course, Pope Francis has tried throughout his papacy to offer a different approach to try and welcome gay people.",

      "sentences": "Well, Sara, as senior White House officials, including White House Chief of Staff Jeff Zients, spent part of the weekend on the phone with lawmakers, Republicans, and Democrats, trying to see if they can reach some type of consensus when it comes to additional border policy -- security policy changes. Negotiators are set to return to the negotiating table again today after meeting for about three hours yesterday. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas was on hand for those meetings.But even as negotiators say they are making progress on this front, it still remains unclear whether they will be able to act fast enough to actually reach an agreement by the end of the week. Immigration Policy has long vexed lawmakers up on Capitol Hill. It is a very challenging topic that has very specific details that need to be run through. There's the need to, one, get an agreement but then they also have to write legislation, sell it to their members, and then also vote on it. So, it's a very steep climb from this period now until lawmakers are set to leave for holiday recess at week's end. The White House has been warning for quite some time that they need this aid for Ukraine and for Israel by the end of the year. They've said that they are running out of time to provide Ukraine with the assistance that they need on the battlefield. And they've been hoping that somehow lawmakers would be able to reach some consensus on border security in order to advance this forward. Now, one of the groups that Zients and others met with over the weekend was the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. Those lawmakers have expressed some frustration that some of the ideas that are being proposed at the White House might sign on to might be a bit harsh when it comes to immigration. But it really speaks to some of the political challenges facing President Biden at this moment. He doesn't want to alienate his base. But his team also recognizes that immigration could be a political liability heading into 2024 as there have been people saying that more needs to be done on the southern border. So, people are hopeful that progress continues to be made, but it really remains unclear if, at this point, they can actually reach that agreement in the short timeframe that they have.",

The public today getting the chance to pay respects to the late Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor as she lies in repose at the Supreme Court. Justice O'Connor passed away on December 1 at the age of 93.She became the first woman justice to serve the nation's highest court in 1981. Her funeral will take place tomorrow at Washington National Cathedral. Already this morning, those closest to the justice were able to take part in a private memorial at the High Court to honor her. Joining us now is one of Justice O'Connor's former clerks, Traci Lovitt. Traci, thank you for taking the time. You just came over from the events at the court happening this morning. What was it like being there for you today? TRACI LOVITT, FORMER CLERK TO JUSTICE SANDRA DAY O'CONNOR: It was both nostalgic and sad, but also joyous to be celebrating such a wonderful role model that we had in Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. And I'd like to thank you for doing the segment. You know, the justice retired 18 years ago. And there is -- it's important, I think, to recognize her legacy and to remember her in everything that she did and achieved.",

And what she meant to you even before you were able to clerk for her is an important message for women and girls everywhere.I want to read just a bit for everyone you wrote. On the day of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's swearing-in at the Supreme Court, many girls and women including 12-year-old me started thinking for the first time about legal careers. One couldn't help but wonder if she could succeed in the legal field, why can't I? And then you even go on to clerk for Justice O'Connor. Talk to me about that relationship and kind of what you carry still today from that time. You know, it is always so special to hear the relationship between clerks and justices.",

And she picked up, and that's him in the photo you're showing now.On kayak day, she invited him as my kayaking partner.

And it's that sort of perseverance that when the odds seem against you, odds seem to have, you down, you just dig in and try harder. And that's what she did. And she proved to a whole generation there is no ceiling for women and the law. We can do whatever we want. And I hope that young girls watching today who haven't thought about themselves as a legal career, give it a nod. You can do it. She did it. She's blazed the trail.

      "sentences": "Well, Sara, this does open up potential new avenues of ways to potentially treat this or prevent it. And so, for a few years, scientists have been homing in on a gene called GDF15. And now a hormone with that same name.What they have found is that this is something that circulates normally during non-pregnancy but during pregnancy, higher levels of this hormone are associated with greater experiences of this nausea and vomiting that you get during pregnancy. And so, they've actually found that if people have had a high exposure before pregnancy, they're kind of desensitized to it. And then they don't actually get that same level of nausea and vomiting with the higher levels during pregnancy as other people do. And so, a couple of different approaches here potentially for treatment include, could you block the effects of this hormone in the brain during pregnancy, or could you even, in people who have already experienced this bad case of morning sickness in a previous pregnancy, give them ways to increase that hormone and kind of increase their tolerance before their next pregnancy so they don't experience it? So, all of that has to be researched and see if it can be done safely. But potential new avenues, guys.",

And that's really important to emphasize because the researchers here point out this has been ignored by a lot of people in the medical community, and that is to pregnant people's peril. Princess Kate did experience hyperemesis gravidarum, and that's that really severe form of this.That affects about two percent of people in pregnancy. That overall nausea and vomiting can affect 70 to 80 percent of people. And so, this is something that's really widely experienced. And those more severe forms of it can be really dangerous, causing dehydration, weight loss, miscarriage, all kinds of problems. So, this is something that really needs a lot more attention.
