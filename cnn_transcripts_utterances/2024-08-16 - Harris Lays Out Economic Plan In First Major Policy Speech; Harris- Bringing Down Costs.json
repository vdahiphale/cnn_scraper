      "sentences": "Oh, Jess, it's being received very well by this crowd. It is a smaller crowd than her typical campaign rally. And these are invited guests from the community.But the Vice President basically outlined two very different visions for America. This was the first time that we heard her give a concrete policy address. But it was also significant because you could see she was really intentional about trying to connect with everyday Americans. She says that she knows what it's like when the prices add up for clothes, for food, for groceries, for everyday living expenses. She talked about working at McDonald's as a young person in college and then seeing some of her co-workers at that time trying to make that salary work while raising a family. So, here are the actual concrete policies that she laid out: A federal ban on price gouging for food. She pledged to build 3 million new affordable homes. Homes that she underscored would, in fact, go to the working class. And perhaps the loudest applause line came when she talked about helping first-time homebuyers, $25,000 for first-time homebuyers. You saw people get up on their feet and just applaud loudly. That was something that is very well received. And no doubt, Jess and Boris, that is something that I repeatedly hear on the campaign trail. So many people are worried about the ability to buy a house and the ability to afford rent. And so this economic vision is really speaking to the needs of everyday Americans. Republicans are characterizing it as just a wish list. They are, in fact, policies that would require working with Congress and are very difficult to get over the finish line. But at least now, Jess and Boris, we have a vision, a concrete policy vision, for what a Harris presidency would bring.",

Let's discuss with our panel, Ameshia Cross, Matt Gorman, Jeff Zeleny and Julia Chatterley is with us as well.Jeff, on the politics of this, there were two things that really struck out to me with this speech. And I think they were pretty obvious and deliberate. On the issue of tariffs, which Donald Trump has sort of made his namesake going back to his first run for the White House, Kamala Harris here describing it as a Trump tax on imports, essentially saying that Donald Trump wants to tax consumers. And the second thing, she's spent this speech contrasting herself with Donald Trump. And I think the most clear contrast was the fact that yesterday Donald Trump is giving a press conference outside of his private golf club. And then you have the Vice President here talking about how excited she was to see her mom save up for 10 years to buy a house. And then how she worked at McDonald's to put herself through college and watch people around her struggle to make ends meet, work multiple jobs to do that. So it gives a sense of legitimacy to this populist argument that she's trying to make.",

And it struck me as when she would talk about - you know, she's talking about the feelings that she had when they moved into their first house, and what it feels like to be an American right now that's struggling. She's trying to make that connection with voters that she sees them, that she hears them. It's a tale as old as time in politics, but not everybody can do it.",

      "sentences": "Exactly. Well, you can't do it if you didn't live it. I think that the narrative she's able to build is one that comes from personal experience. And honestly, it's one that millions of families across America have in that same way, where they've watched their parents, they've watched their grandparents, caregivers have to save for years. Some of them make it to where they're able to buy a home. Many of them, quite frankly, do not.I think that her having that conversation showcasing how she also had to work in college, working a low-wage job, setting up that dichotomy that many people still don't understand. The majority of folks in low- wage jobs have families at home. These are not teenagers who are trying to, you know, save some extra cash. These are folks who are paying rent, who have to buy school supplies, who have to ensure that everything is taken care of at home, utilities and all of that, off of the cost of what you're going to earn flipping burgers. That is a very tough thing to do in this society. But I think that what she also did in outlining the policy platform she did was pay attention to what Americans are seriously concerned about. We know housing is one of those. We know that being able to afford simple cost of living is one of those. We also know that it matters to have someone who has lived that, who has watched their family live it, have that conversation. Because at that point, it shows not only a heart, but it also shows that you understand what that means in everyday life. Back to school is just a minute around the corner. For some people, it's already started. They already know what that cost is.",

      "sentences": "Two things. I think, number one, she had took a lot of far- left positions during her first run in 2019 and 2020. She has, you know, temporarily kind of moderated these through some anonymous quotes from aides saying, well, she doesn't really want to ban fracking anymore. She doesn't want to do this, she doesn't want to do that.This new program that she's kind of doing is pretty far left, $25,000, price controlled essentially. That's number one. But the other thing is, you know, kind of conveniently forgot she was vice president for the last four years when a lot of the housing market crisis was at its worst, when inflation was at its worst. So there's a lot of memory holing that. But look, when it comes to the $25K, I mean, you just added $25,000 into every price - in - on every home price in the country, because if you're giving that away essentially for free, people will add it into the price. And obviously price controls have come under criticism from The Washington Post, Catherine Rampell, whom this channel's talked to earlier.

Not many details on exactly how they would do that, what the cost of these proposals would be. At some point, when you're talking about a potential ban on price gouging or offering this relief to first-time homebuyers, you run into the reality of Congress and what would actually pass. She even mentioned breaking down red tape at the state and local level to enhance home building, to build up inventory.Which of these proposals do you think actually will get to Congress and then pass?",

Her fundraising strategy, the sheer, you know, historical fundraising she's been able to do in a categorically very short amount of time, is not only for her at the top of the ticket, it's also for those down-ballot races. The makeup of Congress is going to really make a difference here.But I would also argue that she is utilizing things that, in some ways, we saw from Build Back Better and expanding them. So Congress, and what it looks like, is going to, again, throw this to the Republicans. Tell them that the American people are demanding these things. They want affordable housing. They want to be able to pay rent. They want to be able to ensure that they can buy their kids' school supplies and be able to feed them at the same time. These are things that matter no matter what political or partisan stripe you happen to be a part of. What she's doing is laying this out to the American people.

So that threat doesn't go away. If anything, it's now heightened because of the increasing tensions in the Middle East.Then, of course, you have the theory that if that individual who shot at Trump and hit him in Pennsylvania was a lone wolf, we know from the school shootings, we know from these other mass shootings that one of those crimes usually inspires or inspires an existing planner to accelerate their plans and join the momentum. Some of the studies they've done into these offenders show that when they see the notoriety the person before them gets, that they want that notoriety for themselves, which is one of the very reasons we talk about him as the shooter, as opposed to repeating his name and adding to that fame.
