There's, firstly, the political dimension, which you're talking about with the MAGA Republicans in Congress who seem determined to undermine Western support for Ukraine, and clearly they want Putin to win the war. Why, I have no idea. The second challenge is the material challenge, which is that we're running out of munitions to send Ukraine. There was an important comment by a leading European politician that basically said, we're seeing the bottom of the barrel in terms of munitions. So there needs to be a greater effort on the part of defense industries to increase production of those munitions.

The U.S. secretaries of State and Homeland Security, as well as the U.S. Attorney General and the White House's senior advisor on Homeland Security were among the senior U.S. officials who met with the Mexican president as well as their Mexican counterparts. At a press conference after a day long series of meetings, the officials emphasized how critical the ongoing conversations to try to solve these crises are and the various steps that the two countries are taking, including the U.S. Sanctioning of Mexican cartel members for fentanyl trafficking. One point of contention was the news on Thursday that the Biden administration had authorized the building of new barriers along the border with Mexico. Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas insisted there is no change in the Biden administration's stance against border walls but instead blamed Congress forcing the administration to spend money that had already been appropriated. Take a listen. ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS, U.S. SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY: From day one the policy of this administration has been that there will be no more wall construction. That remains our policy and we have never wavered from it. The action that we took, we had no choice. It was mandated by law. We requested that congress rescind the direction. It did not do so.

I mean, just looking back, I was thinking in June we saw Secretary of State Anthony Blinken here in Beijing meeting with Xi Jinping and among the takeaways was a need to get this relationship back on track. One of the phrases that we heard was the need to stabilize the relationship. And then if we look back to just less than a month ago, we saw China's Foreign Minister, Wang Yi meeting in Malta with National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, where again, they had some very formative conversations that could lead up to this meeting. This is also in addition to visits from secretary of labor Janet Yellen, as well as commerce secretary Gina Raimondo.

I should also point out, Michael, that in the next few days we will be seeing more high profile Americans coming here to China and to Beijing. We are anticipating a bipartisan delegation, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer as well as several other lawmakers Republicans on both sides of the aisle to continue this discussion with Beijing.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voiceover):  You are witnessing a courageous act of rebellion. Young girls gathered to learn in a secret classroom. To the Taliban, they are criminals defying a ban on female education, but these students say they're determined to continue their schooling no matter the cost. Two of them told us why. I've told myself that even if the Taliban arrest me, I will stand up and tell them I don't want to be kept at home, she says, I just want to learn, and that is not a crime. CNN was granted access to this underground classroom on the condition we conceal the identity of the students and staff and keep the location hidden. But allowing our cameras in comes at extraordinary risks. Around 30 students huddled into this little room to learn everything from science to math to tailoring and drawing. Mariam (ph), not her real name, is their teacher. Here is with us every second we're inside the school, she says, but there's a power stronger than fear, our hope for the future. This is one of nine secret schools that educate more than 400 girls across eight Afghan provinces. It is operated by a clandestine network called SRAK. Families find the program through word of mouth and demand is growing. It was founded by this woman, Parasto Hakim. She says because of her activism, she was recently forced to flee Afghanistan. But in the summer of 2021, as Kabul fell to the Taliban, she tells us she anticipated the ban on female education and got to work. PARASTO HAKIM, FOUNDER OF SRAK SCHOOLS' NETWORK:  So, we were watching some documentaries. I was looking at Afghan woman setting up NGOs and like hide in underground places. ABDELAZIZ (voiceover):  Inspired in part by Christiane Amanpour's 1996 CNN documentary, Battle for Afghanistan, Hakim began to follow the example of women set nearly 25 years ago.",

It is a gender apartheid. But also, the impact on mental health, because obviously, when you are being controlled, when every move you make is being controlled for your gender that has a huge impact on your mental health.

The international accountability mechanisms must be in -- you know, in place and activated in this case. It is gender apartheid and I think we have, you know, written to the U.N. recently, a letter, but also throughout our activism, we have asked that this term of gender apartheid, because it is systematic and it's continuously, and it's against one particular group of human beings, which is, in this case, women. So, this is amounting to crimes against humanity. Therefore, I think the international institution should be used effectively. In the meantime, I think all the pressure should go to a political dialogue to changing the political ecosystem.

JOHANNA FITE, ANSES (through translator):  I fear there's an emerging phenomenon, but we've been seeing an increase in infestations for about 20 years now. It's happened gradually because there's no miracle product to combat bedbugs. But today, in these last few weeks, there's clearly been a media phenomenon of psychosis created around bedbugs. BELL (voiceover):  And the media interest says as much about Paris as it does about the bugs themselves. With fashion week on as well as the Rugby World Cup and soon the 2024 Summer Olympics, the issue is also one of image. Bedbugs are, after all, about as universal as it gets. But France now knows that it needs answers urgently. OLIVIER VERAN, FRENCH GOVERNMENT SPOKESMAN (through translator):  We need to give the French people an answer. Is there or isn't there a clear upsurge in bedbugs? Since when and where?
