Ahead right here on CNN Newsroom, more US strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen as Washington continues to warn the Iran-backed group to stop attacking commercial shipping in the Red Sea.And vote counting now underway in Taiwan after polls closed in the self governing island's presidential election. Plus, Israel rejects accusations of committing genocide against Palestinians before the top UN court. It is now 4:00 PM in Taiwan where polls have just closed in the election to choose a new leader and parliament. Now vote counting is getting underway and we may in fact get results in the next few hours. It is a three way race for president with no clear favorites. CNN's Kristie Lu Stout joins us now from Hong Kong with the latest and the suspense here, right? There were a lot of choices on the ballot. And in fact it is historic in many ways.",

      "sentences": "Yes, definitely. I mean, it is a strong three way race. We're waiting for the results to come in. Voting is wrapped in Taiwan. Millions of people went to the polls. It was a bright and sunny day in Taiwan, which encourage a greater turnout in these key presidential parliamentary elections.Now, the ballots are being counted starting at this hour. It's a process that is famously known as being efficient and transparent. The result will be out this evening. And, of course, China, the US and the world are watching. On your screen you see the three main presidential candidates in Taiwan. You have Lai Ching-te of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, or the DPP, Hou Yu-ih of the opposition Kuomintang, or KMT, and Ko Wen-Je of the Taiwan People's Party, or the TPP. Now, let's talk about each candidate one by one. Lai Ching-te is currently the vice president of Taiwan. He is also the chairman of the ruling party, the DPP, and he says that he would maintain the status quo and pursue peace through strength if elected. At a recent campaign rally, Lai said this. Let's bring up the quote for you. He said this, \"Taiwan stands on the frontline of the confrontation between democracy and totalitarianism.\" Now, China has denounced his party and has denounced Lai in his views as separatist. The second candidate, Hou Yu-ih, is of the main opposition party, the KMT. He is the mayor of New Taipei City, a longtime police officer. And he says that he will restart talks with Beijing, if elected. That he will engage. And last week Hou said this, let's bring up for you. He's referring to himself in the third person -- first person. He said, Hou Yu-ih opposes Taiwan independence, will allow cross street peace, restart dialogue and exchanges, strengthen national defense and let everyone live in peace in Taiwan.\" Now his party, of course, the Kuomintang traditionally favors engagement and closer ties with China. And then you have the third presidential candidate, Ko Wen-je of the TPP. He is a former mayor of Taipei. He was a surgeon before getting to politics, and his party's focus on pocketbook issues like housing, like wages, like the high cost of living has really resonated with the youth vote across Taiwan. We're also keeping an eye on the parliamentary election in Taiwan. Both the two major parties, the DPP and the KMT, has said they need to win a majority because a divided government would make it much harder for the next president to advance their agenda. China looms large in this election. And, in fact, the day's running up to the election, a Chinese official call this election a choice between peace and war. China, of course, claims Taiwan as its own territory despite the fact it is never controlled it. Back to you, Paula.",

Such an important day in Taiwan now. It is, in fact, crucial to understand Taiwan's strategic and economic importance here, which is a good reason that all of us should pay attention to the fallout from the election. Now, regardless of who wins can you give us some insight into the campaign itself? You know, we just heard Kristie talking about how, you know, some of the economic issues really resonated, even though what we discuss a lot of times are the geopolitical issues. WEN-TI SUNG, NON-RESIDENT FELLOW WITH THE ATLANTIC COUNCIL GLOBAL CHINA HUB: Yes. I mean, economic issue really fell out of borders this time around. I think usually Taiwan election has two main candidates -- so the means for a referendum on China policy. There's a bit more room for other bread and butter issue to come to the floor, at least the election as well. So oftentimes, we hear young border in Taiwan talking about housing prices being a challenge, that they may be less than optimal in terms of creation of good paying jobs for the next generation, and how a younger family may be generally always looking for more assistance, rightfully so internet helping to raise and educate the children, all which, of course, depends on having good governance and a thriving economy.

Good to see you, Nada.So there's been at least, as we've just heard, at least one more strike from the US and allies in the last few hours. Should we assume it's over and if that's the case, it seems the Houthis remain undeterred? NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER: That's really we've been hearing from senior leaders within the Houthi rebel group, including the leader of the Houthis, Abdul-Malik Badruldeen, vowing to continue to respond to any aggression targeting Yemen from the United States or its Western allies. But, of course, the expressed intention behind those strikes, both rounds or strikes as carried out by the United States and the United Kingdom, has been to diminish and downgrade the Houthi's abilities and capability to carry out attacks on the Red Sea. And, of course, to retaliate to those strikes both the United Kingdom and the United States characterizing those rounds of strikes on Yemen as an act of self defense. They believe that these strikes, the attacks carried out rather by the Houthi rebels in the Red Sea have destabilize the global supply chains. They're destabilizing and disrupting the global economy. But also, according to military officials, putting lives at risk. And, of course, this has been a key concern for the United States and its Western allies as we continue to see tensions in the region mounting. Now following that round of strikes overnight Thursday into Friday, which of course we saw the United Kingdom, the United States along with support from other international allies carrying out 60 strikes around 16 different locations in Yemen. Now following that, we did see a response from the Houthis. They launched an anti-ship ballistic missile towards a vessel in the Red Sea. It did not actually hit the vessel according to US military officials. But again, we have seen another attempt to retaliate. It's unclear the extent to which those strikes carried out by the US and UK have diminished and downgraded the Houthis military capabilities. But, of course, we have seen a smaller scale retaliation from the Houthis and that has triggered yet another response this time, United States acting unilaterally in their strikes, again smallest round of strikes carried out by the United States overnight. But again, that express intention has been reiterated targeting military assets in Yemen. There is, of course, a huge amount of concern over the disruption being caused by Houthi's attacks along the Red Sea, as well as the potential for those attacks to broaden out across the region. We've seen the Houthis targeting locations in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in the past. And there is concern, of course, for the United States and its allies around their ability and capability to further those attacks more broadly, if there is indeed an escalation. Because we have heard from the internationally recognized government in Yemen, which has criticized the attacks carried out by the Houthis, condemning them for dragging Yemen and what today described as another phase of confrontation and conflicts in the region.",

And in Yemen, of course, huge crowds gathered in the capital city Sana'a. That was to protest those strikes ahead of the Houthi Supreme Revolutionary Council -- Committee, pardon me, urged the US and the UK to go back to their country and fight racism instead of protecting Israeli ships.For more analysis now, we are joined by Ibrahim Jalal, a non-resident scholar at the Middle East Institute. He's speaking to us now from Vienna. And it's really good to see you. As we've had, again, a second mission out there by both the US and Britain to hit those targets in Yemen. My question to you, will this work? Will it have the deterrent effect that the US and Britain hope -- it hopes it does? IBRAHIM JALAL, NON-RESIDENT SCHOLAR, MIDDLE EAST INSTITUTE: Deterrence has collapsed all together. It is why we've seen 28 Houthi maritime attacks since November 19. So to establish deterrence, it's not even a question. What the United States and the United Kingdom hope through this surgical military operation is to establish the rules of engagement, to configure power dynamics, and sort of send a military warning to that, you know, surgical military operation that lasted only for a few hours, and targeted more than 70 Houthi positions, mainly in the forms of radar positions, ballistic and missile, and drone assembly workshops, as well as identified military camps. And it's worth to note that the operation had limited capabilities, which indicates its higher precision based on the gathered intelligence. But of course, this military operation has appears thus far as symbolic, but the latest US unilateral strike and independence from the United Kingdom shows that this could also be an open military operation to continue targeting the Houthis. In tactical terms, it does not significantly degrade Houthi capabilities because the Houthis have known that this attack is coming, as seen in multiple warnings. They were told that there is a concentration of the attack, that the attack would happen. And then they are not yet to the attack, the announcement was made, which gave them enough time to deploy and sort of this further decentralize the large caches of the heavy and medium arms, as well as deploy the high level security, mobility, (inaudible) and hiding tactics, which (inaudible) warfare all the (inaudible) too.",

We dealt with the symptoms of the threat. And that makes it limited. So the outcome going forward, appears that the Houthis would like to also say face and continue to leverage and exploit the situation in Gaza by, you know, covering, first of all, deploying some of their assets to the Red Sea and other governments where they can launch continued maritime attacks.But also tried to expand them in coordination with the Iran's axis of resistance. In a way to sort of diversify the (inaudible) and therefore sort of attempt to distract the focus on the Houthis alone, given that they took this maritime adventurism.
