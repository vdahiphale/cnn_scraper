Genome is the term for the entire set of DNA instructions for a cell or organism. Thanks to recent breakthroughs in genetics, scientists say they will soon be able to bring back prehistoric creatures that have been extinct for thousands of years. We could see a woolly mammoth roaming the earth in as little as four years, according to researchers. Now, woolly mammoths were the huge, hairy-looking elephant type beasts marching through the ice age snow about 10,000 years ago. One company, Colossal Biosciences, says it plans to reincarnate the mammoth using gene editing technology, in a process called de-extinction. And there are other extinct creatures scientists could bring back as well, like the Tasmanian tiger or the dodo bird. But should they? As you can imagine, there are plenty of ethical questions about these recent genetic advancements. Here`s CNN`s Rachel crane with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RACHEL CRANE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Your body contains 37.2 trillion cells and within each is a copy of a code consisting of more than twenty thousand genes and billions of strands of DNA. This code is your genome and it determines everything that makes you you. What if you could modify that code, bring back extinct species, eliminate hereditary diseases? That is precisely what molecular engineers and geneticists around the world are working on.",
