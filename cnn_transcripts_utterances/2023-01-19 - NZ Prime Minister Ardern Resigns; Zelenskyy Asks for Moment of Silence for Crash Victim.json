So that is kind of the thinking behind that package. Ukraine obviously continues to ask for more. We are talking here about an 800-mile frontline, about constant shelling, and aerial bombardment from Russia. President Zelenskyy in comments again to Davos this morning in a new address that he made really spelling out why they need these new weapons. He said, look, we're not trying to hit Russian territory with the long-range artillery. We're trying to hit Russian-occupied territory within Ukraine to prevent them from constantly shelling cities like Kherson. He said that air defense is still a weak spot for Ukraine as Russia continues to target the energy grid.

They need Germany's approval to re-export them to Ukraine.

Hong Kong is also set to scrap its own quarantine requirement for those who test positive for the virus. But what's to stop another major outbreak over the holiday? CNN's Ivan Watson has more.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  A population on the move. After three years of restrictions due to their government's war on COVID, Chinese can finally travel again, just in time for the upcoming Lunar New Year holiday. In pre-pandemic times, this was described as the world's largest annual human migration. I haven't been home in three years, says this man at the main Beijing train station. Millions of Chinese people are traveling, as COVID-19 spreads out of control. (On camera):  Chinese officials say COVID infections have passed their peak in many parts of the country, but there are clearly still concerns about the scale of the outbreak. For example, here in Hong Kong, authorities require all of these travelers arriving on high- speed trains from mainland China to get negative COVID test first before they can cross the border. (Voice-over):  Last month, Beijing abruptly scrapped its strict zero COVID policy. The ensuing surge of sick people putting a strain on hospitals and health workers. Several social media videos showed nurses sick with covid collapsing on the job. I felt unwell, says this nurse in Shandong. It had been a week that I had COVID-19 until that day when I finally collapsed. Over the weekend, health officials who once prided themselves on keeping COVID out of China, abruptly raised the COVID death toll since early December, from several dozen COVID deaths to nearly 60,000 people killed by COVID. But the official U-turn on COVID has had other unintended consequences. At a factory in Chongqing, workers pelted police with what appeared to be boxes of COVID tests. Some biotech companies withholding salaries or laying off workers after the government suddenly stopped demanding the population take millions of COVID tests a day.  GEORGE MAGNUS, RESEARCH ASSOCIATE, UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD CHINA CENTER: The implementation of zero COVID and the abrupt and unprepared manner in which it was abandoned, it speaks to a chronic government's failure.

The highest court in Israel is saying that the recently appointed minister of interior and health, Aryeh Deri, cannot serve because of his previous convictions, including from last year on tax charges for what he struck a plea bargain, resigned from parliament, served the suspended sentence, and vowed to retire from public office.So now, the Supreme Court said Deri needs to resign or Netanyahu needs to fire him. But Netanyahu have to manage this relationship carefully because he needs Deri's 11 seats from Deri's party in order to stay in power. If he loses those 11 seats from his coalition, then Netanyahu no longer has a majority. So far, Netanyahu hasn't commented beyond supporting Deri and Deri' has pledged to keep fighting. Most likely, though, this will speed up an already brewing showdown here in Israel over the role and power of Israel's highest court. Because Netanyahu and his government want to make traditional reforms. They've already set off a plan. And, part of the plan would make it possible for the parliament and therefore whoever is in power, to overturn Supreme Court rulings. Now, backers of these changes have long accused the Supreme Court here of overreach and elitism. They say the changes would help restore balance between the branches of government. But the opponents of these reforms including the former prime minister, Yair Lapid, the current president of the Israeli Supreme Court and 80,000 or so people who came out in the pouring rain on Saturday to protests in Tel Aviv say it would destroy the independent judiciary, it would destroy the checks and balances and would potentially be the beginning of the end, they say, of Israeli democracy. But, if Benjamin Netanyahu manages to get these traditional reforms through, it cannot only help Netanyahu in his own corruption trial, something that he denies, but could also be the path back for Deri to serve because then the parliament and the party in power could overturn the Supreme Court decision. And backers of these reforms have now called on them, on Netanyahu to be fast-tracked as a result of this against Deri, speeding up what is already expected to be one of the most dramatic legal and political battles in Israeli history.
