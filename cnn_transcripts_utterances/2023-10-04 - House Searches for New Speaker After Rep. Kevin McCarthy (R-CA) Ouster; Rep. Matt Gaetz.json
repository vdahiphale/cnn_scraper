The House Republican majority is now in such turmoil that they have thrown in the towel for the week, sending members home until Tuesday next week. The man who singlehandedly led this charge into the abyss, Matt Gaetz. Now, the only really unifying message amongst most Republicans there this morning is that he should be held accountable. But what does that look like? Caught up in all of this, you remember, you probably don't need even reminding, taxpayer dollars, of course, and any concept of a functioning legislative branch.

The question is can they agree on a candidate, a new candidate who will lead them. But in talking to members, there's a lot of bad will within the conference and a long way to go before they can get behind a consensus candidate. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. AUSTIN SCOTT (R-GA):  Those eight people are anarchists and they're chaos caucus members. And the fact of the matter is they get their power from the 212 Democrats voting with them all of the time. And so they have demands that nobody can meet. REP.

He said that they have a lot of good people in the Republican Party, and kind of left it at that, a very vague statement. And that's in keeping with his posture over the last few days.I've spoken to many of Donald Trump's advisers and allies over the past 24 hours, and they told me that he purposely did not want to get involved in the power struggle in Congress. They noted that, one, Donald Trump has a lot going on himself right now. He obviously is attending his civil trial but also focused on his 2024 race. But also the other fact is that he had people who endorse him and support him on both sides of the speaker fight. Of course, Matt Gaetz, the Republican who led the effort to oust McCarthy, is a Donald Trump supporter. He endorsed him, and he's a surrogate for his campaign, but you also have a lot of people who backed Kevin McCarthy and did not want to see him removed from his speakership who also endorsed Donald Trump. And so, really, they told me that they didn't see a lot of political upside to Trump getting involved in this. Now, I have one quote from a Trump ally that I think really encapsulates how the president is thinking about this. He told me he can't be sticking his neck out whenever there's a fight in the House, especially when he has people who endorse him on both sides. And so that's really where the former president stands on this. But, as you mentioned, Sara, it's really a stark contrast from what Donald Trump did back in January. Of course, McCarthy was going through his 15 rounds of voting in order to secure his speakership and the gavel. And Donald Trump came in in the 11th hour and helped lobby lawmakers to support him. And, ultimately, Kevin McCarthy won. But yesterday, he did not go into that speaker fight with Donald Trump's support. And, obviously, we saw him ultimately get removed from office. Sara?",

It was a picture of the judge's clerk, identifiable of who it was, in a picture with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer saying without any evidence that she is Schumer's girlfriend.Well, that was really a bridge just too far for this judge. He issued this rebuke against not only the defense but everybody involved in this case to not issue anything publicly about anyone on his staff, whether it be, you know, in comments or on any social media, saying personal attacks of any member of my court staff are unacceptable, inappropriate, and I will not tolerate them. And he said there will be strict sanctions if those are broken. Now, it's unclear exactly what he meant by that. He hasn't officially issued a full official order. However, we do know both parties did go back into the courtroom after everyone was told to leave at the end of the day yesterday, and so things clearly were discussed. As for now, we have the defense's former accountant, rather on the stand getting cross-examined and, as we noted, the former president sitting there, and he's engaged. He has been engaged in the past three days of testimony watching this sort of unfold, as he is really trying to, as he says, protect his brand because a lot is at stake. It is in jeopardy, his brand, at the end of this three-month trial. Yesterday, John, important to note, that he, for really the first time that we've heard from him, said he wants to testify.
