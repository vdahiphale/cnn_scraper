Ukrainian officials are renewing their push for Western made fighter jets, a request which is once considered a non-starter by NATO Allies because of fears of escalation.Similar fears over sending tanks were debated for weeks, but on Wednesday, the U.S. president announced the deployment of 31 M1 Abrams tanks, the equivalent of a Ukrainian battalion, while acknowledging they are unlikely to arrive before long awaited Russian spring offensive. Chancellor Olaf Scholz says Germany will send 14 Leopard 2 tanks which could be ready in three to four months with more to come. Training for Ukrainians will begin soon. But the risk of escalation remains a major concern for the German Chancellor. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OLAF SCHOLZ, GERMAN CHANCELLOR (through translator): In everything we do, we must always make it very clear that we are doing what is necessary and what is possible to support Ukraine. But at the same time, we are preventing the war from escalating into a war between Russia and NATO. And we will always continue to observe this principle. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Well, former U.S. President Donald Trump may soon be back on Facebook and Instagram. Facebook's parent company Meta says it will restore his accounts more than the two years after he was banned for inciting violence when his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol January 6th. The decision comes on the heels of a similar move by Twitter. CNN's Donie O'Sullivan explains why Meta made this decision. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Meta announcing the most politically consequential decision in its history, certainly here in the United States announcing on Wednesday that it was going to let Former President Donald Trump back on its platforms which include of course Facebook and Instagram. Now, you might remember Trump was kicked off the platforms in the days after the attack on the U.S. Capitol. Facebook at the time saying was too dangerous for Trump to be able to have that megaphone that he might incite further violence. And two years later, Facebook Meta has now said that it is reassessed its ban, it has determined that there isn't as greater risk of imminent violence or harm caused by -- posed by Trump, and that they are going to allow him back on the platform in the coming weeks. Now, this is a boon in Trump's campaign for 2024. He has of course announced that he is running for president. Again, we have seen in the past, the Trump campaign really effectively used and spent hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising on Facebook, because it is a very effective way they have found of targeting voters but also fundraising. As you can imagine, a lot of people on both sides of the political spectrum here speaking out for and against this decision. Of course, many people saying it's important to be able to hear from a former president and candidate for president that's including the ACLU who had this statement. They said this is the right call. Like it or not, President Trump is one of the country's leading political figures. And the public has a strong interest in hearing his speech. They said, indeed, some of Trump's most offensive social media posts ended up being critical evidence and lawsuits filed against him and his administration. And we should know we filed over 400 legal actions against him. And that's a very important part of all of this, of course, the ACLU saying there. Although we might not like Trump, we believe that what he's saying should be able to be seen by voters and citizens in the United States and people around the world whether it be good, bad or ugly, back to you.

Officials in Japan say at least four people have died working to clear snow in the frozen conditions. In South Korea, heavy snow forced hundreds of flight cancellations. The capital saw temperatures fall to minus 15 degrees Celsius. Meantime, forecasters in China are expecting the mercury to plunge, as well, in some parts. Experts say such extreme weather events are the new norm. For more, we turn to meteorologist Britley Ritz. You know, there's something about minus 20, when you get below that. It is a unique type of cold that you've got to experience to know what it's like.",

And that's exactly what's happening right now in Eastern Asia.We have this massive area of high pressure that's setting up behind the front that moved through. So it pulls in a northernly wind, and that wind cranks up as we get that pressure gradient. So it's cold. And on top of that, the Japanese -- dealing with snowfall, which of course, makes it even colder. Temperatures right now across China, well, we're at one below in Beijing. And here we are, bringing in really cold temperatures earlier this morning. Beijing at 16 below early on, and Shenyang (ph) at 23 below. That was this morning. And now we move into the central parts of Japan, in the central parts of the Alps, the Japanese Alps. And temperatures were nearly 16 below zero. Record temperatures, by the way. The temperatures forecast. Low temperatures rolling in over the upcoming days. Look at this. Eighteen, 15 below, parts of Japan as we roll into the weekend. In Tokyo, at least we're trying to warm up here with some sunshine, Monday and Tuesday. Back up slightly above average, 11 degrees. but that front rolls through. And then when we get that wind blowing off of the ocean, it pulls in more moisture. It rises, cools and condenses over the mountain ranges of Japan, and we wind up with heavy snowfall. Forty-five to 60 centimeters of snow, especially along the central Japanese Alps, where we can pick up the heaviest amounts of snowfall, John.",

They have been selling at a loss.And companies, even if they're fully state-owned, will always seek to minimize the amount of losses that they're accruing, and that's one of the big problems.",

And, therefore, additional supplies are going to be required. And that's going to come from Russia, and from the global LNG market.
