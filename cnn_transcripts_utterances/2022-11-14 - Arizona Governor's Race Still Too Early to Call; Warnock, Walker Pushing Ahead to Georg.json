This is a hotly-contested race, with accusations from Republican Lake, saying that there's something going wrong with the count taking place here in this county. Election officials in Maricopa have pushed back strongly, saying if anything, they are moving at a faster rate than they have in other elections What is so important about the information that we got, this latest election report from the county, is that the Lake campaign views this batch of votes as her path. It is a path that continues to narrow, especially with this latest report. In addition to the 85 to 95,000 remaining ballots that need to be counted, there's also about 8,300 ballots that are still having to be cured.

This is a historically back -- black college in the city of Atlanta, and this is where Raphael Warnock did really well during the last election. And we also know that Herschel Walker is making his campaign stops, as well. Let's take a look at the exit poll and some of the highlights from that exit poll, when it comes to Warnock's voters. He was able to really dominate voters of color: 81 percent voted for Warnock; 69 percent of those voters were 18 to 29 years old; and 68 percent were urban voters. And that just shows, where his bread and butter is, and that's why Reverend Warnock was here outside of Morehouse College, went inside of an event with one of the biggest rappers in the world, trying to speak to the youth, trying to speak to people here to get back out and vote. I want you to hear from Raphael Warnock and from Herschel Walker on what they're telling their supporters this weekend. SEN. RAPHAEL WARNOCK (D-GA), RUNNING FOR REELECTION: I'm reaching out to the folks who didn't vote for me the last time. Maybe they voted for the Libertarian candidate.  Maybe they voted for Herschel Walker. And I want to ask yourself a serious question, who do you think is really ready? HERSCHEL WALKER (R), GEORGIA SENATORIAL NOMINEE: If you voted last time, go vote for me again, but tell the people that didn't vote for me they need to vote for me.

You know, potentially losing as few as seven or eight House seats, and gaining in the Senate, and gaining in the governorship.So that is very rare to begin with. I think it is essentially unprecedented for the president's party to do that well while the president himself was facing majority disapproval from the country. The only examples we have of anything like this are years like 1934, with FDR; 1962 with JFK after the Cuban missile crisis; 1998 with Clinton, after impeachment; 2002 with Bush after 9/11. All those presidents were extremely popular at the time that their party defied the usual midterm trend. That was not the case this year. And the only way to explain Democrats avoiding the kind of losses that have been typical when a president's approval rating is as low as Biden's is that voters, even voters disappointed in Biden, were simply reluctant to give power to the Republican Party. It's an unequivocal message of resistance, I think, to the Republican Party, as it has now been redefined in the Trump era.",

And again, I mean, we're talking about, at a moment where 75 percent of the country say the economy is in bad shape, Republicans made only minimal gains in the House, lost ground in the Senate, did not win any of those blue-state governorships that they targeted -- they targeted. And that, I think, is a very clear signal, that in those places, voters are resistant to this vision of what America is and should be. And I think that is a challenge for Republicans. Now certainly, they consolidated their hold on red America in this election. I mean, all of those states that banned abortion, for example, Republican governors cruised to reelection. But they -- the magnitude of the wall that they -- the solidity, maybe, of the wall that they ran into, even with his tailwind behind them of enormous dissatisfaction with the economy and the president s performance, you really can't avert your eyes from that, if you're going to seriously compete in 2024 as the Republican Party. HOLMES: Yes. It's going to be -- its going to be interesting to see what -- how Ron DeSantis does, if he -- if he turns to the national stage. A lot of people say that he's Donald Trump without the crazy. I did want to ask you this and see what you think of the importance of it. Given the abortion issue and the like, an interesting aspect of this election was the turnout of Gen Z. Young millennials under 30, who appeared to vote in great numbers.

They don't really have any of deliverables, per se.but they do have sort of this expectation that these two leaders, when they sit down, face to face, for the first time since Joe Biden became president, that they will be able to what they call build a floor, essentially try and define the terms of this relationship, set some red lines, so that there aren't miscommunications down the line. So they sort of see each other eye to eye and gain a better understanding of where each other stands. And of course, this meeting comes as U.S.-China relations are at, perhaps, their lowest in decades. It all started when Nancy Pelosi, the U.S. House speaker, went to Taiwan over the summer. Beijing responded furiously. They cut off a lot of channels of communication. And sort of that is the context that U.S. and Chinese officials are working to arrange this meeting. Now, they were able to talk quite effectively, to try and come up with the logistics, with the agenda for when these two men sit down. White House officials say that there were serious substantive discussions, that in fact, kept going until late last night here in Bali. The two sides still working to come up with items that they wanted to emphasize, including items they didn't want to emphasize in this meeting. So President Biden is a -- is a person that has does place a lot of emphasis on these face-to-face encounters. He does know Xi pretty well. The two traveled many miles together in the U.S. and China, when they were both serving as vice president. But of course, this is now a very different context, both because President Biden is now the U.S. president, but also because of this new tense relationship between the U.S. and China.

Time for China to become self-reliant in key technologies to upgrade its economy.But probably more crucially, to upgrade its military to catch up with the U.S. And so in recent days, that's why we've seen Xi Jinping offering a slightly more conciliatory tone by, for example, telling a U.S. business lobby group that he's willing to work with the U.S. to find ways to cooperate. There have also been signs or hints of possible tweaks in China's stance on Ukraine, with Xi Jinping telling the visiting German chancellor, for example, that China opposes the threat and the use -- use of nuclear weapons, which is seen by many as a subtle rebuke to Mr. Putin, given the Russian leader's nuclear posturing. So it's going to be very interesting to see what Mr. Xi does and doesn't say to Mr. Biden on this issue when they meet. But overall, Chinese state media, as well as officials here, echoing American officials by portraying this meeting itself as a positive sign, stressing the importance of keeping lines of communication open, especially when tensions are running high. But the problem here is the freefall in this relationship is not due to the lack of rapport. As Kevin mentioned, the two men have known each other for years. It's really because of how each side uses own strengths and the other's intentions. And Washington increasingly vocal about China under Xi Jinping become -- becoming more authoritarian at home, and more aggressive abroad. But from Chinese -- from China's perspective, you know, the U.S. government under Biden has been doubling down on its effort to build an anti-China coalition to contain its rise on the global stage. So that's why, with all the rhetoric and the policy directions from Beijing, the stakes are so high in this meeting, despite the very low bar, as Kevin mentioned, set by both sides -- Michael.",

But in this midterm, we saw the Democratic Party have a net gain of gubernatorial seats, not lose any Senate seats, and they may, in fact, gain one. And a net loss, it looks like, right now, of less than ten House seats. The last time that happened in a midterm election, 1934. So how did Democrats pull this off? Well, despite high inflation, the issue of abortion was also on the minds of voters. In fact, a look at our exit poll showed that about as many voters said that abortion was important to their vote as inflation. And those abortion first voters, they voted overwhelmingly Democratic. And of course, Joe Biden's popularity had sunk considerably over the course of his presidency. And indeed, our exit poll showed that only about 41 percent of voters had a favorable view of Joe Biden. But when you also ask them whether or not they had a favorable view of Donald Trump, Trump's favorable rating was right around the same level. Indeed, there was a solid portion, just a little bit less than 20 percent of the electorate, that did not have a favorable view of either Donald Trump or Joe Biden. And those voters, who you might have expected to go overwhelmingly for the Republicans because Joe Biden is the president of the United States, in fact, basically split their tickets fairly equally, only slightly going for Republican candidates. Of course, it's not just about Biden and Trump. It's also the fact that there were a lot of candidates running for the United States Senate who, in the minds of the voters, were extreme. Indeed, in pretty much all of the key battleground Senate races, more voters said that the Republican candidate was too extreme than said that the Democratic candidate was too extreme. Lastly, in the governor's races, there were a lot of Republicans running who denied that Joe Biden legitimately won the 2020 election, which of course he did. All of those candidates who were running in either swing states or in blue states, currently with GOP governors, are either trailing or lost. The only one who's currently trailing who CNN has not been able to project as a loser yet is Kari Lake in the state of Arizona, who right now is trailing. Back to you. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The TSA says agents did not fully use the screening technology at their disposal and also returned, quote, \"visible blades\" to the passenger, even after an inspection. No one on the flight was injured. The agency says employees nationwide will be given reminders on the proper protocols in this type of situation. We are still more than five weeks away from the official start of winter in the U.S., but for many, the frigid temperatures are already here. About 28 million people are under freeze alerts, from Southeast in Atlanta up through the Northeast in Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia. And more than 3 million under winter weather advisories in parts of the Midwest and Southwest. Let's bring in meteorologist Pedram Javaheri with the latest. Yes, I brought the big coat in tonight.",

      "sentences": "You know, it's incredible too, because this time last week, of course, we were talking about a hurricane making landfall across the Southern U.S., across parts of Florida. And now you're looking at these conditions that are incredibly cold for what time of year it is, of course.And temps in some spots, especially around the South, about 15 or so degrees below average. But these are current observations. Not often across areas of the South in Montgomery and Atlanta in the month of November, you have colder temperatures than in Boston at this hour and New York City at this hour. So it really speaks to how cold the reach here of the extreme temperatures is across parts of the Southern U.S. Of course, where you expect it into the teens into the 20s, up around the Northern Plains, upper Midwest. That's in place, as well. But notice, when you factor in the windchill, Atlanta feels like 29 degrees. That is comparable to what it feels like in places like Chicago or even Duluth, Minnesota. So if you feel it's cold in the South, you're not mistaken. It is incredibly cold for the time of year it is. And it is going to remain cold for a few days. In fact, in Atlanta, temps get even colder, from a 55 on Monday to a 50 for an afternoon high on Tuesday. Given 65 is average for this time of year, you can kind  of see why this is a big deal -- a big deal for a lot of folks. But Philly, as well, upper 40s, where upper 50s are what are considered normal temperatures this time of year. Nashville, look at what happened here, Michael. This was Friday afternoon's high temperature. And again, really makes it feel considerably more brutal when you go from 73 down to 43 in a span of 24 hours. In Nashville, coldest temperature we'd seen since the 12th of March. Sixties, again, what is considered normal. But notice, this is going to be a multi-day setup here, so potentially not just into this week but possibly the beginning of next week. We get multiple shots of Arctic air that line up, really, across the entirety of the lower 48, with the exception of far South Florida, which is expected to remain above average. So that's what we're looking at. And a possibility of some wintry weather mixed in, as well, with this, Michael. So we'll follow this as it progresses.",

We have too many examples in the world of conflict and people using ad hominum attacks on social media and so on and so on. You won't find Dolly Parton doing that. LAUREN SANCHEZ, JEFF BEZOS'S PARTNER: And when you think of Dolly, look, everyone smiles, right? And all she wants to do is bring light into other people's world. That's all. And so we couldn't have thought of someone better than to give this award to Dolly. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
