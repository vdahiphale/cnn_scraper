The president's chief of staff says voters will be, quote -- see, quote, a very energized president.And just moments ago, the White House press secretary shared this about what the president plans to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  He's going to talk about his unity agenda. There are issues, there are issues that both sides care about -- ending cancer, fighting for our veteran families. Those are important. Making sure we're getting fentanyl out of our communities. And it is important for this president to continue to talk about our freedoms and how they are under attack. They are, in extreme ways by extreme Republicans. And so he's going to continue, you're going to see whose side he's on, the side of the American people. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

There has been this sort of curious gap between, again, how the economy looks by traditional metrics, and softer measures like consumer confidence or views of the economy and the economic outlook.For a couple of years now, in fact, Americans have been about as pessimistic and dour about the economy as they had been during some of the deepest, darkest depths of the great recession following a once in a century financial crisis. And there's been a sort of a puzzle about that. In recent months, I should say, consumer confidence has been picking up. It's still not great, but there has been significant improvement in the past few months. And the real question has been, to what extent will consumers, obviously, continue that upward trend. And then to what extent will that growing positivity reflect well upon President Biden? If you look back to the 2012 election, then President Obama's reelection chances were considered kind of was iffy about a year out. But then as economic confidence grew, that reflected well upon President Obama and significantly improved his reelection chances.",

This is not the type of trend line you want if you're president of the United States. You go back to 2021 to 54 percent, 2022, 43, 2023, hey, maybe a little bit higher, but basically the same at 44. And now were at the bottom of the trough at just 38 percent on average. This is not where you want to be if you're the incumbent president of the United States with the election just months away.",

Bush and Obama were both at 49. And then right at the bottom, which is where Biden is closest to, was Donald Trump back in 2020 at 42 percent, and George H.W. Bush in 1992 at 41 percent.Now, why is that important? Well, if you know your presidential election history, the two presidents on this list who lost reelection were Donald Trump and George H.W. Bush. And that's who Joe Biden's approval rating looks the most like at this particular point. Now, look, we still have months to go until the November election.

      "sentences": "It can, but on average, it does not. So if you look at Joe Biden, the average shift in his approval rating based upon the State of the Union, it's gone up by a single point. Now, if you're at 49, maybe going to 50 would be a pretty gosh darn big deal. But if you're at 38, going to 39 is not really much of a big deal. If you look at presidents since 1978, the average shift is zero points. In fact, sometimes they go up a little bit, sometimes they go down, but on average, it averages out to no shift whatsoever.Now, why is that, Sara? Why perhaps is there no shift? Who are the people who tune into the State of the Union? Well, it's usually fans of the president of the United States. In 2019, a lot more Republicans than Democrats tuned in. Remember, that was when Donald Trump was giving a State of the Union address. Look at last year, what do we see? Plenty more Democrats than Republicans tuned in. So it could be tonight that Joe Biden is really just preaching to the choir. Now, maybe some Republicans can tune in, maybe there will be some good press for Joe Biden coming out of the State of the Union that perhaps could generate some approval rating rise. But the fact is tonight he's probably going to be speaking to a lot more Democrats and Republicans. And of course, most Democrats already like Joe Biden.",

Joining me right now is Dr. Mamie McLean, a reproductive endocrinologist and fertility specialist at Alabama Fertility, one of the facilities that was impacted by the State Supreme Court ruling.

What does today mean for you and your patients? DR. MAMIE MCLEAN, REPRODUCTIVE ENDOCRINOLOGIST, FERTILITY SPECIALIST AT ALABAMA FERTILITY:  Today is a really special day.
