This is not a murder case where anyone is claiming there was murder that was done with intent. The issue with manslaughter is whether or not you acted recklessly. What does that mean in English? It means that you consciously disregarded the risk that the behavior you engaged in can cause death. What's the behavior? You have somebody in a chokehold, would it not be substantially likely that they could die as a result of the lock on their neck? So the issue in manslaughter is recklessness, right? The consciousness regard that your behavior could actually cause something to go amiss. And so here, the jury was deadlocked on that issue. I'm presuming, right, without having been in the room, that there were some who were saying, You know what, regardless, I don't think I'm going to convict, because this was, as the defense said, self-defense, meaning there were people in immediate fear of being injured or killed, and he there, quite intervened. I think that's one reason, right? So, I think --",

And so because of that difficulty in establishing that, now what happens is, prosecution moves to dismiss the case. The judge dismisses that case. Now, they go to the next thing they could be charged with to the core of your question, and that is what they now consider is what's called criminally negligent homicide. And what that means is the jury now will consider whether or not he was negligent as we look at the defendant there, right? Negligence is, as we know, negligence, you were careless, right? You didn't perceive a risk that you should have perceived. So now we're looking at an E felony, which means he can face up to four years in jail if convicted. If he were convicted of the top count that was just dismissed, that would be 15 years. And so the answer to your question is, that's the charge that they'll be focused on fighting about when they come back and they start the deliberations again.",

So what happens is, is that the reason this is critical is, before you can get to criminally negligent homicide, if you're a jury, youhave to reach a decision as to the top count, which was manslaughter. They could not, the 12 member jury do that, they were deadlocked. So with that charge now dismissed, they are then permitted under the law to get to that next count, which is criminally negligent homicide. No matter how you slice this, no matter how you argue about this, this is a significant victory for the defense, because it means their client's exposure has just gone from 15 years in jail if convicted, to up to four years in jail if convicted of the criminally negligent homicide. So that's what the core issue will be when the jury resumes.",

Now from a legal perspective, there's a few things that could happen. One, if TikTok gets some sort of temporary injunction, that could mean that we don't actually have to force these app stores to ban the app, which is a possibility. Two could be, if the Supreme Court decides to take this up, you're looking at a very long process for which we could finally come to an answer here. And so, I think it's actually unlikely that Americans are going to see the app completely go away on January 19th. And then, of course, the third option is that there is a seller that comes up front. Though, the problem is, even though there's a lot of people who have indicated interest, as you know, Richard, China has said that they do not feel it's appropriate for ByteDance to sell off the U.S. arm. And so, if I had a guess, I think this is going to be like a very long standoff before we get an answer here.",

Obviously, he flipped his tune during his campaign, and you can imagine why, for political reasons, it looks really good to support an app that more than half of the country has. But in terms of what power he has to actually do anything, it's sort of limited. You know, he could push a Republican led Congress to try to appeal -- repeal the law. That seems somewhat unlikely, because especially in Congress with the Republican majority, a lot of these conservatives have an anti-China stance. He could pressure the DOJ not to enforce it. He could try to argue that it actually already complies in some ways from a national security perspective. But all that seems pretty unlikely and effective.",

For instance, you've got the managing of limited air space as we fly more so air traffic becomes more controlled, more difficult, more congested. You have net zero emissions by 2050 where there are many people who now say the target simply cannot be reached. And one reason for that is that the production of sustainable aviation pools SAF. The latest decarbonization efforts just simply not happening fast enough. And all of this is relevant because aviation is 2-1/2 percent of emissions. But the industry itself gets a much worse rap in terms of the critics and the activists. Salvatore Sciacchitano joins me now from Montreal. The president of ICAO. Good to see you, sir.

I will not remember those in detail, but one important goal is to have a CO2 emission reduction, five percent CO2 emission reduction by 2030.

To be sure, consumers and Americans still feel that inflation is too high, that prices are too high because, of course, what happens is they're still going up, just not as fast, but they're not coming down. And frankly, I don't think they're ever going to, that's just not the way it works. But Donald Trump's ability to maintain this good economy without necessarily juicing it up. And by the way, juicing it up is exactly what Joe Biden did with his unnecessary stimulus package, which then caused the Fed to move even faster. Donald Trump could make the same mistake. The raft of policies being put in place will all increase growth at a greater speed, and the Fed will be slower to cut interest rates. We all know this. It's economics 101.
