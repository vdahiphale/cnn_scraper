The storm destroying about 200 homes, nearly leveling some buildings. This is just one of several tornado reports that happened across the country. Look at this dash cam video from Toledo, Ohio. You can see strong winds sending debris everywhere as drivers waited for the storm to pass. Right now, nearly 400,000 customers in Texas and Florida, in Oklahoma and Alabama are without power this morning.

But when we talk about what's happening now, the more immediate threat, these line of thunderstorms that are still associated with the severe weather that moved through the Perryton, Texas, region late last night. You can see these storms, that yellow box, that is, of course, the severe weather watch boxes that are in place. But I want to highlight this line of storms moving into Jackson, Mississippi. There's actually a tornado-warned storm that is valid this morning and through the next 15 minutes or so. And we're going to monitor that very closely. Looks like the tornado vortex should stay South of the town of Jackson. So that's good news. But this storm system across Eastern Texas still producing winds over 60 miles per hour. The other major weather headline that we're following is the extensive rainfall that is taking place in the Florida Panhandle. Pensacola and surrounding areas have received -- get this -- over a foot of rain in a very short period of time.

They're really quite audacious in how much money they ask for. Not often that they get what they ask for in terms of millions of dollars. But in this case, we reported first yesterday that multiple federal agencies in the U.S. were breached in this attack.

It's an app that you essentially are just transferring video from one site to another, downloading it. It's a way that people sort of play around and edit video.So this is what we call supply chain attacks. So you come in through an app, and then the licensees all get impacted.

The extent to which, you know, it's vital -- it's a national security concern, no one seems that worried yet, but stay tuned.

The former president's attorneys contacted the Justice Department about obtaining the necessary security clearances for his classified documents trial. That's according to a source familiar with the outreach.The judge overseeing the case issued her first order, setting a deadline of today for that reach-out from attorneys, saying they all need to reach out to the DOJ about those clearances. CNN's Jessica Schneider joins us live from Washington now this morning. So that process, getting the ball rolling here, how long could it take for that clearance?",

They now need to alert Judge Cannon by Tuesday that they've done that.But it is clear that her order definitely puts this additional pressure on the former president to get his legal team fully aligned here. Trump does have Chris Kise, the former solicitor general in Florida. He's on his team. Also Todd Blanche. They were both in court when the arraignment happened earlier this week. But we do know that he's still looking for another attorney. His team has been in touch with Florida law firms, as our team has reported. But you know, historically, Erica, attorneys have been hesitant to work for the former president. He does have this history of not necessarily listening to legal advice, not always paying the bills. So we'll see who else he's able to get on his team. But we have reported that he's actively looking, especially for likely a third member to add to his legal team in Florida -- Erica.",

The Republican spoke to a crowd at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California last night. This is just a few hours after officially announcing his bid for the White House.And he didn't directly address his top two opponents, former President Trump and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. But he did pitch himself as a different kind of candidate who can unite the Republican Party. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR FRANCIS SUAREZ (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It is time for a next generation leader who has the vision to lead and the character to connect with everyone by looking at them in the eyes and listening to them, not shouting at them and lecturing them. It's time for a leader who can connect with segments of our country that Republicans have historically lost, like young voters and urban voters and segments we can make gains with, like Hispanics and suburban women.
