We've got a lot to get to, including as the 2024 political season ramps up, the Biden White House is contending with renewed focus from the president's opponents on the crisis at the U.S. southern border. Former President Donald Trump's harsh rhetoric and Texas Governor Greg Abbott's contentious new law and migrant arrests have reignited Republican efforts to make border security the focus of the 2024 election, even at the potential expense of American allies like Israel and Ukraine, elevating the fight over immigration policy to new heights. And now House Speaker Mike Johnson is calling for Biden to take executive action to secure the border.So joining me to discuss is Kevin Liptak at the White House. Kevin, thanks for being back with us. What is the administration doing to help the situation at the southern border?",

      "sentences": "Yes, they are urgently looking for solutions here. And the phrase that you hear from officials is breaking point as they're describing what's happening on the southern border, and the numbers really do reflect that. In recent days more than 10,000 migrants unlawfully crossed the border, and that does reflect a significant increase from previous months. So this is a major logistical challenge, of course, for the Biden administration, but it's also a political challenge for President Biden as we enter this election season.One of the things that you're seeing him do is apply pressure on the Mexican president, Lopez Obrador. They did speak by phone last week, and really the hope among American officials is that Mexico will do more to try and curb the flow of migrants, and President Biden did dispatch senior members of his cabinet to go to Mexico next week, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken and the Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas, to try and talk about ways that Mexico can help stem these flows, including potentially putting troops in southern Mexico, putting more checkpoints between the southern Mexican border and southern American border to try and stop these flows before they reach the United States. The White House has also requested $14 billion from Congress to try and increase border security, increase personnel to try and process these migrants faster, but that money is caught up in negotiations between Republicans and Democrats on tightening border rules. Congress did leave for the holiday break, so that money won't be passed before next year. But certainly, this is something that President Biden will be under pressure to try and resolve as he heads into this political season.",

That's something that the Biden campaign seized on almost immediately to compare it, for example, to rhetoric that you heard during Nazi-era Germany. And so I think this contrast is something that you will hear consistently as President Biden heats up his campaign.In the end, he is in a bind here from people on the right, even some Democrats who want him to do more on the southern border, but also from progressives, immigration advocates, who do worry that some of the changes being talked about will amount to some of the restrictive policies that you did see under President Trump. So the immigration issue is something that presidents have contended with for a long time in a lot of ways. It's just down to a broken system that will require Congress actually making some reforms to fix, Omar.",

Once you have a president -- look, you can talk about immigration policy. People can reasonably differ on immigration policy.

They continue to elude them despite the bombing of an extensive tunnel complex under Palestine Park in Gaza City, which the IDF believes was housing not just offices and headquarters for Hamas, but actually apartments, living quarters for senior leadership.Nonetheless, they are saying that a jet strike has killed one of the Hamas officials responsible for funneling weapons into the country, because Hamas has to get these rockets and the other weapons that they use to fight the Israel Defense Force from somewhere. It's believed that they're largely coming from Israel, smuggled through Egypt through these underground tunnels and right into the hands of militants, who are continuing to fight, continuing to launch rockets by the dozens toward Israel, even though the large majority of them are intercepted by the Iron Dome without serious damage or injuries here on the Israeli side. Of course, a very different situation on the Palestinian side. The people of Gaza continue to suffer as a result of the extensive bombardment. There were 18 people killed earlier in the day today in artillery fire. And I've actually been really close to the Gaza border just in the past week. And when you hear the outgoing artillery, the sound, the explosion is so loud, it can actually shake your car if you're driving past the area, or certainly if you're standing outside. It's enough to make you do a double-take. I can only imagine how terrifying the incoming artillery would be. And that incoming artillery is now hitting new areas that had not until recently been the focus of the IDF, which is now expanding its military operation. Now that they have essentially secured operational control of northern Gaza, they're now moving their efforts into central and even southern Gaza where many of the displaced Gazans, and you're talking about 80 percent or more of the population are living in these refugee camps in very dire conditions.

Now, the source says that Blavatnik hasn't made specific demands to Harvard, but he wants the university to make sure that Jewish students are protected the same way that other students are. Now, this comes as the Harvard President Claudine Gay remains mired in a plagiarism controversy. Harvard announced that Gay will request additional corrections to her writings, this time to her 1997 PhD dissertation due to what the school described as inadequate citation. This is clearly an embarrassing setback for Gay, and it comes just a week after she issued corrections to two of her scholarly writings in the 2000s. Harvard called these instances, quote, regrettable, but university officials have determined that this does not constitute research misconduct, which is something that would be subject to punishment. Matters of plagiarism can be quite complex, and experts that CNN spoke to were split on how or even whether Gay should be punished. But none of them called for her to be fired. And they noted it's quite rare for academics to be fired for plagiarism or for students to be expelled for it, for that matter. Now, according to a person familiar with the matter, just before announcing plans to issue these latest corrections, Gay held a virtual townhall meeting with hundreds of faculty members. Now, the source says that about a dozen Harvard faculty members spoke during this event, and all of them were supportive. The plagiarism controversy, that did not come up. Back to you.
