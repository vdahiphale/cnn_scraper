They are distraught and demanding Israel do more to free hostages still being held in Gaza by Hamas. Over the weekend, families of hostages showed up at Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's home to deliver their message that they wanted their loved ones back.This comes as Netanyahu says he has rejected outright the latest conditions set by Hamas to secure the release of hostages, terms that would include things like an end of the war and withdrawal of all Israeli forces from Gaza. Jeremy Diamond is in Tel Aviv for us. Jeremy, Netanyahu's office -- the prime minister has told the families, look, he has an initiative to win the release of hostages. What are you hearing about this? And what are the hostages saying if they've heard it yet?",

Several moles were removed and checked. And she was diagnosed with malignant melanoma.She said it was a shock. And many of her fans had been expressing that shock too on her Instagram page. And it comes after we heard that her former father-in-law, King Charles, is going to hospital because he has to have a procedure in relation to an enlarged prostate. That is benign, we're told, by a source. And the Princess of Wales is still in hospital as well, having had surgery on her abdomen. We're told by a source that that isn't related to cancer, either. But a lot to take in for royal fans with three members of the family or two members and a member of their extended family as well all suffering from these medical illnesses, Kate.",

With Ron DeSantis now out of the race, Haley gets what she has wanted for weeks, a one-on-one contest with Donald Trump. New Hampshire voters are famous for making decisions late. Will it come in time to give Haley the momentum she's fighting for to carry her through the primary season?Joining me right now is someone who knows New Hampshire, Judd Gregg. He was a Republican senator for New Hampshire -- from New Hampshire for nearly 20 years. Senator, it's great to have you on. You've been supporting Nikki Haley. What is your sense of where things are right now in New Hampshire and headed? JUDD GREGG, FORMER U.S. REPUBLICAN SENATOR FOR NEW HAMPSHIRE: Well, I think they're a little bit unpredictable, to be honest with you, Kate. As you mentioned, the voters tend to decide late. Polls really don't aren't that accurate, usually in our state. And this election is going to have the highest turnout in the Republican primary ever. And I tend to think that that bodes well for Governor Haley if there's a very large turnout. I don't think President Trump can get to 50 percent if there's a very large turnout. And if it's one-on-one, I think Haley's going to beat expectations. But this is an election where people actually vote, not a poll. And it's unpredictable.",

He quickly endorsed Donald Trump after dropping out. And I also just saw that a Republican congresswoman from South Carolina Nancy Mace, she came out this morning endorsing Donald Trump. And here's what she told the Associated Press, Senator. I don't see eye to eye perfectly with any candidate. But she goes on to say the time has come to unite behind our nominee. And that speaks to that soundbite I played off the top where Nikki Haley's pushing back on this idea of it's time for everyone to coalesce around Donald Trump.

That swing states are dominated by independent voters.Most of the independent voters, at least in New Hampshire are educated women who used to be Republicans in many instances, and they won't vote for Donald Trump. He's cost us the presidency once. He costs us the Senate twice. He almost costs us the House of Representatives. At the head of the ticket, he will be an extremely weak candidate. Even though if Biden is the nominee, obviously, he'll be an extremely weak candidate too. But we could put a candidate up who is strong and who will keep the Senate -- who will take the Senate and keep the House and that would be somebody like Nikki Haley. And so, I just don't understand Republican rank-and-file folks who want to change the government of Joe Biden, not looking at the obvious, which is, Donald Trump has lost. And he's nominated cases that are winning cases with independent voters for the last three elections. And we can't afford that if we expect to continue to take the Senate, keep the House, and take the presidency.",
