The resolution's purported grounds for impeachment have no basis in law or fact.\" The White House also argued that pursuing the impeachment would trivialize the impeachment power that lies in the Constitution and could also lead to further partisan abuse of it down the road.But the White House is also using this moment to try to urge lawmakers to get on board with that bipartisan border deal. The view within the White House is that the way to actually change the issue and crisis at the U.S. southern border is through policy, not through impeaching Mayorkas. But it all does come amidst that political reality that so many Republicans have expressed opposition to that border bill that's currently being considered up in the Senate.",

Donald Trump on his campaign believes that immigration is a top issue for Americans going into 2024, into November. They also believe and they've seen the poll numbers that show that Americans and many voters believe Donald Trump does better on the issue of immigration.So he wants to take this to Joe Biden and the ballot box. And one thing is increasingly clear. Donald Trump's power in Washington is growing. We have seen these Republicans really fall in line behind the former president in a way we hadn't seen in quite some time.

I'm frankly, surprised that Democrats are willing to go as far as they are.But Donald Trump cannot give a win to Joe Biden, so he is pressuring House Republicans and senators to oppose this. And it honestly looks like it's dead on -- it will likely pass the Senate with a lot of Republican \"no's\" and it's dead on arrival in the House. It's remarkably craven. I think the challenge, though, is are the Biden folks going to be able to communicate over the next 10 months I tried to secure the border but Donald Trump convinced a bunch of Republicans to block it?

So certainly that's a more viable tact than if it had just been that the House speaker had bottled it up in a more normal way. So I think they'll try that. The problem, obviously, is Joe Biden is president.And also, we've seen what the Biden administration does when it doesn't have all the legal authorities it would like to have. It makes a big show of all the efforts to look under the couch cushions and find new authorities and find new creative interpretation. With student debt, you saw this over and over again, at first the aggressive effort that got struck down by the courts. But then every time they find another way to relieve another piece of student debt, they're wrapping that up into a big message about how hard the president is pushing back against his limited legal authorities here. You would think that they would message in a similar way on immigration, especially since they finally seem to have decided that it really is a political necessity for them to get this under control and to show that they're getting it under control. Really, they do need new legal authority, which is why Republicans have their own bill that they've been talking about for most of the session. They're like pass HR-2. If you didn't need new legal authorities, then why do they have a flagship piece of immigration legislation that they're talking about?

Also, he had quite a degree of success when he went into hospital with an enlarged prostate, revealed that. There is a huge increase in inquiries of National Health Service off the back of that. He really did get some satisfaction from raising awareness by sharing that diagnosis. So I think that's a watch. I think we may find out exactly what cancer this is, which would go against the tradition in the Royal family to reveal any medical details whatsoever. We haven't heard about the Princess of Wales, for example. We didn't hear how Queen Elizabeth died. Until this morning, he's in good form, if anything, a bit frustrated that he's unable to carry out his public engagements. But he is able to carry out the formal constitutional duties. He is going to carry on meeting for his weekly audiences with the prime minister. And I'm told that you know, we're not at the level where he has to appoint other members of the Royal family to stand in for him if he is incapacitated in some way, and we will be told if that happens. So in terms of updates, it will have to be something quite significant if we hear an update, I think, and that's probably the biggest one if he's had to appoint the so-called counselors of state.

He has to appoint two of them. The reason there's five is because one of them is Prince Harry. And you know, he's not a working Royal, so he wouldn't be appointed as a counselor of state, so they also added Anne and Edward. But I think, the obvious choices would be William and the Queen, because the Princess of Wales is, you know, in recovery from her operation as well. So they basically will sign laws, you know, keep the Constitution going. You've got to remember, the King isn't just the person who appoints the prime minister, he is head of the Judiciary, head of the Armed Services. He's also head of the Church of England. You know, the whole system grinds to a halt if he can't sign off on the paperwork, so they have to have a system in place and that would be the Queen and Prince William would stand in for him effectively for those key roles.",

They're talking about where they came from.So it's more than anecdotal, but what you have here is a city-wide pattern 156. This is a pattern that burst onto the scene because it was different from most patterns. You know, usually you have somebody who's operating in a section of Manhattan or a section of Queens. This hit four out of the five boroughs with people operating on mopeds and scooters. Look at that video with the woman, where the phone is being snatched from her and she is being dragged, you know, by the scooter around the corner. The guy on the front of the scooter, he is the getaway driver, essentially. He gets a hundred bucks for the day. The guy on the back, who jumps off does the snatch or in some cases does the snatch without jumping off. Gets $600.00, and they were all working for you know, kind of a modern day Fagin, a guy named Victor Parra in the Bronx. Parra's job was you bring me the iPhones, you bring me the electronics, I have a tech guy. We have two phases here. Number one, we crack the phone. We get the personal identifying information, we get into their bank accounts, their other financials, and we start to exploit that to make money. Number two, after we've gotten everything we can out of that phone, we ship the device to Colombia or another country, and we sell it as hardware.
