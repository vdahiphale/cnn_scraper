That he considered himself a pilgrim.He says that when he crossed, of course, from Lebanon into Syria that's when he was arrested -- detained by security forces and taken to a regime prison. He says he was treated relatively well, given good, given water, but that he heard the sounds of people being tortured in that regime prison. Again, he was there for seven months. It was first understood that he was missing earlier this year in Hungary, so there is very little understanding as to how he wound up in Syria other than what he is telling reporters. U.S. officials have responded -- have commented on this. And I do want to read you what one U.S. official told CNN, which is that it is aware of reports of an American found outside of Damascus. It is seeking to provide support, but out of respect for his privacy, we have no further information to provide at this time.

How much has it changed? SETH KRUMMRICH, VICE PRESIDENT OF CLIENT RISK MANAGEMENT, GLOBAL GUARDIAN (via Webex by Cisco):  Kate, it's increased dramatically.

They make tough decisions every day and they will alienate part of their population that's going to disagree with them. So we need them to look at their digital footprint. We need them to understand what they look like for those that would take umbrage with them. And then we need to be able to put in place informed digital online threat management and have the entire suite of services ready to support them. We want to see what people are saying online and if we see a red flag -- something that we think is going to be activated -- we at Global Guardian will then immediately send armed executive protection agents to the home, to the office.

KRUMMRICH:  It changes it dramatically. It really puts extra emphasis on this new environment that we're working in. We did not see this after the Atlanta Olympic Park bombings. We didn't see it after Ted Kaczynski. But we're seeing this incredibly different environment that our clients are having to work in now, and now it's really getting in and making sure that we have all the bases covered -- and not just in their hometown. For example, at Global Guardian we have agents in all 50 states and in over 145 countries so that wherever they travel we can immediately have somebody come in, reduce the risk, and take care of any security situation that might arise because people that would want to target them are global. That information, they can get on their couch. So we really are working now to make sure that we're making informed decisions with our clients and that they understand their threat profile.",

A reminderThe move seemingly clears the way for Trump's controversial pick Kash Patel to take over as the new director of the bureau if he can be confirmed. Patel, who has been meeting with senators this week, said he will be ready on day one to fill the post. With us now is Andrew McCabe, CNN senior law enforcement analyst and former FBI deputy director. And Andy, you say even though it was clear that Christopher Wray was not going to be FBI director under Trump, you think he should have stuck around to get fired. Why? ANDREW MCCABE, CNN SENIOR LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST, FORMER FBI DEPUTY DIRECTOR (via Webex by Cisco):  Yeah, I do think that, John, and I'll tell you why. And I should preface it by saying that I believe Christopher Wray has been a good and solid director of the FBI and I think he's doing this for what he believes are the right reasons. I think -- I assume he believes that by announcing his departure and resigning he's doing this in a way to kind of minimize turbulence for the organization. Unfortunately, I don't think that's possible at this point in time, and I think there's a much more important principle at stake here, and that he is the principle of FBI independence. That principle has been a founding -- the founding kind of core of our post-Hoover, post- Watergate reformation of the FBI. It's something that Congress imposed, not the president -- Congress imposed on the FBI giving the director a 10-year term. And I think that maintaining his position and essentially forcing the new president's hand -- forcing Donald Trump to fire him when he arrives and is inaugurated is a much more important message. I think it sends a clear -- it would send a clear message to the FBI people that what we do is we stay on our post. We continue fighting the good fight doing the work the way that Americans expect us to, fairly, impartially. You work at the -- at the behest of the president -- I understand that -- but the president right now is Joseph Biden, and he has not asked Christopher Wray to leave.

And during that time he essentially worked as the political intelligence and retribution leader for every president he served, Democrat and Republican.They all relied on Hoover to do essentially the dirty work that they felt they needed done in order to maintain political power, whether that's initiating investigations against people who are suspected to be homosexuals and vilified as potentially being communists, or it was putting bugs into the hotel rooms that Martin Luther King would stay in when traveling in the civil rights movement to collect his conversations with associates. Illegal surveillance -- essentially terrorizing people who presidential administrations wanted silenced or eliminated. So in the post-Watergate, post-Church committee, Pike committee era we exposed these things -- Congress exposed these things, and the FBI was shifted to a different place in American life, and that is cloaked in independence from the political machinations of the White House, right? Expected to make decisions about who to investigate and how to investigate based only on the law and the facts that you could prove. That is the FBI that America expects and has experienced for the last 50 years. And I think at this critical point in time we are at the precipice of stepping away from that standard. I think that's clearly what Donald Trump has indicated in his many statements about how he expects his FBI director to follow his every direction and to pursue his political enemies.",
