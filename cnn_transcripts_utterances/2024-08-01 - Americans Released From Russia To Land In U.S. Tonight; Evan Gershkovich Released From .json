American Russian journalist Alsu Kurmasheva, and Russian activist Vladimir Kara-Murza are also so on their way to the United States.While in return, Russia got what one us official described as its, quote, biggest fish, former FSB colonel and Russian assassin Vadim Krasikov, who was serving a life sentence in Germany for murdering someone in broad daylight. In addition, Moscow got back several others accused of spying or cybercrime. Some of those Russian prisoners just landed in Moscow. You see them there, personally greeted by Russian Leader Vladimir Putin. This as incredible new details about the painstaking behind the scenes work to free the Americans comes to light, including secret overseas trips by CIA operatives and Director Bill Burns. President Biden working the phones with his Slovenian counterpart to secure a final piece of the deal, just an hour before he decided to drop out of the presidential race. And Vice President Kamala Harris's private conversations with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on the sidelines of a February conference in Munich where White House officials tell CNN, she pressed the importance of Germany releasing Krasikov in exchange for the others. Here at THE LEAD, we are sending our deepest and most heartfelt congratulations to the families of Evan, Paul, and Alsu, all of whom Jake has interviewed here on this show. We'll bring in assistant editor at \"The Wall Street Journal\", Paul Beckett, who joins us now. Paul, note of personal privilege.

A whole host of ways to undermine the U.S., all ways which are escalating that you can still have conversations like this, which is, which is evocative of the Cold War, frankly, when you had again the USSR and the U.S. very much at loggerheads, but still able to negotiate deals like this. And this is the first -- this is the biggest one since the Cold War.So you still have those discussions and that's important. You know, you still have channels open. That's -- maybe you can call that a sliver of light in this just in terms of that relationship, but also to your point, the complexity is truly remarkable because it wasn't just the U.S. and Russia. The U.S. had to get six allies on the same page to give up things they didn't want to give up. Germany did not want to give up understandably a convicted murderer who was an FSB assassin who carried out a murder in broad daylight and on German soil, right? They did not want to do that. Norway gave up a detainee and did not get a detainee in return as Germany did. So it shows that these relationships, and I think this is something that President Biden deliberately highlighted from the White House, that these relationships in these alliances are not purely transactional, that they're part of a long-term relationship.
