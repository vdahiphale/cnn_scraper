The Israeli military, the ISA, the Security Agency, and the police. They say it happened at 11 o'clock this morning, and it happened in central Gaza, the area of Nuseirat Camp. Now we know from the Israeli side that they say that four Israeli hostages have been released, and as you say. One of those hostages is Noa Argamani, a 25 year old Chinese-Israeli citizen who, as you say, we did see on the back of a motorbike on October 7, being taken away by her mass militants. She was at the nova music festival, potentially one of the better known hostages that that we have been hearing about over the last eight months.We also know that Andrey Kozlov, 27 year old, Russian Israeli citizen has been rescued as well. He was working security at the Music Festival when he was taken hostage. Shlomi Ziv, 40 year old who was also working security at that that music festival where hundreds were killed on October 7 and Almog Meir Jan, a 21 year old. So the four, according to Israeli officials that we've heard from, are in good medical condition. They have been taken to a medical center to check them over. Let's listen to what the IDF spokesman had to say. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Thanks so much for being with us.$130 billion that's a lot of money, according to the fearless fund, that's venture capital funding raised by the U.S. companies in 2018 and the firm says that when they found out that only 2% of that financing went to companies founded by women and less than 1% went to companies started by women of color, it became their mission to close that gap with a grant program for black women entrepreneurs. But their work is now on hold after a new federal appeals court ruling. Fearless fund was sued on behalf of a group called the American Alliance for equal rights. They argue the program violates the law, and they say programs that exclude certain individuals because of their race, such as the ones the fearless fund has designed and implemented are unjust and polarizing. Now the AAER is led by Edward Blum. Now he's not a household name, but I'm sure you know the fruits of his work recently. He's a legal strategist whose Supreme Court case dismantled affirmative action in college admissions. Blum is not trying to hide his continuing crusade. This headline, conservative activist who took down affirmative action is now going after law firms diversity programs is featured on his group's website. His group is also going after a Southwest Airlines travel award program for Hispanic students. The Smithsonian's Institute, a National Museum of American Latino in March, Blum touted a settlement that promised the museum's internship will now be open to all ethnicities. But not just Blum has taken up this cause. Since the affirmative action ruling conservative groups like his have targeted a range of programs from those studying reparations to a program meant to help pregnant women of color.

You know, these days, we call it Dembo. Pointing back to a dancehall reggae record by Shabba ranks called Dem Bow.
