Russian forces primarily from Wagner mercenary groups of convicts and contractors appear to be making gains. They have claimed that they have taken several villages to the north of the city in an attempt to encircle it. Ukrainian forces say that they are standing their ground in the face of what they call intense Russian assaults.Now, the fight for has evolved over the past few weeks and months, from a longer-range fight using tanks, artillery, mortars, to something that is much closer quarters, urban warfare. The fight going from street to street, building to building. Ukrainian officials for now are not talking about leaving the city, surrendering it to the Russians. But President Zelenskyy's stance on that has softened over time. He has said that they will not defend it at any cost, if it means losing all of their troops. Meanwhile, Biden administration official now openly warning China against sending legal aid. So weapons to Russia for use in Ukraine. The Biden administration had already warned China about non-lethal aid that was being sent to Russia, but now top officials say that China is actively discussing sending weapons to Russia. They caution that no decision has been made yet, but the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations said that this would be a red line because it would be a significant boost to Russia in this fight.

The Biden administration's role and specifically the president has been to walk this line between, you know, getting Ukraine what they need to win without provoking a larger war directly with Russia.And I think that's exactly what the president is doing today. Now will he change his mind down the road? He's changed his mind about a number of systems before. He wasn't planning to give tanks to the Ukrainians. We're now sending tanks. So I wouldn't be surprised if this changes down the road. But right now, he's sending a signal to Russia that he's conscious of the fact that he does not want this to escalate into a larger conflict directly between NATO and Russia. And it's good for Russia to see that. It's good for Russia to see that we're giving them a lot of arms.

Here in this area, we got maybe two feet of snow in higher elevation, more than six feet of snow in some of those areas. It is much-needed snow for California and for western states.But when we talk about the drought, the big question is, will this be enough essentially to stop the water crisis in the west? Scientists saying that because of these back-to-back storms, this parade of storms, a lot of the snowpack and a lot of the reservoirs are in good shape. But what they're saying is, you have to be cautiously optimistic because even though we are getting a lot of snow and there is rain filling those reservoirs, it is going to depend on what happens in the next couple of months in terms of how hot and how dry it is going to be. So if the snow melts too quickly, it might not be enough to essentially help us in this water crisis. So we'll have to wait over the next couple of months to see exactly what happens to this white gold here behind me. So, of course, scientists just very excited about what they're seeing here in California. Some of the residents, though, it has been a headache for them, because as you mentioned, the 5 had been closed for such a long time, people had been stranded. People just not being able to get to where they needed to go. And we're talking a lot of flooding in the Los Angeles area. A lot of people without power. So we're left with all of this after the storm, but of course, it is good news for California and for the western states in terms of drought and water -- Jim.",

But I think by now, the president should have visited.

The presiding judge in the case, Matthew Kacsmaryk, was nominated by then President Trump and confirmed in 2019. He is known for his anti- abortion convictions. In \"The Washington Post,\" Caroline Kitchener has written an in-depth profile of this judge and this looming court ruling and she joins me now. Caroline, thanks so much. You and another reporter for the article spoke to 20 people who know this judge, including family members and close friends. What can you tell us?",

He had made a series of statements about LGBT rights that really made clear of his conservative convictions before he was confirmed.But we really found a long history that goes back decades of deep anti-abortion beliefs, really since childhood. He was raised by two born-again Christians who really emphasized the pro-life issue and then he really took it on himself through college and the years after. We spoke with a lot of his friends and family members who are very open about the depth of his beliefs on this particular issue.",

So we found out that when his sister, who he's very close with, he's called her his hero, when she was 17, she got pregnant, she moved away from home, from their conservative community, into a maternity home, and then she put her son up for adoption. Now, that -- that particular experience has been described to me as formative for the judge on the abortion issue, seeing his sister go through that and seeing the adoption rather than the abortion.Sixteen years after that happened -- and he actually went to the hospital to be with his sister at that time, 16 years after that, he joined the board of the maternity home, and that's an anti-abortion maternity home that took his sister in. So clearly, this is very personal. It's not just kind of a philosophical belief. It is something that really goes deep for this judge.

I mean, part of the concern is that the cases that are heard by Judge Kacsmaryk, when they're appealed, they go to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which is, you know, a pretty widely considered the most conservative court of appeals in the country. And then to the Supreme Court, which of course overturned Roe v. Wade in June. So there's really a path there that has been consistently -- you know, has consistently yielded the results that conservatives want on these kinds of cases.So, you know, I think that if this case was filed in a different district, with a judge that had a different reputation, abortion rights groups would be far less concerned, because the claims in the lawsuit have been pretty widely dismissed as lacking kind of legal and medical basis, but because it is this judge at this moment, they're really worried. And they're making plans for, you know, what would happen if mifepristone goes off the market. And there are some things that they can do. They could go to a misoprostol only protocol, so that would, you know, a different kind of pill that they could use, but that is something that really has not been done in this country for many years, so it would take a lot of finagling and it would really just send abortion clinics into upheaval once again.",
