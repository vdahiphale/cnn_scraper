Let's get closer to see what's going on here. So the lawmakers are being seated through those doors right now. And there are crowds here, holding up signs that are accusing President Yoon of insurrection Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, when he deployed police and soldiers to this very building, to try to stop lawmakers from holding a vote, which ultimately overruled his very short-lived martial law declaration. As you mentioned, President Yoon has apologized today for the measure he took and he's basically submitted the future of his government to his own ruling party, the leader of which has declared that Yoon cannot complete his term in office, which is still due to continue for another two years. Now moments ago I spoke with an opposition lawmaker from the Democratic Party and asked him what he thought the chances were that Yoon would be impeached in a vote in these chambers. Take a listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PARK SUN-WON, DEMOCRATIC PARTY LAWMAKER:  Less than 50.",

And part of that is because of the experience they had eight years ago, when a previous conservative president, Park Geun-hye, she was impeached and ultimately ended up going on trial and serving time in jail. And that was a big disaster for the Conservative Party. So they don't want a repeat of that. But they clearly also see that President Yoon's position is untenable politically. As you pointed out, he has very low poll ratings and there's been a poll conducted this week that showed more than 70 percent of Koreans surveyed supported his impeachment. You have the opposition party that has filed charges with law enforcement against not only Yoon but against his defense minister, who has since resigned; against the army chief of staff, the commissioner of the national police and other top officials. What may be at stake here is whether or not Yoon might have to end up behind bars or facing prosecution. As members of the opposition Democratic Party have made it clear, they think that that Yoon and his supporters are now trying to fight to stay out of jail at this point. So that might be what's at stake right now. And while this is going on, this is going on against the backdrop of large protests taking place right outside the national assembly, with critics of Yoon calling for his impeachment, accusing him of insurrection. And I might add, some supporters of Yoon and his People Power Party as well showing their force here. South Korea has a very rich culture and tradition of protests and it was ultimately protests that helped bring down President Park back in 2017. So we'll just have to see what will happen in the days or weeks ahead, again, if Yoon survives this impeachment vote, which we expect to begin in minutes here. It does not mean that he is out of political hot water. It may be a case of just the heat will continue to increase and it will be a heck of a political drama to watch as it continues to unfold here.",

If he does survive the vote, I think he'll be a zombie president. The Democratic Party has promised it will continue to introduce motions for impeachment, which will require continuous votes within 72 hours of every submission of a motion for impeachment. So I think the protests that will build and the pressure that will build will make it impossible for him to carry out the duties of his office and may be forced to resign. So whether he goes out through impeachment or resignation has different pathways for dealing with his replacement. So we'll see what the PDP's strategy is in this and why they might be favoring resignation rather than impeachment.",

Park Geun-hye was impeached and removed from office back in 2017.

I think he will either be impeached or will be forced into resignation. And as far as impeachment goes, if it goes to constitutional court, that could take up to six months. And then once the president can no longer serve, whether through resignation or impeachment and removal from office, a new presidential election has to be held within 60 days. So we could see, in case of resignation, a very quick presidential election and a new president coming in or it dragging on for up to six months or so, going to the constitutional court.",
