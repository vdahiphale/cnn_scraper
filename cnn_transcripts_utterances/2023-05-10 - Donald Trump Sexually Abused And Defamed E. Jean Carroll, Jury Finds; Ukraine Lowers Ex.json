Over the years dozens of women have made similar accusations but this is the first time Trump has been held accountable.Part of the verdict all is Trump to pay $5 million in damages to Forbes magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll, who accused him of raping her in a department store changing room 27 years ago. His lawyers say they will appeal while Trump himself has repeatedly called the case a scam and a video posted to his social media platform. He accused both the judge and jury not liking him. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: What else can you expect from a Trump hating Clinton appointed judge who went out of his way to make sure that the result of this trial was as negative as it could possibly be? Speaking to and in control of a jury from an anti-Trump area, which is probably the worst place in the United States for me to get a fair trial. We'll be appealing this decision. It's a disgrace.

And then a statement added this. This victory is not just for me, but for every woman who has suffered because she was not believed.Voting is just the latest in a string of stunning legal blows for the former president. CNN senior legal affairs correspondent Paula Reid was in the courtroom on Tuesday. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA REID, CNN SENIOR LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Or the speed of this decision suggests there was not a lot of disagreement or deliberation in the jury room. I was in the court Tuesday morning. And it took about 90 minutes for the judge to give the jury instructions on how to make this decision. And it took just a little bit longer than for that for them to actually make this decision. And while I was in court throughout this trial, it was clear to me, this jury was being very attentive, not only to E. Jean Carroll, but also to other witnesses. And it's clear from this decision that they believe not only E. Jean Carroll, but they also believed her friends who heard her describe this encounter shortly after it occurred, and also women who alleged other similar behavior. They also of course heard from the former president in his own words in the infamous Access Hollywood tape describing grabbing people and then doubling down on that in his deposition. Now, we may never know exactly what the jury thought of specific pieces of evidence because they have been anonymous throughout this trial. And the judge has encouraged them to remain anonymous, even though they do have a right to speak out. Now, the former president's lawyers are trying to spin this as a victory for their client, because the jury did not find that he raped E. Jean, but they did find that he sexually abused her that is still under the law, a form of sexual assault, a form of battery. So if you have a day where your client is found to have sexually abused someone and defame them and may be on the hook for around $5 million in damages, it is hard to honestly spin that as a victory.

And the evidence would then permit that is an appealable issue. It is because a judge will have to evaluate, was it so overwhelmingly damning and harmful that the jury didn't see the facts, but just base their conclusion of a verdict upon this tape. One can argue perhaps they did, perhaps they didn't. Obviously, Ms. Carroll says it was one of many things that the jury based its decision on, and a judge could easily conclude that under the rules, it is admissible, nothing to see here and a non-issue as it relates to an appeal.

This was to be clear monetary damages to the tune of almost 5 million, right, this lawsuit. But when you look at the issues that he's facing in Georgia, with respect to election interference, when you look at what he's facing as it relates to federal crime and the insurrection of January 6, as it relates to classified documents and other things, he could face significant exposure there.

So both sides are switching positions. However, Ukraine has been training significantly. They have a bunch of new kit that I think can outgun and outrange their Russian counterparts. They will take over territory I'm convinced of that and they will take in my view significant territory, will it be a grand sweeping offensive across the 600 mile front from the Donbas down to Zaporizhzhia?

Any leader who's in office has to take into consideration the political impact or consequences of whatever decision they are going to make. And the pressure that they are under from within their coalition or from among their electorate.But I think in this case, actually John what we had was just a week ago 104 or 102 rockets that were fired into Israeli cities just a couple of few weeks ago during Passover. We had rockets that were fired into Israel on three different fronts -- Gaza, Lebanon, Syria all at the same time. Behind all of this, as well as attempts to build up a rocket production capability in the West Bank directed from Gaza, is the Islamic Jihad. Israel had to defend itself, had to respond. Are there political issues that the prime minister of Israel is dealing with at the same time? It is possible, but I think that here we are really looking at an act of self-defense.",

But the fact that there has been no, response yet, not a single rocket is very interesting and telling. And it raises questions, what is Islamic Jihad waiting for? It could be that maybe they're taking a page out of Israel's playbook, right. Israel got hit by those hundred rockets last week, it didn't retaliate right away. Prime Minister Netanyahu did come under some pressure from the public and the media and within his own coalition that his response was weak. But what we saw was it was actually building up from what happened 24 hours ago with the targeting of these three Islamic Jihad guys. So is Islamic Jihad also trying to put Israel to sleep for a few days? And then to target when it has the advantage? It's not exactly clear but it's interesting that we're still 24 hours later with no response.",

I think so, you know, ultimately, look just like they were able to create this production assembly line in the Gaza strip, even despite Israeli efforts to stop it and how impressive the capability they have, today like they have rockets there that could already reach Tel Aviv. So do they really need a rocket capability in the West Bank on those mountains of the (INAUDIBLE) that looked down into Israel's coast, which includes Tel Aviv, (INAUDIBLE) and other parts of the country? I'm not exactly sure if they need it but on the other hand that would be a huge escalation. The reason they don't have it yet though is because Israel does have operational freedom in the West Bank. And we see periodical operations, weekly, pretty much inside some of these terror havens inside the West Bank. Places like Jenin, Nabulus and other parts of the Palestinian territories. Israel has been able to stop that from happening. But it's possible John, like you said it's a matter of time when they get that. But that would be seen as another escalation.
