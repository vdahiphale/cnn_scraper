Also, CNN has learned that Florida has chosen three companies to execute the next phase of the migrant relocation program kind of created there by Ron DeSantis. That's according to a source familiar with the process. It sets in motion plans to transport migrants to other cities just as he did last year.And then in New York, parents are protesting over the mayor's plans here to -- how he's planning to handle the migrants coming into New York City.

What we saw outside of this public school here in Brooklyn, New York, this morning was some anger, some frustration on behalf of not only parents but also students as they were led around the block a couple of times, signs in hand, taking a stand against this latest effort by Eric Adams, his decompression strategy, if you will, to try to deal with the growing number of asylum seekers. And what that strategy includes is locate -- placing about 300 asylum seekers, at least so far, at about 20 gyms in schools throughout the city here.Now, in terms of what the mayor is saying is this is his effort to try to deal with this ongoing - these ongoing asylum seeker arrivals of anywhere from 200 to 300 and at some point even 500 a day. They need a place to put them. So, he believes that this is one option here. These gyms are separate. City officials saying that the asylum seekers, they would be temporarily offered respite at these gyms, would not have any sort of contact with students. But the parents, they mostly are sympathetic with the plight of these asylum seekers, but they also recognize that a school gym is certainly not a place for them, not to mention potential school disruptions. And then there's the other argument as well that I've heard from parents, which is concerns about the safety of their children. Well, the Brooklyn Borough president responding to those fears.

Well, July 2017, right after Fourth of July, her father, Ryan, goes to pick her up. She's not there. The mother is gone.I looked at court records this morning, and an Amber Alert was immediately issued. There was nothing. They couldn't find her. At the end of July, a felony warrant for arrest on child abduction was issued out of the courts in Illinois. Still nothing. So, for six years he didn't know what had happened to his daughter. What did she know? We don't know. But last Saturday, in North Carolina, we want to show you, that's 600 miles away, someone in a store recognized her from the Netflix series \"Unsolved Mysteries.\" Went to store personnel. I recognize her. She's someone that's been missing. Police came. They found her. They arrested her mother. Let's listen to police in Asheville, North Carolina. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. DIANA LOVELAND, ASHEVILLE, NORTH CAROLINA POLICE: It is unusual, but it's good that when someone does suspect that they recognize someone, no matter how old the story might be, that they are not afraid to give us a call so we can come investigate.

And that's going to clip their profits by about $500 million. It's one of the biggest drivers of their so-called shrinkage is this idea that organized crime is basically taking the stuff at the - at the retail price off of their store shelves and selling it to consumers who really are looking for lower prices, even lower than Target prices, those are pretty low prices already, because of the inflation story.

Number two, a nimble monitoring agency to follow what's going on. Number three would be funding geared towards things like AI constitution, AI that can reason about what it's doing. I would not leave things entirely to current technology, which I think is poor at behaving in ethical fashion and behaving in honest fashion.
