      "sentences": "We are following breaking news. President Biden is praising the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, the mastermind of October 7th, the massacre in Israel. And the president says that he plans to speak with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu soon.Israel's military confirming Sinwar's death earlier today. Two Israeli sources telling CNN that forces encountered Sinwar during a routine military operation. It's unclear what his death will mean for the Israel-Hamas war. Let's discuss a little bit more here with Democratic Congressman Jake Auchincloss of Massachusetts. Congressman, thanks for being with us. How significant is this? REP. JAKE AUCHINCLOSS (D-MA): Momentous. The world is safer now that this architect of mass murder and mass rape and hostage taking is dead. And it is an inflection point. For Hamas, it is an inflection point between continued war or the possibility of peace. If Hamas puts forward somebody in the same vein as Sinwar, one, Israel is going to kill that person too, rightfully. But two, there is going to be continued conflict in the region because the mandate of Hamas is the destruction of the Israeli state and the murder of all Jews. And no country is going to live next to a neighbor like that. But if Hamas puts forward somebody that is willing to start their tenure by unconditionally releasing all of the hostages, there is a pathway for peace.",

      "sentences": "Because Sinwar was the biggest obstacle to peace and to the release of the hostages. Sinwar, even by the barbaric standards of Hamas, was considered a hardliner. And when he took over the political wing of Hamas, in addition to the military command that he had in Gaza, the prospects for a hostage deal and for peace really faded to almost nothing. Which is why it was so critical that Israel retain a military presence in Gaza so that this type of routine military patrol could ultimately take out Sinwar.There is now a new prospect for a hostage deal. I'm not saying it's going to be easy. I'm not saying it happens immediately. We are still dealing with a terrorist organization. We are still dealing with people who have no moral code whatsoever. But with new leadership, that individual could release the hostages unconditionally. And then there could be an actual prospect of true negotiations to end this conflict.",

And if you could predict it perfectly, this wouldn't be the situation we were in.So that's why we are putting forward an air defense system. That's why we have our aircraft carrier strike group in the region, so that we can be prepared for anything. I think, though, that what this does do is it adds another tactical victory to the last few months for Israel. They've had success in southern Lebanon against Hezbollah.

It has -- it's got a lot of different missions, including, of course, the protective detail.But it also does, you know, counterfeit. It does cyber investigations. And according to this report, I mean, what you see here, what happened in Butler, Pennsylvania, is really a symptom of a bigger problem with the agency. And what you're hearing already, though, from Ronald Rowe, who is the acting director, he's saying that the Secret Service is already working on some of these things that are inside this report. Let's listen to a little bit more of what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RONALD ROWE, ACTING DIRECTOR, U.S. SECRET SERVICE: Well, what I'm focused on right now is making sure that I'm advocating for the men and women of the Secret Service that are out there doing the mission. And I'm trying to match the level of effort that they're doing right now to make sure that we are successful. And I'm pushing myself and those around me to make sure that we're having those conversations with key decision makers so that I can advocate for them. And everything is on the table, everything from pay reform, retirement reform, getting an authorization to ensure that our personnel are paid for every hour that they work. That is my focus right now. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Yesterday, around 5 p.m. local time in Buenos Aires, a hotel manager where Liam Payne was staying made a 911 call. I want to read you part of that 911 call, Brianna. The hotel manager said, We have a guest who is overwhelmed with drugs and alcohol. He breaks things up. He is tearing the whole room apart.Now, they didn't name Liam Payne in that. But after that, of course, is when the police said that Liam Payne was dead after falling from the third floor at that hotel. Now, local police also yesterday told the Associated Press that he had jumped from a balcony. I reached out just moments ago to the local police, and they declined to give me more details regarding that word jump. But then they referred me to the prosecutor's office in Argentina. The prosecutor's office in Argentina, they are saying that they believe that this fall could have been an accident due to the way that his body was found and the injuries that his body sustained. They also say the prosecutor's office that he, quote, may have fallen in a state of semi or total unconsciousness. Now, I want to tell you that local authorities have provided media with photos of what they found in Liam Payne's hotel room. There is a photo of a broken TV, also photos of what appear to be drug paraphernalia. We are not going to show that photo. But obviously, this is just an incredibly heartbreaking, tragic story. And although the exact circumstances are unclear, this is going to shine a light on mental health, on online bullying and the pressures that these young stars face in the spotlight.",

The two that you were talking about, the 4-4 there in Pasadena and the 4-7 in Malibu, certainly shook a lot of people. And so that was the issue.This wasn't in the middle of the desert. But there are so many, so many zones here that could shake at some point in time. And it's really just a matter of time. My lifetime, my son's lifetime, we all don't know, but there you go -- guys.",

Because this is a cycle that's been going on for a millennia, and it's not going to stop. Even if we've had a really long time, we are going to see another big earthquake at some point. So it's a matter of people being prepared.You talk about the January 17th earthquake in 1994 in Northridge. Dozens of people died. Thousands were injured. And that was centered in a very populated area. And then if you look at October 17th, the anniversary today, 35 years ago, the Loma Prieta earthquake, which people may remember was when the World Series was going on. I was in high school, and it was one of the most terrifying days, right, to have a major shaker like that and all the devastation that will occur. They will tell you that another one will happen in our lifetime. And in Southern California, what one geologist explained to me is that the way that you see all those mountains and hills underneath every one of them is an active fault. And the world underneath, the earth underneath is moving at about the same pace that fingernails are growing. So what we can do is prepare. And today was a great shakeout. And so what happens on the third Thursday of every October, today happens to be the anniversary, is a time for people to drop, cover, and hold on to practice and be prepared for an earthquake. So knowing how to do that, where you're going to go, if you're in a wheelchair, locking your wheelchair and making yourself safe in these environments. You don't want to run outside, which people used to do. When I was a kid, they used to tell us to stand in a doorway. No, you want to drop, cover, get under something sturdy, hold on while that shaking is going on, and protect yourself. [15:55:00] And then also get the things you need in advance and put them, stash them away. Enough water, that's the most important thing. You also have to have your food and your medicine. So you want people to prepare, be safe, but also just know for all these -- there's grown Angelenos who've never felt strong shaking because it's been so long. Prepare and get ready. And these little earthquakes are a little reminder. So not necessarily meaning a big earthquake is coming, but a reminder to just get your ducks in order.",
