A massive attack on energy sites by Russian forces has left more than 1 million homes in the dark. The combined missile as well as drone onslaught, stretched well into the western part of Ukraine across some 14 regions, at least five people were injured. And this has become, as many of you would know, a familiar scene throughout Ukraine. People taking shelter after losing power at their homes, as well as businesses. Russian President Vladimir Putin says the attack was a payback, a response to Ukraine's use of American-made missiles. Have a listen to this.

Michael, good to see you. Let me start then with what Nick was talking about, and then that's this massive Russian overnight attack targeting energy infrastructure. I mean, it's something that you and I have discussed in previous years, even when I was out in Ukraine. This is right out of the Trump -- pardon me, slip of the tongue, out of his playbook -- Putin's playbook, right.

Now, as Nick pointed out, some of them are preventative, but I have a -- I have a bit of a feeling that a lot of these are actually the direct result of direct Russian strikes over the past few hours on critical infrastructure. Temperatures are very low, near zero right now most of Ukraine. They're due to drop even more in a few days time. And Isa, you know, you and I have seen a lot in Ukraine when you've been here and, you know, graveyards and damaged buildings and stuff, but just a few blocks from here, I went today and I saw the neighborhood that was bombed by the Russians just three days ago.

President Biden was visiting a firehouse here in Nantucket, Massachusetts, when he spoke to reporters and said he believes that Trump should rethink the tariffs that he has talked about imposing on Canada and Mexico, arguing that it could jeopardize relationships with some of the United States most closest allies. Now, President-elect Donald Trump earlier in the week said that he plans to impose about 25 percent increase on tariffs on all imports coming from Mexico and Canada until the two countries do more to try to curb the flow of not just migrants to the U.S., but also fentanyl and other drugs. And for President Biden to come out there and publicly say this is quite a shift from what we have seen over the course of the past three weeks when he has really refrained from weighing in on any of President Trump's policies or his picks for cabinet posts that have played out since the November election. But it's also a very stark reminder that Biden and Trump hold very different policy views on things like tariffs, things like trade and the economy, but also the way to deal with allies around the globe including Mexico and Canada. So, it's very rare for President Biden recently to weigh in on this. Just yesterday -- or two days ago, as he was traveling here to Nantucket, he was very careful when someone asked him about these tariffs, said he wasn't going to comment. And then now he's changed his tune, saying that he does think that they should re-think it. Throughout the campaign, Biden and Democrats had warned that they believed that these tariffs would raise prices on -- prices back here at home for Americans. But now he's adding another layer to this, saying that the president -- President-elect Trump, with these tariff threats against Mexico and Canada could jeopardize those relationships as well.",

And, Oren, as we have seen, as we spoke to Nick Paton Walsh at the top of the hour, these weapons, this equipment, desperately needed in that frozen frontline. What has been done then?

The key question is, and this was the problem we heard from multiple U.S. officials and defense officials, is that they're simply unlikely to be able to use what they have left allocated by Congress. That's roughly $6.8 billion dollars in what's known as drawdown authority, that allows the U.S. to take weapons, systems, equipment right from U.S. stockpiles and send it directly and quickly to Ukraine. They've been doing that since virtually the start of the war, and they've kept up a steady pace. But that pace, especially in recent months, has very much dropped off. And as we noticed that it wasn't going to be able or didn't look like it was going to be able to hit and use all of that $6.8 billion by January 20th, by the end of the Biden administration, that's when we learned that it's going to be unlikely to happen, according to these officials. Now, the pace has been raised since fall to about $750 million a month, and that might get even closer to a billion a month, but in the two months left, that still leaves billions of dollars unused on the table and equipment that won't be able to go to Ukraine. The U.S. obviously has to watch its own stockpiles very closely and replenish what it sends, and it's only what it has in excess, effectively over that sort of baseline, that it's able to send, and that simply doesn't look like it'll be enough to use all of that $6.8 billion. So, what happens to it? Well, according to one of the officials we spoke with, it'll effectively be up to the incoming Trump administration. Do they want to stop the flow of weapons entirely? Do they want to stop announcing new military aid packages? That's up to them. And that's why we're looking so closely to try to get a sense of what is their plan on Ukraine. President-Elect Donald Trump while on the campaign trail said he could end the war in a day back in summer. He's made it clear to be one of his higher priorities. The question, and this is what we don't know, Isa, is how?",

He was the national security adviser to then-Vice President Mike Pence. So, he has been in this orbit and in these circles. In terms of what are his ideas on Ukraine as the special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, he put forward a proposal and presented this, according to two sources familiar with the conversation, to Mike Walsh, the incoming national security adviser. And his idea is roughly to say, look, Ukraine, we will keep arming you, if you take part in negotiations. If you don't take part in negotiations with Russia, the flow of weapons begin -- the flow of weapons ends. I'm sorry. The problem is that's not the only proposal on the table and that's not the only idea that the incoming national security adviser has heard. One of those who was also being looked at for the special envoy to Russia and Ukraine was Rick Grenell. His idea was creating autonomous zones to try to end the war. And meanwhile there are others, Isa, who say that Trump might increase the flow of weapons. So, all of these are on the table.

I really thought of that book as a book about my own feeling about the kind of world we're leaving to our children. And I had this notion that if I put it into the book, I could get it out of my head. We exist in a culture that is about buying and selling. So, when my children were very small and learning how to read, we would be riding the New York city subway and they would be playing with language by reading the advertisements. So, their first experience with language, which is this most human and sacred thing is in this language of advertising that's telling them to go to McDonald's and telling them to buy this thing, and they don't even know what it is they're being told to buy.
