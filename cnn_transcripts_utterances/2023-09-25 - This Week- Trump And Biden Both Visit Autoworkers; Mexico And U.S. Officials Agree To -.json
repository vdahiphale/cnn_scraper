This really does indicate kind of what the general election strategy would be assuming a rematch between Trump and Biden.Biden is determined to rebuild that so-called blue wall. He wants to get Wisconsin again. He wants to get Michigan again. He wants to make sure that everybody is clear on where he stands and he's trying to activate the labor movement as a whole as a key part of the Democratic coalition. Trump cannot win unless he pries away some of that base. And what he has done already in some of his statements -- we'll hear a lot more of it, I'm sure, this week -- is he's trying to separate the leadership of the union from the actual membership, just as Phil pointed out. I think he couldn't have picked a worse time. I mean, everything is on the line for these autoworkers. And to choose that moment to say your elected union leadership who is fighting for you to get a 20 percent- 30 percent raise, they're selling you out. They doing something wrong. They're not fighting hard enough against the future, which is electric -- you know, electric vehicles. I don't know if this is the right time to do it. I don't know if it's going to work for him but it does show that he's going to have to really, really try and dig into this stuff because you've got a sitting president who is doing something nobody's ever done.

We see the priorities among younger Democrat voters might be combating climate change and fighting this climate crisis.

I think that subplot is fascinating.But yeah, you're exactly right. Donald Trump's position as president and as candidate for president in 2024 is anti-institutional against the labor unions, in part because he recognizes that there is this inherent tension between the leadership of the union and the membership of the union. That's just sort of the nature of unions to a large extent. But also, just because he understands this is -- these are groups that are advantageous for the Democratic Party.

You can see when it's going to hit Belle Chasse and wind its way up towards New Orleans there. And in here is where all these water treatment plants are that keep folks in Orleans and Plaquemines Parish alive with drinking water as well.
