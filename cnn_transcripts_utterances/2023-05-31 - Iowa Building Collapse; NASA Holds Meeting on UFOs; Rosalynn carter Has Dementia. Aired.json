The defense attorney calling his actions incomprehensible and inexcusable.But the defense is going to try and ask the jury to consider if, in their words, his irrational motives and misguided intent ultimately fit with these 63 federal felony charges that Bowers is facing. Now, John, again, you spoke earlier about those 911 calls. That was really the moment in court that shifted the tone for this trial, as I said earlier. Bernice Simon, we heard her 911 call from inside the chapel, 84 years old. She was in the synagogue holding her husband who had already died on the phone with 911 trying to guide first responders to where she was. And she was incredibly brave, you hear it here, but then also you hear gunshots and then a silence because she had been killed. So, it's going to be another just harrowing day we expect here in what's going to be a challenging and difficult trial ahead. John.",

The House of Representatives expected to vote today on the long awaited and hard-fought debt limit deal. Republican leaders believe that they have a majority of their members on board. And they're also clear that they will need Democrats to push this over the line in this compromise deal. And even then it still needs to go through the Senate, of course. The country is now five days away from potentially defaulting on its debt. Much more on that ahead. Also this morning, Republican presidential candidate Ron DeSantis is on the trail in Iowa. At his first official campaign event just outside Des Moines last night the Florida governor told reporters that he will counterpunch against any attacks coming from Donald Trump, which is a noteworthy shift from DeSantis, who's long touted his close friendship and relationship with Trump to his political advantage.

Earlier this morning North Korea tried to launch a military reconnaissance satellite but it crashed into the Yellow (ph) Sea due to what state media called engine issues. Intelligence coming out of South Korea suggests the failure was due to a rushed launch and a changed flight path. North Korea plans to attempt a second launch soon.Also this morning, protests in Brazil, they are heating up. Riot police fired tear gas and watercannons at indigenous groups who were armed with bows and arrows. The protests are over Brazil's congress moving toward approving a bill that will limit the recognition of new indigenous ancestral lands throughout the country. And right now Secretary of State Tony Blinken is in Sweden and pushing for leaders to support Sweden's membership to NATO. Yesterday Blinken spoke with his Turkish counterpart, urging them to change their mind and approve Sweden's ascension. Turkey has been a holdout, standing this Sweden's way, after doing pretty much the same with regard to Finland's NATO membership. Turkey eventually supported Finland joining the alliance in March. Blinken hopes to have this whole matter solved by mid-July. John.",

They're going to say, we found some things that we can't entirely explain and that we want to look into more. That's what my guess is. You know, for a long time the government wouldn't say anything at all about this. Then the military came along and finally said, well, yes, there's some things out there that we're not quite sure what it is. Defense people looked at some of these images as well. Things captured by pilots up there and started saying, yes, maybe there's something strange about this. So, what's different, you look at these videos and you say, what is that thing? Is it performing in some way that we don't understand? And, if so, where did it come from? Is it some kind of a test vehicle from another country? Is it from space? Is it some aerial phenomenon we don't know about? And it's funny you even said unidentified anomalous phenomenon. Well, it's also been unidentified ariel phenomenon, all of which is replacing the UFO, which we always used to talk about, unidentified flying object. So, they've had this group in place. They've been looking at this. This is the first peek at NASA's look at this. This is the difference. The military has looked at this before. They continue doing what they're doing. This is the first time NASA has jumped in on this. They have a 16-member committee which they put together that has been looking at this. They're coming out with their initial findings before they put out an actual report on all of this. John.",

And many of them they ultimately said, ah, this was a weather balloon or this was some kind of, you know, flock of birds. It was something that showed up in a way that it shouldn't have.

She's been this huge advocate, as you know, Kate, for mental health overall. But age is a risk factor. If you look at people over the age of 65, that's when you see a sharper uptick especially when it comes to Alzheimer's disease, Alzheimer's dementia. We don't know specifically what type of dementia she's been diagnosed with. And then as you go from 75 to 84, the numbers go up even more. She's 95, as you mentioned, and she's in that category where you have the highest percentage of people who are going to have at least Alzheimer's-type dementia. Age is the biggest risk factor. There's other risk factors as well, including family history. That can be a risk factor. Previous traumatic brain injury, race, ethnicity, those can all be risk factors as well. So, not a huge surprise. We, again, we heard she was in the hospital in 2019, but had not heard anything about a potential dementia diagnosis before yesterday.

I think it's probably one of the most common questions we get because there are people who develop just sort of more natural, expected, age-related memory challenges a bit. It's not pre-ordained at all that that happens. But how do you know when it's actually turning into something like dementia?For example, when you talk about forgetting something. If you forget the name of an acquaintance, that's something that probably happens to everybody from time to time. That's normal. But if you forget the name of a family member, a close family member, that would be something that would be considered more - something that would be suspicious for dementia. I always say, if somebody forgets where their car keys are, that's normal. If they forget what their car keys are for, that would be something that's more like dementia. But as a general rule, Kate, if you're thinking about this or anyone's thinking about this in their own family, has the symptoms - have the symptoms started to interfere with their activities of daily living? Just how they conduct their lives. If it's gotten to that point, that becomes increasingly suspicious for dementia.",
