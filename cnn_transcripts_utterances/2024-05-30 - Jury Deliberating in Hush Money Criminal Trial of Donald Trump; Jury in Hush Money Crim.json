Why one side might like that a bit more.\"My wife is fond of flying flags. I am not.\" Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito refuses to recuse himself from January 6th cases despite the controversial flags that Trump supporters have adopted seen at two of his homes. And just when you thought that Zoom snafus were so 2020, meet the man caught driving, driving during a virtual court hearing after being charged for driving with a suspended license. I'm John Berman with Kate Bolduan. Sara is out today, and this is CNN NEWS CENTRAL. This morning, prosecutors, defense lawyers, legal analysts around the world trying to figure out what the jury is thinking. It is verdict watch in the criminal case against Donald Trump. The jury has the case. They have been deliberating for four hours, but they asked to be read key pieces of testimony, testimony that largely involves David Pecker, the man that ran \"The National Enquirer,\" testimony about discussions that he says he had with Donald Trump himself about burying stories before the 2016 election. The jury also asked to hear their jury instructions from the judge once again. With us this morning, CNN's Brynn Gingras from outside the courthouse. Within an hour or so, we should learn a whole lot of new information, Brynn.",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's right, John, testimony as you're laying out for the viewers that in closing arguments the prosecution said pay attention to this testimony of David Pecker. The prosecutor who gave those closing arguments is saying he believed his testimony was utterly devastating. So it's certainly interesting that the jurors are requesting to hear back some of this testimony, though it's unclear, of course, why.So as you just laid out, they had two requests before they left yesterday, the jurors. One request was to hear back four different parts of testimony regarding David Pecker and his interactions with Donald Trump about the Karen McDougal deal, and also a testimony from both David Pecker and Michael Cohen from that August 2015 Trump Tower meeting where they sort of, according to prosecutors, hatched out this catch and kill scheme, the basis, according to prosecutors, of this conspiracy that they allege against Donald Trump. So very, very key parts. Unclear exactly what parts, you know, definitely unclear what parts they're going to read back. But we're hearing its about 30 minutes or so that that's going to take to read all that back to the jurors. Their second request, as you noted, they'd like to hear back jury instruction. What's unclear this morning is how much of the jury instruction. They don't get a copy of that when they go back into the room and deliberate. So do they want to hear all of it, all 55 pages, or do they want to hear a portion? The judge asked them to clarify that. So we'll hear when court resumes at 9:30 this morning. So look, when court picks back up, that's where we start off. We'll hear back the readback of this witness testimony, we'll figure out how much of jury instructions will be read back, if a portion of it, all of it. We don't know yet. And then the deliberations are going to continue. One little thing to point out as well that's interesting for the jurors, they actually have a computer back in their deliberation rooms that has all the evidence on it that they can access. But again, it's the testimony that they don't have access to, and that's what here when court starts back up, guys.",

I think it's quite possible that they've already determined that the document itself, those documents have been falsified, meaning that it wasn't a payment to Michael Cohen for legal services as opposed to that it was reimbursement for the money that he paid for Stormy Daniels. So in terms of Michael Cohen's testimony, for them to ask for it back bag, they haven't completely discredited him.But remember, it can be two jurors, three jurors, five jurors, half of the jury, we don't know. But the important part is that Michael Cohen's testimony, when they asked for it and David Pecker's testimony about a specific meeting, then they're comparing the testimony between the two, trying to see if it can be corroborated between the two. And it also goes to show you, remember, one of the jury instructions has to deal with accomplice testimony, and on Michael Cohen as an accomplice, you can't just take his testimony alone. You need the corroboration. So perhaps they are looking for that cooperation as well.",

This report from \"The New York Times\" and \"The Mississippi Today\" I can honestly say is explosive.There is no access to these chat that we can even get ourselves. In fact, the Rankin County Sheriff's Department is asking \"The New York Times\" to see this themselves, but it kind of details a lot of the stuff that was going on behind the scenes. The WhatsApp group chat was started, first of all, because it is encrypted, and so unless someone gives you access to it, there have been no way anybody would been able to review this, but some of the things have been going back and forth is sometimes when they would see a dead body, they would share that picture amongst a group chat. They would joke about things going on. In fact, one of the messages talks about when Deputy Hunter Elward asked, \"Did you tase the man in the face?\" Or when another officer of the Goon Squad said, \"Did you use your taser to shock the man's anus?\" So you can see the back and forth. There is even a time when there was a woman who apparently they had arrested and they were talking about whether or not they would share pictures of this woman's naked body after the arrest.  So obviously, there is a lot of questions about how pervasive, how corrosive was this back and forth Goon Squad with these messages. Now, some of the people who were involved here says this was just joke. This was just a macabre nature of what was going on, but when you realize that sometimes they were able to coordinate their efforts through WhatsApp, that shows you how whatever happened in this chat group sometimes ended up affecting people. Now, to go on here, one of the lawyers for one of the men who was arrested, actually, Daniel Updike, Jeff Reynolds, the lawyer says the explanation by some, they were just joking about torturing people in their WhatsApp group rings hollow, given the multiple incidents of torture that have now been documented. Malik Shabazz, the lead attorney for Jenkins and Parker says the latest revelations regarding the Rankin County, Mississippi Goon Squad text messages are not surprising at all. You understand there is a lot of pain still in this community. I will tell you, the Justice Department is still asking for people in this community to come forward with more things when it comes to talking about the Goon Squad. But, let's not forget, five members of that squad have already been sent to jail. But at the same time, people believe this is a deeper corrosive problem within that sheriff's department. These messages are starting to bring to light some of the things that people talk about. John, I will continue to examine this. There is a bunch of people working to get to the bottom of it, but something like this, the WhatsApp group chat, a lot of people want to analyze -- John.",
