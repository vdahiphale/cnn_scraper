We'll check in with the other markets as well. That is the big board. Those are the markets and here are the main events. The reality of climate change sinks in. The planet sees its two hottest days ever. Fed officials are in agreement, interest rates are going even higher this year. And Google and Facebook threaten to block news access in Canada. The Canadian Heritage minister joins me to discuss the new law that would force social media sites to pay for news. Live from New York, it is Wednesday, July 5th. I'm Paula Newton, in for Richard Quest, and this is still QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. So tonight, the planet keeps breaking temperature records this week underscoring the climate crisis we are in at this hour. The hottest day ever recorded on Earth was on Monday and that was only to be broken Tuesday, with an average global temperature of 17.2 degrees Celsius. Now the previous record set in 2016, the hottest year ever, and we may come to beat that this year. Like in 2016, we are dealing with an El Nino event, the warming of equatorial waters in the Pacific that tends to lead to warmer global temperatures, and the intensifying effects of climate change. And already this year, the consequences of global heating have been devastating. Canada has had its worst wildfire season on record, and we are only halfway through it. There have been deadly blistering heat waves in India, China, Mexico, and the Middle East. The Southern United States is sweltering right now under an intense heat dome, and the UK just recorded its hottest June ever. North Africa has seen temperatures near 50 degrees Celsius. Even Antarctica in winter right now is seeing unusually hot weather. CNN's chief climate correspondent, Bill Weir joins me now. This isn't your first rodeo. You've been covering this literally from one end of the globe to the other for years. I want to ask you, are we reaching this tipping point sooner than anyone really expected it? And if we are, well what can be done about it?",

And this is exactly how it would be predicted, as the ice goes away, the earth systems contain and hold down a lot more heat and this is a staggering statistic I found today, Paula. They actually measure the extra heat captured on our warm planet in Hiroshimas per second, that's the amount of energy in a Hiroshima-sized atomic bomb. A few years ago, the oceans were bringing down five of those a second. That's five Hiroshima-sized atomic bombs per second, but that has since doubled just in the last five years. So we're seeing this cascading effect, and that is what is really troubling is that at a certain point, you reach a tipping point where earth systems sort of take over and perpetuate the warmth. As the ice goes away, you lose that reflective ability, the dark water absorbs more heat. You're seeing some of that. But the El Nino phenomenon, which is natural is just sort of laying bare how much of that extra heat the oceans have been hiding from us here on land. And now, it is just, boom through the charts. And you see these charts, it sort of seems like it must be a printing error, where they're just off any historical record right now, from surface level temperatures, sea surface temperatures, the water that's even deeper there, all the way across the board.

It was a terrifying job because every week, a colleague would come up to me say, Jeff, it's worse than we thought, and the great climate scientist, my colleague, James Hansen, has been telling me and telling the world for years, not only are we warming at an alarming and unsustainable rate, but the warming itself is accelerating. And he has been saying for years that even during the La Nina phase of the Pacific, which cools the planet, we continue to warm. In other words, the underlying warming was so great that even the La Nina didn't stop the warming process, but he kept saying to me and saying to the world, wait until we go to an El Nino, boom. Now, we're in an El Nino and the temperatures are jumping, we're setting records. We could hit and exceed that 1.5 degrees Celsius level within the next three, four, five years. That was supposed to be the absolute ceiling. Now, the what to do has been known for a long time, which is to move from the coal, oil, and gas economy to one based on wind, solar, geothermal, hydropower, nuclear, and others that don't burn carbon, and this has been understood, to move to electric vehicles, to move to heating our buildings with the electricity rather than heating oil, and so on. But we have to do it, and we have to do it at a global scale. And Congress has dragged its feet because of the big oil lobby, really corruption basically for years and years and years, paying these campaigns of our congressmen and so forth.

They're not resisting movement on this. It's the same in India, a disaster. But they're saying create a system of finance. That depends on the US Congress.

I do think that a pause here, though, Paula, when the markets makes a lot of sense. I mean, this was the best first half of the year for the NASDAQ in 40 years, which is pretty incredible.

And those include, as you mentioned, the CDC, the FBI, Justice Department, State Department, White House press secretary, US Surgeon General cannot speak to TikTok, Facebook, and Instagram, WeChat, except for if they notice any illegal activity or see any national security threats. But this comes after a 2022 lawsuit that two state attorneys generals filed against the Biden administration, GOP attorney generals, saying that the Biden administration colluded with social media companies, asking them to address and suppress information about COVID-19 theories, election integrity, vaccine efficacy, as well as stories about Hunter Biden and the president himself, thus breaching the First Amendment. However, the White House is saying that they were only speaking to these social media companies in the best interest of the American public, especially during the pandemic, when there was so much misinformation around COVID-19. The White House also saying that the DOJ is going to be looking into this, seeing what their options are with this case. White House also saying that it is up to social media companies to figure out what content is on their platforms, and ultimately up to those social media companies to figure out what to do with it. But this judge saying that he has seen enough evidence to grant this injunction, also saying that if these plaintiffs, these two state attorneys generals are successful in their lawsuit, that this would, \"be the most massive attack against free speech in US history.\" Now, this judge, Judge Doughty is a Trump appointee. He still has to make a ruling in the lawsuit, in that case, but this injunction, this basically, blocking of communication between the Biden administration and these social media companies is a win for these states who have brought this lawsuit. Paula, we also reached out to the social media companies, wanted to see what they thought about this. The only one that we heard back from is Meta. They had no comment, but interesting to see how they really feel. Do they like having the federal government pointing out problematic content to them? Or do they want them to stay out of it?

Google wants some certainty, more predictability, which is totally normal from a business perspective. I was in the private sector for a while and what they are asking for it's totally reasonable. And we think that (INAUDIBLE) regulations will be able to meet pretty much everything that they ask. So that is Google. And I'm telling Meta, why don't you can put us, guys?
