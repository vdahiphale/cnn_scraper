Still listed in critical condition at last check is the photographer, that is Jesse Walden. And, of course, even here at the hospital you can feel the sort of - the angst, quite frankly, among journalists here that are obviously rooting for Jesse and hoping for the best here. Now, let's back up a minute because the quotes, the information thatyou just played before you came to me from the sheriff really speaks to what is the big question right now, which, what was the motive? What led up to this? And while much of that remains unclear in the less than 24 hours since the shooting in which we are right now, we do have more info in terms of the sequence of events. So, let's go over that quickly. At 11:00 a.m. yesterday deputies get a call that there was a shooting of a woman in a car. They go out there. They investigate. Then, five hours later, 4:00 p.m., another call comes in. And as you mentioned, those journalists that were there covering the initial shooting were also shot. Then a mother and a nine-year-old child in a nearby home also shot. The nine-year-old died. The mother, we're told, survived, also in critical condition. Here's what else the sheriff said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SHERIFF JOHN MINA, ORANGE COUNTY, FLORIDA, SHERIFF'S OFFICE: No one in our community, not a mother, not a nine-year-old, certainly not news professionals should become victims of gun violence in our community.

So, I think you look at this number and you say it's a rear view mirror number, it is still strong at the end of the year, but right now all of the anxiety is about how -- where we're going forward. We also got a jobless claims figure this morning that was really, really good.

If you want to make that defense, the way you make it is, you play the clip of Donald Trump speaking at the Ellipse, you show his tweet saying, be there, it will be wild.
