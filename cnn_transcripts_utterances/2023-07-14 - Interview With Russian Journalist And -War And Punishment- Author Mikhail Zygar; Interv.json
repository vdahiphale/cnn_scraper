They discuss how she mix sadness andsilliness in her hit show, \"Bad Sisters.\" Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Bianna Golodryga in for Christiane Amanpour. The cracks are on full display in Moscow after the failed Wagner rebellion at the end of last month. In an extraordinary show of defiance, senior Russian general, Ivan Popov, of who led Russian forces in Southern Ukraine is saying he's been fired after accusing military leaders of not providing sufficient support. Meanwhile, general and Wagner VIP, Sergey Surovikin, has still not been seen in public since the aborted mutiny. It is a stark contrast with NATO leaders who, despite some bumps in the road, put on a largely united front at their Lithuania summit this week. I spoke about this with the Russian journalist, Mikhail Zygar. He fled the country after a media crackdown and in protest of the war. His new book, \"War and Punishment,\" follows the painful history between his country and Ukraine, and is now available across the world. Here is our conversation. Mikhail Zygar, thank you so much for joining the show. It's great to talk to you. We'll get to your book in just a moment. But let me get you to respond to what has transpired this week, and that was the NATO summit in Lithuania. Obviously, Ukraine walking away disappointed that there wasn't a direct timeline offered in terms of when they can join the alliance. But nonetheless, big news was made. It appears that Sweden will be joining very soon. I'm wondering how all of this is playing out within the Kremlin and how they are portraying it to the Russian public, because the theme that they had presented all along is that NATO is a threat to Russia, now you've seen over the course of one year, not only Finland joined the alliance but now Sweden soon to join as well. MIKHAIL ZYGAR, RUSSIAN JOURNALIST AND AUTHOR, \"WAR AND PUNISHMENT\":  You know, it seems to me that Russian political elite is a bit in disarray. And actually, the most discussed topic is still Yevgeny Prigozhin's mutiny. And the number of internal problems is that high that -- obviously, propaganda is trying to address the news about Ukraine and NATO summit, but actually, they (INAUDIBLE) with it. There are meaningless statements by Former President Medvedev that, OK, Ukraine will never join NATO and that's why we should continue our war. But actually, the thing that people are really discussing is the internal problems in Putin's inner circle and in the army.",

He was considered to be the only guarantor of the stability forthe political elite, for the bureaucracy, and now it's obvious for everyone that he cannot hold it. And the recent news are that General Popov, who was one of the high ranking commanders in Russian army, was fired from the ministry of defense. So -- and he was obviously supportive of Prigozhin's line. We've heard in the recent years that not General Surovikin but other very important commanders and generals from the ministry of defense were detained or arrested recently. So, we are witnessing the system that seemed to be very stable is beginning to collapse.",

The fallout from the mutiny continues, as you mentioned, another general now speaking out after he says he was fired for criticizingthe direction of this war and its leadership. And General Surovikin also now being detained since that failed mutiny, and no one has really spoken him since. A lot of his advisers around him as well, according to \"The Wall Street Journal,\" have been detained in question. How do you see this ending? Because it appears that Vladimir Putin, over the years, had done a very good job of making foolproof any sort of attempted coup or threat from opposition or the left, but perhaps, now, he should be more focused and concerned about the stability of those in the right, around him, of the Siloviki.",

He always wanted them to compete with each other. And actually, he was using Prigozhin as a counterweight to minister of defense, Sergei Shoigu. And these competition goes on. But now, we see that probably Vladimir Putin is out of touch with reality, as Angela Merkel once said. Even his reaction to the Prigozhin's mutiny was weird because we know that the same day he left Moscow for a big celebration in his hometown, St. Petersburg, where he was partying on a yacht of his close friend, Yuri Kovalchuk. So, probably Putin -- obviously, all my sources confirm that his decisions are a bit strange. And most Russian bureaucracy don't -- just don't get it, why he's not very decisive as he used to be.",

Because you really do go through a lot of detail and debunking the myths that they were created as one. But you start the book with a confession. And here's what you're right. This book is a confession. I am guilty of not reading the signs much earlier. I, too, am responsible for Russia's war against Ukraine. As my contemporaries and our forebears. Regrettably, Russian culture is also to blame for making all these horrors possible. What in Russian culture, in your view, attributed to this war today?",

We have never had any kind of people's history of Russia. We had the history of the Russian emperors and then secretary generals and then presidents. Actually, we need to change our attitude. We have to change the attitude to the neighbors. We need to focus the real story behind us, and that -- all those stories are sometimes dreadful, Russian history is full of blood, and we need to know it. And history is being used as justification of this war. Putin is using history every time he is talking about history in every single speech, and that's falsified version of Russian history.

What's interesting in this book is that you give a lot more detail as to President Zelenskyy's history and who the man is before he's become this wartime president that everyone has come to know and admire for his great bravery. He was, as we know, a comedian, an actor, but he was also someone who was well versed in Russian and Russian culture. Russian was his dominant language. That was his first native language. And it's interesting that over the course of the past few years, he had been really hoping to use his charm, to use wit, to use his familiarity with Russian and Russian culture to find some common ground with Vladimir Putin.

It's -- the story is through the eyes of two sisters, as Ezra and Cinthy, she goes Hyacinth Kindred.

So, I wanted to go far into the north to really emphasize the wingspan of racial hatred in America, but I also wanted to think about Maine as this place, when I was young as a student, I spent a lot of time going north. And I always wondered, you know, what it would be like for a black girl like me to grow up in this kind of environment. And so, Cinthy and Ezra, as you mentioned, they are coming of age. They are 13 and 15. They are coming from a loving black family that has always tried to protect them and emphasize education and what kind of life that they might have if they have education and love and support. And as they're beginning their first day of school, of their last year, all of this kind of falls apart. And so, that's -- those are some of the things I would like to say is that, you know, what kind of world in Maine versus the south would be the setting for this novel? I think that's really important to think about with these girls. And that, you know, they are defiant, they are bold. They do not want to be ladies. They don't want to listen to what their parents are telling them. And the world is telling them that they have to be. I'm reminded of Zora Neale Hurston's novel, \"Their Eyes Were Watching God.\" And there's this moment where the central character in that novel, her grandmother who loves her and wants to protect her tells her that, you know, she can't be a flower, she can't be a blossom. She's come in to her grandmother's porch and she's watched bees kind of kissing the flowers, and she's aware of her own sensuality and her life. And her grandmother says, you know, the romance and sensuality of the world is not for you. Black women are the mules of the world. And so, this happens as she's very young. And so, I wanted to reclaim the sense of vulnerability and dreams and imagination for these young girls that you can be strong and defiant, that can't be taken away from you, that you can have access to the sweet dreams of life and that we have the power to choose what work looks like for black women. We don't have to exhaust ourselves and work ourselves to death. That we are not just here to be laborers or mules or animals. And I think in this country, and particular going back to enslaved black women, I wanted to not provide some kind of traumatic story of black girls and women. I wanted to think of our inner lives and our imaginations and I wanted to give this to my two young girls who are 13 and 15.",

And so, I feel very compassionate and tender towards Ruby because she suffers from promises that the world has told her that she should receive as a young white girl. And so, these three girls, you know, at the beginning of the novel, they decide the day before school they're going to play this game where they really look at each other and they go up into this hard sunlight and they lie down on the ground and they look at each other, and they're trying to figure out why the world is telling them that they are different or that one body is valued more than the other, that one is more beautiful than the other. And when they sit up, they kind of think, there's something different, but it's not what the world is telling us. And so, what happens in the novel is that, at this moment, there's a loss of innocence. There's a certain kind of feeling of them being dragged into the gays of the world, on their bodies and their futures. And so, Ruby is coming from an environment, even though she is white, there's a class issue where she has been kicked down in a way to make it seem that she is not as -- she doesn't possess as less value than black girls. But because she is poor, there will be extra steps that she will have to take to claim the gifts and privileges of white womanhood. And for Cinthy and her sister, they are sitting up and trying to think about the loving veil that their parents have wrapped them in, have made a shelter for them, and realize that there is a dissonance, that there's a break between what their parents have promised them versus what the world has kind of suddenly asking them to see about their selves and to not see themselves, and that they are trying to say, that they want to see themselves, all three of these girls.",

And part of that to learning was when Todd Park recruited me to come to the White House. And I had seen what was going on over in the U.K. where they had created something called the Government Digital Service, which, yes, was much more than a one-year service program. It was the great technologists and designers and content strategists working at the center of government, really changing how the U.K. operated and how the government could communicate with its citizens. And so, that was the inspiration for the U.S. Digital Service. And also, I think, out of that we got another wonderful group in the General Services Administration called 18F, and both of those groups are now groups and agencies around federal government.

So, most low-income people access the internet through a mobile phone, but they would have to go find a computer at the library to use it, and it really was -- the reason why so many people who were eligible for a SNAP in California weren't getting it, they couldn't get through this form. Even at the library, it would take too long. The library computer would timeout after half an hour and they hadn't finish filling it out. And because of all of the processes and procedures that they had to jump through after filled out that form. And working with those counties to find a better way to do this, with fewer questions that worked on a mobile phone, involved really understanding that they -- the way they made decisions about this was that all the counties got to vote on what features were going into this.
