      "sentences": "You are live in the CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.We are following big developments in two major stories at this hour. A short time ago in Texas, the state's House of Representatives voted to impeach attorney general Ken Paxton. He is accused of bribery and abuse of public trust. The conservative Republican calls the proceedings a politically motivated sham. Meanwhile here in Washington, we're waiting for details on a phone call that is wrapping up, or may have already wrapped up, between President Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. The debt ceiling talks have reached a crucial moment of sorts, says negotiations are now down to one final sticking point, work requirements for social safety net programs. The White House and Republican leaders may have as little as eight days -- eight days to prevent the U.S. from defaulting on its debts. Many experts predict economic disaster if that happens. Let's begin with the debt talks. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is at the White House. Our Manu Raju is up on Capitol Hill. Manu, what do you think? Do we think we'll get some kind of readout from the speaker on what was said in this conversation? What are you hearing at this point?",

He has been speaking with reporters for most of this process going forward, although last night, late in the night as talks were going on, he did slip out of the Capitol without talking to reporters. We'll see if anything happens here.But this is a significant moment. And these negotiations have hit this critical time because negotiations have essentially been going around the clock between the president's team and the speaker's team, and they have not been able to close out a deal to avoid the first ever default in American history. In large part because of the sticking points that you mentioned, one of which dealing with the issue of so- called work requirements for some social safety programs like food stamps. But there are also other issues, too, that are still being hammered out including how far to go in imposing spending cuts. Remember the White House didn't want to include any of this at all as part of the dela to raising that national debt ceiling. They simply asked for it to be done without any condition whatsoever. Republicans demanded conditions. Now the White House is negotiating those conditions. And the question is, can the speaker and can the president finalize those remaining issues that have been unresolved? That's what one key negotiator Patrick McHenry told me right before this phone call took place. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. PATRICK MCHENRY (R-NC): But there is a major disagreement between the two parties. Republicans want to cut spending. That's what we offered with our approach to raising the debt ceiling. We want work requirements for able bodied folks to get back in the workforce. Those things are big issues and there is no way to sort of gloss that over.",

Some history was made today in Austin, Texas. As the GOP-led statehouse voted overwhelmingly to send 20 articles of impeachment against Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton to the state Senate for trial. Paxton becomes the first Texas official to be impeached in the House of Representatives in nearly half a century. The vote, 121 days, 23 nays, and two voting absent. CNN's Rosa Flores joins us now from Houston. Rosa, this vote is just the beginning. Ken Paxton is certainly not out of the woods. And I guess one of the most important things to headline out of all of this, highlight out of all of this is that he is no longer the attorney general right now. Is that right?",

On Twitter he said today, quote, \"I am beyond grateful to have the support of millions of Texans who recognize that what we just witnessed is illegal, unethical and profoundly unjust. I look forward to a quick resolution in the Texas Senate where I have full confidence the process will be fair and just.\" Now Governor Abbott has the power under the Texas constitution to appoint an attorney general while Ken Paxton is suspended. I've reached out to the governor's office to see if that decision has been made or if an announcement will be made, and I have not heard back. Now what actually happens in the Senate? We don't know the timing at this point but we do know that the lieutenant governor serves as a judge. There are 31 senators. They serve as jurors. And a two-thirds vote of those present is required for a conviction. Now, Jim, here's one very interesting detail. One of those senators is Angela Paxton. If that name sounds familiar, it should because she is the spouse of Ken Paxton. Now, some of these articles of impeachment include allegations of an affair. All of this goes back to the donor that is of question in all of these allegations in regards to the settlement involving the whistleblowers. And so one big question is, what will happen? Will she participate? I've reached out to her office. I have not heard back -- Jim.",

And an impeachment proceeding is less about, you know, trying to punish the guilty. It's more about trying to protect the citizens of Texas. Protect our constituents.

The concern among city officials here is that 45,000 number, which is the total number of asylum seekers, roughly, that they're still caring for, is going to continue to increase. So they're doing two things.One of them is they're scouring not just the city but also the state for places to potentially put them but also taking this unprecedented and coming with controversial -- controversy, rather, a legal step, petitioning the court to grant them some flexibility in the form of the suspension of portions of their Right to Shelter Law. This has been in place for decades. And at its heart, it basically requires New York City to provide shelter to any homeless individual. And as you just saw in these numbers, many of them have been asylum seekers. So what they are hoping to do is secure some flexibility and some clarity. Now this has come with some criticism, and as we mentioned some controversy with some critics saying that if they secure this order from the court, that it could allow the city an opportunity to basically skirt around its legal obligations to provide housing for homeless individuals. But when you hear from the city, from Eric Adams, from his deputy mayor and the list goes on, they say that they are concerned that the system will buckle under its own weight and that this migrant crisis, according to one deputy mayor here in New York, shows no signs of ending any time soon. So they would like this kind of flexibility should they find themselves in a very tight spot where we see, let's say, a bus load of migrants and they have to place them in accommodations that would not adhere to the Right to Shelter Law as it is. So that's why they're petitioning for this. But again the city insisting that they do not want to basically shut the door in the faces of migrants. But with that mounting price tag that's expected to surpass $4 billion by next summer, then they're worried that if they don't do this, then they could end up in some serious trouble -- Jim.",

We want some type of a cap as it pertains to the budget going back to fiscal 2022. The president doesn't want that. But from my understanding, they have sort of met in the middle with the White House on that. So look, I think this is a good thing for the president to be able to negotiate running for re-election.

The advisory cites a study showing that 95 percent of kids between ages 13 and 17 report using social media, although the 13 is the minimum age for a lot of these sites, between the ages of eight and 12, forty percent of kids report using social media. So there is just a lot of use, and the surgeon general points out there's not enough data to say that this is safe. They look at the available research and they conclude there are some benefits like helping kids find communities, particularly kids who are marginalized, but they detail a huge number of risks as well, including studies showing the correlation between social media use and depression and anxiety, interruption of healthy habits like getting enough sleep, online harassment, and low self-esteem. So this is something that they are calling for more research on and for policymakers to step in here. They're also calling on the tech industry to be more transparent with its data. The social media companies say that they have already put measures in place to make their products safer for kids. They also have guidance for parents on how kids can use their sites safely, but the pressure is going to continue to mount. The surgeon general told me that they've heard from researchers that they have trouble getting the companies to really share all of their data, so they are calling on them to be more transparent. In the meantime, they're giving some tips for families and parents to put into place right now to try to protect their kids. Things like establishing a family media plan, having times when there are tech free zones, maybe around dinnertime, or especially overnight to enable kids to get enough sleep, modeling social media responsibility ourselves, putting the phone down -- that is something that is so hard for so many of us. Teaching kids about technology, reporting cyberbullying if it happens, and then banding together with other parents. The surgeon general said strength in numbers, that is something that's really important, something we can all work on together.",

So not just sort of laying down the hammer, but really explaining why is this problematic? How does it make you feel? What do you notice about yourself? What are you concerned with?
