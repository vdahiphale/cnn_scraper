I mean, the nominal, you know, opposition are just nominal, just to be playing in that game. But what do you think a convincing claim of a win will mean for him in the situation he finds himself in right now? SULLIVAN: There's no doubt that Putin is going to win. As you say he's running effectively unopposed. But this election is extremely important for him, for Putin, for Russia, and I would say for the world, for the following reason. He's been working on this -- this project, getting himself re-elected, despite the Russian constitution's term limits which were in effect until he had the constitution revised in 2020, he's been working on this for years. Winning re-election -- but here's the key factor from his perspective. It's turnout. He wants to be able to tell the world, show the world, that the Russian people support him. They turned out in large numbers -- 75, 80 percent -- and voted for him. What the opposition is trying to do is to use that turnout issue against him. And there's been -- you may have seen an organized effort to try to convince those who were opposed to Putin to vote at a particular time on Sunday, noon on Sunday, going to the polls, showing long lines of people at that precise time, as opposed to Putin. So the election comes down to turnout. Putin wants a large turnout to validate, to claim legitimacy for his rule, because otherwise, he doesn't have legitimacy. He doesn't have, for example, the communist ideology that the Soviet leaders had. He doesn't have the divine right of rule the way the Czars have. He seeks legitimacy from the Russian people. That's what he really craves. Otherwise, he would just declare himself president. AMANPOUR: You're a Republican, and you see what Donald Trump Republicans are doing in Congress about aid to Ukraine. And appearing to actually be throwing their lot in, you know, with Putin rather than the democratic, sovereign, independent Ukraine that the rest of the world -- the western world is supporting. This is what Republican Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin said recently. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. RON JOHNSON (R-WI): We are now about two years into this bloodbath. And now, we're in a bloody stalemate. And the reality, I think, a lot of my colleagues who are supporting this aid package are ignoring is that Vladimir Putin will not lose this war.

QUEEN AL ABDULLAHRamadan is typically defined with family gatherings, people coming together, sharing a meal and breaking their fast together. But what is it like for the people of Gaza today who are now hungry and thirsty in tents or makeshift shelters, who are mourning their dead and mourning the life that they had just a few months ago? You know, Christiane, since the beginning of this war, Israel has cut off everything that is required to sustain a human life -- food, fuel, shelter, medicine, water. And it has been going on now for five months and left the people of Gaza completely reliant on outside assistance. And actually, it has systematically denied and delayed a lot of that assistance, occasionally bombing some of the convoys that bring this assistance and bombing some of the people -- shooting at some of the people who are trying to get whatever scarce resources that they can get. According to the U.N. every single person in Gaza today is hungry. Over a quarter of the population, that's more than 550,000 people are one step away from famine. Experts say that they have never seen a population descend into such mass hunger so rapidly. I mean, I'm hearing of people just eating whatever they can get their hands on, including grass or they're having to grind, you know, bird feed or animal fodder just to make bread. And in the north of Gaza, people are not on the verge of starvation, they're actually dying of starvation. It starts with the most vulnerable -- the elderly, the wounded, babies. We're hearing increasing number of babies who are dying from severe malnutrition and thirst. And if things don't change, I think these cases are going to be spiraling throughout the strip. And, you know, this has been a slow-motion mass murder of children five months in the making. Children who were thriving and healthy just months ago are wasting away in front of their parents. You know, starvation is a very slow, cruel, and painful death. Your muscles shrink, your immune system shuts down, your organs give out. Imagine being a parent, having to go through that, witness your child going through that and not being able to do anything to help. It is absolutely shameful, outrageous, and entirely predictable what's happening in Gaza today because it was deliberate.",

These airdrops are literally just drops in an ocean of unmet needs.And King Abdullah has said from the very beginning, they are neither sufficient nor they are substitute for, you know, humanitarian access at scale. So countries should not use them as a way out, nor should they be viewed as an excuse for not doing what needs to be done. And that is implementing an immediate and sustained ceasefire, opening all access points into Gaza, particularly land routes, streamlining the inspection process and making sure that there is safe access within Gaza so that the aid can be distributed. Every moment counts. Children are starving as we speak. So every moment and every meal counts. And so, I think now we're past the stage of trying to talk Israel into doing these things.
