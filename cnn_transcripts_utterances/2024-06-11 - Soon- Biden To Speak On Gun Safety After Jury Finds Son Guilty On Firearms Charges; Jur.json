      "sentences": "This had not been on his schedule before today's verdict. But of course, that is where his son is, where his wife, Jill Biden. And certain, President Biden will want to be around his family and surrounded by his family at this very painful moment.Before then, he will be speaking at this event in Washington meant to tout his record on curving gun violence. There is some political awkwardness in the timing of that. It was sort of a fluke of scheduling. I'd be surprised if the president uses that speech to address this in any capacity. Certainly wanting to focus on a reduction in violent crime. But then from there, the president will be heading back to Delaware. We did receive a statement, a written statement from the president shortly after this verdict was rendered, where the president said, \"As I said last week, I am the president, but I am also a dad.\" The president goes on to say, \"Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today. So many families who have had loved one's battle addiction understand the feeling of pride seeing someone you love come out on the other side and be so strong and resilient in recovery.\" The president went on to say, \"As I also said last week, I will accept the outcome of this case and will continue to respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal.\" And he concludes, \"Jill and I will always be there for Hunter and the rest of our family with our love and support. Nothing will ever change that.\" So the president very much viewing this case through the lens of a father, as a dad, not necessarily as a president. I think there are two important things to note from that statement. One is sort of linking this case back to the millions and millions of Americans who have similarly struggled with addiction in their own families trying to relate their own experience to the experience of those families. But also saying very specifically that he will accept the outcome of this case, drawing a very clean clear distinction with the verdict that was rendered earlier today in Wilmington and the federal criminal counts rendered against former President Trump, who has said that this amounts to a rigged judicial system. President Biden very clearly saying that this is the rule of law, and he will accept the outcome. We did here a little bit from him last week on this topic. Listen to what he said.

It just shows how sensitive this topic is for him.At the end of the day, this really does punctuate quite a painful saga for the Biden family, really starting with the death of their son, Beau Biden, though it's really sort of launched this addiction spiral that this case centered around. President Biden very much focused on his family throughout all of this. You'll remember, he has been traveling back and forth to Europe. He is due to return to Europe again tomorrow for the G-7 summit. But throughout all of this, he's remained in very close touch with his son, remained very concerned for his son's well-being. And I think his decision to return to Wilmington later today really does go to show how important he believes holding his son close at this very difficult moment will be.",

Like I was -- I was telling someone earlier, like President Biden never really even came into play for me. Because his name was only brought up once during the trial and that's when I -- that's when it kind of sunk in a little bit, oh, wow, this is -- this is the -- the sitting president's son who is on trial. And so that was -- yes, that was kind of hard to know, OK, what the trial is about now. But you kind of put that out of your mind and after that -- after it was brought up, again, I did -- I did put it out on my mind. I never, never really added the two together. (END AUDIO FEED)",

      "sentences": "So it's fascinating and rare to get a glimpse inside the jury room like we just got from Juror number 10.A couple of things jumped out at me. First of all, the juror said that when they took their first straw poll yesterday, it was 6-6. And then he said he came back today and it was 1-11. And eventually they got to unanimity. That shows me that the jury did what juries are supposed to do. They kept open minds. They consider the evidence. They interacted. And they reached unanimity. And this is why so few juries, in fact, hang. You might think more juries would have a hard time getting to unanimity. But the fact is they almost all do. I also thought it was really interesting when the -- when the special counsel, David Weiss, came out to speak, he stressed the word \"choice.\" And that was consistent with the theme that the prosecution made at the trial itself. I think David Weiss knew and I think the juror confirmed the evidence of Hunter Bidens guilt just in a straightforward, objective way, was overwhelming. The concern the prosecutors had was will sympathy enter into this so much. And so they stressed, yes, he was an addict, but you, yes, he was still a grown man who made choices. And it sounds like that argument resonated, based on what we heard from the juror.",

I mean, they -- they really coalesce around one another. And in some respects, they're going to be -- tonight and in the days ahead, they're going to be accepting. It really is a moment of resignation to the reality of it. I think they knew this was coming. Just statistically, the number of federal defendants that go to a -- that go to trial and ultimately are acquitted are very few. So they knew going into this that the chances were small. But what you've heard since then is this emphatic point, from Joe Biden and even from Hunter Biden, that they are grateful for the family that they've got. And I think when it comes to Joe Biden, you see that seam between his family life and his political life. And he's trying to acknowledge both of those facts in his statement. Talking about supporting his son, but also underlining -- and this has obvious political resonance -- that he accepts the jury's verdict and he accepts the sanctity of the judicial process.",

But I think what a lot of people took from what Joe Biden said was that he was going to let it stand.

In many ways, he spent decades in politics without that being the thing that was so much in the foreground. But now, here you have in a way that really, you might never have predicted a decade ago, you have a case that touches his own family, in which there is an obvious natural person and, I think, social pressure to say, well, is there some way in which I can mitigate his suffering? And he has come out and saying, quite definitively, that he would not pardon him. I mean, in that interview, he didn't prevaricate. He said it very definitively, no, he wouldn't do it. I think his statements so far have underscored that.",

They thought the real issue to them was whether the case should be brought but realized that they had sworn to a duty to pay attention to the law and the facts and reach a verdict that was righteous with the charges that were brought against him. Again, we all know that the charges would not have been brought if the plea agreement that had been reached some months ago had gone forward. But the disagreement between Abbe Lowell and the prosecutor, Mr. Weiss, became public in front of a judge and a judge is going to say, I'm not taking this plea, we'll just go to trial, and that's basically what happened.",

But this is a case where he accepted responsibility basically from the beginning. And as a result of which, I think a judge has a reason to deviate downwards from what the guidelines range may be and give him maybe a year and a day. A year and a day is probably the best prison sentence you can get. Because you don't do day for day like you would for a year. With a year and a day, you do about eight months and then you get out and go into a halfway house. His sentence will wait, most likely, until after the tax charges are completed in Los Angeles though.",
