Now, according to the prosecutor's office, that they allege that Menendez and his wife have received hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes that they had done -- then used to help three New Jersey businessmen and the government of Egypt. This investigation has been going on for several years and sources have told CNN that they have sent out rings of subpoenas to people seeking information about some of these businessmen and these relationships.Now, one of the businessmen is someone who has known Menendez's wife for a long time. He is someone that had obtained the exclusive right to export and certify Halal meat to Egypt. That has been a focus of this investigation. And another one of the businessmen is a New Jersey developer. And prosecutors were asking questions about him, his communications with the senator and his wife. So, as you said, though, this is the second time in ten years that Senator Menendez has been charged with bribery and corruption. The first time he did go to trial to fight those charges, it ended in a mistrial and then the judge had thrown out some of the case - some of the remaining charges, and the Department of Justice decided not to retry him. But now this is a second time he is facing criminal charges, bribery charges, for allegedly receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars, him and his wife facing these charges. Now, I've reached out to his attorney. I've not yet heard a comment. But Menendez was on CNN in April saying that he was confident that this investigation would end without any charges. But he is indicted today and we'll learn more from the U.S. attorney's office, who will be holding a press conference about two hours from now. John.",

The administration is now deploying hundreds of additional military personnel to the southern border because of the latest surge of migrants. Nearly 9,000 crossings were recorded in the past 24 hours. This new video that we're showing you is -- shows the moment a migrant family pulls a child through the barbed wire essentially, and pulls other - and others are coming through that barbed wire as well, right in front of authorities in Eagle Pass, Texas. The mayor of that city saying President Biden bears, quote, some responsibility for the crisis. Let's go there. CNN's Ed Lavandera is in Eagle Pass for us an he's joining us now.

      "sentences": "Well, Kate, the scenes here in Eagle Pass dramatically different from what we saw 24 hours ago. This area of the Rio Grande on the edge of Eagle Pass has been the area where we've seen thousands of people crossing in the last few days. But this morning really dramatically different. And we've been able to see across the Rio Grande here. A much heavier presence on that side this morning of Mexican law enforcement, state police, perhaps some local police and definitely some Mexican military vehicles that have been going up and down that area where so many migrants have been staging.In fact, there's really just been a handful of people crossing this morning. In fact, you can see out there in the little island in the middle of the river, there's a group of three migrants that have come by. You'll notice that two of them are wearing life jackets. There was a group of Texas state law enforcement on an air boat that went over to that little island just moments ago, before we came on air, and threw those two life jackets to two of those migrants so that they could walk safely through the river over here on to this side. And this is clearly a sign of just how dangerous and desperate the situation has been. In the last three days, two people have died, swept away, drowned in the current of the river. And one of those victims included a three-year-old boy. So, this is the area, Kate, where we saw hundreds showing up yesterday. And you can see all this razor wire. And many times they have come across, they're standing there just at the bottom of the river's edge trying to figure out how to get through the razor wire and turn themselves in either to state police here in Texas or to border authorities. So, we're trying to figure out exactly what is going on, on the other side because the mayor here in Eagle Pass says they've been bracing for this number and this magnitude of migrants crossing here into Eagle Pass to continue. The mayor told us last night that he was in a meeting with federal law enforcement here in the area and they told them that there were 50,000 to 60,000 migrants entering southern Mexico. And the question becomes where exactly are all of these people going to go? And, of course, this is very -- it's almost impossible to predict really exactly what happens. There's many things that could happen to large groups of migrants as they make their way through Mexico. They disperse into different areas. Maybe they didn't end up making the journey all together. But it's the kind of news that local officials along the southern border here are bracing for as they try to prepare and get a sense of what might be coming in the days and weeks ahead. Kate.",
