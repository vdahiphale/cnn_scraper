Here's what he tweeted. Quote, shared power curbs the worst excesses of both parties, therefore I recommend voting for a Republican Congress given that the presidency is Democratic. That is a contradiction, by the way, contradiction of what he tweeted just a few months ago when he wrote, quote, for Twitter to deserve public trust it must be politically neutral, which effectively means upsetting the far right and the far left equally.Let's talk to probably the only tech journalist who has interviewed both Elon Musk on her podcast and John Fetterman recently on a number of these issues. \"On with Kara Swisher\" is the pod.

He said he's always voted Democrat along -- also along with those tweets. And this year he voted Republican.I tweeted back at him. So that means - because he wants everyone to be equal, I guess. If there's a Democratic president, you know, the House and Senate -- the Senate should be Republican. And then I tweeted back, because apparently he lives in Texas, so that means he's voting for Beto, right? And so it's just - he's just playing games.

You've even heard members of the Republican Party on our air say that.And she said -- she didn't say, we want to own the libs, or that liberals are this and liberals are that. What she said was, she wants a strong Republican Party. There is -- there are two different messages, and two different things happening on the Republican side and on the Democratic side.
