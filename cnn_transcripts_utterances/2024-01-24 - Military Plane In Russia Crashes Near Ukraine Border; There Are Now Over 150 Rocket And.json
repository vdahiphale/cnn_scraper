Russia pointing the finger at Ukraine, following adeadly plane crash, and American military escalation in the Middle East, both raising global tensions, which are already sky high. Also ahead, a mother on trial in connection with murders committed by her son. Why prosecutor says she bears some responsibility for her teenage son's actions. And later, out with the North, in with the South. The results of the New Hampshire primary are in and all eyes are now on South Carolina. Here are from one group of voters who say they'll stick with Trump even if he gets convicted. Hello everyone, live from New York, I'm Bianna Golodryga. Zain is off today. You are watching \"One World\". We have two major escalations in conflicts across the globe to bring you. First in Russia, where a military plane carrying 74 people crashed near the border with Ukraine. The governor of the Belgorod region says no one survived. Russia claims 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war were on board and says Ukraine anti-aircraft missiles brought the plane down. Ukraine claims missiles were on that plane. And in Iraq, the U.S. has carried out airstrikes against Iranian-backed militias. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin says the strikes targeted three facilities in response to increased attacks on U.S. forces. CNN's Oren Liebermann following the developments from the Pentagon for us, and Matthew Chance is in London. We begin with Matthew and the news out of that plane crash in Russia. Do we know right now who was on board that flight? We've heard from the Russians. We have yet to hear from the Ukrainians.",

      "sentences": "The Ukrainians are being pretty tight-lipped about whether they even shot this plane down,although the fact that it was in that border region, the Belgorod region, which has been an active war zone increasingly over the past several months as Ukrainian forces try to deprive Russia of the freedom of movement inside its own territory and its own airspace, makes it very possible that this was, indeed, some kind of anti-aircraft strike. Indeed, Russia state television showed the twisted metal wreckage of the aircraft. You can see there are shrapnel marks inside some of the metal panels which are, we're told, consistent with the impact of sort of anti- air missile munitions. But, you know, we shall see what information comes out. Much more controversial is what was the cargo of that plane. The Russians have been pretty clear that they say there were people on board, that more -- over 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war, that being ferried back home, essentially to take part in a prisoner swap. They were going to be released pretty soon. The Ukrainians have cast some doubt on that. They haven't categorically denied that, but they've cast doubt on it, saying that their intelligence suggests it was missiles on board the aircraft. If that's the case, obviously that would have been a high priority target for the Ukrainian air defenses who are trying to prevent these kinds of munitions getting to the front line. But the truth of the matter at the moment is pretty unclear.",

So we have no confirmation of that. It's just what the Russians are saying at this point. Matthew Chance, thank you so much, and do keep us posted if any developments happen there. We want to turn now to the U.S. airstrikes on militia targets in Iraq. Oren Liebermann is at the Pentagon. And Oren, this strike was in response to an attack on a major base in Iraq on Saturday. We've now seen over 150 rocket and missile strikes at U.S. troops based in Iraq and Syria since the Israel-Hamas war began. So, things continue to escalate, not de-escalate.

So, on the surface, this was a big night for Donald Trump. He beat Nikki Haley by double-digit margins here -- 55 percent to 43 percent. But if you look under the surface, there are still some problems for Donald Trump going into this, specifically with independent voters and whether or not he can win and expand to a wider electorate. Last night, we heard from Nikki Haley in her concession speech, where she said this race is far from over. There are dozens of states left to go. Up next, obviously, her home state of South Carolina, where right now she's polling some 30 points behind Donald Trump. You still got a month to go before that. Having said all of that, though, is she right? Is it far from over, or is it more of a done deal at this point?",

But he is functionally the incumbent in this race, so that should be taken with a grain of salt. Nikki Haley's campaign is pointing towards states that have open primaries, where independent voters can participate. That is a better gauge, tends to be a better gauge of general election success than these closed partisan primaries where, especially in the deep south where Donald Trump is expected to romp to victory. While it was, you know, 10, 11 point margin is significant, it did, as you pointed out, show some significant weaknesses in the -- in, in any plausible Trump general election coalition among independents and moderates, and those are the folks who ultimately decide who wins elect win elections in America.",

And one thing Haley could have at her time, as long as there is money, is time, i.e., the fever not -- doesn't break, because Donald Trump's got a hardcore support that's not going anywhere. But people start to look at the court cases. Maybe there's a conviction. Maybe he continues to underperform with moderates and independents and folks start to say, you know what, this guy is not the best general election candidate. He's the most polarizing candidate possibly, imagine he is most damaged candidate and he would take country in a dramatically different direction, one that's not constitutionally conservative but is autocrat- adjacent.

This is about a constitutionally settled right that don't -- many of those justices affirmed in their hearings, that have been in place for fifty years. And so, that rollback has really created massive headwinds for the Republican Party but they've got to blame themselves because it was part of their agenda for a long time to come.

I concludethat there is a basic joint interest of both Hamas and Israel with the deal. The main problem, and it's the most important issue, is a gap, a huge gap that exists between the two parties, between Israel and Hamas. Israel -- its basic interest is actually a ceasefire. Israel wants to oppose the current fighting but to preserve a capability to return into the conflict after a month, two months, even more, in order to implement its basic original goal of eradicating Hamas capabilities in the military and the regime aspect. While on the other hand, Hamas' basic interest is actually to put an end to the war. They really demand the guarantees -- international guarantees to put an end to this war and later to bring Israel to withdraw its forces from Gaza Strip. And I assess, Bianna, that both parties can reach an interim agreement in between of beginning the process with ceasefire, then maybe to develop it to a more -- to a longer arrangement. But we must remember, the whole process is very fragile, very unstable. And you know, right now, I do think that the likelihood for broad long-term agreement is quite low.",

I want to ask you about the broader picture and concern about escalation in the region as a whole. We've continued to see more attacks by the Houthis, despite the U.S. along with the U.K. also firing on their facilities, concern early on in this war about what Hezbollah will do. And now over the weekend, we saw attacks continue on U.S. bases in Iraq and Syria. All of these proxies of Iran. The U.S. responding, as well. But given the sort of whack-a-mole situation ,we see the Middle East turning into, does this benefit Hamas at all? Because I remember early on there was reporting that Hamas leadership was disappointed that Hezbollah didn't join in the fight right away. So, does all of this regional instability benefit Hamas, or does it put more pressure on them to bring it into this war?",

After so many decades of neglecting them, they showed the whole world that they stand in the center, in the core of the regional conflict in the Middle East. But as you mentioned before, and it's correct, many of Hamas leaders and the Palestinian leaders, they do afraid that all kinds of conflicts, for example, the conflict in the Red Sea in Yemen, develops their own self-fade dynamics and can actually be the main focus the original crisis and not the war in Gaza. So, they afraid that, for example, if a war in the Northern arena in Lebanon will start, or even in other arenas like Iraq and Syria, it can really cause the damage to the interest of the Palestinians to show that they are the real sources of the instability in the Middle East and not other arenas. But it seems right now that the -- mainly,  crisis in the Red Sea, in Yemen, this crisis right now has its own dynamics. And I do think that even if there will be a deal or will be a kind of more contained conflict between Gaza and Israel, maybe the other conflicts, and mainly the conflict in Yemen, will develop and even can be much, much bigger than today.",
