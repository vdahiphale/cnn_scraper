Monday, he'll be in York, Pennsylvania, to talk about the economy, that's Make America Wealthy Again, Tuesday, Howell, Michigan, that as a suburb of Detroit, he'll be talking about crime and safety, So Make America Safe Again. Wednesday, Asheboro, North Carolina, that is Make America Secure Again, or, excuse me, that one is Make America Strong Again. They're going to be talking about national security. Then he's going to go to the border in Arizona on Thursday, Friday, back to the economy in Las Vegas, then he has a rally in Glendale, Arizona, on Friday night, all part of Make America Great Again. as you noted, he's going to have various surrogates in Chicago giving press conferences. Today, it is Rick Scott and Ron Johnson, two senators. They want them focusing on the economy. But even if they are trying to get Donald Trump to focus on the issues, particularly every single day, a separate issue, just a reminder, these are not rallies. These are what are being internally called messaging events. That means smaller crowds, smaller venues, and a way to have Donald Trump just stick to the message. But even with those kind of runway that they are giving him, Donald Trump is still likely to veer off course because that's what we've seen time and time again. This is him in Pennsylvania over the weekend. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Have you heard her laugh? That is the laugh of a crazy person. As soon as she laughs, the election is over. I'm a better looking person than Kamala. It was a coup of a president. This was a coup, and they stole the presidency of the United States from him.

They are still clamoring for an agenda, for problems and solutions, to be told more specifically what your vision is. And that means Tim Walz, too how are you guys merging? Your visions.

I think she has to be very firm in what her position is, and she articulates that very well, that she wants a ceasefire, she wants to bring the hostages home.My advice for those uncommitted voters is you do more detriment to your movement by attempting to step on her night. If in fact we see those protests in this arena, which I don't think we'll have a lot of -- there have been a lot of things going on behind the scenes with Mignon Moore and Leah Daughtry and Donna Brazile having those conversations, having those meetings happen with those uncommitted delegates, et cetera. But I think you do more damage than anything else to your movement and what you want to do. And at the end of the day, I think that this is going to be a celebration. I think you'll have some protests that go on on the outside. The media will cover it as such, and let those people's voices be heard. But the leader of the party, and this is what I tell people, there are two things you need to know. We haven't had a more Zionist president in the history of America than Joe Biden. There is no space between the Democratic Party and Israel. Kamala Harris, there still is no space, but she also is talking about the plight of the Palestinians in a way that has a level of empathy in the fact that we don't want any more Jewish babies dying, we don't want any more Palestinian babies dying. That is the message that she is saying. And so with that being said, I think that we can lift her up and say on this issue, if you care about this issue, the way that you are marching and protesting, do you want Kamala Harris or do you want someone whose son-in-law said that Gaza will be Trump property? Those are the contrasts we have. It's a delicate issue, but I'm here to drink Casamigos and celebrate Kamala Harris. And so hopefully that's what we do all week.",

And I think that that resonates both, I think will certainly resonate with Democrats in the audience here tonight. But I think also with a lot of swing voters who are watching, who are kind of looking at what do I want the next four years look like? I think he will make a case that's rooted in what he's been able to achieve. But will also crucially be about passing the baton to her and saying, you know, this is what's at stake and here's what she's going to be able to do to carry forward these values that we, as Americans care about. And the other thing I would just say about his remarks tonight, I think there's been a lot of discussion of policy and kind of how he's going to talk about his own accomplishments. But I think another thing that is going to be on display tonight is this core sense of decency that is a fundamental contrast with Donald Trump in the way that he -- the way he conducts himself. But he's also going to remind people that Joe Biden is somebody who made ultimately a selfless decision to hand over the nomination that he believes Kamala Harris is the right person to carry forward the values that we care about and I think having that kind of innate sense of decency on display tonight is going to be really powerful thing for Democrats. That also says to swing voters, hey, what do you want the future of this country to look like? Do you want to look like Donald Trump, or do you want it to look like Joe Biden?",

How do you think that she should try to define herself this week when you look at those numbers? S.E. CUPP, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Yes, that's what I was saying. I mean, people especially in the all-important swing states, I talk to them all the time. They want to know how this government, Harris-Walz administration will solve their problems. And they want specifics, not just on inflation and on the border, but on housing prices, and mortgage rates, the cost of goods, all kinds of things, abortion. What are you going to do specifically and listen, you're right. She's only been there a little while, but I'm a prosecutor, he's a criminal, that's not a policy. That's a bumper sticker. And again, this is a week to celebrate Democrats, but it's also an opportunity to lay out a message for people who are still waiting to hear that. And let me just add one thing, I think Kate Bedingfield is totally right that Joe Biden will talk about decency tonight. That's important. That's a great contrast. However, this is just on a side, you can take it as you will. But I don't know why Bill Clinton is still at these DNCs. He is a problem. He is a bad look for Democrats.
