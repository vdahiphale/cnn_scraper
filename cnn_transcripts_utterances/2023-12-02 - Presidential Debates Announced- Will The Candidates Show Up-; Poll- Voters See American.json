      "sentences": "The politics of perception. I'm Michael Smerconish in Philadelphia.If it were still the economy stupid, then Joe Biden's presidency would be in much better shape. Something else is at play here. Yes, inflation is souring Americans but by many measures, the economy is booming. The economy is clearly growing, the Gross Domestic Product is up 5.2 percent in the third quarter even faster than previously estimated. If GDP is rising, the economy is considered to be in solid shape and the nation moving forward. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rally this week to a new high for the year. Wages had been losing ground to inflation for two years but since May, wages have returned to outpacing inflation. And unemployment is at an historic low. The U.S. unemployment rate has been below 4 percent for 21 straight months, the longest stretch since the late 1960s. How about gas prices? Gas prices have fallen or remain steady for 10 weeks. You barely read about that anywhere, but you can rest assured if they were headed in the other -- it'd be on a loop with videos of pump prices. The holiday season, that's another barometer it's looking promising for retailers. According to data from Adobe Analytics, lured by the deep discounts on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, U.S. shoppers spent a whopping $38 billion over Thanksgiving weekend. That's a jump of 7.8 percent over last year, outstripping the predicted 5.4 percent. But still, President Biden receiving no political dividends. As the \"Washington Post\" recently noted that disconnect between a booming economy and how Americans feel about it appears to be widening at a critical time ahead of next year's presidential election. It is also shaping up to be a key liability for the White House even as its policies are bolstering job creation and business investments. In a variety of national battleground polls, President Biden trails former President Donald Trump. As politico recently pointed out, among the latest surveys this month from 13 different pollsters by disposition is worse than their previous polls in all the two of them. Might it be that perception has overtaken reality? Consider the case of the Big Mac. Allison Morrow here at CNN was among those who told the story of Topher Olive. A year ago olive went to a McDonald's in Post Falls Idaho and ordered a limited edition smoky double quarter pounder, BLT with fries and a sprite. Total cost for this novelty item was $16.10. He posted the receipt on TikTok. It went viral and keeps being recirculated on TikTok, Reddit and YouTube. Then a recent YouTube video incorrectly reported that it was a Big Mac meal. And more than 1.7 million viewed that video containing false information as to the price. The narrative became that the cost of a fast food meal was upwards of $16. And by the way, the price of a Big Mac meal on Biden's watch, it has gone up but not like that. The viral story reached the White House Office of Digital Strategy. But as one source told \"The Washington Post,\" what are we supposed to do? Tell the President or Chuck Schumer to send a tweet saying hey, most Big Macs aren't that expensive? It would look ridiculous. I felt obliged to do some field research this week. My Big Mac meal in the Philly burbs, it cost me $10.09 before tax. The White House has struggled to set the record straight and the perception is impacting even the President's base. And to \"The New York Times\" with this headline, Even most Biden voters don't see a thriving economy.\" \"The Times\" noted that a majority of those who backed President Biden in 2020 say today's economy is fair or poor. Ordinarily a bad omen for incumbents seeking reelection. Part of the explanation might be due to the loss of COVID related relief. While inflation has subsided, prices are still high groceries for example of 25 percent since the pandemic. The resumption of evictions and student loan payments have led to less disposable income. And credit card debt is now at a record trillion dollars. Fifty-seven percent of Americans say they don't have a spare $1,000 for an emergency. The resulting national funk has had an impact. It's not just that we think things are worse than the data suggests, we're also no longer confident in the American dream, where the dream is defined as getting ahead or doing better than your parents and grandparents generation. [09:05:18] That's the findings from a Wall Street Journal NORC survey which included two questions, if people work hard, are they likely to get ahead in America? And will your generation do better than the generation before you? Well, the results as to one of those questions shocking. In 2012, 53 percent of Americans said the American dream still holds true. And just last year, when the journal asked a similar question, whether Americans who work hard were likely to get ahead, 68 percent said yes. In the current poll, that numbers down to 36 percent. In other words, it's been cut nearly in half. So is it perception or is it reality? I want to know what you think. I want to compare results of ours to the Journal. Go to smerconish.com, vote on today's poll question. Agree or disagree, if people work hard, they are likely to get ahead in America. Aaron Zitner joins me now. He's covered this data for the Wall Street Journal where he's a writer and editor in the Washington bureau focusing on how politics are driven by demographic and economic change. He wrote the piece, \"Voters see American Dream slipping out of reach.\" Aaron, great to see you. People tend to think that our best days are behind us, right? AARON ZITNER, REPORTER &amp; EDITOR, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Yes. And that's what's so dour about this poll finding. For a while we've known that people just aren't feeling the good economic numbers as your, you know, a deputy described there. But when we get to the idea that the American dream is now slipping away or that our children's generation, this is an NBC finding, they found a record low 19 percent of Americans saying that our children's generation will have it better than our generation, that speaks to something more pervasive and possibly more durable. It's the sense that something structural has changed in the economy, and that were more fragile, and that this is a longer term problem than say, inflation, which tends to be transitory.",

And two that are particularly relevant in the Israeli case are, one, the warning was outlandish. And two, and this is the most important, it was warning of something that had never happened before. We call it first occurrence syndrome. If something has never happened before, even though all the evidence looks good, decision makers will routinely reject it. Because in the back of their mind, they're thinking, well, that's never happened. Terrorists flying over the wall in hang gliders to land and shoot up kibbutz had never happened.
