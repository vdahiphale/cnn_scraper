      "sentences": "And a shocking new report reveals just how many species are near extinction.Kate is out. I'm John Berman with Sara Sidner. This is CNN News Central. President Biden has an important meeting at the White House with Jordan's King Abdullah. The meeting comes as Israel Defense Forces say they have carried out a series of strikes in Southern Gaza in the city of Rafah. Now, as part of those strikes, Israel says it has rescued two hostages who are now safely back in Israel. Palestinian medical officials, controlled by Hamas, say that more than 100 Palestinians have been killed in that operation. This strike, though, does raise questions about what will happen in the future in and around Rafah, which is a city where Israel has told Palestinians, hundreds of thousands, to flee to. Will Israel continue even intensify operations around there? President Biden, of course, has been speaking with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He has warned Israel about launching a ground assault without a credible and executable plan to ensure civilian safety. CNN's Arlette Saenz is at the White House with the very latest. What are the expectations for today's meeting, Arlette?",

Let's bring in CNN Chief International Anchor and Correspondent Christiane Amanpour.Christiane, our reporting from yesterday was about two thirds of Biden's phone call with Benjamin Netanyahu was about the hostage releases. And we've seen those releases happen. They were very emotional. Do you think that the operation will help sort of reinforce Israel's current strategy, which is all war, or is there a chance this is another chance for the United States to push for this targeted special operations like the one that we just saw that ended in the release of two hostages, in the rescue of two hostages?",

      "sentences": "Well, you're hearing, Sarah, President Biden and the Biden administration and most of their allies now increasingly call for restraint and not to go over the top, as you've heard, Biden himself has said, and for credible programs or rather methods to protect civilians. The Palestinian authorities say that some hundred or so civilians, people, were killed during the air part of the rescue of these two Israeli hostages.Now, obviously, the release is incredibly good news for Israel and for the families. They have since October 7th put the release of their hostages front and center, even over and above the defeat of Hamas. They want the hostages released first and foremost, even those who support the war against Hamas. So, this is a very, very important issue. Equally important is the idea of the day after, which is what Biden presumably is going to be talking to King Abdullah of Jordan today. And Jordan and Egypt are very concerned that any further Israeli operation, particularly this close to the Egyptian border, Rafah, is going to cause potentially an exodus. Egypt has now bolstered its military defenses near the Rafah border, and they do not want any excuse for any forcible expulsion of Palestinians either into Egypt or the other side into Jordan. And that puts into question, they say, these countries, their peace agreements with Israel. And this is becoming very, very fundamentally important. And at the same time, other Arab allies who have made normalization deals with Israel, for instance, the UAE, this morning have told CNN that the only way to end this. And the only way to have successful negotiations is for irreversible progress to that two-state solution.",

      "sentences": "Well, not just internationally, but in the United States as well. You have seen the popular discontent in the United States with the level of killing and death in Gaza. And if you remember, if you go all the way back to October 7th, the weight of international sympathy was with Israel after the awful slaughter of what we understand to be 1,200 Israeli civilians and there were soldiers as well, but also the kidnap of more than 200. And this really was very important for the world to understand what happened inside Israel.But the minute it started to show up in terms of exponentially greater deaths inside Gaza, that has caused a shifting of public opinion around the world against the Israeli operation, against the Israeli counteroffensive, right up into, you know, most of the world leaders who are, including President Biden, who's saying over and again, to take care of civilians. Now, Israel says that it does what it can to minimize civilian casualties. The number of deaths in Gaza, according to the Palestinian health authorities, is approaching approximately 28,000. Now, think about that, 28,000 dead, including thousands of children. Analysts say it is the swiftest and most, you know, deadly military operation in modern history in terms of that number of casualties. So, it is incredibly, you know, very, very, very, very difficult for the Palestinian people, but also for the rest of the world on how they try to navigate this war, because many people and allies also want to see the inability of Hamas to threaten Israel in the way that it did on October 7th. So, this is very, very, very difficult, but the humanitarian fallout is what's causing the most anxiety, heartbreak, political backlash in the rest of the world right now.",

I mean, they view that kind of invitation, encouragement from the front runner of the United States for the Republican nomination to be literally insane. I mean, for the presidential candidate of the United States to say that kind of thing publicly while President Putin is having an interview in order to put down his lines of negotiation, which essentially are negotiation on his terms only over Ukraine, for the leading Republican candidate who people must take at his word. Nobody is trying to guess what he's saying. They're taking him at his word. It's caused a huge amount of anxiety, as you can imagine.The usually quite careful and diplomatic secretary general of NATO, Jens Stoltenberg, came out immediately and dismissed this comment and said they expect any U.S. president, no matter of what party or who that would be, to abide by the rules of NATO and the Article 5. So, the idea of -- I mean, literally he used the word encourage Russia to do what the hell it wants in Europe is terrifying for Europeans and the rest of the world, especially in the defense of democracy and the international world order, which the U.S. has since World War II led.",

And here they're asking the justices to intervene on this question of whether presidential immunity should shield Trump from the federal election subversion case brought by Special Counsel Jack Smith.Now, Trump has lost on this issue at the trial court level. And then last week, the D.C. Circuit, so a court of appeals, also handed down a pretty robust opinion rejecting this argument. So, today, he is expected to go to the Supreme Court. And it's going to be interesting to see how this plays out, Sara, because if you talk to legal experts, even sources in and around the Trump legal team, they say that, look, this issue, this argument, this is not one of Trump's stronger arguments. It's unclear if the justices would ultimately want to take this case up. And even if they did, if Trump would win, there's a lot of skepticism again, even within Trump world, that he would ultimately prevail. But this is just as much about the constitutional questions. It is about timing, because we know they are trying, pretty much everything they can, to delay this federal election subversion case until after the 2024 election. Now, if Trump is re-elected, he could make that case. And the one Evan was just talking about, the Mar-Alai documents case, go away. So, what we're looking at right now is not just what the Supreme Court does, but how long it takes them to do it. Because the longer it takes, the less likely it is that this case can go to trial, because we really need all the appeals on this issue to be resolved before that case can begin.",

It doesn't sound like there was any evidence of disease outside the prostate.But what he's suffering now are consequences or the sequela of the surgery itself. We don't really have a lot of detail from his original hospitalization or any detail of the long, almost two-week hospitalization at Walter Reed at the beginning of January. So, it's not really possible to know exactly what complications might have ensued. But his current situation is almost certainly related to his original procedure, and/or maybe even the procedure that he had to correct the complication during his January hospitalization. I really feel for the secretary. These are difficult times. It sounds like his physicians are very optimistic about his overall prognosis, which is the most important long-term information we have. But for now, he's sick. We do know that he transferred authority to his deputy when he was admitted to the hospital yesterday, and that seems like the right thing to do. It's hard to imagine being in the chain of command for the United States military and being a patient in an intensive care unit. So, I think that was the right decision to make.",
