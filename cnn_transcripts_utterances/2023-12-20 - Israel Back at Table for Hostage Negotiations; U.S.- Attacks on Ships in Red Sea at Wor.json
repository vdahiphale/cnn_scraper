      "sentences": "Hey, it's 9 am here in Atlanta. I am Lynda Kinkade. Welcome to \"Connect the World\". A source tells CNN thatIsrael is back at the table and has brought forward proposals for pausing fighting in exchange for Hamas releasing hostages held in Gaza. We'll be live in Tel Aviv with more in just a moment. Plus, the ruling from Colorado Supreme Court could throw Donald Trump's hopes for a second presidential turn into jeopardy and then the search for survivors in subzero temperatures following the deadliest earthquake there in over a decade. Israel is proposing another pause in fighting in Gaza in exchange for the release of more hostages. But a source tells CNN at the moment a deal is not close and the proposals are just the start of negotiations. Now Hamas-run Health Ministry reports at least 46 people were killed more than 100 wounded in Israeli attacks around the Jabalia Refugee Camp in Northern Gaza. You're seeing damage from previous attacks here. The World Food Program says an aid convoy from Jordan has crossed into Gaza through Israeli territory for the first time since the October 7th terror attacks. It entered through Karim Shalom (ph) crossing. Aid group says half of Gaza's population is starving. Our Will Ripley is following the developments and connecting us now from Jerusalem. Good to have you with us, Will. So Israel is talking about a potential pause in the war to negotiate the release of hostages. We know that Hamas's top leader is in Cairo for these talks. What are the expectations, Will?",

      "sentences": "I just want to pause for a moment to reflect on what you just said, half of the population ofGaza starving. That's more than a million people. You have 85 percent of the more than 2 million people in Gaza displaced from their homes right now. And you have hostages that are being held in conditions that their families believe are as about as close to hell on earth as you can get. So there's really a sense of growing urgency here in Tel Aviv and growing pressure not only domestically, but also internationally for Israel to hammer out a deal to once again stop the fighting to allow desperately needed supplies in. When we saw images over the weekend of aid trucks people are climbing on them because they were so desperate to get their hands on the few scraps of food, medicine and other supplies that remain of course the shortage of fuel as well. So they need the aid. Hamas knows that and Hamas knows that Israel really needs to get its hostages back. Now the numbers are round 128, 129 hostages remaining. Of those 108 of them are believed to be alive, the other 21 are believed to be dead but their bodies are being held in Gaza. Israel wants them all back and is willing to stop the fighting for one maybe even two weeks to make that happen. Now Hamas has said in the past that the hostages will only be released if there's a full out permanent ceasefire, essentially the end of the war. Israel says that's not in the table until Hamas leadership is removed. That has been their objective from day one. But what would this pause look like? Initially what Israel is offering according to CNN sources is a one week pause in the fighting in exchange for some 40 hostages released the priority being the women, the elderly and anybody who's in need of urgent care. Now in exchange what Hamas is set to one and they haven't agreed to this deal by the way, but they want their prisoners to be released by Israel. And they don't want women and teenagers like last time. They want in their words more heavy duty prisoners than before perhaps people who are actually facing criminal charges or had been convicted of criminal charges here in Israel because a lot of people you know, from Gaza are essentially being held without any charges and they can be held indefinitely without charges. So it's a very complex situation. The last hostage release deal Lynda took more than a month to hammer out. So getting anything done this holiday week according to an Israeli official speaking to CNN very unlikely they're nowhere near a final deal at the moment. But at least they're talking and that for Israel certainly is a big shift from the tactics that we've seen from Israel in these recent weeks of fighting. And the IDF really stepping up and intensifying its ground efforts there including the accidental shooting death of three Israeli hostages over the weekend, Lynda.",

The West Bank is under Israeli military occupation. It's also believed to be home to almost three quarters of a million Settlers. Israeli civilians are living in the occupied territories. Settlers consider this part of their biblical homeland and are expanding into Palestinian territories. Even though the U.N. Security Council considers their presence illegal, yet Settlers are integral to Israel's security plan in the occupied territories as Israel Defense Force reservists and settlement security squads. Responding the IDF says the security threats in settlements, towns and villages. Palestinians told CNN they consider armed Settlers a greater threat than ever before. Their remit from the IDF is blurring the lines as Settlers encroach on Palestinian land like here, and the Palestinian village of --where there's a settlement at the top of the hill. In this video, you see men in military fatigues. The idea of equips both civilian settlers, security squads and soldiers in the region. As you can see here, it's almost impossible to differentiate. They point their rifles at residence and then they shoot according to eyewitnesses. CNN shared the images we gathered in the West Bank with a senior IDF official who was unable to tell us who here is in the IDF and who is not. We asked how then are Palestinians expected to differentiate. The official told CNN there have been cases of reservists who did not act in accordance with Army standards, adding there is no place in the IDF for such behavior. Every case that breaches army standards will be investigated. Palestinians the official said should contact their local brigade.

      "sentences": "The U.S. and its allies are scrambling to respond to a series of attacks by the Iran-backed Houthirebels in Yemen, who have launched over 100 attacks. According to a U.S. military official using missiles and drones on commercial vessels in the Southern Red Sea over the last four weeks alone causing a dramatic impact to international shipping and international commerce, because of the impact that these attacks have had on these vessels operating there. Many companies have said that they're actually pausing their operations in the Red Sea because of the threat of coming under fire by these Houthi militants. So the U.S. and its allies now trying to find a way to respond that does not involve striking the Houthis directly in Yemen, something that the U.S. has been trying to avoid over the last several weeks. And as a response to the attacks to date, the U.S. now says that they're going to be setting up an international coalition of maritime forces that will essentially be in the region and in the Red Sea available to respond and help commercial vessels if they need it. Some of the vessels or some of the ships, I should say they will be escorting these commercial vessels if the situation warrants it. And of course, we have also seen the U.S. shoot down a number of the missiles and drones that the Houthis have launched, targeting these commercial ships in recent weeks. But it remains unclear whether the Houthis are going to be deterred by this new maritime coalition. They have said that they are going to continue their attacks on these commercial vessels in solidarity they say with the Palestinians and an opposition to these rallies. However, it's important to note that many of these ships that they have attacked, if not most of them, actually have no ties to Israel at all. And the U.S. says that the Houthis have just been attacking these ships opportunistically and they have been taking advantage of course of the U.S. and allied presence in the area. They want to try to bolster their international reputation and presence there. And they think they will be able to get attention by continuing to target these vessels. So the U.S. facing a very big problem here grows calls for them to strike the Houthis directly. But at this point, this maritime coalition, according to the Secretary of Defense, they say is going to hopefully help ease the problem. Natasha Bertrand, CNN at the Pentagon.",

You might remember hospitalizing, the referee, and there are criminal proceedings that are still ongoing as a result of that. Football was suspended at every level in Turkey after that. It came back yesterday. And then this happened in just a second match on the schedule. I think it's fair to say there's anger, there's embarrassment. There are a whole lot of questions about what happens next in Turkish football. How are the club presidents getting this level of control and feeling that they can impact what is happening on the pitch and that's what we're going to be discussing a little bit more in a couple of minutes in \"World Sports\".",
