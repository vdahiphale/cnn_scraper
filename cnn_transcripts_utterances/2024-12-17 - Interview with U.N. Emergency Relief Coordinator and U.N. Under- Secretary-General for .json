Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stepped into Southern Syria, occupying even more Syrian land and saying they'll stay there until they can ensure Israel's security. While in Gaza, Hamas says a ceasefire-hostage deal is possible. And that comes amid catastrophic death and destruction that's still raining down on the enclave. Syria's new leaders are pushing for legitimacy on the world stage. Ahmed al-Sharaa, who's head of HTS, a designated terrorist group by the U.S., has been meeting with United Nations and European officials this week. As an advocacy group warns that hundreds of thousands of Syrians could be buried in mass graves across the country. The U.N.'s humanitarian relief chief Tom Fletcher is in Damascus, where he's been meeting with Syria's new authorities, and he's joining us from there. Welcome to the program, Undersecretary-General. TOM FLETCHER, U.N. EMERGENCY RELIEF COORDINATOR AND U.N. UNDER-SECRETARY- GENERAL FOR HUMANITARIAN AFFAIRS: Thank you, Christiane, and best wishes from Damascus.",

Their communities have been utterly broken. They've lost loved ones. It will be very, very hard to rebuild that social fabric, let alone the physical infrastructure that you need to build security, justice opportunity here. Now, I believe that hundreds of thousands more will want to come back, but it's vital that they're able to do so when it's safe, when they feel able to do so.

So, there has to be support for those communities as they seek their loved ones. There has to also be accountability for the crimes that have been committed. And as you say, different bits of the U.N. will look at those issues, but I'm sure they'll do so with real energy and engagement because the Syrian people deserve to move on from this chapter, but they can't just forgive and forget.

We need everyone to respect sovereignty and let the Syrian people chart their own course and rebuild their own country. It won't be easy. It'll be very hard. It'll be perilous. Many things will go wrong. There'll be many challenges. But there is this brief moment here of genuine hope, I felt it last night as I walked through the streets of old -- of all the old town -- of the old City of Damascus. People are scared. They're fearful. They're anxious. But there's also an air of optimism, a hope in the air.

But also, and this is a key message from the U.N. and all of our meetings with the transitional administration, it's vital we get an inclusive government that represents all Syrians that has the legitimacy of the whole country, and is able to move as quickly as possible to a proper democratic election that can really renew confidence. And I was reassured by that conversation with Ahmed al-Sharaa and with the prime minister, that they see that as the right direction of travel too, even with all of these challenges that they face. And of course, at the center of my discussion, it is essential that women and girls who are so key to the humanitarian operation are protected and that that space for them to lead is protected, but also that they are given a stake in the future of Syria. Their role in the future of Syria is absolutely crucial. And I've made clear in my conversations that when the International Community is making its judgments on the quality of governance and on the potential of this partnership with the authorities that right at the core of that will be the way in which women and girls are treated.",

So, they said it has to be subject to a background check, and the kits have to be serialized. So, if they show up in a crime, the law enforcement can do its job. What it didn't do is require a license in order to purchase one of these kits and ensure that there's no secondary market for these ghost gun kits in that process, right? So, basically make it so that they are fully regulated. That didn't happen because Joe Biden was pulling a thread through a very small needle. His authority in order to do this was found not in new law, but in the 1968 Gun Control Act. Congress needs to get with the program and realize 50 years have passed, right, and pass legislation to ensure ATF has full authority to regulate this market.

I never heard President Trump say that he should -- we should make it easier for criminals to access firearms or firearm parts.
