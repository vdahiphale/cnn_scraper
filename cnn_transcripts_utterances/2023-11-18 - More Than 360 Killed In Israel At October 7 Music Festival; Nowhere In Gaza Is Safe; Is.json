The death toll now stands at 364, up from 270; 17 of those killed reportedly were police officers. About 40 people at the event were taken hostage. Israeli authorities don't believe the terrorists knew about the festival beforehand. Three weeks into the IDF's ground incursion into northern Gaza, CNN crews in nearby Israel reported seeing heavy activity during the night. Hamas officials now put the Palestinian death toll in Gaza at more than 12,000 people, including more than 5,000 children. The crippling fuel shortage and damage from Israeli bombardment have forced dozens of hospitals and clinics to close, according to the Palestinian Authority ministry of health, citing medical sources from the Hamas controlled enclave. CNN's Nada Bashir has a closer look with how people with nowhere to go are forced to live in the ruins of their bombed-out homes. Her report contains graphic images. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

We know the death toll has increased now to 12,000. The injured Palestinians we're looking at sitting at 30,000 people. These numbers are very difficult to get your head around. But more importantly so in terms of what's happening at Al-Shifa Hospital, the largest in northern Gaza. And, of course, the IDF embarked on an operation there; they're inside the hospital, this heavy and intense fighting in and around the hospital as well. And, of course, this hospital still has patients. We've been hearing from doctors from inside, talking about no food and water and lack of electricity and, of course, diminishing medical supplies. In fact, we also heard from MSF. For the past week they've been talking about the deterioration around al Shifa, no clear or safe passage out of al Shifa. They're very close to the hospital and have been ringing alarm bells. More importantly we know those neonatal babies are inside the hospital and in desperate need to get them out. The IDF is saying that they have been making way and creating clear passage for them to exit. But we're hearing very different realities, that it is hard to get out.

And they're, you know, telling us about the harrowing experiences and the stories and they say that 42 days is far too long, it's too much, it is a nightmare that is playing out in real time. We know the negotiations are currently underway from our sources, they tell us the Qataris are mediating these negotiations with the U.S., Israel, Hamas as well as the Egyptians. If there is any breakthrough, it could happen in the next few days. But these take time. And what is important here to note, as well, is that anything that happens on the ground could derail any type of talks that are happening behind closed doors, which we've seen in the past. Only four hostages have been released through a breakthrough moment a few weeks ago. And now we're looking at a situation where there's hopefully going to be some move. But Hamas has got a list of demands and who knows who's going to make concessions on either side. But we know what is on the table and we know what is at stake and a lot is going on, Kim, in Gaza right now. So it will be interesting to see if a breakthrough can happen in the next few days that could include some kind of pause or, even as we heard clearly from international organizations, a full-out cease-fire.",

This is the first time a court has come to that conclusion. But the judge here stopped short of taking Trump off the Colorado ballot. In fact, she ordered the secretary of state to keep Trump on the ballot. And that is because of the specific language of the 14th Amendment. Section 3 of that amendment says that certain officials cannot hold office if they engaged in insurrection. But the judge here noting President of the United States is not specifically listed under Section 3. She writes this, she says, \"Part of the court's decision is its reluctance to embrace an interpretation which would disqualify a presidential candidate without a clear, unmistakable indication that such is the intent of Section 3 of the 14th Amendment.\" So because the Constitution does not explicitly state that a provision for a prospective president to be removed if they engage in insurrection, Trump must remain on the Colorado ballot. It's likely the group that tried to get Trump off the ballot will appeal to the Colorado Supreme Court. This is a group, by the way, that includes several Republicans. Now they have to file their appeal by Monday, just a few days from now. But then any appeal really could be heard fairly quickly. There's a good chance that this case could ultimately be heard by the Supreme Court, the United States Supreme Court. You know, we do know, of course, the Supreme Court is solidly conservative and the majority of the justices are really sticklers in adhering to the exact text of the Constitution. So Trump could ultimately also end up victorious at the Supreme Court. So chances are that he will be on the ballot in all of these states, despite all of these challenges, he's won so far -- Jessica Schneider, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And that is going to tee up action potentially after the Thanksgiving break. Now past efforts to expel George Santos have failed. It is a high bar; it requires a two-thirds majority for passage. But having the weight of the House Ethics Committee and the weight of this damning report behind it is significant. And already we have seen a number of Republicans, new Republicans, come out and say they will now support expulsion after previously voting against it. And meanwhile, the new speaker, Mike Johnson, is essentially giving members a green light to vote their conscience. I want to read you part of the statement that came from his spokesman, Raj Shah. He said, \"The Speaker has reviewed the report and its very troubling findings. \"As members from both parties, members of the Ethics Committee and Representative Santos return to Congress after the Thanksgiving break, Speaker Johnson encourages all involved to consider the best interest of the institution as this matter is addressed further.\" So we'll see what Santos decides to do. At this moment, he says he will not run for reelection in 2024, claiming he will stick around and serve out his term as long as he is allowed. But some Republicans are hoping he resigns before they have to expel him. Santos, for his part, has been defiant, says he is innocent, deserves his day in court and also announced he will hold a press conference on the Capitol steps on November 30th.

Since the onset of the Israel Hamas war, a handful of influential talk show hosts has spread anti-Semitic tropes to their millions of followers. One of the main charges, the disgraceful notion that a spike in anti- Semitism is merely Jewish people getting a taste of their own medicine after supposedly supporting anti-white sentiment, a reprehensible conspiracy theory that has been denounced by the anti-Defamation League.",

CHARLIE KIRK, RIGHT-WING COMMENTATOR: It is true that some of the largest financiers of left wing anti-white causes have been Jewish Americans. DARCY (voice-over): Kirk has also floated the conspiracy theory that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu knew about the October 7 terror attack but chose to do nothing.",

DARCY (voice-over): Some conservatives have pushed back against the anti-Semitic rhetoric being spread by their peers. Ben Shapiro, co- founder of \"The Daily Wire,\" which employs Candace Owens, ripped her earlier commentary as disgraceful during a recent speech. BEN SHAPIRO, \"THE DAILY WIRE\": The question was about Candace Owens. I think her behavior during this has been disgraceful. Yes. She still works for my company. And I think she's been absolutely disgraceful. I think that her faux sophistication on these particular issues has been ridiculous. DARCY (voice-over): Owens appeared to fire back in a response drenched in anti-Semitism, suggesting Shapiro opted for wealth over virtue, quoting a Bible verse saying, \"You cannot serve both God and money.\" CNN reached out to \"The Daily Wire\" for comment and has not gotten a reply. The rhetoric comes as anti-Semitic attacks are surging across the U.S. and around the world. Jonathan Greenblatt, the head of the ADL, spoke out against the commentary coursing through right wing media. Responding to Musk, Greenblatt said, \"At a time when anti-Semitism is exploding in America and surging around the world, it is indisputably dangerous to use one's influence to validate and promote anti-Semitic theories.\" -- Oliver Darcy, CNN, New York.
