With that backdrop of incoming rockets, of incoming sirens, really giving us a sense that the fight against Hamas and Hezbollah is a fight is far from over. Just give us a sense of what you've been hearing today.JIM SCIUTTO, CNN CHIEF U.S. SECURITY ANALYST: Well, let me tell you where I am now, if I can. This is a memorial for the victims at the Nova festival. You may remember, nearly 400 were killed that day at the Nova festival, about a third of the total killed by Hamas on October 7th, 4,000 survivors, and many of them are here, this is on Lake Tel Aviv, in the memorial today, trying to capture, I think, some of the spirit of the Nova festival, there is music. They've been making bouquets of flowers. They're painting. There are therapy sessions here. There is meditation, some of which evokes what that festival was meant to be. Of course, the festival, much more of a celebration, and this one much more honoring those that they lost that day, the many hundreds of young people, and trying to regain some sense of peace, right, a year later, 366 days later, but the reminders are closed. There is a wall of the faces of those nearly 400 victims of the day. And I was looking at the wall earlier, Isa, and by and large, they're young people, right? I mean, they came to dance. They came to listen to music, and so many of them died that day. And you talk about reminders of just how close the war is. A few minutes ago, it started to empty out here because there was yet another air raid siren in Tel Aviv, and we saw, we looked up in the sky and we saw the smoke trail of the interceptor missile flying into the sky, not quite clear what it was intercepting. But, this is a daily event here. There was another one earlier today where I got sent into the shelter. So, we're seeing a number of events like this today. I was with some of the hostage families earlier today. They're trying to remember. They're trying to honor. They're trying to honor those who died. They're trying to keep the memory alive of those who are still being held in Gaza. And as they're doing that, the shadow of war is all around, and not just those air raid sirens, but of course, military activity expanding in Lebanon, the fight still going on in Gaza, where this all started on October 7th. And now the question as to how Israel responds to those missile attacks just a few days ago.",

And I won't say, Isa, when folks say that to me that they minimize or don't imagine that there will be consequences, the fears of a widening war, but I do hear a lot of agreement in this country that something must be done, right, something must be done as it relates to Iran. Of course, the question is, what will that response be? How big it will be? And then the question after each attack is, how then Iran might respond to this latest response, this latest escalation?",

The Lebanese government says more than 1,400 people have been killed, and over one million displaced ever since Israel launched its current campaign against Hezbollah. Earlier today, at least 10 firefighters lost their lives after an Israeli strike hit a fire station in southern Lebanon, and that is according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. And also today, an Israeli airstrike caused a large blast near Beirut's airport. Our Ben Wedeman is live for us in Beirut, where he is tracking this rather escalating conflict. And yet again, Ben, I'm throwing to you, and I can hear drones just above your head, I imagine, give us a sense of what you've been seeing today, fresh airstrikes and with fresh -- further, I should say, evacuation orders here, Ben.",

And as you mentioned, there was this large explosion dangerously close to Beirut International Airport, which, despite everything, continues to function. Now, the Israeli military put out a statement that it was a targeted strike, but without mentioning its proximity to the airport, the closest one we've seen yet.Now, I'm just going to step out of the frame and let cameraman, Sharbil Melo (ph), focus in on, you can still see smoke rising from a variety of strikes. We were here late last night, as more strikes were coming in. This is the pattern every night, every day, heavy strikes at night, sporadic strikes during the day, with this drone buzzing all the time overhead, over the heads of people in a city that are exhausted already by this war that certainly has escalated dramatically in the last two weeks. Now, as far as the situation in the south goes, what we see is that the Israelis continue to conduct intense airstrikes and artillery barrages, continue to conduct what they called limited, localized and targeted raids inside Lebanese territory. Today, the Arabic spokesman for the Israeli military yet again put out a long list of villages in south Lebanon with evacuation orders, telling people to go north of the Awali River, which is well away from the border, and not to drive back south and not to return to their homes until further notice. So, what we're seeing, in addition to that, of course, is continued firing by Hezbollah inside Israel. Last night, their missiles reached all the way to the city of Haifa for the first time. So, the expectation is that there is going to be an Israeli ground incursion, an invasion, I think we can call it that, an intensification of back and forth fire between Israel and Hezbollah, basically setting the scene for what's going to be a full-scale war yet again between Israel and Hezbollah and Lebanon.

From day one, Sinwar wanted to expand this war so that Hamas is not fighting in Gaza on its own, to drag in Hezbollah, a much more capable force into this war, to drag in Iran, and we're talking today about an Israeli response to Iran, a direct Iranian-Israeli confrontation.And at the same time, Benjamin Netanyahu wanted his opportunity to underscore that he is Mr. Security and to readdress the balance of power in the region against Iran to take a blow to that Iranian ring of fire around Israel, including Hezbollah in Lebanon.

So, Israel has done quite a remarkable job striking blows toHezbollah's leadership, decapitating the leadership, killing Nasrallah, but a ground invasion is a whole different ballgame that changes the narrative.

In fact, we saw Israel -- Israeli military saying that it intercepted a surface-to-surface missile fired from Yemen. So, Houthis here.

So, it's not insignificant that they have essentially been able to decapitate Hezbollah's military leadership. What we're seeing today is Iran being more directly involved in the direction of Hezbollah.Let's remember that, in those bunkers, together with Nasrallah, who lost his life, top Iranian generals have also lost their lives. They are directly involved in this war. So, increasingly, what we see with Hezbollah is a decentralized organization where the foot soldiers on the border are defending their own villages, and one can expect them to put up a valiant fight in that regard. But, the leadership in Beirut is increasingly under the direct control of Iran, and it's increasingly apparent to most Lebanese, who do not want this war, that this is an Iranian-Israeli war that's unfolding on their territory.",

So, there is an American aversion to that.Whether Netanyahu actually takes that into consideration or not is an open question.

In the next few minutes, U.S. President Joe Biden is set to hold a candle lighting ceremony at the White House in memory of the victims. Earlier, survivors and families of those killed gathered at the site of the Nova Music Festival in Israel that became, of course, one of the biggest targets in the massacre. And images of those taken by Hamas were projected onto the walls of Jerusalem's old city yesterday, a powerful reminder, they are not forgotten. And on this somber anniversary of the attacks that claimed some 1,200 lives, questions remain unanswered about warnings ignored and a catastrophic failure of Israeli intelligence.

Tens of thousands of Israelis remain displaced from their homes, not knowing whether they'll ever return to those homes. Thousands upon thousands of families are mourning, grieving the loss of their loved ones, grappling with horrific injuries, wounds, emotional trauma.

I think that was brought into extremely stark relief just a few weeks ago when those -- the bodies of those six hostages were found in Gaza, those six young people who had been murdered by Hamas has, I think, produced this ground self-support in Israel for some kind of a measure in order to bring those people home, pretty much at no matter what cost.",
