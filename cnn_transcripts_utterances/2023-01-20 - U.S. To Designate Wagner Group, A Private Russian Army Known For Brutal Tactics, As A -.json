Prigozhin has -- appears to be getting more weapons, so they're completely on supply chain, look at these pictures. I'm going to show you this. These we understand to be images of what appeared to be Russian rail cars, traveling to North Korea, picking up infantry rockets and missiles, weapons that according to the United States then went straight to Prigozhin's and Wagner fighters in Ukraine. And the concern tonight is that North Korea might deliver even more lethal military equipment to Prigozhin specifically. Ben Wedeman is OUTFRONT live in Kramatorsk, Ukraine.

In a dugout, this officer nicknamed Koleso explains Wagner's tactics. They attack at night, first wave is less trained, but we need to use lots of ammunition against them, he says. The next wave of troops has night vision, better trained, and better equipped. Tactics seemingly from a different day and age, inflicting mounting casualties on Ukrainian forces. This soldier was critically wounded when as armored personnel carrier was struck by Russian fire. Much of Bakhmut is now a ghost town, the sound of shelling, the danger constant. We're inside this tunnel inside Bakhmut, taking cover because there's incoming rounds just nearby. The few civilians left resigned to their fate. People die from strikes everywhere in Kyiv, and Dnipro, says Valentino. If that's your destiny, death will meet you anywhere. On a hill above the city, the Soviet Era T-72 tank fires into the distance. It's sound and fury perhaps not enough to turn the tide. (END VIDEOTAPE) WEDEMAN (on camera):  And that tank, T-72 tank is more than 50 years old. We've seen other artillery for instance, that dates back to 1950, older than me. And this is why the Ukrainians are so insistent that they need modern weapons to fight the Russians.

And now, retired Air Force Colonel Cedric Leighton and Peter Rough, who just wrote an extensive article about Wagner Group chief Yevgeny Prigozhin. He's director of the Hudson Institute Center on Europe and Asia. Colonel Leighton, let me start with you. When you hear Ben talking about Bakhmut where he spent so much time and saying Russia is slowly and steadily gaining ground. You know, you hear Prigozhin today claiming that he exclusively took a suburb of village south of the city of Bakhmut. How significant is the Russian performance here? I mean, we understood, you know, Soledar, it was very clear was a marginal to no strategic importance. Bakhmut is different. COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Yeah, it sure is, Erin. The key thing here is that although Bakhmut is not the center of great industry, or the center of military base, it is a stride one of the main highways that feeds and eastern Ukraine. And so, because of that, and also because of the symbolic nature that both sides have really made of this -- of this town. The idea here for the Russians is to capture it at any price. They don't really care what they're capturing. The main fact is that they're capturing something. And so, Bakhmut has become a symbol of both the Russians and for the Ukrainians. For the Ukrainians, it's basically a symbol of resistance. For the Russians, it's a symbol they hope of their victory in the future, in the weeks to come.",

We have a lot to learn from the armed forces of Ukraine were clearly and harmoniously, he's complimenting them. What is his goal here?PETER ROUGH, FORMERLY AT G.W. BUSH  WHITE HOUSE OFFICE OF STRATEGIC INITIATIVES:  Well, I think Yevgeny Prigozhin is obviously an oligarch, and a kleptocrat, which is what the modern Russia passes for a businessman. But he doesn't just have pecuniary interest, which has long been speculated, but -- says he wants to capture these parts of Ukraine because of the salt lines or the gypsum mines, lucrative parts of Ukraine and its vast resources. Now by stepping out in recent weeks also for example claiming credit for the Internet Research Agency which he established in Russia's second city St. Petersburg from which Western intelligence claims that the Russians have been discord in Western societies. On top of that, he's also bragged about Wagner deployments in Africa, where, for example, in Mali, they have attempted to push out the French, or in Syria where the openly challenged United States in combat. Now, increasingly, by pushing out, it's become much more than just a kleptocrat oligarch, if you will. He's becoming a political military figure. And clearly, he's aiming at the power structure in Moscow, he's doing that in two respects. One through the open comments which is taking, the second through sleepy produced videos that the Concorde Group, which is his public relations outfit, has been releasing of him visiting the frontlines, cutting a strong figure, leading his troops, so to speak, towards combat, all of that suggest transformation.
