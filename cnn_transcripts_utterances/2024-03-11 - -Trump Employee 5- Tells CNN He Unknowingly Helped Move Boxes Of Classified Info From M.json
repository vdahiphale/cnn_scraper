At this point in time, I think it's been pushed off, although the Jack Smith and his team want it to be held this summer, in July. But part of the Trump team's strategy, on all these case, is to push them off, keep pushing them off until after the election. And as we know, from polling, if you look from the political side, not the legal side, but from the political side, we know that there is a segment of the Republican base, of likely Republican voters, who said that if Trump is convicted, they won't vote for him that that will make a difference for them.

Brian Butler, in that interview, he's talking about a specific moment, in the car, with Anthony Pratt, where Pratt comes out. And that's the first thing on his mind that he shares with his Chief of Staff, and with Butler, that Trump told him about nuclear submarine secrets and Russia. And that is not just an anecdote that we should care about, because it's about classified information, potentially, or secret information. It's putting his finger, on why cases like this are charged. And if you look at all of these filings that prosecutors make in this case, when they're arguing to the judge, about why this case should go to forward for trial, why this case has been charged?

There's this obstruction angle to it that really sets it apart. And so, you're likely to hear from him, on the witness stand. But that is what he's doing.
