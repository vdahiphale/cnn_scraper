We also learned over the weekend that Pence had called Ducey repeatedly to talk about the results of the 2020 election. Now, sources had said that Pence was not putting pressure on Ducey, but he was trying to get information on if there was any visible voter fraud in order to return that information back to the former President. Pence was asked about that this weekend. Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MIKE PENCE, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: I did check in with not only Governor Ducey, but other governors in states that were going through the legal process of reviewing their election results. But there was no pressure involved, Margaret. I was calling to get an update, I passed along that information to the president and it was no more, no less than that. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So, Ron DeSantis, clearly this is an issue and a decision, his a calculation, a campaign is making that, these woke issues are important to highlight. Look, his record in Florida with regard to the culture wars is broad and Republican voters know about that, but it, in my opinion, his contrasting message with Donald Trump should be about winning and the fact that he won reelection and Donald Trump didn't. It should be about his success in the economic realm in Florida, about how he handled COVID, about how the tourism and real estate is thriving in the state of Florida.

And because of that, they're required to provide around the clock deterrence against many adversaries, including North Korea, China, Iran, and Russia. But because there is a constant need for this deterrence, these air defense soldiers get very little time off between deployments and as a result, many of them are beginning to suffer burnout, and the Army already has more missions than it has air defense capability. According to the Army's most senior air defense official who spoke to CNN about this, the problem has also gotten worse since Russia invaded Ukraine last year. U.S. Air Defense soldiers, were told stationed in Europe, have had to deploy with just hours notice to protect NATO's Eastern Flank and assist in training Ukraine on air defense systems, including of course, the Patriot system in the Pacific. Meanwhile, the U.S. military is increasing its presence in the region to prepare for a possible future conflict with China, while also maintaining its deterrence of North Korea and the U.S. still has its ongoing mission in the Middle East. So, because of all this close to 60% of the Army's Air Defense branch is deployed at any one time and the air defense soldiers typically have less than a year at home after a year long deployment. Now, ideally, they should have two to three years at home after a full year away. So, as one senior army defense officer told CNN, \"we have been overworked and undermanned.\" So, service leaders now are, therefore, becoming increasingly worried that the missile defense units could be stretched too thin, and they're starting to come up with some solutions, including embedding mental health specialists and offering a nearly $50,000 enlistment bonus to attract more candidates for certain air defense jobs. Now, Brigadier General Maurice Barnett, who is the commander of the 10th Army Air and Missile Defense Command in Europe, he told CNN that while, \"our number one priority, of course, is taking care of our people,\" the U.S. still obviously has a mission to accomplish, and those mission requirements are not slowing down.
