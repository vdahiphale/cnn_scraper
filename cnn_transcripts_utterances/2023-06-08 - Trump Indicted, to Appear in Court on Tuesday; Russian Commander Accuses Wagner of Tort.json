Trump's former attorney telling OUTFRONT an indictment maybe returned or unsealed this week.Also, a Russian commander accusing the Russian private army, the Wagner group, of torturing him, saying the Wagner chief is stealing military equipment as fighting on the ground is intensifying in Ukraine tonight. And a Supreme Court surprise. Two conservatives joining the liberal justices and giving Black voters a major victory. A decision that could help them win back the House. It's a significant decision from SCOTUS and the head of the NAACP will be my guest. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening to all of you. I'm Erin Burnett. And OUTFRONT tonight, Trump is bracing for an indictment in multiple investigations. The former president huddling with aides tonight at his Bedminster, New Jersey, home. One source telling CNN Trump believes an indictment is likely to happen sooner rather than later. And former Trump White House attorney Ty Cobb, OUTFRONT regular, tells us his sources say an indictment may be returned or unsealed as early as this week. Cobb is also hearing charges Judges will come in Florida, which is ground zero for Trump's fight with federal officials over classified documents at Mar-a-Lago. And we are getting new and exclusive information tonight from a key former White House official who testified in that document's case. The former career official was in charge of advising the Trump administration on the entire declassification process and this person told federal prosecutors that Trump did know the proper process for declassifying documents and that he followed it correctly at times while in office. We do know that to be a fact. I mean, we have this document, this actually proves it. It shows, and this is a document about declassifying materials related to the Crossfire Hurricane investigation of the FBI. It's very specific. Trump's very last full day in office that he knew and used proper declassification procedures to release part, but not all of the classified documents related to the investigation into his campaign's ties to Russia. Now, that investigation, as I said, was called Crossfire Hurricane, and in Trump's own words in this document makes it very clear he doesn't believe that he himself has the power to just release all of the documents. In fact, if you read through it and it continues to show the process, I requested, Trump states, the document that the declassification review can be performed so I can determine to what extent materials in the binder should be released in unclassified form. I mean, it's all there and then here on the second page, the signature. So this is obviously -- this is a process. These are the rules and these are the limitations and it's a far cry for how Trump and his inner circle have tried to portray the declassification process since the documents investigation began. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN SOLOMON, EDITOR IN CHIEF, \"JUST THE NEWS\": He had a standing order, there's the word I was looking for, that documents removed from the oval office were deemed to be declassified the moment he removed them.",

And then in addition to that it could be defiance of a grand jury subpoena, that's another one, another form of obstruction. I also think they would go forward on classified documents charges and other parts of the Espionage Act, and not just retention of documents and they refer to the national defense information but classified documents.

I think the messaging that they're going to try to portray is going to be similar to what he put out on his truth social. But the issue is that from what I know about Trump, he is going to say that he is being indicted because he is running for president.But I believe that he is running for president because he knew he was facing legal trouble, and that he could use his campaign as a shield then and say this is politically motivated and they're coming after me because they don't want me to be president again.
