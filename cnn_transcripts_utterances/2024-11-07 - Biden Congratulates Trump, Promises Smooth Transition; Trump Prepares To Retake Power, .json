We'll see how that ultimately plays out.But assuming he stays in GOP control, one of those, Speaker Mike Johnson himself, in fact, I asked him last week if he would dissuade Donald Trump from seeking retribution against his political enemies. He said Trump's not going to do that, don't worry about it Trump's not going to do that. So we'll see if Johnson is ultimately right or if Trump carries out with his promise. But there's also others as well, the number two, who's expect wants to be the number two still, Steve Scalise, will implement the agenda on the House floor. Also, Tom Emmer, the Republican whip, who is wants to be Republican whip again. This -- that's going to be a key position because if they do have a majority, it's going to be another narrow Republican majority which means they had to keep their members in line to get bills through along party lines and then there is the Senate and there's a whole leadership scramble right now in the Senate. There's a leadership election on Wednesday to succeed Mitch McConnell. That person will be essential especially the early part of the administration to get Donald Trump's cabinet confirmed, secretaries confirmed, and move along his agenda. Two of those who are the leading contenders John Thune, the number two Republican, John Cornyn, the former number two Republican. They have not always been in line with Trump. Cornyn was the Republican whip under Trump in his first two years, helped him with some of his agenda. Thune has been supported Tim Scott for the presidency, initially, ultimately they've been trying to bolster their ties with Trump. Rick Scott who's more the long-shot candidate says that he is the true Trump candidate. So we'll see how the senators ultimately decide when they vote next.",

We have a really good road map from when he was first in office in 2016 to get those executive orders back in place but I think more than that he's going to want to actually implement law so that whichever if -- if he doesn't have a Republican successor to office, they can't just undo what he had successfully done and lead us to an additional open border era.",

That kind of masculinity appeals to men who already wear futurist female t-shirts. They're not bringing in I think the kind of men that l is talking about who have spent years listening to podcast are very removed by the way from the conventional media ecosystem. And so, you know, this feels like 2004 all over again, Jake. We live through that. Democrats have to go out into the country. Remember NASCAR dads and Howard Dean talking about putting bumper stickers on pickup trucks. I mean, it kind of feels like Democrats are going to have to go through that reckoning again because the gender gap this time for the first time in many cycles did not favor Democrats. It favored Republicans because Donald Trump moved men in his direction more than Kamala Harris was able to move women in her direction, compared to Biden's 2020 margins.",

I think the general sense is that she really did her best and her team did her best with the weird truncated 107-day campaign that she had to run. There is a lot of anger though being directed at President Biden and I think the sort of big \"what if\" question that is going to be haunting Democrats for the years to come is what if Joe Biden had dropped out of the race years ago, not even sought a second term and actually kept the promise that he initially made of being a transition and a bridge president which was what he said when he was running back in 2020. And you know, Jake, as you know, Democrats had a lot of concerns even pre the CNN debate about his health and his age and I think what I'm picking up on is the thing that is really fueling the anger at Joe Biden right now is this idea that whenever those concerns were raised, the president himself and the advisers close to him just found it so intolerable to have that decision be questioned. And if I could, you know, CNN did a big story back in July I think Jeff Zeleny and I were both by lines on this story about Democrats and their wide- ranging concerns about the president's health. And in that story, I remember talking to a senior Democrat who said everyone's aware of the concerns and they said everyone who expresses any level of suspicion or contrary views, they, being Biden's inner circle, call everyone and they beat the shit out of them and say, stay on message.

There is a sense that in the suburbs, there was too much of an overreliance that abortion rights was sort of a metaphor for freedom which was really going to drive out a turnout. And the Liz Cheney campaigning a sense that the democracy was really going to win over some suburban women rather than talking about the economy. But the bottom line of all of this obviously the vice president is limited to how she could separate herself from President Biden, but even in those limits, she just didn't do it. But it was that one answer to the question on the view where she said that, you know, she can't think of anything she would change. That became an ad that was played again and again and again. Speaking of ads, in Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, the ads the Democrats decided to not push back on, the biggest cultural issue probably in advertising this campaign the trans issue. That was something that the Democrats just could not get their minds around, how it could move votes.

There's nothing strategic and targeted about that. If that's what they end up doing, that could be a very good leveraging way of bringing people to the table, perhaps negotiating them, reducing tariffs on their side, and leveling the playing field as Mnuchin mentioned there. But these blanket tariffs that have been threatened I think do risk slowing growth and they do risk higher prices and that's what a consensus of economists are saying. I do believe he was a moderating voice for the former president or the president-elect. So it is a shame to hear him say look, I'm going to stay on the sidelines. And I think it's ironic what he did say about for the first time and certainly not in the four years when the former president was in the White House to see the Fed chairman. He aligned -- the Fed chair is trying to cut rates. President Trump or President-elect Trump wants to see rates come down and one of the only things that could fly in the face of that is targeted immigration policy, blanket tariffs which would perhaps force the fed to slow down.

I think the other thing is they didn't talk enough about the strength of the jobs market, in particular, too. They didn't talk about the fact that growth was much stronger than just about everywhere else in the world. But you know what they really didn't do, Jake, and it goes to that stat. They didn't reassure the public that over the next four years, they would feel richer than they did when this administration started and whether it's nostalgia or otherwise, that's how they felt about the term under President Trump. Let me just show you because 75 percent of people in our exit polls were saying, look, we feel the same or worse than we did in terms of wealth. Now, let me just show you a chart very quickly because this shows you exactly what people were feeling and it's real. Wages went up under both President Biden and President Trump. This is very important but look at the level of inflation which is that dark green bar. It was much higher overall under Biden. The bigger the gap between those two bars, the more money you have in the end of the day to spend on the fun things and makes your life easier and that's one of the critical differences for me.

At the Mountain Fire just northwest of L.A., nearly 20,000 acres burned, more than 14,000 people under evacuation orders, schools closed, a major highway closed, still no count on just how many homes have been lost. Another blaze burning in Malibu, firefighters have somehow kept that contained. Power intentionally cut to nearly 70,000 customers for fear of sparking even more blazes in bone dry vegetation.",

Now, they are still trying to figure out how many homes were lost they've got teams out right now trying to count the losses here. And you know the wind has drop now. The wind's going to drop a little bit over the weekend. But, Jake, the problem is come Monday, Tuesday, next week, these Santa Ana winds that we get this time of year in California, they are going to pick up again and that has everybody anxious that there's going to be another round either here or somewhere else in the area where all this dry vegetation is just waiting to burn -- Jake.",

And the more that gets put up into the sea and sky, the hotter it's going to get. This -- the physics are real simple.
