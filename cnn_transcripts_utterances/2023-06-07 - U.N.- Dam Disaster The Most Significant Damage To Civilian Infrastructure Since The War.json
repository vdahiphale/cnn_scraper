Coming up, theUkrainian president says hundreds of 1000s are without water after that dam collapse. Pope Francis is hospitalized in Rome after abdominal surgery. Today, New York City faces some of the worst air quality in the world. And later, the PGA Tour faces a deluge of backlash over its surprise partnership with LIV Golf. No running water, streets impossible, homes unlivable. Communities along Ukraine's Dnipro river are facing what the UN calls the most significant damage to civil infrastructure since the Ukraine war began. Immense flooding from a destroyed Russian control dam has forced more than 1500 people to evacuate. Satellite Imagery is giving us a stark aerial view of the dam before and after that massive breach as well as the extent of the devastation to towns in that flood zone. Well, ten people so far have been reported missing. Seven in Russian controlled territory and three on the Ukrainian side. President Volodymyr Zelensky says the disaster has left hundreds of 1000s without drinking water. Well CNN's Sam Kiley is in Ukraine. He's monitoring the situation. He joins us today from Central Ukraine. Sam, you were reporting on this as it happened 24 hours ago. What more do we know at this stage about what caused this?",

Except insofar as, ultimately in the view of theinternational community blame for the collapse of the dam rests fairly and squarely with the Russians. That's the view of the U.N., of the Britain, United States, France, European Union and others. And that's because the Russians had control over it. There's been no evidence yet that the dam was blown up in the immediate period before the dam collapsed. But there is substantial evidence that it was beginning to fall apart, dating back certainly to the end of May. Satellite imagery would indicate that and it was allowed by the Russian authorities to overfill putting even more pressure on that fragile structure already affected, of course, by the war. And I think there's an important aspect of this, Becky, which is that a Ukrainian officer that we spoke to said that he saw Russians -- Russian troops being swept away by this dam blast. This is our report. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Then he came by his own car here to the hospital for this procedure. Now this is a procedure that is to take care of a hernia on what is presumed to be scar tissue from surgery he had about two years ago on his colon. And we've understood from the Vatican that it was because he was under recurrent painful and worsening pain. Now what's especially important is the pontiff, 86-years old, as you mentioned, has a very full summer ahead first week of August. He's planning to go to Portugal for World Youth Day. End of August he's planning to go to Mongolia. None of those plans have been cancelled. So, this could very well just be a procedure. You know, the Vatican says he will recover fully they expect in order to just make him more comfortable. He was in pain. Now it is worth noting he has had a lot of health problems. He is confined to a wheelchair for much of the time due to knee problems. He has sciatica problems. In March he was in this very hospital behind me for infectious bronchial situation where he was here for four days. So, 86-years old, anyone would be worried about a loved one that's that age undergoing surgery and under general anaesthetic -- anesthesia. Thank you.",

Ithink the issue with this ceasefire is that it created a smoke cover that distorted the spiraling catastrophe on the ground. What we're seeing in Khartoum, for certain is essentially the RSF, which is one belligerence looting homes, occupying water stations, which are cutting off water for entire neighborhoods, using rape as a weapon of war, occupying military hospitals and turning them into military outposts. And then at the same time, what we're seeing is the military has more or less lost the city. They do control the sky, and they are trying to mount a bit of a larger offensive in order to retain its symbolic legitimacy among some people within the capitol that do support the military, not necessarily because they support the military, but because of the violence from the RSF has been so up close and personal, Becky.",

The U.S. and the Saudis, of course, have been brokering these -- these ceasefires that have, frankly, not worked.

And I think it was dead in the water from the moment it started, because it essentiallyfocused on a ceasefire to uphold the laws of war, which both parties should have been upholding anyways, so really bestowed legitimacy on them to do the absolute bare minimum. And then anything short of respecting the laws of war would still be tolerated. What is needed at this point, is a far more concentrated international effort, and an awareness and recognition about the most powerful actors in the world, including the U.S., Russia and China, that they stand to lose a lot more than to gain if this war continues. There is at least in framework and blueprint, a better laid out initiative that includes enabling the civilian dispensation that has been unveiled by the African Union, the African Union has no leverage, really, unlike maybe the Gulf states or the Saudis, when it comes to Sudan. However, I think if there is backing for that initiative, I think if there is leverage that's exerted from most powerful actors as high up to the Security Council, then that initiative might hold a bit more chance. So, where they have legitimacy and some impartiality, they can be aided with the leverage of more powerful states.",

The UN, of course, just that the weekend did, did extend its mission there. But clearly, things have to change. Thank you. Well, we reported earlier U.S. Secretary of State arrived in Riyadh, for his second day of meetings in Saudi as Washington does try and sort of rehabilitate its relations with the kingdom. Antony Blinken met Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Jeddah last night for nearly two hours, they touched on a number of sensitive issues, it is said including human rights, the conflict in Yemen, and the potential normalization of Saudi Israeli relations. Well, Blinken's visit comes, of course, just after the Saudis announced, they'll be slashing oil output starting next month to boost crude prices. Let's check in with CNN International Diplomatic Editor, Nic Robertson. And I have to say, Nic, you know, I live in the region. And I was just reflecting with the team here, that it seems not a day goes past these days where the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia isn't hitting their headlines. And yesterday, of course, was -- the past 24 hours has been no exception at all. This trip for the Secretary of State coming at a very, very busy time for the Kingdom. What did you make of what came out of the meeting between Blinken and the Crown Prince? We have readouts as they are known. Statements about what was discussed. What did you make of -- of what was discussed?",

That -- they were building on that, and one of the areas they hoped to build in was the economy. You know, Saudi Arabia's got a $37 billion deal going with the United States with Boeing Airlines, for aircraft. And that's seen as very significant. 140,000, I mean, yes, 140,000 jobs in the United States depend on Boeing. So, there's this economic part, and there was thoughts to sort of tie up on 5G and 6G, telephone, cell network connections, you know, development in that area. But I think the thing that caught my eye was the area of working together on clean technology, clean energy supplies. And I think in this area, they might be referring, it's not clear, they might be referring to the development of a domestic nuclear power program for Saudi Arabia. This is an objective of Saudi Arabia at something they want. And some people see this as potential leverage to get this normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel is something that the United States has. So that was a line that came out of that meeting that was interesting. But I think Blinken set this -- set this normalization issue ahead of the meeting by saying nothing on this is going to happen fast, but it's something that it's important to the United States.",

And -- and this is not something that's going to be easy to step aside from, but the position that the Saudis have taken is they're going forward, and to your point about Saudi sort of asserting itself diplomatically, the strong diplomatic agreements that it now has with China to broker a better relationship between Saudi Arabia and Iran is significant of Saudi Arabia, looking at what it feels is the United States, deserting it diplomatically, the Gulf region. And therefore, them looking for other allies and partners, diplomatically and also, potentially, for weapons supplies, as you were suggesting. So, the Saudis' attitude to this point that's put forward here, which is a very real point, which is a very heartfelt point, which is very well understood in the West. Their view on it is, we are going to go in our direction, and it's up to the rest of the world to catch up with what we're doing. And I think the LIV PGA situation has shown just how far the reach of Saudis influence and many would estimate that's come through the check book, through money, how far their influence can go, and what they're intending to do. And I think this is sort of writ large of the way that MBS wants to be, an important regional power, an important global diplomat, an important -- an important significant player on the global sport stage for a prestige for international image and for domestic consumption at home as well, where he has really liberalized the kingdom. Where he has gotten rid of the hard conservative leaders if you will and marginalized them and their voice has gone and he is now allowing sports and music outside and all the things that Saudis have -- young Saudis had clamored for, for so long.

The Vaticansays it will not give out updates on the Pope's condition after his surgery. He is back in a Rome hospital where doctors aren't repairing a hernia. The 86-year-old pontiff is expected spent several days in the Gemelli hospital. Soon CNN Chief Medical Correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta joins me. Now we know many people around the world who have questions about exactly what the -- what the Pope has been through. And what we can expect. The word from the Vatican is that the hernia surgery is intended to fix what has been quite a recurrent, painful and worsening symptoms. What can you tell us about this type of surgery, Sanjay? DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. So, what seems to have happened here, Becky, is that back in 2021, Pope Francis had an operation on his colon, and that involves an incision in the abdomen. When people hear hernia, sometimes they think of a hernia in the groin. This is a different type of hernia that we're talking about, one that is actually in the abdomen. When they do that operation, and they repair the tissue in the muscle, sometimes that repair starts to open up, people may develop a little pooching that they may see on the abdominal wall at that point, you can sort of see an idea of what that might look like on this graphic. Ultimately, though, intestines, things like that can start to actually fill that opening, fill that that pooched area. And that's what causes the pain. When people have an operation, like the one that he had back in 2021 and then they develop a hernia and incisional or abdominal hernia, most of time, it's going to need some sort of repair. And typically, that happens when someone starts to have significant symptoms, which is what sounds like it's happening. In case you're wondering about the time course here, why 2021 And now two years later, it's because this can take, it can take place over some time and repairing them, that abdominal wall, repairing those muscles, to make sure that that pooched area is no longer there. That's the goal of the operation, Becky.",
