Vice President Kamala Harris has tapped Minnesota Governor Tim Walz to be her vice presidential running mate. Moments ago, Walz responded to the news, saying it's the honor of a lifetime and he's -- quote -- \"all in.\" Also new this morning, we're learning about why Harris landed on the Minnesota governor, including his background as a high school teacher, football coach and military veteran, his record and executive experience, their strong rapport, and his ability to draw a stark contrast with Donald Trump. He's been using the term weird a lot. We will be talking about that. In fact, it was Walz who did popularize that phrase Trump is weird. That was quickly embraced by Democrats. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. TIM WALZ (D-MN), VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Keep hammering on these guys. This idea of calling them out for who they are, shrink them. Is he a danger to society? Yes. Is he a danger to women's health? Yes. Is he a danger to world peace? Yes. But don't give him more credit than he needs. He's just a strange, weird dude. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The compelling biography that Tim Walz has, remember, he is somebody that they are trying to use to really take aim at voters in the blue wall states, and they are going to be emphasizing, as we have already seen in the last hour, the fact that he served in the Army National Guard, the fact that he was a teacher and a football coach, that he was born in a small town in Nebraska.Those things are all going to factor in. And last of all, and probably one of the most important things that we are going to be talking about is just the personal chemistry that she thought that she had with the Minnesota governor throughout this process. We know that she was looking for someone that she could mesh well with, that she just liked, and that she believed that she could trust. And, certainly, that was a big factor in -- at the end of the day, when it came down for her to make that decision. We know that it came down to three finalists at the end of the day, perhaps even two by the end of yesterday, and, at the end of the day, that ended up being a huge, important factor for the vice president.",

We were talking with Amy Klobuchar in the last several minutes. She talked about how he knew his way around a hunting rifle, knew his way around a football tailgate, that he brings a lot of those sort of necessary heartland components to this campaign that maybe Kamala Harris did not.

But it's that full picture that the Harris campaign really seized upon, and the vice president, I'm told, found him authentic. She found him warm.

What we know is that there wasn't anything on the public schedule, so nothing that we expected him to go to today. But, clearly, there is a movement here, Jim, and the energy around here is electric. When we saw him pull out, the crowd started cheering. It's a very big moment here in St. Paul. neighbors are very excited. This is a huge moment for the state of Minnesota as well. And when I talk to voters here, they say they are looking forward to the rest of the nation learning about him what they already know. And what they say really seals the deal for them is that he's authentic. He's a regular guy, but he's not a pushover, that he's a fighter. And then one woman also used the word steady. Minnesota has seen some extremely turbulent times when he was in his first term as governor here. He ushered the state through the riots following George Floyd's murder, COVID. There have been some really tough times for this state. And what one woman I spoke with said was that he was a steady voice in a time of real upheaval.

And so that gives you a sense, you have a Democratic Party that is excited, that's fired up, that has an abundance of talent. But also don't forget that this is about Kamala Harris and her leadership and her steady hand. She got thrown this loose ball very late in this process, and she has conducted this campaign masterfully. She marched through this process well. She kept this thing secret until it came out today.
