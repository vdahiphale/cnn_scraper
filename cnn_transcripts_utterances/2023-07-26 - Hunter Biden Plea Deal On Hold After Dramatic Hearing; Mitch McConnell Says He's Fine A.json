We'll take a closer look at what's next for the president's son and the ongoing Justice Department investigation of him.Also tonight, former Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani is now conceding that he defamed -- defamed -- two Georgia election workers. Why is he doing this now? And what impact might it have on investigations of 2020 presidential election interference? And House Republicans grill the Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on border security, including some GOP lawmakers pushing for his impeachment. We'll discuss the politics of impeachment in 2023 as some conservative Republicans also are setting their sights on President Biden. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM. We begin with the Hunter Biden court hearing that went off the rails today. The president's son may had been expected to sign a plea deal but the federal judge in the case had other ideas. CNN's Sara Murray has been covering all of the twists and turns for us today. She's here with me in THE SITUATION ROOM. So, Sara, where do things stand now for Hunter Biden?",

President Joe Biden's son arrived in federal court today prepared to plead guilty to two misdemeanor tax charges and to strike a deal to avoid a felony gun charge. After a five-year Justice Department probe that Hunter Biden once predicted he would emerge from unscathed.

Eventually Hunter Biden's team agreed he was not shielded from further charges, and the deal seemed, for a moment, back on track.But then the judge raised questions about the gun deal. Is this even constitutional, she asked. And she said she was not ready to sign off on the deal. The hearing ended with Hunter Biden in a pro-forma move pleading not guilty. The courtroom drama providing another opening for Republican lawmakers who slammed the plea agreement. REP. CHIP ROY (R-TX): At least there's some scrutiny going on.

MURRAY: The plea deal was set to cover Hunter Biden's tax transgressions over a five-year span, his drug issues, and his firearm possession charge.

So the White House understandably is basically saying, look, this is a Trump appointed U.S. attorney.This was an investigation that began under the previous administration, and if it was stalled, it was stalled under that administration, too. And I think that those are both factual things. One factor here that, you know, I think we all have to consider is that whatever is happening with this Hunter Biden investigation, clearly it transcends, you know, the leadership of the Justice Department, the leadership of the White House. And if there are any efforts to kind of put Hunter Biden in a different category, the reasons for that may not be solely political. And I think that that's probably what came out of this hearing today is that even the judge looks at this and is like, this is confusing. This may not be typical for this kind of case, and that may not be because of politics. It may be for other reasons, too. That's not going to stop Republicans from accusing the DOJ of being political, but I do think we should just keep in mind that there might be other things at play here.",

It might be something that is necessary in order to get more information about the Biden family business dealings, even though Republicans to this point haven't been able to prove that Joe Biden at all benefited from Hunter Biden's overseas business deals.I think from a practical matter, though, it makes it harder for Republicans to get information as long as this is an ongoing investigation. You know, Jim Jordan doesn't just want to hear from David Weiss, the U.S. attorney overseeing this, he wants to hear from all sorts of investigators who worked on this probe.

I can tell you, Wolf, just from observing him in recent weeks that he is acting a little bit differently than he normally does. He's been walking a little bit slower, speaking a little bit more softly. In fact last month, he couldn't hear the reporter's questions even though they were really audible questions.

Secretary of War William Belknap was impeached by the House in 1876 before being acquitted by the Senate. And House Democrats are already throwing cold water on the pursuit, reminding Republicans Wednesday of the hearing's purpose.REP. JERRY NADLER (D-NY): To be clear, Republicans have not established any legitimate grounds to impeach Secretary Mayorkas. They have not uncovered evidence of wrongdoing or malfeasance of any kind. They have policy disagreements with the secretary and so do we. But policy disagreements and personal grudges are not a basis for impeachment. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

This is not a place for policy disagreements.You know, I remember when Democrats were trying to go after President Donald Trump in the beginning of his administration. Then House speaker Nancy Pelosi said that she was not going to impeach Donald Trump because we disagree with him on policy. She wanted to see what he had done that might meet the standard of high crimes and misdemeanors. And he wasn't impeached until he did meet that standard. So I think that this effort to go after Mayorkas is just political grandstanding. They know, even if they did impeach him, it wouldn't make it past the Senate. And remember what happened to Eric Holder when he got censured by the House a few years ago during the Obama administration. That kind of emboldened Eric Holder. Because once you remove the kind of -- the overhang, the stigma, the fear of the impeachment, then Mayorkas doesn't have any reason not to go full forward with the policy agenda that he's carrying out for the American people.",

Listen, if the Republicans want to investigate somebody, they should look into what's happening at the border with Governor Abbott with this 1200 or however long this fence is with the concertina wire. And we find out that 4- year-olds are being pushed back and given water. And we got a border agent saying that pregnant women are being hurt at this concertina wire and not being helped. This is the kind of thing that in America that's supposed to be a welcoming big place, a place that's strong enough for all of us, these Republicans see it as a brittle place where they have to deny people basic humane accommodations.

So if I'm a moderate voter from New Jersey or New York or Pennsylvania, I don't really want any part of this. And so I think that, again, this has been a misguided effort. We've seen this before. The Senate does not want to take this up because once you impeach somebody in the House, the Senate must take it up almost immediately. And again, very disruptive to what's happening.

A source close to Reed says he is expected to make a full recovery. That source saying that he is recuperating very well at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, and they hope he is home soon and able to be with his family.To this point, his family has not released a statement but they did exclusively provide us with this picture of Trevor Reed. Reed was injured about two weeks ago while fighting along the frontline in Ukraine in Bakhmut. It was a shrapnel wound the source close to Reed said, and he was initially taken to the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv for treatment. And then an NGO got him out of the country where he was then transported to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, one of the largest U.S. Military hospitals, for further treatment. Take a look at this timeline of the last few years for Reed. It was in the summer 2019 that he was arrested in Russia and unlawfully detained, according to the U.S., on charges of endangering a law enforcement officer. He was in jail there for nearly three years and then was released in a prisoner swap for a Russian cocaine smuggler, and that brings us to April 2022. About a half year later in November 2022, he made the decision to go back to Ukraine. That decision, the source close to Reed says, was first because he was honored to fight alongside Ukrainians, but second, because of what he saw, the oppression he saw while he was within a Russian prison. At some point after November, he does come back to the U.S. In fact he was on our air in studio just a couple of months ago. But then he returned to Ukraine. And that brings us to July. That's where he was wounded just a couple of weeks ago by shrapnel and that forced him to come out of the country to receive treatment first there and then at Landstuhl where he currently is. You can see here, if you look at that picture, this is one of the issues for the U.S. He has right there an American flag on his uniform that he was wearing in Ukraine. Whereas U.S. officials from the White House and the State Department have made it very clear that Reed was not there as part of a U.S. or a DOD mission. He went there of his own choice, of his own free will, and as a president citizen. But if you were to be captured or fall into Russian hands, that would certainly complicate things and undermine the U.S. claim and reinforce, Wolf, the Russian claim that the U.S. has been involved in the fighting there for some time, which is why this has been so sensitive and complicated.",
