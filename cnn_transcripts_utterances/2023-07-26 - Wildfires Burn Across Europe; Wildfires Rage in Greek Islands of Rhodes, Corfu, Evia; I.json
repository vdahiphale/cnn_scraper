I mean, they included seven counts of sexual assault. One offense, the most serious charge of them was causing a person to engage in penetrative sexual activity without consent. This could have potentially held decade's long prison sentence. Of course, he has now been found not guilty. But by no means was this an easy trial, the jury deliberated for days a total of nearly 12 and a half hours. Ultimately the judge in not finding consensus with the jury ruled that they could come to a majority decision at least 10 out of the 12. Once that decision was made by the judge in under an hour the jury came out with their final decision again, not guilty on all charges. These are accusations that date back again a long time nearly 20 years, so there was competing narratives in court with Kevin Spacey again describing many of these instances as romantic as flirtatious and of course, as consensual. These are accusations that surfaced in the wake of the Me Too movement, so potentially a blow for that movement.

And asyou pointed out they are on a recess right now ironing out some of the wrinkles around this Hunter Biden plea agreement, which again, is supposed to be him pleading guilty to two misdemeanor tax charges and striking a deal to avoid a felony gun charge. Right now, it seems like they're still working out some of the elements of that. Prosecutors made clear in court today that Hunter Biden had the means, he had the income to pay his taxes a couple years back, and he just didn't do so. They pointed out that he was getting large sums of money from foreign sources, Chinese sources, Ukrainian sources, as part of this, obviously, that has been a big political football on Capitol Hill. And prosecutors also said that as part of this deal, they are going to recommend probation. Now ultimately, it's going to be up to the judge to decide what that sentencing is going to look like. We don't expect that to happen today. But we do expect that she would set a date for sentencing. But things are progressing rather slowly as they iron out some of the wrinkles. And you look; you can bet that even if they work out most of Hunter Biden's legal problems today, the political problems are definitely not going away. I mean, on Capitol Hill, House Republicans are chomping at the bit to get more information from David Weiss, the U.S. Attorney who oversaw this investigation about how he conducted this probe about allegations from IRS whistleblowers who worked on the probe that there was political interference. Weiss has shot some of those down, but Republicans on the Hill has made clear they want more answers. And we've also seen House Speaker Kevin McCarthy signal in the most pointed way yet that he believes these concerns about the Biden family finances could rise to the level of an impeachment inquiry.

So they spent a period from the end of May, up until a few days ago, securing the vessel behind me, which is the FSO Safer itself. There were a number of things that had to be done to secure the oil from exploding. And that's done by pumping in our gases into each of the 13 compartments that are holding the oil. There was a need to rebuild a number of systems for pumping, but also lighting, there's no engine that that's functional on this, this vessel. There are booms that have gone around the outside to capture any accidental spill. And of course, is installing the pumps that are now working as we speak. So the hard part, in many ways, technically is over in getting the vessel stabilized. And that's what allowed us to start the pumping yesterday. And it's gone very well so far. We're pumping between four and 5000 barrels of oil every hour right now. So this is a testament to the good preparation work that has been done.
