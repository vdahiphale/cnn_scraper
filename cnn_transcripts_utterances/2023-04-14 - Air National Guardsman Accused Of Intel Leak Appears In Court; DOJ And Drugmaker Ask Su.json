That is just one of the stunning new details we're learning about the suspect arrested and the flagrant Pentagon leak investigation. Twenty-one-year-old Jack Teixeira was charged with two federal crimes today. He did not enter a plea, but he will remain in custody until his detention hearing next week. Teixeira who was arrested yesterday at his parents' home was an IT specialist for a military intelligence unit on Cape Cod, Massachusetts.",

He actually held top secret clearance since 2021.Starting in December, according to the affidavit, he was posting hundreds of highly classified Intel documents to a chat group frequented by gamers. Those documents later spread on social media. CNN's Chief Law Enforcement Intelligence Analyst, John Miller, is with us as well as CNN National Security Correspondent Natasha Bertrand who is joining us live from the Pentagon. So John, let's talk a little bit more about these charges. So two federal charges at this point and what do they point to?",

But as the investigation which is literally today, only six days old, which is lightning speed in a classified leak investigation has to go further, which is okay, this is what we know and we think, which he was - he had his friends, they were gamers, they shared these documents in their private discord space, it was cool to have access to real secrets.What we don't have is an espionage charge. What we don't have is that he was working for a foreign government. What we don't have was he was leaking it to Russia or China. But they're not finished yet. So what we're going to see is he's arrested on probable cause. It's a complaint by an FBI agent, we're going to see an indictment and then you could see a superseding indictment, depending on where the investigation goes. At minimum for every one of the hundreds of documents that he may have posted. Each one of those could be a criminal count ...",

And this is where my brain is right now.And what I mean by that is he is - he enters the State National Guard, Massachusetts National Guard, and is in a in a state status. That means he's essentially owned by the governor who I reported to at the time. So he is doing what we call state functions. There's a capacity in particular in Intel, in particular at this wing in which the person is what we call federalized or title 10 status. That - I don't mean to get technical here, it just means he's owned now by the Pentagon. And his reporting bypasses the governor and he goes up the Pentagon chain. It was interesting to me to say the least that at least what's been disclosed by the court yet - now, it does not at all make clear what status he was in when he had access to that information. It says he has top secret security clearance that tells me nothing. He could be either State National Guard or Federal National Guard. I believe this is the next shoe to drop. I mean, I believe as we learn more, we will either determine for reasons that are inexplicable to me that he was a State National Guard member having access to information that has almost no relevance to a State National Guard or possibly that he had been federalized under Title 10 status, in which case the Pentagon has a big problem, right? Because he is reporting up the Pentagon chain of command, and they should have had better oversight over him. In either case, let's just say it's not good.",

Because it seemed yesterday from that Pentagon briefing that they were really focusing on the fact that he signed an NDA and that in and of itself is sort of like the ball is in his court. He broke that agreement and he gave the analogy, the Brigadier General, that it was as if somebody's home had been locked in somebody who had a copy of the key then decided to break back into that home.I mean, is it as simple as that?

It would still definitely be available, but there would be these drastic changes that the FDA has laid out. They're saying that they're unsure how exactly they would handle it if the Fifth Circuit ruling goes into effect. And they're saying that this is really a process that demands just a lot more than just a flip of a switch.So the DOJ has asked the Supreme Court to step in. They're laying out all of these logistical hurdles. But here is what would happen if the Supreme Court does not step in. At about 1 am Saturday morning, so just mere hours from now, a Fifth Circuit ruling, it would take effect and that ruling says that women beyond seven weeks pregnant cannot take Mifepristone. Well, up until now they've been able to get it up to 10 weeks pregnant. And also telehealth and prescription by mail options would just be eliminated. So women for the past few years, they've been able to get this prescribed online by their doctor and then get it in the mail. That however, would end overnight tonight, if the Supreme Court does not step in here. Now, DOJ has laid this all out in their filing to the Supreme Court and they're arguing right off the bat several things. They're saying, look, this drug has been approved for more than 20 years since the year 2000. It's survived five presidential administrations because of the scientific backing for this. And the World Health Organization has this drug listed on its list of essential medicines. So the DOJ is doing all they can to put all of their arguments before the Supreme Court. It is now in the hands of the Supreme Court. Erica and Bianna, we're expecting that potentially the Supreme Court might rule by the end of the business day. But really, A, they don't have to act here, although it's likely they will. And they could act all the way up until that 1 am East Coast deadline. So we'll see the clock is really ticking here and a lot is at stake, guys.",

In Broward County where I am from, two women suffered from PPROM which is where your water breaks early.Anya (ph) - these brave women share their stories. She went to the hospital. She asked for help. They told her to go home and wait. She delivered the fetus in a toilet. She hemorrhaged so much that she lost half the blood in her body according to her medical records. She had her - the doctor told her husband you need to prepare for the worst and she may not be able to have children now. Shinae (ph), same situation, went to two hospitals. Nobody wanted to help her. Deborah (ph) from Lakeland (ph) had - the fetus had Potter syndrome. She could not find two doctors to sign off to terminate that pregnancy. She was forced to carry that pregnancy without amniotic fluid in her body, which is very painful, and deliver her dead baby. Now when you talk to the bill sponsors, they'll say, well, that's covered in the language. And I am saying it's not covered because we have four situations in Florida women - brave women that we know of who came forward and said no one should have to go through with this. And so my language actually put the doctors - look, we know this is going to happen, let's give you some coverage. Because the doctors now in the state of Florida, they can't make the best decision because they're faced with a third degree felony charge. They're faced with losing their license. I mean, it's crazy. So you have doctors who are playing lawyers and then you have lawyers who are playing doctors because in Deborah's (ph) situation, the hospital vetoed the decision to terminate the pregnancy. Women are going to die because of this and because they refuse to clarify that language. They're going to be more Anyas (ph), and Deborahs (ph), and Annabelles (ph) and Shinaes (ph) in this world.
