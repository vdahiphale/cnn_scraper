Justin Pearson was one of three Democrats who loudly demanded stricter gun laws after a deadly school shooting and that didn't go over well with the Republican supermajority. A vote on whether to reinstate Pearson happens in the coming hours. A group of anti-abortion doctors that sued to ban a common abortion medication is urging a U.S. appeals court to uphold the ruling that would take the drug off the market. The group filed its response to requests from the U.S. Justice Department and the maker of the drug mifepristone, asking that a Texas judge's decision to suspend the pills 23-year-old FDA approval be allowed to take effect on Friday. The appeals court wants the Justice Department and drugmaker Danco Laboratories to respond by midday on Wednesday. And the Manhattan district attorney who filed criminal charges against Donald Trump is firing back at one of the former president's closest allies. Alvin Bragg is suing Congressman Jim Jordan, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, who's promised an investigation into Bragg. Bragg calls the Republican investigation an unprecedentedly brazen and unconstitutional attack by members of Congress on an ongoing New York state criminal prosecution and investigation. He also says, quote, Chairman Jordan and the committee are participating in a campaign of intimidation, retaliation and obstruction. Bragg is asking a federal court to block testimony before Jordan's committee by a former senior prosecutor in his office, plus possible testimony by Bragg himself. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Scott has been testing the waters for months now with the listening tour in February and frequent visits to Iowa. Which of course, leads the Republican primary and caucus season. An exploratory committee is often a way for presidential hopefuls to gauge interest before officially becoming a candidate. He scheduled to hold events in Iowa later on today.The U.S. president is waking up in Belfast, Northern Ireland today. He's on a four-day visit meant to coincide with the 25th anniversary of the U.S. brokered Good Friday Agreement, which is the peace pact that ended the troubles. The British Prime Minister greeted Joe Biden upon his arrival and the two were expected to hold talks fairly soon. President Biden will later head to the Republic of Ireland. He's traveling with family and they will be exploring their Irish roots. We go now to CNN's Kevin Liptak, who is live for us in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Kevin, I believe the two leaders are going to be meeting over coffee. We're not expecting a press conference.

And you'll remember Sunak is expected at the White House next month for more formal talks. Their talks today aren't necessarily the full blown out robust one on one meeting that these two leaders will have next month. And I think high on the agenda for them today is actually the situation here in Northern Ireland, sort of the reason that President Biden is here in the first place.Of course, they both want to get this devolved government, the power sharing government back functioning here in Northern Ireland. And of course, both leaders would have liked to see that happen before President Biden arrived, but there continues to be this dispute over Brexit trade rules. The Unionists in that government have withdrawn and it's been nonfunctioning for over a year now. And that is sort of one of the unfulfilled ambitions of the Good Friday Agreement. Of course, that is the agreement that President Biden is here to celebrate. And I think it's notable, he won't be speaking to lawmakers at any point on this trip in a formal speech. Instead, he'll be speaking to students at Ulster University. Really trying to focus not necessarily on this region's bloody past, but instead on its future, on the potential for economic investments in this region. And you know, a lot of those students may not have even been born in 1998. They may not have any direct memory of the troubles themselves. President Biden really wanting to emphasize the potential in this region instead of just sort of its very troubled history. From here he does head south to the Republic of Ireland later this afternoon. That will include the first of two stops on this trip. And one of the President Biden's sort of ancestral hometowns. It will be in County Louth. That is where President Biden's great, great, great grandfather Owen Finnegan, who was born in 1818. He was a shoemaker. He left for the United States in 1849 sort of around the era of the Irish famine. That's really kind of the origin moment for President Biden's Irish history, Bianca.",

WNBA star Brittney Griner is writing a memoir about her detention in Russia.

Griner has resigned with the Phoenix Mercury and will be on the court when the WNBA season starts next month.
