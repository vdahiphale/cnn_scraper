      "sentences": "Welcome to our continuing coverage of an Iranian missile barrage on Israel. I'm Jim Sciutto, live in Tel Aviv.The IDF says that Iran fired some 180 missiles at Israel. CNN, my team and I witnessed the barrage as it rained down on Tel Aviv. Iran says the attack was its response to last week's strike in Beirut, which killed Hezbollah's leader as well as an Iranian commander. It also cited the assassination of a Hamas leader in Tehran weeks before. The IDF now says that Iran's attack tonight will face serious consequences. Our Nic Robertson is in Haifa in northern Israel. And Nic, one of the nightmare scenarios for Israel has been a multi-front attack at once. I wonder, in the midst of these missiles coming from Iran, did you witness fire coming from the north as well, coming from Hezbollah in southern Lebanon?",

      "sentences": "Jim, if there was fire from Hezbollah, it didn't appear to us from where we are here in Haifa or over in the west of the northern front, it didn't appear to be significant or strong. And of course, this will have been part of Iran's calculus for why it wanted to strike Israel, because it recognizes Hezbollah's weakness and wanted to show support for Hezbollah, but not just because it wanted to show support, because it was always, as you know, understood in this region that Hezbollah was a deterrence force, an Iranian proxy deterrence against Israel targeting Iran. And suddenly that deterrence through Israel's strikes on the Hezbollah leadership, its command and control, its weapon systems, had suddenly been weakened.And I think we can judge by what we saw this evening that there weren't big barrages of Hezbollah rockets coming in support of Iran, that Hezbollah is, in fact, in a very, very weak position. So as Israel considers its response and its deterrence, it will understand it doesn't have to worry in the short term as much about Hezbollah responding. So I think what we may see tonight could be very significant, Jim. SCIUTTO: No question. And of course, you still have going on an Israeli ground operation in southern Lebanon, which was, until a few hours ago, right, the big escalatorious step of the last several days.",

With April and this most recent one, the fact that most missiles were shot down, is that an indicator that the Iranian capability is lesser than imagined? I suppose we'll see in the coming days and weeks.Nic Robertson in Haifa, thanks so much. Well, President Biden, he spoke about the Iranian attack just moments ago, and here's what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, (D) U.S. PRESIDENT: At my direction, the United States military actively supported the defense of Israel, and we're still assessing the impact. But based on what we know now, the attack appears to have been defeated and ineffective, and this is testament to Israeli military capability and the U.S. military. It's also a testament to intensive planning between the United States and Israel to anticipate and defend against the brazen attack we expected. Make no mistake, the United States is fully, fully, fully supportive of Israel. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "I certainly wouldn't disagree with that, Jim, but you're right to point out that he refused to put a specific answer on it. We did hear from National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan as well as from the State Department that there would be consequences facing Iran and that effectively this can't go unanswered and that the U.S. wants to have discussions with Israel in the coming days over what that response looks like. If that's the case, first it implies the response will not be immediate, or at least the U.S. is urging Israel not to carry out an immediate response so that the U.S. can have time to weigh in, so that there can be consultations and discussions.Of course, this, as Israel promises, that response is very much coming. But we repeatedly pressed Major General Pat Ryder on whether the U.S. was taking -- was putting on or off the table the possibility of the U.S. striking Iran directly. It certainly seems very unlikely, especially because the U.S. has been pushing and continues to push for de-escalation. So it just doesn't seem like something that's going to be in the U.S. move in the coming days. I think we very much expect it coming from the Israelis sometime soon here. The question is the timing and what are the targets here. Does Israel go after Iran's nuclear program? Does it go after its oil and natural gas, one of its major profit and revenue centers that basically allows the entire country to keep on running? Does it go after weapons, weapons that it uses against Israel or others, or weapons it supplies to Russia? All that, I suspect, is what the U.S. will want to discuss with Israel before Israel carries out that attack. The question, will Israel wait for those conversations, and will Israel even be listening to those conversations?",

I mean, we saw a number of them in and around Tel Aviv. Again, not clear, similar to where you are, as to whether they were a missile strike as intended or a piece of a missile after it was intercepted or perhaps one of the interceptors, but still there were impacts, and some of those impacts caused damage.It's remarkable, I think, when you look at that, that there were no casualties, at least in Israel, although I understand there are reports of a Palestinian killed in Jericho in the West Bank.",

There are also two lightly or moderately wounded individuals in and around Tel Aviv, as reported by Israeli health authorities.Here, luckily, there were no casualties, but it is important to note that just a couple of hours before whatever missile it was that landed here hit, there were children in this school. This was a school day, an elementary school day, and as I said, these are 2nd grade classrooms, 3rd grade classrooms in this building right behind me, and clearly you can see the power of the impact that this missile had. When you look at the size of the crater, as these workers here, including, we've seen several folks from the Israeli military, the Home Front Command here, as they continue to pick through the debris, identify the pieces of shrapnel and make a formal determination about exactly what kind of missile actually made impact in this, on these school grounds.

      "sentences": "Israel says Iran's missile attack was serious and will have serious consequences. Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps says it was attempting with these missiles to hit military and security sites. It says it targeted three bases around Tel Aviv. Israel says that in total, Iran fired some 180 missiles.Also in Israel today, police say six civilians were killed in a stabbing and shooting attack in Jaffa in Tel Aviv. At least 12 other people were wounded. Police say two attackers were neutralized at the scene. They are investigating it as a terrorist attack. Joining us now is Cedric Leighton, retired U.S. Air Force Colonel and CNN Military Analyst. Good to have you on. As Israel contemplates its response to this strike, and it's been quite public about saying it will have a military response, I want to ask you a specific question about one of those options that's apparently on the table, and that is the possibility of striking Iranian nuclear sites. There's been some public commentary for years that Israel could not do so without U.S. help, whether help to get out Iranian surface-to-air missile sites or refueling help. Is that still true, that Israel would need U.S. help to do so, or could it strike them on its own? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (Ret.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, Jim, I think they could strike those installations on its own, and the reason I say that is looking at what the Israelis were able to do with the strike on Hudaydah in Yemen just the other day. That is about the same distance from Israel to Hudaydah as you have from Israel to some of the Iranian targets or potential Iranian targets, and the Iranians do have an aerial refueling capability. Where it's a bit more difficult to go after Iranian targets in that kind of scenario is the fact that they would have to overfly some possibly hostile countries, or at least countries that would not want them to fly over their airspace for that purpose. So that might make a bit of a difference, or they could circumvent the Arabian Peninsula and go down, you know, via the Red Sea, then the Arabian Sea, and then up through the Persian Gulf. That would be another way of doing it. If they did something like that, the Israelis would have to refuel probably several times if they used the F-35 to do such -- to conduct such a strike, but it is technically possible for them to do it, yes.",

      "sentences": "I think Iran wanted to do some damage. Now, you know, you do have to caveat it a little bit by looking at, you know, what happened in April, as you pointed out, Jim. There are, you know, certainly indications from April that there was signaling involved and that they were, in essence, sending some missiles up in order to about 300 of them, plus -- you know, including the drones, that is, to, you know, create at least a wave effect.So in some ways, they -- I think in April they were actually testing the Israeli missile defense systems with kind of an en masse attack. Now, this time around, it seems like something similar occurred and that they were targeting several specific areas. They actually announced that they were going after the Israeli intelligence headquarters and three bases. So with that in mind, then I would say that they were actually trying to target some of these areas, hoping to get through, and basically if one missile gets through and causes damage, that, in essence, is a victory for them. And this time, it really didn't seem to happen at all.",

We thought that their capabilities were a bit more extensive, and in this particular case it looks like it's basically things that were put together in, you know, somewhat of a haphazard fashion.Not that they don't have a significant capability. They do, but that capability does have limitations, and those limitations might be a bit more severe than we thought.",

And this is really, Jim, the scenario that so many leaders in the Middle East were warning the United States about, that as long as the war in Gaza goes on and the death toll mounts and the violence goes on, the conflict would spread. Now it's spread to Lebanon.This evening we're seeing clearly Iran and Israel are about to already in a situation where they could be basically at a long-distance war as well. And there really is a sense of exasperation among many leaders in the region, including many U.S. allies in the Arab world, that the United States just simply hasn't done enough over the last year to try to push for some sort of diplomatic solution. We've seen plenty of trips by Secretary of State Antony Blinken to the Middle East, I think 10 at this point in the last 12 months. But at the end of the day, there's very little to show for it. So we find ourselves on the brink, if not already in the regional war that so many were afraid of. And there doesn't seem to be any foot on the brakes at the moment. The United States obviously coming to the aid of its ally Israel, but there are broader concerns in this part of the world. And certainly things could get dramatically worse at this point we are expecting, of course, perhaps even within the next few hours, an Israeli attack on Iran. And that could set in motion a scenario of back-and-forth attacks between the two countries while there is war raging between Hezbollah and Israel here in Lebanon, while the war goes on in Gaza. So we're at a very dangerous tipping point, and there doesn't seem to be any countervailing force to try to stop the region and sucking the United States in with it over the brink into the abyss.

And I just wonder what gets us out of this, right?

But I don't know that Israel has the bunker busters it needs to definitively take out some of Iran's nuclear technology. Reports keep emerging about new facilities that are buried deeper underground.Iran has been working to hide its progress. Israel also risks tipping Iran over the nuclear line. So far, Iran hasn't actually produced a nuclear weapon. It's perhaps weeks away from being able to do one, but it hasn't made the decision to build a weapon. Depending on how hard Israel attacks, it might push Tehran to build that weapon, and then you've got a nuclear arms race potentially across the Middle East. Israel has to contend with that. So that's why I think you might instead see some sort of calibrated punishment that causes more pain than the last time, but still doesn't cause major civilian casualties or troop casualties, but somehow cripples something that Iran truly values. Maybe they'll hit the oil fields, but I think they would do oil fields through a cyberattack, not something declared.",
