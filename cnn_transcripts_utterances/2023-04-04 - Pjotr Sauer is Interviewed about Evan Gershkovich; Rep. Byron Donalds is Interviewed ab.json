In just hours, he will turn himself in behind me at the building, 100 Center Street, as the first American president in history to ever face criminal charges. Sources tell CNN that Trump is facing more than 30 counts, all related to business fraud. The grand jury indictment, though, is still under seal. We don't know the details. Neither does Trump's legal team as of this moment. One of his advisers described his mood yesterday as he headed from his home in Florida here to Manhattan as defiant and focused. Our live coverage continues throughout the morning. Poppy.",

American detainee Paul Whelan was also held there before he was sent to a Russian penal colony. Evan faces up to 20 years in prison on these espionage charges. His parents fled the Soviet Union. His colleagues say he fell in love with Russia, with its culture, with its language. He made Moscow his second home. He also worked to hold the Kremlin accountable. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) EVAN GERSHKOVICH, DETAINED \"WSJ\" REPORTER: No longer is Russia fighting Ukraine, but the whole west. Nothing that might even be taken as a sign of dissent is allowed in Russia right now. It's massively early to say Russia's, you know, a dying power. They are worried, extremely worried, about what I think everybody has seen as an increasingly erratic government in Moscow. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Bragg, however, so far has refused to cooperate with that, saying he does not believe there is legislative purpose. Joining us now is Republican Congressman Byron Donalds of Florida, who we should note serves on the House Oversight and Reform Committees. Good morning, Congressman. Thank you for being here. Obviously, we've been talking about this indictment for Trump today. We're going to see him at the building behind me in just a matter of hours from now. Do you think the indictment helps or hurts him politically? REP. BYRON DONALDS (R-FL): Well, look, it absolutely is going to help him in a Republican primary. You know, you -- as we speak, Republican voters are rallying around President Trump simply because what they view is an indictment that makes no sense at all, an indictment that is pure politics, a political persecution of a political enemy, something that the American people frankly despised in our country, simply not for.",
