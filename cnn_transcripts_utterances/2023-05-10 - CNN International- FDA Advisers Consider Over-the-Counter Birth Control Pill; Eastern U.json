It's available for public comment from now through June 5. But based on current incidences rates, it's estimated that 12.9 percent of women born in the United States today will develop breast cancer at some time during their lives. And it's important to catch these cancers early. That gives a better chance of survival.Now meanwhile, this update does not change recommendations for women at high risk of getting breast cancer. Those women should still keep in contact with their doctors for what's best for them. But for all of us, for all women, it's important to discuss with our doctors our family history of cancer, whether you have dense breasts. Ask for a breast exam at your next appointment and talk to your doctors about when to start screening for you based on your own risk factors and how often. Back to you. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Because obviously, the support that they have from their populations that continue to spend so much money and support Ukraine is dependent on how those expectations are set. Ukrainian commanders very well aware of that particular dynamic.When we talk to them, they are cautious. And they talk about how perhaps this is misunderstood in the West. That this is a counteroffensive that will be potentially very bloody. It's not like a war game, not like Hollywood, some of them say to us. So, I think that there's a real understanding of that dynamic. There's a real hope here that they can break through. They have had a success over the weekend not far away in Bakhmut in the east of Ukraine. Able to take several kilometers of ground there. One officer involved in that told us that they intercepted Russian communications and that the Russians were surprised that they lost ground. Other reports saying that significant numbers of Russian soldiers and Wagner mercenaries killed in that particular offensive. But I think when you step back from that sort of immediacy of the frontline and we're able to get insights often about how it looks and feels close to frontlines, we step back 12 miles -- 20 kilometers or so perhaps from the frontlines. So, take a look at people's lives there who are so close to the frontline in reality because shells and missiles can hit them and how they are getting on with their lives.

They're now saying the U.N. has said that on Sunday and Monday there were no inspections of ships. They've restarted inspections on outbound ships that are leaving Ukrainian ports for the global markets through those sort of maritime corridors that were agreed.But, you know, Russia is making this hard. There were expert level talks last week that did not end well. They're now moving to senior level talks. They're expected to start today in Istanbul with deputy foreign ministers from U.N. -- from Ukraine, from Russia and Turkey and U.N. representatives as well. To try to revive this deal. I think the problem for Russia is that they're saying that a separate agreement that was agreed last July which was supposed to help smooth the path to their (INAUDIBLE) exports to global markets is not being met. They're saying sanctions are getting in the way. Clearly there looking to have some of those sanctions lifted. But I think, you know, this is also Russia at a time when it's clearly on the back foot on the battlefield struggling to defend as well as attack.

The plant has been occupied by Russia really since the first weeks of the war. They need them there to keep running it. Russia doesn't have people that they can just bring in just like that to keep running this plant. So that I think, what's going on here. But it is extremely nerve-racking. We know that this plant is vulnerable. We know there's weapons on the site -- certainly according to the Ukrainians. But I think the most important thing here is what we don't know. We don't have a lot of visibility about what Russia has been doing there. How they've been running it. The amount of military equipment there.
