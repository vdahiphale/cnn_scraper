British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak starting day two on the job. He is expected to face his first questions in parliament in just a few hours. How Sunak plans to handle Britain's economic crisis will most likely be addressed and be top of that agenda.Americans will decide the fate of the House and Senate in just over two weeks from today. More than 9 million early and absentee ballots have already been cast for the U.S. midterm elections on November 8. More on both these stories in \"EARLY START.\" Now it's a bad day to be Ye brands. It's a tough time for the rapper who formerly went by Kanye West after he doubled down on anti-Semitic comments made online. The company is saying nay to Ye, and that includes Adidas, which worked with West for nearly a decade. Forbes has dropped him from billionaires list saying the botch deals now make him worth a mere $400 million. Former fans torched their Yeezy, protests that the former with one Florida man saying that he's burned $15,000 worth of his 40 pair Yeezy collection. Two high profile athletes have also left Ye's sports agency. Aron Donald with the LA Rams, and Jaylen Brown from the Boston Celtics, both said they oppose hate speech and antisemitism, though neither mentioned Ye in their statements. The CEO of the Anti-Defamation League says now is the time for Ye to learn from his mistakes. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JONATHAN GREENBLATT, CEO, ANTI-DEFAMATION LEAGUE: I wish it had happened sooner but this does send a strong statement that there are consequences when you express antisemitism in any form of hate. It's just not in line with our values in society. I don't believe in cancel culture, I believe in council culture. You need to embrace the sinner and help him understand why what they did offends so they won't do it again and they are enlightened as a result. That's how in society we move forward. Which is why with Kanye it was so problematic. Because when offered, for example, to visit the Holocaust Museum or when individuals like me and others said, hey, let's work together, he not only rejected them, he used those as opportunities to spout even more anti-Semitic toxins. So, look, whether it's happening, you know, on the public stage, on a college campus, you know, at the voting booth antisemitism and hate should never be tolerated no matter what the source.

An oil rich state and yet it's been like this for weeks. In fact, the waters have receded now but here is no end in sight.The Nigerian government is warning that Bayelsa and four other states that are the worst affected could see even more rainfall until the end of November which means the waters could come much higher. And you already see this. This is a main street in the capital and this is a reality. So many people are only getting by using boats. They used to be able to walk here and drive here. Only the brave are willing to drive here. You see cars over there are underwater. The man across the street has got the water all the way down to his waist. And some people are still living in those homes. Do you see across the street, you see buildings that are completely shut down. The business cannot operate because the water gets all the way to the steps and the ground floor is completely written off. But this is not just happening in this state of southern Nigeria, 33 other Nigerian -- 36 states have been affected by flooding this year. It's the worst flooding in a decade and it's because of poor infrastructure, well-above average rainfall and especially climate change. But the government has used that climate change as an excuse angry some Nigerians who say this is just a result of negligence. That the government didn't prepare even when there was a forecast and after the floods affected so much of the country, it didn't respond adequately. There are people sleeping right on the streets. The kids who are bathing with the water, who are cooking with it, who are washing with it and preparing food. So, one of the real fears here is cholera and other water-borne diseases very likely could be an outbreak in parts of the country. But here in Yenagoa, Bayelsa state, they have residents who've reporting seeing bodies floating on the streets because of just how much of the city and how much of the state is underwater. It's a truly tragic situation that people feel the government has not responded to effectively. And they want it declared a national emergency which the government still has not done. Because according to the Nigerian government, they are not yet overwhelmed. Though from here it doesn't look like that -- Max.",
