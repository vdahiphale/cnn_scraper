If you had chickenpox, the virus that causes that is often times can lay dormant in the body and then, for whatever reason, be reactivated when you're an adult.That can happen anywhere in the body. You can get a rash and it's usually quite painful. As you can see in the image on the screen, sometimes that virus can affect specifically the facial nerve, the nerve that you see outlined there. That can cause weakness or even paralysis of the face, you can get those lesions on the face, in the eye, ear, mouth even. Again it's quite painful. What people most notice, Brianna, is that the face looks frozen. It's just not moving as well as, for example, the other side of the face. A lot of people know what Bell's Palsy is. It's similar to Bell's Palsy. Although Ramsey-Hunt is typically something that is -- it's more severe and takes longer to recover from.",

Members of the local armed forces say they believe they have found footprints, there, circled in the mud. They believe those belong to children. These were found near a small river.It's yet another hint that the kids could still be alive after weeks alone in the Amazon. And that's after they survived a plane crash. Officers previously found a shelter the kids appeared to have made, and also have scissors and hair ties inside, other clues they've been collecting. CNN's Stefano Pozzebon joins us now from Colombia. Stefano, I wonder, it's been a few days. They have hope. They've seen these footprints and they've seen other signs. What's the status of that search? And do the searchers remain confident that they're alive and well?",

It's an entire nation that's frankly holding its breath until -- it seems at least Wednesday, when the president had announced a breakthrough had been reached, and then had to retract his comments and apologize for creating false expectations. Now, we're all waiting for this final outcome of the search. But at the same time, new details have emerged over this flight and aircraft itself. We have learned that the same aircraft, a Cessna 206, crashed in a very close-by situation, a very similar situation just two years ago. You probably see the images on the screen. That is from 2021 when the same Cessna 206 crashed. It was later repaired, the engine and the propeller were changed, and deemed fit to fly again.

But really all across Alberta it's a very similar scene, and even some other provinces across Canada. This is where you have the poor air quality alerts due to the wildfires in the areas.
