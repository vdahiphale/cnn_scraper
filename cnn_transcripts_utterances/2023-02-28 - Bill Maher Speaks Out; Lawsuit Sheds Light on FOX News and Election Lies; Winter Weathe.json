Justices are hearing arguments in two cases challenging President Biden's plan to wipe away more than $400 billion in student debt. Six Republican-led states and two individuals are challenging its legality. Let's bring in CNN's Jessica Schneider and Rene Marsh. Both are at the Supreme Court right now. Jessica, I want to start with you first. It's no surprise this is a conservative court. And, so far, it sounds like they have been pretty skeptical of the Biden administration's arguments so far.

      "sentences": "That's exactly right, Abby.The conservative members of this court are really given considerable pushback on the idea that President Biden and his administration can even put into place this sweeping debt relief. They're really zeroing in on the price tag of this program, more than 400-plus-billion dollars. And they're also wondering about the real powers of the presidency and, by way of that, his education secretary, because the main issue in this case is whether or not the Biden administration and the education secretary can wipe away what is a sweeping amount of debt for millions of students. Forty million students or borrowers are eligible; 26 million so far have applied; 16 million were approved before this program was stopped by the lower courts. And it remains blocked as the Supreme Court hears these arguments. This would really do away with up to $20,000 in debt for a number, millions of borrowers here. The solicitor general arguing for the Biden administration is saying that, yes, this administration has the power to wipe away some of this debt because of the HEROES Act. And that act, that statute says that the education secretary can waive or modify loan provisions in the event of an emergency. The administration is pointing to the ongoing COVID pandemic as that emergency, but, again, the conservative justice is here acting very skeptical. They're saying that this big of a program, 400-plus-billion dollars, should really be in the hands of Congress. They asked about separation of powers. And then Justice Neil Gorsuch and other conservative justices also touched on this idea of fairness. Take a listen. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) NEIL GORSUCH, U.S. SUPREME COURT ASSOCIATE JUSTICE:  What I think they argue that is missing is cost to other persons in terms of fairness, for example, people who've paid their loans, people who don't -- have planned their lives around not seeking loans, and people who are not eligible for loans in the first place, and that a half-a-trillion dollars is being diverted to one group of favored persons over others.

You can see the snow blanketing Hartford, Connecticut, and Boston could see up to six inches of snow by the end of the day. But, also, in parts of California, they are still cleaning up from the last snowfall, and now even more is on the way.

It is still very treacherous at some points, where we see some rockslides and some snowslides onto the road. All of this has made it very difficult for them to get emergency services to people up there. And a lot of people were trapped over the weekend. In fact, we just talked to a group of friends who were coming up here to an Airbnb to celebrate one of their buddies' birthdays, and a two-hour drive took them 10 hours. And it got so treacherous on Friday evening that they ended up abandoning one of their cars, and they were just now digging it out. So that just gives you an idea of what they have been dealing with. Over the weekend, we know that there were 600 kids who were at a science camp who were supposed to come home on Friday, but were not able to make it home. But they got a nice extra escort by officials to get them out over the weekend. They actually got home yesterday, just because that's how bad it was. What they have seen in this area, Abby, is three times the amount of annual snowfall in less than four days. And guess what? We're not done. This is the first time that we have even seen a blizzard warning for San Bernardino County, was just last week. We're expecting two to three more feet of snow to come in later on this evening and tomorrow. And, as you can see, they're still very much working on it, because up there you see some of that fog. We were just up there. It's not easy to see. The visibility is low. And there are still a lot of cars under snow abandoned on the side of the highway.",

And they did it because they needed it to deliver much-needed ratings. And the conservative media mogul also took explicit steps to make sure that he and the network were helping the Trump campaign and the Republican Party. Our CNN senior media reporter, Oliver Darcy, has been tracking all of this and this extraordinary lawsuit. Oliver, look, we saw the evidence that FOX hosts spread the election lies. They knew that they weren't true. Now we have Murdoch providing a lot more details about the extent of it. In this latest filing, it really shows that there is knowledge at the top, the very tippy tops of the FOX structure, about what was going on there. And they knew that it wasn't true.",

It continues to expose FOX for the dishonest organization it is, and it starts at the very top with Rupert Murdoch, who is, of course, the FOX Corporation chair and the boss behind the whole network. And in this legal filing, we have now our first look at Rupert Murdoch's deposition that was taken by Dominion last month. And, in it, he acknowledges that his top hosts, people like Sean Hannity, Jeanine Pirro, Maria Bartiromo, that they endorsed -- that's the language he used -- that they endorsed some of Trump's election lies, despite them knowing and him knowing that they were not true. This is a big deal because FOX has really been arguing that the hosts maybe didn't endorse it, but they gave -- they allowed commentators to come on the air and make some of these remarks as part of news coverage of Trump's election lies. But Murdoch himself is saying, no, they endorsed these lies. And elsewhere, in private e-mails that Dominion has obtained, for instance, Murdoch is calling those lies. He says they're damaging to the country. He at one point referred to them as B.S. And so it's very clear that, behind the scenes, FOX executives, FOX stars knew that these lies were not true, but they continued to peddle it to their viewers, and, it seems, because of a financial incentive.",

And it seems that the opposite has really happened. The liars haven't been punished. They're still on prime time at FOX. They're still holding high -ranking positions, like being a CEO of FOX News. The people who were seemingly punished were the people trying to tell the truth. In this filing, it's revealed that Bill Sammon, who was the FOX News D.C., bureau chief, Murdoch suggested that he should be fired because he oversaw that call where FOX News called Arizona, you will remember, before anyone else, for Joe Biden, which effectively gave Biden the election. And so Murdoch said, we should maybe fire this guy, and suggested it would be a good show of faith to the Trump supporters. And so that's really what's shocking here, is that the people who are lying are still in their positions. People like Bill Sammon, who seemingly wanted to just deliver the news, tell the truth, they have been let go or reprimanded.",

      "sentences": "Yes, it is really shocking. That's probably the best way to describe it, but also really reveals, I think, what a lot of people see when they watch FOX as well.Oliver Darcy, thanks for all of that. And let's get some more on this from former U.S. attorney Harry Litman. So, Harry, all of that we just went through with Oliver is pretty damning in a lot of ways. You have top FOX executives and anchors. They're admitting that they knowingly lied on the air. You have evidence that staffers who pushed back on those lies were punished, proof that the directive was coming from the top of the network, and it was to help Trump. And you have testimony that it wasn't about the truth. It was about ratings, and it was about money. So putting all of these together, this is a defamation case. They have to -- Dominion has to prove that FOX knew that they disregarded the truth. Are they going to be able to do that in this case? HARRY LITMAN, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY:  Yes, I think so. And, as you suggest, it's a really rare and hard burden. Since the Supreme Court put that requirement in place, it's almost never happened that somebody can be a big media defendant like this. But as Oliver -- he made a very good tour of sort of big details here, Rupert Murdoch essentially throwing several reporters under the train. The entire organization knows that it's a lie, and they continue to push it. And as he also detailed, they're basically not -- acting not as a news organization, but as an arm of the Republican Party. So it's all revealing and stunning, as you say. It's also totally down the middle for the legal claim they're making, because we know it's false. And it really will come down to, did they know it's false? And this most recent filing has vivid details, especially including Murdoch, who oddly is ready to give up on a lot of its reporters, but just wants to say FOX itself didn't do that. That's not sort of a legal distinction. And Dominion, I think, is going to get to trial in a couple of months and going to be able to prove, it seems, an overwhelming case that FOX knew and, at a minimum, was reckless about -- that also counts under the law.",

And that is his primary focus right now, not only to sell books, but also, if he does, in fact, launch a nationwide campaign.I mean, polls indicate that he is the second most popular Republican presidential candidate, were he to run, second only to Donald Trump. He's competitive with Donald Trump in that sense. He's in double digits. And these issues are ones that those voters really care about and like him for. I mean, Florida is, I think it's fair to say, a red state now, as opposed to what it was 10, 20 years ago. But one of the reasons is because of Republicans like Ron DeSantis. I mean, you remember, he barely won reelection -- barely won election in 2018, and then he won with almost 60 percent of the vote last November. So he's doing a decent job, not only selling himself to more traditionally Democratic voters, but also maybe even bringing some people into the Republican Party.",

For example, if the Democrats are going to have their convention in Georgia in 2024, why couldn't the Major League Baseball All-Star Game be held there a few years ago after that new voting legislation passed? So, I do think that there is an opportunity there for conservatives to say that corporations are getting too political. By the same token, the Disney situation is also different, because Disney started off with this special territory that they got to self-govern. So it wasn't like they were being penalized from something that every other corporation and company in Florida had. It's some sort of special dispensation that was taken away. But, as you note, Abby, Vice President Mike Pence disagrees. And I think there is going to be a robust debate within the Republican Party in the primary about what exactly conservatism is. Is it letting companies run themselves without the pushback from the government, or is it good to have a fighter in there representing the conservative cause, which is, I think, how DeSantis is positioning himself?",
