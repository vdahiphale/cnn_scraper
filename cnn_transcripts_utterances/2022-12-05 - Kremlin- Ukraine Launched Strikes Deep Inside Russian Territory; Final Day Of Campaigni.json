Moscow accusing Ukraine of plotting deadly attacks, as the former right-hand man of Putin's private army warns on OUTFRONT that he is out for ultimate power.Plus, an unexpected hero in the Twitter files. The Democratic who demanded answers about why Twitter buried a story about Hunter Biden in an election year. Congressman Ro Khanna speaks out OUTFRONT. And China operating more than 100 police stations across the globe as Chinese leader Xi Jinping tries to crack down on protesters outside of China. Let's go OUTFRONT. Good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, the explosions deep inside Russia. I want to show you the video of what Moscow claims as a Ukrainian drone strike on a military base. This is one of two bases hit in what are the closest strikes to Moscow since the start of Putin's invasion. You can see it there on the screen. According to Russia, at least three people were killed. And I'll show you a before and after picture of one of the bases. So, on the left, you can see what appears to be the exact location of one of the blasts. And to the right, what the area looked like before. And there are new images from the ground. A fuel truck destroyed, also damages to a bomber that was loaded with a missile ready to use. And this is significant, right, a bomber loaded for a missile ready to use, it comes on a day as Ukraine's air force says it took down more than 60 Russian missiles. You see some of the images here. Could've been 61, except for that bomber was taken out. It is an incredible development here what exactly happened on those bases. And it comes as the head of the infamous and brutal Wagner Group of Yevgeny Prigozhin is now threatening the United States, warning Washington tonight not to designate his group as a terrorist organization, referencing al Qaeda with this threat, and I quote him, they've already put one organization on the list of terrorist organizations and they got a response that made them tremble. Do not wake Wagner PMC, Americans. Well, I spoke exclusively to Prigozhin's former right-hand man, a former commander for Russia's notorious private army, a man who worked closely with Prigozhin and was key in running the Wagner Group's tactical operations in Syria. He knows Prigozhin well, and he told me that Prigozhin has the ambitions far outside of Russia and that his ultimate goal may be to topple Putin himself.

The two Russian bases that were attacked overnight are between 300 and 350 miles from Ukrainian territory. So when we see the blast go off in the video of your screen, this is 300 to 350 mile as way from Ukraine. The drones that we know Ukraine has and its arsenal do not travel that far. But we saw something, General, and that was that this weekend, Ukraine's state-owned weapons manufacturer announced that it successfully completed tests on a new kamikaze drone with a range of more than 600 miles, okay? That would easily enable them to do this, and I'll show everyone a photo of the drone. So, again, we don't know if it was used in this attack. But, General, if it was and Ukraine has successfully now on its own -- the U.S. isn't giving it the capability to strike that far, preventing them from doing so. If they now have the ability to have their own drones that can go 600 miles into Russia, what does that mean, and what do you think happened at these bases?",

So that's one thing that he's not going to be able to escape.Secondly, I think the fighting around Bakhmut, and Sam did a good job reporting on that, the fighting in Bakhmut seems totally disconnected from anything else that's going on. And I think this was a reflection of the fact that Prigozhin does not take his orders from the general staff, he does not take his orders from Minister Shoigu. He is basically conducting his own operations in an area that is not strategically important for Ukraine or for the Russians. But yet he's pouring in capability and troops that are there. And I think this was for his own purposes. And the final part, of course, as Dr. Timothy Snyder said, it's bad to lose in Ukraine, but it's worse to lose in Russia. And I think Prigozhin is setting up himself, as Mr. Kadyrov, for this power struggling that's happening below the surface inside Russia.",

Congressman Ro Khanna is next.Plus, we take you to China to see firsthand the lines that people are now enduring in the rain and the cold just to get tested for COVID, to get takeout at McDonald's. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [19:30:51] BURNETT: Tonight, the Twitter files. New emails and documents reveal just how intense the debate inside Twitter in 2020 was, as the company went to great lengths to suppress a \"New York Post\" story about Hunter Biden and his laptop. That laptop contained a trove of personal and business emails that critics claimed were proof of corrupt activity by both Joe and Hunter Biden, in which Trump supporters say would've impacted the election if not censored. Well, the communications were obtained by a writer Matt Taibbi. They show the internal debates over removing links to the story, labeling the story unsafe and locking out accounts that tried to share the story. In one exchange, a top Twitter official says, in part, quote, I'm struggling to understand the policy basis for marking this as unsafe. And the files show this, that at least one Democratic congressman tried to sound the alarm. Ro Khanna emailing Twitter's top lawyer at the time, in part, and I quote, Ro Khanna, this seems a violation of the First Amendment principles. I say this as a total Biden partisan and convinced he didn't do anything wrong. But in the heat of a presidential campaign, restricting dissemination of newspaper articles even if \"The New York Post\" is far right seems like it will invite more backlash than it will do good. And Congressman Khanna is OUTFRONT now. He's a member of the House Oversight Committee. Your first television interview since I saw this. And, you know, I saw this and really, I've read it many, many times, because you really stood up for what you believe is true. So, let me start here, Congressman. That was what you said then. You had only limited information at the time, right? You just knew that it was being suppressed and you wanted to make a statement. Has anything that you have learned so far from the Twitter investigation in the past hours and days surprised you? REP. RO KHANNA (D-CA):  Erin, what surprised me is that Twitter made the decision in the first place to censor. Look, liberal Democrats should be for the principle of standing up for First Amendment speech. And \"New York Times'\" Sullivan said: we want speech to be open, uninhibited, wide ranging. I get Twitter's a private actor, but they're effectively a modern public square. And it was disappointing to me that they were suppressing \"The New York Post\".",

KHANNA:  Well, I mean, look, we've all written emails, and I'm glad that they released that one. I'm sure I've written things that they aren't as thoughtful. But when I read it, I said, I stand by every word. I mean, I got into politics partly because I believe American democracy is great where we have everyone have a voice to stand up and participate in speech.

Suddenly amidst all this, the protest, the zero COVID that you're reporting on, he appears with President Xi Jinping bowing to the former leader of China's body at a military hospital in Beijing.
