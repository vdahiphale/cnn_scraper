JIM SCIUTTO, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: You know, Kate, what I hear, I hear daylight between the Israeli government position and the position of the U.S., its closest ally. President Biden has said that he does not support an Israeli reoccupation of Gaza. Now, Netanyahu did not say reoccupy, but he did say maintain security responsibility, which you would imagine involves a continued Israeli military presence there. And he did not define exactly how long that is. Is it weeks, months, is it years? You know, it was 18 years ago that Israel withdrew from Gaza and handed it to Palestinian control. And it's not the only instance of daylight between Israel and the U.S. on the question of a cease-fire. You hear Blinken and others say that there's great support for some sort of humanitarian pause. You know, Blinken describes that in very short term, limited terms, it seems. That's one thing. And also, it seems that his requirement to have a cease-fire is the release of all the hostages which does not seem like a realistic prospect at this point. In fact the negotiations this weekend with Blinken in the region focused on releasing women and children first. So on all those issues you have distance between the U.S. and Israeli positions.

With every day that has passed, things have gotten worse. The U.N. is now saying that 70 percent of Gaza's two million population is now living internally displaced and living in inhuman conditions. So no water, no food, no sanitation, and that that has got to stop. And yet here we are one month on and neither the loud calls from regional leaders that have gone on for much of that month for a humanitarian cease-fire nor indeed the American -- now American position now of coming into that and also calling for some kind of humanitarian pause to allow the aid, nor indeed the fact that so far there have been 88 U.N. workers killed in Gaza.
