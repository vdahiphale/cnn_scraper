Winning some of these states could come down to one key demographic, the Latino vote. Latinos are the second largest and fastest-growing group of voters in the United States. The majority of them have historically voted for Democrats but a growing number of Latinos have become Republicans and many now support former president Donald Trump. CNN political contributor Ana Navarro is a Republican who's now supporting Vice President Harris in this race and recently spoke at the Democratic National Convention. She's been one of Trump's harshest and most outspoken critics. And in the next hour, she travels across the U.S. to see for herself why Trump appeals to Latino voters and which issues matter the most to them in this election. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
