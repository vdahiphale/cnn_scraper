Let's get you right to the news. Well, the American experiment endures -- those words from outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden following President-elect Donald Trump's decisive comeback victory this week. As the world braces for a second Trump presidency, Mr. Biden says he will commit to a peaceful transfer of power come inauguration day. He spoke from the Rose Garden a short time ago.

That's what the American people deserve. I also hope we can lay to rest the question about the integrity of the American electoral system. It is honest, it is fair and it is transparent.

He has been the president before. So at the beginning of this, though, will be his chief of staff. We're getting a sense of a few potential names of chief of staff. Of course, his campaign manager essentially, Susie Wiles, was one of the people really who coordinated all of this and if he selects her she would be the first female chief of staff. There has never been a chief of staff in the White House to a president who was a woman. So this certainly could be her. We'll see if she wants to move from Florida to Washington, but also a couple other names there. But bigger than that -- I mean, this is a moment for the former president to sort of put a stamp on his incoming administration. One thing we are hearing again and again he apprizes above all is loyalty. You'll remember from his first term, he found several cabinet secretaries that disloyal in his view. Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, was chief among them. So look for a loyalist and a yes men, if you will, to join his administration throughout the ranks, but particularly in key positions in the cabinet.",

But the question is what types of influence he will have.As you know, Elon Musk gets a lot of business contracts and things from his government contracts. So that will be one of the many long list of potential conflicts of interest. But look, he will have a key role in this. One thing that is not likely to be as front and center is family. Donald Trump, Jr. has been very active in the campaign, but Ivanka Trump, for example, and Jared Kushner, they have not been active in at all. That's the former president's daughter and son in law. So I do not expect this to be as much of a family affair as it was eight years ago. But there is no doubt, this -- things are moving very quickly here, and the former president is likely to come to Washington as early as next week to potentially have a meeting at the White House. So 74 days until the inauguration. But a lot of this hiring and positioning will be done between now and then.",

I'm not going to talk about anything that relates directly or indirectly to the election, he simply can't because he doesn't know what's coming, but he doesn't want to talk about the prospect and the impact of potential tax cuts in the United States, potential tariffs in the United States, and the impact perhaps, of big limits to immigration, too. The expectation is it could limit growth, it could raise prices for consumers, and that will complicate their job. The problem that he's got today is he just doesn't have the answers, and he doesn't want to weigh in until we know more. And I think that's reasonable.

Well, that's what economists say would happen under former President Trump's tariff proposal.A tariff is basically a tax on products, and Trump wants to put them on everything that comes into the U.S. That's $3 trillion worth of goods a year. In order to cover the higher tariffs, companies will have to raise prices, and that cost ultimately gets passed down to you, the consumer. So here's his plan: a 60 percent tariff on Chinese imports, and up to 20 percent on imports from other countries. Trump says it will protect working class jobs and punish countries making goods with cheap labor in unsafe conditions. The self- proclaimed tariff man is hoping the tariffs will incentivize Americans to buy more made-in-America products, and the tariffs could, in theory, raise trillions of dollars to help fund tax cuts. But economists at Goldman Sachs warn the tariffs could backfire, instead raising prices on American families, killing jobs, and setting off another trade war. Countries could then retaliate, putting their own tariffs on U.S. goods that they buy. The cost to the average American family, by one estimate, more than $2,600 per year. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

First of all, Donald Trump has said publicly that he intends to fire Jack Smith, quote, within two minutes of getting sworn in. I don't think there's any surprise about that. But even beyond that, Lynda, it's important to understand the Justice Department itself has a longstanding policy going back to Watergate in 1973, saying we do not believe we have the power to prosecute, to try and to imprison the sitting president. So here -- here we are in a situation where someone who's been indicted is about to become the sitting president.

There's issues with prosecutorial misconduct. And so I think that case is likely to go away.With respect to both state cases, one thing that is very much clear to me is there will not be a state level criminal trial of the sitting president. The state authorities do not have the power under our Constitution to try and potentially imprison the president. The principles called the Supremacy Clause, which essentially says the federal government has to be supreme to the state government.

And later in that interview, Brian Hook laid out what I've heard from sources as well, that there Trump would likely put economic pressure on Tehran, even though today the spokesman, the foreign ministry in Tehran, has said that that Trump's election, you know, offers a new opportunity for the United States to consider a new strategy.That's not at all. I think the direction that Trump will be headed in pressure on Iran, but he will also look to those strong relationships he built, particularly with Saudi Arabia, particularly with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, to move more quickly towards a normalization with Israel. That's going to be a difficulty for all the reasons we've heard about. So much recently that, you know, the crown prince is now set as a standard that the costs for him for doing that would be for Israel to recognize or at least get on an irreversible path to recognizing a Palestinian state. That's not sort of, you know, possible at the moment. But I think also, you know, how does a region react as well? We've got a sense of that already Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, even as the votes were being cast, was firing his defense minister, you know, that's probably not something that he would have done if he really thought that Kamala Harris would have won the election. We've seen as well a decision made in the Knesset today about removing from Israel any family members of terrorists who commit a terrorist act with a family member might have said something. So there are things that are being done already by Prime Minister Netanyahu that perhaps wouldn't have happened under a Trump administration -- or not happened rather under a Biden administration, that wouldn't have happened quite -- quite so quickly. So even though were only in this the very beginning of a transition phase, I think you'll perhaps see that from Prime Minister Netanyahu and then the war in Lebanon. You know, what they're weighing up in the region there is, is will Israel -- will Prime Minister Netanyahu go for a ceasefire, proposed by the Lebanese, you know, it's a -- with a -- with a sort of a temporary ceasefire, but meeting some of the conditions of what he's asked for to make the northern border of Israel safe. Will he go for that or will he -- you know, will he upscale and uptick the military action? I think when you look to Gaza, the concern there really is that at Netanyahu is pushing forward with what was known as a generals plan, which essentially forces all Palestinian residents out of the north of Gaza, something, again, that the Biden administration strongly objected to.",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRYAN LANZA, SENIOR ADVISER, TRUMP 2024 CAMPAIGN:  There's going to be a staged process. There's going to be a phase in. The easiest people to target are the criminals, the people who here have committed violent crimes illegally that are still here. You know, that's going to be step one. And once we sort of understand what step. Once we understand how step one moves forward, we'll understand -- we'll move to the next layer. But let's be clear to the American people, we are going to deport illegal aliens who've broken our laws and who have been violent to our people. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And that is exactly what was quietly happening behind the scenes both among Trump allies and some in the private sector. The private sector because the federal government often relies on contractors to help manage and build these facilities. And so they have been quietly preparing with discussing what the possibility of this could look like. And now sources tell me they are expecting that to ramp up. Now, a key component of any type of mass deportation plan is going to be detention space, because whoever they arrest, they need to put them somewhere and so the federal government has over the last several years, been quite limited in how much detention space they have, only a few ten, tens of thousands. But still far less than where many in the in the incoming Trump administration would want that number to be. Now even so, even if contractors are lined up and there are some who are, there -- money is going to be critical to this. This is going to be an expensive operation. Previous analysis has shown that it costs nearly $11,000 just to arrest, detain process and remove one individual. Plus, whatever it would cost to fly them out to their home country. So certainly this is an expensive endeavor. Officials say they are preparing for that. Now at the Homeland -- the Department of Homeland Security, they -- has been -- has been a mixed bag of emotions. They are no strangers to whiplash when it comes to immigration policy. And they're certainly bracing for what this could look like. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

This is a protection for Dreamers.The average DACA recipient has been in the United States for 25 years. They came here when they were six. So we got to be ready to say not only is that the wrong thing to do but those people deserve a pathway to citizenship. They're at risk and many people like them who have a temporary status, other people at risk are folks who are U.S. citizen households who have an undocumented family member. But to your point 1 in 3 Latinos in the United States lives in a household where they themselves or live with someone who's at risk of family separation. That is not this is not about the border. This is not about what's happening to people coming tomorrow. That's part of it. This is about American families here today, and we're going to have to show up in every single community.

But at the ocean temperature charts, you see as well this is what is throwing water cycles out of whack from Asheville, North Carolina, to Eastern Spain, and the Amazon has a drought right now, tributaries are drying up. So the United States not being fully engaged in this very global problem, you know, the atmosphere doesn't end at any border.
