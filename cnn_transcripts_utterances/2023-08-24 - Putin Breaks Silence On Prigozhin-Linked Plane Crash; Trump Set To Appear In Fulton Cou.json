Tonight, Russian PresidentVladimir Putin breaks his silence on the catastrophic plane crash that has reportedly killed his former ally and then former critic, Wagner boss, Yevgeny Prigozhin. And it's all eyes on Fulton County here in Georgia as we wait for the former U.S. President Donald Trump to be arrested for the fourth time. We'll be live outside the jail in just a few moments. Condolences and criticism, and for the first time, Russia's president is speaking out, not mincing his words about a plane crash, which is said to have killed Yevgeny Prigozhin. He of course is the man who founded the Wagner Group and launched a brief mutiny against the Kremlin. He quoted off exactly 2 months ago after making an apparent deal with the President Vladimir Putin. Mr. Putin said Prigozhin was talented, but had made serious mistakes. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VLADIMIR PUTIN, PRESIDENT, RUSSIA (through translator):  First of all, I want to express my sincere condolences to the families of all the victims. This is always a tragedy. Preliminary information suggest that Wagner Group employees were also on board. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Russia's aviation agency published the names of all on board, 10 people, among them, Prigozhin. Although, we must point out the victims remains have not yet been identified. Video that CNN cannot confirm shows a small plane falling out of the sky. State media reports that they were no survivors, and that eight bodies have been found. Investigators are combing the crash site near Moscow. And a social media channel linked to Wagner says Prigozhin was killed by quote, \"traitors to Russia\". Others are blaming Ukraine, which is celebrating its independence day. President Zelenskyy says his country has nothing to do with it. Well, CNN's Nick Paton Walsh joins us live from Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine, along with senior international correspondent Frederik Pleitgen in Berlin, and our national security analyst, Steve Hall. Good to have you all with us. I want to start with you first, Nick because this crash happened two months after the Wagner Group launched this mutiny against the Kremlin. We're now hearing from the president who has offered his condolences to the family of Prigozhin. What do you make of it?",

I mean, at the end of the day, I don't think we're ever going to know precisely what happened because Russia is a closed society, it has no rule of law. And so, we won't get any transparency. But what we're left with, or at least what I am left with is a couple of key questions. I mean, the first is, how is this going to be interpreted and depending on how the Kremlin spins it. So Putin's comments initially were very guarded, he didn't say a whole lot, and you wonder whether or not his elite, and some of the key, have they thought, OK, now the real Putin is back, we've got to be really careful or have they learned, that, OK, it's possible to try what Prigozhin tried. I mean, his troops after all did get halfway to Moscow. We just have to be more careful. Is that -- is that what opponents of Putin are saying right now? So, we'll have to see what lessons they've learned based on what actions we see and how the Kremlin spins this in the coming days.",

One is that, we saw how popular Prigozhin was at least, in places like Rostov and other places that are near the border with Ukraine, where you know, they're being impacted by Ukrainian drones and so forth. So, Prigozhin, because of some popularity, it might have been thought by Putin and his assassins that, OK, we need to give this some time, if we turn around and kill him immediately, there could have been, you know, some sort of -- some sort of uprising. The other thing is that because Prigozhin got as far as he did, it's possible that Putin essentially had to sit down and figure out with his key security guys, OK, what are we going to do? How are we -- this is not just one man, this is an armed unit that if we kill its head, could come for us. And so, they might have had to plan a little more carefully as opposed to it being, you know, one opposition figure like Navalny, who they can just throw in jail.",

I think with regards to Prigozhin, there's an element of hubris here. We've seen it with some of the other oligarchs that didn't end well 20 years ago, of course, Nikovski(ph) is a good example. You know, the fact he could pull even with Putin in terms of political strength and ended up spending, you know, 10 years in a Russian jail. So there is a certain hubris that sometimes these guys display. They feel like, OK, yes, I was able to pull this off, I tried something, I didn't suffer anything immediately so it must be OK, and then the hammer comes down. I think that might explain some of Prigozhin's movements in the two months in a regnum between the initial incident and yesterday.",

Well, I want to turn now toanother major story we're following this hour. The pending forth arrest of former U.S. President Donald Trump which is going to happen in just a few hours here in the U.S. state of Georgia. And all eyes are now on Bedminster, New Jersey, where Trump is expected to leave his golf club to travel to Fulton County jail. There he'll be booked on more than a dozen charges, as you can see and as you can imagine, security is pretty tight at the jail. Law enforcement officers on high alert ahead of his arrival. Crowds have already gathered in anticipation. Protesters both in support and against the former president are there. And in the coming hours, we've learnt that District Attorney Fani Willis has requested for an October trial date in this case just two months from now. Well, I want to bring in CNN's Zach Cohen who joins us outside Fulton County court. Good to have you with us, Zach.

Now, it's -- it remains to be seen what that process will look like. But we do know that the defendants in this case, there are 19 of them total, and about nine have turned themselves in so far. All of those nine people have been treated exactly like any other defendant would be when they surrender themselves to a jail. That means they were given a mugshot, that means they were fingerprinted. You know, we are talking about a former president here, and so, it remains to be seen if he will follow that same trend, but you know, we've seen a tightened security around the jail and here at the courthouse in anticipation of Trump's visit to Atlanta, Georgia. And as you mentioned, really interesting on a day that he's supposed to rather surrender, Fani Willis; the district attorney, the prosecutor in this case is requesting that a trial happen two months from now, like October of 2023. Which is remarkably quick turnaround. And so, you know, the prosecutors in this case moving forward, asking for the next without a timeline as the president is about to make his way to Georgia and surrender to a jail, really for -- I mean, the first time we've ever seen this happen, I mean, in U.S. history, really.",

And if they do that, then the state has to try the case, either that term of court or the next regular term of court, which will be in the September- October timeframe. So, she had no choice, but to put this on the calendar. I don't think the state is ready to try the case, I don't think they will be ready. I think the defense lawyers will not be ready to try the case, except for Mr. Chesebro's lawyers which they did, this is a tactical move to basically call the state's bluff and make them put their case up. So, there will be a lot of documents, there will be a lot of information, there's going to be a lot of discovery that has to take place. But this is what the law provides. If you're indicted, you have a right to move your case quickly through the court. How that plays out to the other what? Eighteen defendants, other than Mr. Chesebro remains to be seen. And I think, again, I think they will file motions to sever many of them, and have their case separated so that they have more time to prepare. Remember, at the same time, we have motions being filed in the federal court, asking that certain defendant's cases be moved from the state court to the federal court.

You can have your bond revoked, the judge can put additional requirements on you to allow you to remain on bond or released until the time of your trial. So, there are a number of things that could happen. What's unique in this case is that he's also a candidate for president of the United States. And one of his -- the witnesses who will appear against him in his trial, is his political, now rival, Mike Pence; the former vice president. And so, Trump will have a right under the First Amendment, I believe, to respond to claims and allegations that are made and political attacks that are made, especially around the January 6 incident. He'll have a right to respond to things that the Pence campaign might say, and it will be interesting to see what the court does if the court is -- how close the judge lets the former president sort of get to the line, before he crosses that line into criminal conduct.

In Portugal, more than half the country surpassed 40 degrees Celsius, and it's not just Portugal, hundreds of firefighters are battling fires across several countries in Europe. CNN's Eleni Giokos has the latest on those fires in Greece. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ELENI GIOKOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera):  This is what is left of one of the most beautiful hiking trails in the whole of Greece. I'm in Parnitha Mountain in Athens, it's known as the lungs of Athens. It's an important carbon basin for the city. I want to show you why it's called the lungs of Athens. If you look out, you can see this thick black smoke towering over the city. But you also see a very densely-populated area, not enough greenery, and this virgin forest was that one reprieve. Fires broke out here on Tuesday, it affected homes, many homes were burned yesterday, the fire department are not giving us an exact number, they're still trying to assess the damage. We also don't know how much of this forest is actually been burned. What we do know today is that the firefighters tell us that overnight, it was a nightmare experience with many new blazes erupting across the mountain, and of course, with no air assistance that makes it all that much more difficult to put out the flames. This morning, many helicopters and planes towering above us, one of the helicopters can carry around 11 tons of water and working rapidly to try and put out the fire. You can see the wind has subsided somewhat, but the fear is that, once it starts again, that, that will reignite some of the flames that are starting to just simmer at this stage. Now, looking ahead, locals tell us, they're very worried about potential flooding during rainy season and landsides. That will be something that will come in the future. But for now, this fire season for the whole of Greece has been absolutely catastrophic. We have seen hundreds of new fires erupting across the country in the last few days.

And it is remarkable, the youngest person on that stage, he was the one most forcefully pushing back against the responses to climate change. I don't know if he gained any new voters from the response or from his entire performance. But it is quite remarkable that, being up there, he is the one with the least amount of government experience. And his profile has only gotten larger. He was virtually an unknown six months ago. And here he is on stage, calling the former vice president, Mike Pence, by first name repeatedly throughout the evening, referring to him as Mike. And we see Vivek Ramaswamy just surging in the polls. I don't know if that translates to electoral victories. I don't know if he's able to pull off a big win in Iowa with caucus votes in the next five months with Trump still really commanding such a significant lead.

And in particular, the addition of the UAE and Saudi Arabia is important to potentially bring their financial might to the new development bank, the so-called BRICS bank, to counteract the World Bank and IMF.
