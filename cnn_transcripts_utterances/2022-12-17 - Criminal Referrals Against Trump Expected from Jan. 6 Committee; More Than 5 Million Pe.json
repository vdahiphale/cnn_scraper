That's sort of like the lowering of the flag and the troops enter into the Capitol.The conspiracy to defraud, and the conspiracy to obstruct or very similar charges, different statutes, but the essence of them, Boris, is that there was an agreement among people to prevent the designation of Biden as the duly elected president. So, they did it by defrauding the government. And they did it by interfering with the orderly transition of power on the date of the insurrection. So those are the three most likely charges.

Rain, yes, right there along the coast. But even for cities like Boston and Portland, you're starting to see that transition from rain back over into snow. The heaviest snowfall obviously is going to be once you move a little bit more interior.Look at some of the total so far, you're talking double digits in a lot of places over a foot for areas of New York, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and two feet, when you talk about portions of Vermont. We're also getting some snow in the Midwest, most of that is going to be the lake effect enhancement. But still, even those areas could still look at potentially several more inches on top of what they've already had. Most widespread areas, you're talking about four to six inches of additional snowfall, the caveat to that is going to be areas of upstate New York and portions of Pennsylvania where you're getting that lake effect enhancement there. You could end up picking up at least an additional foot of snow on top of what's already fallen. The thing is with a lot of this snow, it's not really going to go anywhere soon. Because these temperatures are going to start to drop back. We start to see that take shape across the Midwest first. But then that cold air begins to spread its way across the Great Lakes and into the Northeast but also elsewhere.

Now, this selloff really got started almost exactly at 2 p.m. Eastern on Wednesday. That's when the Federal Reserve Announces interest rate decision. The Fed statement and projections raise fears of more Fed rate hikes ahead. And remember, the more the Fed does, the greater the risk they do too much, and they cause a recession.Jerome Powell's press conference that only further reinforced the same concerns. But this self is not just about the Fed. Thursday's weaker than expected reports on retail sales and manufacturing suggested real cracks are already forming in this economy. So, if you add a tough talking Fed to weakening economic numbers, you get rising recession fears. I would note that Powell and the Fed are probably just fine with this sell-off. I mean their inflation fighting campaign, it requires tighter financial conditions. They know the more hawkish they sound, the less work they have to do. They don't want the market to boom. In some ways, this market is in a loss, loss situation right now. Because good economic news is being treated as bad news by investors because it means a tougher Fed. Bad economic news is bad for investors and everyone because it raises the risk of a recession. Still some investors I talked to they argue this sell off is getting out of hand. Veteran Market Strategy Art Hogan, he told me that it's, \"too soon to be sounding the recession alarm bells.\" And this drop is likely overdone.

And it didn't it didn't play out that way.On the other hand, at some point the White House is going to have to answer for this. And as Joe Biden prepares for a reelection bid, he's going to have to explain to the people what it is he did. Why did we reach record numbers of interceptions at the border? Why wasn't there a comprehensive plan? What are the federalism implications here? Why dole out small amounts of money to individual cities, when what we need is a much bigger, more comprehensive approach? That I think is where the other shoe is going to drop?

There's language that states that a cadet or a midshipman will no longer be allowed to play professional sports until after they have completed their service obligation.Now, since 2019, athletes at military academies have had the ability to apply for a waiver to delay their active service requirement and immediately pursue professional sports opportunities. But if that is revoked, that means players for army, like Carter, are going to have to wait until after their service, which is five years of active duty in three years in the individual ready reserve. Now, Mike Gallagher, Republican Congressman from Wisconsin who introduced the amendment told \"ESPN\", they are working on a legislative fix to grandfather in players who went to play for service academies with the understanding that they could get a waiver to go pro.

Good news though for the Lakers, is LeBron led them to victory, check him out here, going coast-to- coast for the slam. LeBron had 30 points to become the oldest player at 38 since Michael Jordan to have three-straight 30-point games. Lakers won that one 126-108. Elsewhere, Brooklyn Nets remain red hot. They were tied with the Raptors with under 4 seconds to go. They're going to get the ball in to Kyrie Irving, and Kyrie is going to make a fancy move here, he hit the step-back three at the buzzer. You remember Kyrie hit a three to win the NBA finals. But that wasn't at the buzzer, this is actually his first-ever buzzer beater of his career, Nets win 119-116. That's their fifth win in a row.
