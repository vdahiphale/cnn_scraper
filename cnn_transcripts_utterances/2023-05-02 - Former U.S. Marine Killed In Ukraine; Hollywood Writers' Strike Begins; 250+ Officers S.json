The strike was announced hours ago after the Writers Guild and studios failed to reach an agreement hours before a midnight deadline. About 11,000 writers are affected.They say their contracts need to be reworked in the era of streaming to make up for a loss of income due to a dramatic decrease in residuals from reruns. They also want limits on the use of artificial intelligence in the industry. At the Met Gala in New York tonight, show host Jimmy Fallon said he stands with his writers. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JIMMY FALLON, HOST. THE TONIGHT SHOW STATTING JIMMY FALLON: There's a strike. Yes. I think we will. Yes. I think we'll get -- we'll go do whatever I can do to support the guild.

We've seen that start to come back, but it's come back slowly. And in the meantime, the studios have migrated much of their content to streaming services, which for a while, were great growth engines for these companies.But they're not particularly profitable because they're spending so much to try to buy those subscribers. Plus, you've got the added competition of Amazon, Apple, Netflix.

You know, one of the things in the streaming age is these companies. Unlike the network's -- the major television networks, they don't provide regular viewership data.And it's been a nettlesome issue for the Writers as well as frankly, for the media that covers these companies, that we don't really know exactly how many people are watching these shows. And for the Writers who are accustomed sharing in the success of their shows, basically being told, here's a flat residual, you're doing fine, trust us is not what they want to hear. So, that's a real sticking point on this.

So, in a way, some of these issues have been festering even longer than since the last contract was negotiated.And I think they've been -- they've been gearing up realizing that at some point, they have to take a stand. On the flip side, these are enormous companies with tremendous amounts of resources and revenue. But they are seeing their business change in dramatic ways, and they can't tell what's around the corner.

We know that this happened before, with, for example, folks from El Paso going to Chicago, New York or other places, that's one place that can happen. But at the same time, El Paso should or other cities on the board, not just in Texas, should also work with Mexican cities to try to understand, what could be the potential expected increase. And, of course, the different layers of government try to provide additional resources, not just initially, but continuously. Because we know that even if the numbers begin to change next week.

At the same time, we do need to consider how to improve services and collaboration between NGOs and local and state officials.We have heard a lot about funding, for example, the Federal government is providing to cities, memorials to happen to funding can be more contained -- consistent and sustainable, not just for the cities for the poor, but for the NGOs as well that are really doing some of the legwork on the ground. And then finally, regardless of what happens after May 11, we're expected to see continuing collaboration with the region to try to better address the issues of migration before they come to the U.S.-Mexico border, which is really here at the essence of what's needed in the long term.",

Then, more migrants will be expelled and returned to their countries under Title eight proceedings that actually pull it plays consequences of migrants who are returning. Essentially, barring them from the entry to United States in the future.At the same time, one of the things that we have to assume in this type of scenario is that even when migrants do stay here for a period of months afterwards, many of them will have to follow through immigration proceedings. And at some point, the majority of them will have to be returned because they will not qualify for asylum.
