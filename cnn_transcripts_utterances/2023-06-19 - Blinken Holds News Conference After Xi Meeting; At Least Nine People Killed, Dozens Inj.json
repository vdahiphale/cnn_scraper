I came to Beijing to strengthen high level channels of communication to make clear our positions and intentions in areas of disagreement and to explore areas where we might work together when our interests align on shared transnational challenges, and we did all of that. Here in Beijing, I had an important conversation with President Xi Jinping, and I had candid, substantive and constructive discussions with my counterparts, Director Wang Yi and State Councilor Qin Gang. I appreciate the hospitality extended by our hosts. In every meeting, I stress that direct engagement and sustained communication at senior levels is the best way to responsibly manage our differences and ensure that competition does not veer into conflict. And I heard the same from my Chinese counterparts. We both agree on the need to stabilize our relationship. During those meetings, we had a robust conversation about regional and global challenges, that includes Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine. I reiterated that we would welcome China playing a constructive role along with other nations, to work toward a just peace based on the principles of the United Nations Charter. We also spoke about North Korea's increasingly reckless actions and rhetoric. All members of the international community have an interest in encouraging the DPRK to act responsibly, to stop launching missiles, to start engaging on its nuclear program. China is in a unique position to press Pyongyang to engage in dialogue and to end its dangerous behavior. I raised U. S. concerns shared by a growing number of countries about the PRC's provocative actions in the Taiwan Strait as well as in the South and East China Seas. On Taiwan, I reiterated the long standing U.S. One China policy. That policy has not changed. It's guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, the three joint communiques, the six assurances, we do not support Taiwan independence. We remain made opposed to any unilateral changes to the status quo by either side. We continue to expect the peaceful resolution of cross- trade differences. We remain committed to meeting our responsibilities under the Taiwan Relations Act, including making sure that Taiwan has the ability to defend itself. We also spoke about a range of bilateral issues including continuing to develop principles to guide our relationship as discussed by President Biden and President Xi and Bali. Late last year, we exchanged views on our respective economic policies, including our concerns about China's unfair treatment of U. S. companies. During my meeting today with U.S. business leaders who are operating in China, I heard about the problems that U.S. businesses are facing, including recent punitive actions against American firms. I also heard that U.S companies want to continue and indeed grow their businesses here. And so in my meetings, I sought to clarify any misperceptions or misunderstandings about our approach.

These are Taiwanese- controlled islands. They have army, navy and air force bases there. And I visited those and I watched exercises where Taiwanese forces are preparing for the possibility of a Chinese invasion. I watched them do an exercise that was responding to a simulated Chinese airborne attack on those islands. So, they are taking that threat very seriously. They do these exercises all the time, so they are prepared. But I'll tell you this. I spoke to a number of senior Taiwanese officials, and they said while they are preparing, they do not want to provoke, they don't want to make the situation worse. And I'll add that, in private, there's a sense there that they feel somewhat caught between the superpowers here, the U.S. and China, worried that you have folks in the U.S., you have folks in China speaking in very evocative terms that make them nervous at times. And they fear that as there's a one-upmanship, perhaps in the U.S. to be tougher on China on the Taiwan issue, you certainly have Chinese leaders speaking very publicly about their desire to eventually at some point reunify with Taiwan, that Taiwan, which would be most happy with the status quo, doesn't want to see that inflame and escalate. And then they find themselves in the middle of a war. There're genuine preparations for the threat of a Chinese invasion, but also a sense there that they don't want to make things worse, right? And they welcome these talks between Blinken and Xi to avoid that sort of escalation.",

Obviously, there are economic ties between these two countries. They have called themselves the best of friends in the past.
