But one of the sticking points from Hamas's perspective is that they want a kind of package deal, according to this report, in which a permanent ceasefire or the terms of a permanent ceasefire would be agreed before that first phase of a 30-day ceasefire would come into effect. From Israel's perspective, anything short, any deal that doesn't include the dismantling of Hamas is a nonstarter.
