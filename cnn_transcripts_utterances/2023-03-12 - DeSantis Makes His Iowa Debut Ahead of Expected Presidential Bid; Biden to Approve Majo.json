So you are looking at primary voters, I have also been very fascinated by the elected officials who already kind of getting on board to Ron DeSantis train. You had -- I actually was really struck by former Congressman Lou Barletta, one of Trump's earliest supporters. I believe he endorsed him back in March 2016. He tweeted late last week that he wants Ron to run, his former housemate, and also, when Ron DeSantis was in the valley yesterday, he had Adam Laxalt introduced him, another former roommates from back in the day.

That he has always been very clear he wasn't part of the defund the police effort, that he's been vocal about funding the police, and that some of the frustration on this really comes down to -- not to seem technical, but this legislation got tangled up with D.C. -- issue with the D.C. home rule.

But what about those who rewrite the past? Well, that's exactly what millions of Americans who tune into Fox saw this week after House Speaker Kevin McCarthy released a trove of new January 6th security footage exclusively to Tucker Carlson. Now, McCarthy's controversial decision is reopening deep divisions within his own party about the Capitol attacks. And just last night, former Vice President Mike Pence had this to say at the annual gridiron dinner about his former boss and some of his fellow Republicans. He said, President Trump was wrong. I had no right to overturn the election, and his reckless words endangered my family and everyone at the Capitol that day. I know that history will hold Donald Trump accountable.
