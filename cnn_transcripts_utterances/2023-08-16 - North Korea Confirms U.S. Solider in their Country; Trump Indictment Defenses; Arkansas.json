Prosecutors say Ferguson threatened his wife during the dinner, pointing his finger at her mimicking a firearm. When they got home, prosecutors say, his wife said, quote, \"why don't you point a real gun at me.\" That's when, prosecutors say, Ferguson shot her with a pistol.Now, arrest documents allege that within minutes of the murder, Ferguson sent a text message to his court clerk and bailiff that said, \"I just lost it. I just shot my wife. I won't be in tomorrow. I will be in custody. I am so sorry.\" The couple's son called 911 and Ferguson was arrested that night. Judge Ferguson, who prosecutors say was intoxicated at the time of the shooting, is facing murder charges, but he's out on bail. He's been ordered to wear an ankle monitor and stay away from weapons and alcohol.",

But state run media has a very set idea of why King decided to run across the border last month.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) HANCOCKS (voice over): North Korea claims racism in the U.S. military was the reason U.S. Private Travis King crossed into its territory, adding he was seeking refuge in North Korea or a third country. One month ago King ran across the military demarcation line during a civilian tour of the Demilitarized Zone. Nothing had been heard from him since. Pyongyang finally breaking its silence on the incident, claims King confessed that he, quote, \"harbored ill feeling against inhuman maltreatment and racial discrimination within the U.S. Army. A U.S. defense official said they could not verify King's alleged comments, and the focus remains on bringing him home safely. King ran across the border at the joint security area, a heavily guarded area. U.S. and South Korean soldiers were unable to stop him. Pyongyang claims King is, quote, \"disillusion\" at the unequal American society. There are no direct statements from King or details of his whereabouts or condition. King had faced assault charges in South Korea, serving around 50 days in a detention facility. The Army says he would have faced further charges if he had returned to the U.S. as planned. The day before he crossed into North Korea, King was taken to Incheon Airport by a military escort but did not board the plane, claiming a lost passport to airport officials who escorted him back to departures.",

What's the response to that? MICHAEL MOORE, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY, MIDDLE DISTRICT OF NEW YORK: Well, I'm glad to be with you. I'll tell you that there will be some defenses like that.

And so DOJ wanted those charges dismissed from the Delaware court because they say we want to charge him in a different district where these alleged crimes took place, California or Washington, D.C. And Biden's team is not objecting to that because the only reason it was filed in Delaware was because it was negotiated. But they are on polar opposite ends of what happens to this effort to resolve the felony gun possession charge.And so prosecutors, special counsel David Weiss saying that because the probation officer never signed off on it, it was not a done deal. It is not binding. It's not real. And Biden's team is saying, but DOJ signed it and Hunter Biden signed it, so that alone should be enough because this type of deal is usually one that is worked out between two parties. It's usually just a bilateral agreement. But the deal, as they put it before the judge, she wasn't too keen on it.",
