And that, to me, is misguided and has mis- learned the lessons of Afghanistan and Iraq. What we need to do is simultaneously take out Hamas senior leadership, marginalize Hamas militarily. And I support Israels operations to do so. But also be working through and with Palestinians, funded and supported by Arab states, to provide local security, to start educating Palestinian youth, and also to provide avenues of economic development that give people a real alternative in life.",

Just a few moments ago, the Dow was up more than 800 points.This is the Wall Street equivalent of a standing ovation. And the trigger was, yes, this inflation report. We're talking about the PCE Index. This is the Fed's preferred inflation metric. And it showed that prices we're up by 2.5 percent over the past 12 months. That's slightly better than the month before. And that's really not all that bad when you look at things historically. We look at the trend, we can see that this metric has really improved. A year ago, it was above 3 percent. Two years ago, it was above 7 percent. So clearly, as that chart shows, there's been a lot of progress here. But I do want to stress that this does not mean that everything is perfect in the economy, or that life is suddenly getting cheaper. It's not. But prices are still going up, just at a more gradual pace. No doubt, Americans are still spending more at the grocery store, on rent or on car insurance. But the good news, Boris, is that prices are no longer skyrocketing.",

That official say they need more confidence that inflation really is under control.And today's report is another step in that direction. All signs are pointing to a rate cut in the near future. Probably not next week. Just a 5 percent chance priced into the market for a rate cut at the July meeting. But look at that, 100 percent chance of an interest rate cut at the meeting after that. That's in September. That, by the way, is the final meeting before the presidential election. And if the Fed does deliver the rate cut, that would be great news for borrowers, right? Everyone who's trying to get a mortgage, on a home equity loan, pay off credit card debt, finance the purchase of a car would catch a break. One other point here, Boris, is that the fact that inflation has come down and that we're talking about interest rate cuts does show that the economy could be on the verge of something historic, a soft landing. Which would mean taming inflation without causing a recession. And, Boris, that, of course, would be great news for everyone.",
