Sources tell CNN the top Democrats in the Senate and House, Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, as well as former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who, of course, wields so much power still, have all expressed similar concerns directly to President Biden. And ABC News is reporting that Schumer went further, forcefully urging the president to bow out. Schumer's representative saying that that report is speculation. Let's talk about this now. We have Meghan Hays, who is a former Biden White House director of message planning and a consultant for the Democratic National Convention.

And a lot of the Democrats I'm talking to, whether it's lawmakers, staffers on the Hill or Democratic donors, feel as though there is momentum right now to potentially convince President Biden to step aside. Now, again, even though they feel is that there's momentum, there are a lot that think they could very well enter a scenario where he doesn't, where he sticks it out, where he fights it out and says, sorry, I'm not listening to you. But I was just texting with a senior Hill aide who is saying that a lot of members are looking to the leadership, looking to those conversations that Schumer, Pelosi and Jeffries are having with President Biden and hopeful that somehow that can -- that can sway him. Now, one key person who hasn't turned on President Biden is Congressman Jim Clyburn. He is a longtime ally of the president. And you haven't really seen any major voices in the Congressional Black Caucus break from President Biden. And the big question will be, do any in the coming days?

She's been quite a bit recently -- or not recently, but she's been out there a lot. And I also would say she's polling really well with moderates and Independents.

Something that struck me about this convention is that, from Sean O'Brien, a union boss, to the rapper, Amber Rose, to even a J.D. Vance himself being -- talking about working-class people and the effort to dismantle corporations and that sort of thing, is that the Republican Party is seeking to not only expand its base, but also to redefine itself. Do you get that impression? REP. NICOLE MALLIOTAKIS (R-NY): Well, I think that we're attracting every-day Americans, people who may not have voted for Republicans in the past. Had quite a few speak that voted for Biden in the past. But they see how destructive the Democrat's policies have been for the country from the open -- open borders that have created mass migration in cities like fine in New York we're literally two cops we're shot by an illegal immigrant, a 13-year-old girl was raped by an illegal immigrant. And so many other crimes being committed as a result of this open border policy, to the economic issues. They can't afford to put food on their table. Gas is now about $1.25 more today than it was when President Trump was in office. It's because of the anti-energy policies of this administration that are fueling inflation. As well as the highest interest rates in two decades. Americans, young Americans can't afford to live the American dream, purchase a home for their families. And I think it's just gotten to a point where Americans are saying, hey, we're not better off than we we're when President Trump was in office. And -- or perhaps they believed a lot of what his opposition we're claiming about him, the vile rhetoric, the lies that tried to destroy President Trump professionally, personally and economically. So I think there is a shift happening in this country. I think people are seeing that this administration has taken us it's too far to the left and there's a correction that's to be made.",

      "sentences": "I think you we're in friends -- the friends and family box last night. Did you get a chance to speak with the former president? MALLIOTAKIStold him I'm happy that he's with us today. Thank God he is OK. And it was just a brief exchange, obviously, because we we're watching the speeches. And I think one of the most incredible moments was the Gold Star families standing on this stage in tears talking about their loved ones who we're killed. Because I was -- I listened to those hearings when we had these individuals come speak before us. There we're two opportunities to stop the individual - the ISIS-K fighter that set off that bomb. One was when they closed Bagram Air Base and all those prisoners we're released from jail. That released this individual onto the street. And then the second time was when a sniper saw him and, in his testimony that came before Congress, the sniper saw him and they didn't take him out. They couldn't get the permission to take him I'm out. So those 13 lives, that was preventable, and that is a failure of leadership. That is why we need President Trump back. We had peace through strength. We had somebody who would do more to keep our military men and women safe abroad. We have somebody who had a border secure, was not letting in these dangerous people that are wreaking havoc in cities like mine. And again, he made it very clear. He supports immigration. His wife is an immigrant. But it has to be legal and it has to be right. And if people commit crimes, they need to be deported. And so I think that there's a stark contrast between President Biden and President Trump. And I think Americans are saying, gee, you know, President Trump is making more sense here, he's going to be better for me financially, for the economy, for jobs, for secure borders, for safe a nation. And peace through strength, not appeasement of our adversaries.",

      "sentences": "I do want to ask you about that because there is some disagreement, even within the Republican Party, about the approach to foreign policy. And I think that's encapsulated by Senator J.D. Vance and his comments about Ukraine, saying that he doesn't really care about what happens in Ukraine.Also, for the first time -- I know you're on the Taiwan Caucus. For the first time. Taiwan wasn't even mentioned in the Republican Party platform since 1980. How do you see foreign policy being a part of the Republican platform moving forward when there are these disagreements so on Ukraine and there's still sort of a transactional view of the security assurances that the U.S. has made to partners around the world? MALLIOTAKIS: Yes, I think when people look at President Trump, they're saying this is somebody who brought peace through strength, right? We did not have these invasions when he was in office. And he is somebody, I think, who can prevent this. Remember, this is a dealmaker. He has the ability, I think, and he's a strong -- strong president. So I think he was preventative in what happened. And it wasn't until Joe Biden came in and showed weakness on the world stage with some of his policies. You know, rubber stamping the Nord Stream II Pipeline, what killed -- while killing our own. Lifting some of the sanctions on Iran and allowing them to prosper once again. These are decisions that I think we're wrong decisions. Re-entering the Paris Accord without requiring China and India to play on a level playing field. These we're bad decisions for America. They helped our adversaries. And I think that that's the difference here. So I think there is maybe -- there is a place where we need to get together and figure out what we're -- how we're going to proceed on foreign policy. But one thing we know for sure is that President Trump is the courageous and fearless leader that we need. And I think that he really brought respect on the world stage. And look, the bottom line here is -- and people ask me, well, how do you know this just wouldn't happen? Because it didn't happen. That's the best evidence you have is that it didn't happen for four years. And here, we're on the brink of what seemed to be World War III for quite some time. And it's gotten a little bit, I think, under control and we're seeing China now step back from potentially invading Taiwan. But the threats are still there. And -- and we need to again project peace through strength in this country. And I think President Trump is the one to do it.",
