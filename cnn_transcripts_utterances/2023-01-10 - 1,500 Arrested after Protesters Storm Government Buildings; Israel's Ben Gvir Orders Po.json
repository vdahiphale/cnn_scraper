And we certainly expect the three leaders to discuss this issue when we see them together later this afternoon. And one thing that we can report today is the announcement of an online portal that administration officials describe as basically being a one stop shop that migrants and asylum seekers can consult to try to figure out is there a legal pathway for me to enter a country like the U.S., Mexico or Canada. So that's just one of the steps. Another one is the announcement of the building of more physical resource centers, including one in Southern Mexico. The idea here too, is to provide a place and a resource for these migrants to go to, to figure out how they can properly and legally enter the United States. Now, what we are seeing play out essentially is these three leaders showing on the world stage that there needs to be coordination, and cooperation and partnership between countries like these, that it simply can't be an issue that can be solved by one country working by itself. Now back at home, I can tell you, there are some questions certainly being raised about some of these new announcements, particularly because we're really low on details right now, that virtual portal that I just mentioned a little while ago, that's actually not been launched yet, and probably won't be for a number of months. So we don't know exactly how that is going to unfold and what the impact will be on migrants? But it's important to keep in mind that when you talk to experts, when you talk to immigration advocates, one thing that they will always point to is just the reality that for so many of these asylum seekers, the reason that they go directly to the U.S. border. And don't necessarily first go through the channels of properly seeking asylum, is because the situation that they're trying to escape and leave behind back at home is so dire and so desperate. So that certainly is going to be a topic of discussion, I would think between the three leaders just sort of the humanitarian aspect of this and whether there's a way to handle all of this in a humane way. Of course, certainly back at home for President Biden, this has been a huge issue and a focus, and also just a political liability for him as well.",

Over the weekend, the Russians launched a series of missile strikes on Kramatorsk. They say in retaliation for a devastating New Year strike on a Russian makeshift barracks that even Russia concedes killed 89 soldiers though Ukraine insists there were many more.

So that is why these pictures are so significant. Becky, I think it's also important to note that the Chinese government has really narrowed its definition of a COVID death, in order for death to be considered to be COVID it has to have been a respiratory illness that was deemed to be directly caused by the virus so different messaging, different interpretations but these pictures clearly call into question this narrative that we have been hearing from Beijing.",

So many young people have seen his content. And his entire approach has been to design a hugely controversial persona that promotes misogynist hate and appeals to young men in particular, promoting views such as women who are victims of sexual abuse.",

It's so good to be able to test spend a little time with you here on some more local issues.You and I have been working so closely on significant global issues whether it's the pressures of China and Russia and Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine? We need to continue to stand up strong for democracy, rule of law for opportunities and inclusive economic growth around the world. But as you say, there are tremendous things that we can build on here at home. North America is the largest free trading block in the world, larger even than the European Union. We have a tremendous amount to contribute to the world, in goods and services, but also with technologies and solutions that the world really needs. And our capacity to work together has brought us to places of extraordinary success, but at a time of disruption around the world a ton of very real challenges. We can and must be doing even more. So I'm really pleased with all the work that our folks have been doing over the past many months and years on aligning or coordinating, so that we're leading the way on the net zero transition we all have to do while at the same time ensuring that individual Canadians and Americans and Mexicans and others around the world can see themselves in the future in an optimistic way and understand that yes, we're at a time of challenges and strife. But you're right, there's a lot of reasons to be optimistic, especially for those of us that are countries but it's going to take a lot of work something that neither you nor I mostly our citizens have ever been afraid of. Rolling up our sleeves and building a better future and was better communities is absolutely essential. So as we talk about issues, whether it's a Haiti whether it's some of the challenges in South America, whether we talk about critical minerals and energy and how we're going to continue to move forward to create those efficient and resilient supply and value chains that we need? There's a lot that we're going to be able to do together.",

Both left a court in Bucharest earlier and they are waiting to hear if an appeals court will uphold their 30 day detention? Prosecutors are investigating the two on suspicion of human trafficking that is something they both deny. Andrew Tate has amassed millions of followers on social media with his misogynistic views and his hate speech. And that is what I want to talk about. I'm going to bring in Callum Hood, who was with us earlier the Head of Research at the Center for Countering Digital Hate an international organization that works to disrupt the production and spread of hate and misinformation. And before the break I've asked you really to explain the appetite for the sort of Biles spewed by Andrew Tate it is not just misogynistic hate speech. It's more than that. But I'm just interested in the appetite and why the rise in the appetite for misogyny and how tough this is to police?",

It's part of his image that he poses with sports cars in luxurious locations andalso promises young men that if they listen to his advice, they can have a lifestyle that looks a lot like his. And it's inherent to that view and lifestyle he is putting across that women are worthless other than as sex objects, and they're to either be ignored or held in contempt, or taken advantage of, as we know, that Tate himself has done through alleged sex trafficking and by his own admission through a sort of webcam business that he operated. And he is aided and abetted in this grimy business that he is established by social media algorithms, that privilege content that is controversial. That gets people to stop scrolling their feeds and pay attention because that's what the platforms make their money from. They need people to stay glued to their phone, stay on the platform, look at more ads and make them money. We found the TikTok algorithm recommending Tate's content within minutes to new accounts that we told TikTok belongs to a 13-year-old just minutes into its existence. So TikTok has given an enormous leg up to Tate and his business model and his message and it's been instrumental in his success.",

And in the case of Twitter under Elon Musk, he's been allowed to make a comeback personally, from which hecan issue his own statements and rebuild his audience and fan base. So that's one problem. The other problem is that all of this has been supercharged by social media algorithms. In total, we can see from TikTok's statistics that they showed his content to users 16 billion times in the last 12 months worldwide. So that's an enormous advantage he's had given to him by the social media platforms. There is something that they can do about this, they just need to stay on top of these copycat accounts which are set up and they are violating the platform's rules in two or three ways. One, they promote painful misogyny to their mentor inauthentic activity, which platforms will say, especially if it is paid.",
