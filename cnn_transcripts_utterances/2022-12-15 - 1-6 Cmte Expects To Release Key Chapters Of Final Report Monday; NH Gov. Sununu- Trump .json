Bennie Thompson, who's the chairman of the Committee also said he's hoping that they can get eight chapters in the report out on Monday that may prove to be a little too optimistic. And our conversations with other members are talking about still putting the finishing touches on him. I talked to another source who said, you know, this could still slip we still may not see, you know, the real guts of the report until Wednesday as Bennie Thompson previously said.But look, it's pretty clear that we are going to see a number of the top line headlines, the full executive summary in the Monday public meeting. And again, the details on these referrals, what are the names? What -- who are they being referred to? What is the basis, particularly for the Justice Department, John?",

A, what does that tell you? And I know one of your points is that because of all the successes of this Committee, it did have some issues, some failures to get cooperation. You believe the report should make recommendations for what Congress should do to improve its ability to invest -- to conduct, excuse me, investigations, but what hope is that when you know, the Republican House opposes even the existence of this Committee?",

I am looking forward to the legislative proposals here, you're probably right that they don't stand much of a chance in the new Republican controlled House. But listen, the fact that these investigations shut down when a Congress turns over. And so the -- it just -- what's the whole point? I mean, our justice system is just not set up to deal with these kinds of investigations that have this kind of expiration date.And so Republicans should want it to. They should want better tools to try to enforce their subpoenas and get their investigations done. So we'll see if it happens. But I am looking forward to what this Committee has to say about ways to increase their power. And not just for this, of course, but down the road as well.",

Now our full understanding is seven states that were targeted by President Trump at the time and his allies to try to overturn the results, Election officials in all seven of these states have now received subpoenas from the new special counsel.

It may be that they felt they were held up by the frivolous privilege assertions that were going on that now I've been cleared by Judge Howell in D.C. So I'm glad that they've done it, they certainly need to talk to these people. And, you know, I think this could be a really fruitful area for cooperation for the special counsel and his team. You know, these are folks, by and large, who are public officials, local and state public officials, they don't want to go to prison. They don't want their reputations damaged by being involved in this plot. And they're probably not as loyal to the former president as some of the former president's own people, right?So they're a good place to look for cooperating witnesses, and witnesses who will maybe not pleaded guilty to anything will be cooperative with investigators. So I think they can maybe make some real headway when they talk to these people and start getting in their fight.",

And the other hand, if you want to run for president, it costs a lot of money and you got to start organizing, get it raising money, getting a staff, getting going. So you don't have too much long. But to the point, is there a lane? The answer is yes. The question is, how many people can get into it? This is from our new poll released yesterday, should Donald Trump be the 2024 Republican nominee? This is among Republicans and Republican leaning voters.Back in December, it was 38 percent. That's right now. In July, it was 44. At the beginning of the year was 50 percent. So Donald Trump is descending, if you will, in terms of a favorite of Republicans. And as for who it should be, maybe Chris Sununu should change his name to just not Trump. If you look at our poll, just not Trump gets 53 percent, Ron DeSantis gets 38 percent, everybody else gets 1 percent or less, including former vice president, former presidential candidates, former Republican nominee in Mitt Romney there. So Trump is descending, but he's still powerful. We can't put that aside. NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Yes. 38 percent, you know, that's pretty good if you've got a field that's crowded and filled with folks like Mike Pence, and Mike Pompeo, and Ron DeSantis, and Greg Abbott and Sununu. And you know, that's how he won before. That's how he can win again. You know, I think people are surprised that he isn't really doing anything other than meeting with anti- Semites and releasing digital trading cards. The fact that he's been so quiet, and then gives a bit of surprise to people and could explain why no one else has really jumped in, I think we thought maybe some other people would have jumped in by now, but so far --",

That is of course getting vaccinated, getting boosted, and also getting tested frequently. And to that end, they are restarting this program of making free COVID at home tests available to people so you can now order for free tests sent to your home for free. You can do it earlier. Starting today, I tried it just this morning.And they're also trying to offer additional support to nursing homes and other long term care facilities. You know, when I was talking to Dr. Ashish Jha, the White House COVID coordinator about this last night, he said, look, the last few weeks have made really clear that COVID is definitely on the rise. And the reason that the stakes are so much higher right now is of course is because of this triple threat of COVID, RSV and the flu. He said think about it this way, COVID this winter is not a one disease in isolation. He said all of these things have obviously put hospitals and health care workers an extra stress. He did say one good piece of news, which is that RSV does appear to have peaked if you've gotten it, if you've had family members get it. That certainly seems to be good news, John.",
