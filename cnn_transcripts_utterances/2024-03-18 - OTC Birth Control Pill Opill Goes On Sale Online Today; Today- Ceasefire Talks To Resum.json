Like you said, Sara, with online sales, this will make it accessible to -- especially women in rural areas. We know that Opill itself -- it's a progesterone-only birth control pill. If it's taken at the same time every day as instructed it can be up to 98 percent effective. As for how much it costs, it has the manufacturer's suggested price of $19.99 for a one-month supply, $49.99 for a three-month supply, and $89.99 for a six-month supply. Now, these online sales -- they are a major step in the rollout of this product. Next, we can expect to see it hit store shelves. We know that later this month and in early April some major retail pharmacies like CVS and Walgreens will plan to carry this product. So earlier this month, shipments went out to distribution sites. Starting today, it's available online. Next, Sara, we can expect the in-store sales coming up later in the month.",

Basically, following the Hamas counterproposal that we saw last week, saying that they want some 700 to 1,000 Palestinian prisoners released in exchange for potentially all the female hostages, including IDF soldiers, the elderly, the sick, and the wounded.So the hope is that there could be some kind of breakthrough, although we have already heard from Israel's prime minister saying that he believed that Hamas' counterproposal was outlandish and unrealistic. But he has still sent a delegation here. And there were meetings -- key meetings set by the war cabinet and security cabinet in Israel yesterday, on Sunday, where they drew out the red lines -- how far their Mossad director could go in agreeing what Hamas was looking for. So we'll monitor that throughout the day. And also, we know there is that significant operation ongoing in Gaza at this point. We've spoken to one of the doctors within the Al-Shifa medical complex and he says that one of the surgical buildings is on fire. This is where all the operations for all departments were taking place. He said there were many patients who had just undergone medical procedures and were unable to move. The Ministry of Health saying that there have been casualties and there are many wounded as well. The Israeli military saying the reason they are there is because they have intelligence that Hamas terrorists are operating out of the hospital. And they have now just said everyone in the neighborhood of this hospital surrounding the medical complex has to evacuate. They have to head west towards the sea, and then they have to head south several kilometers to an area that the IDF has described as a humanitarian zone. Now, we've heard from eyewitnesses within the hospital, as well, saying that they have been fired upon as they try to move from different buildings, and as they moved inside the hospital. The IDF saying everybody has to stay where they are at this point inside the hospital as they conduct this operation. But we are hearing from eyewitnesses and the Ministry of Health that there have been casualties and with this surgical building on fire that they were unable to get to some of those patients because of the intensity of the fire -- John.",
