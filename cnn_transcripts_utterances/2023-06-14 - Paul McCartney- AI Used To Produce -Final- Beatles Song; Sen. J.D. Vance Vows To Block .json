So when we came to make what will be the last Beatles record -- it was a demo that John had that we worked on and we've just finished it up. It will be released this year.

They can do transparency efforts, meaning people who are creating AI need to be transparent about how they're programming it -- things like that. They can have disclosure hearings where people need to disclose sort of what types of tools they're using to train their programs. So there's a lot of things that they could pass. Congress is gridlocked but this seems to be an issue where there is bipartisan support. The one thing I will say, though, I think a lot of these issues will get litigated in courts. I think you're going to have people who are going to go and sue different companies because their main image and likeness are being used in ways that they didn't give permission or because they feel like they're being scammed.

She said that schools get like an overall grade of a B-. Two-thirds of students gave their schools an A or a B, but almost a quarter gave them a C.

When it comes to mental health and supporting students' mental health, schools got an average of a C+. So not so great there. Just 22 percent gave it an A.
