Significant changes to law around bothsexual assault and sexual harassment and the speech (ph) responsibility, the relationship of women and men to the state in terms of protection against sexual harassment and sexual assault, those laws didn't really start changing until the ''70s. So, part of what E. Jean Carroll is describing is a lifetime in the United States in which she came of age before laws had really even been reformed or revised to better protect or punish those who'd committed sexual assault or harassment. So, she came of age in an era before any of those legal changes have been made. And now, she is living in this moment as a 79-year-old, almost 80- year-old woman to see her story being taken as seriously as the -- in fact, more seriously, than the word of a former president of United States. And so, to have been born in part of that -- what she called the silent generation was a generation where there was no confidence that raising your voice and telling a story of having been aggressed upon, having been assaulted or in other cases, harassed by a powerful figure, you know, the sense that that would end badly for you, and that was a sense that persisted for her up until the '90s when this assault took place. And a friend advised her, don't come forward and tell the story about this powerful man. At the time, Donald Trump was a powerful businessman, a celebrity in New York City, he'll will bury. And she didn't. So, that's what she means by the silent generation, part of an era in which there was absolutely no confidence that telling your story would end well for you, and that lack of confidence has persisted, and this is an incredible instance in which the story -- she told the story, she told the story in a memoir, she told the story in court, she spoke several times during her testimony of how happy she was to get her day in court. And then, the jury, found in her favor. It is a remarkable story of -- a lifetime in which so many of these assumptions and laws have been changed.",

But part of what the fight, in this period is, is to solidify these laws that are supposed to reform those attitudes that are supposed to discourage them, punish them, those -- that kind of behavior when it takes place, that is supposed to better protect women and give them equal citizenship and representation under the law and in civic and public and private and social contexts. And so, he is reflecting attitudes, that as he says, you know, have been the norm over generations. But part of the work that we are in the midst of right now is altering those attitudes. And so, in this instance, he's relying on that, that doubling down as his defense, did not hold water. And in fact, probably helped to sink him because there was a jury that said, actually, those millions of years of that behavior are not OK, and you are going to be held legally accountable in this case for having behave that way.",

And again, I want to stress, a majority of Americans actually didn't vote for him. He won because of -- through the Electoral College. But he won. He won the presidency. And I think it's entirely -- there are people who vote for Donald Trump, many of them who believe that these attitudes, the kind of things that -- and behaviors, what's he's described as having persisted for millions of years are in fact the way that the world should be, that men should have certain abilities -- powerful men should have certain abilities to behave in ways toward women and other bodies in general, and they like that about him and they like that he's direct about it. So, let's not pretend that everybody is put off by this. This is - there's a reason this is such a long fight. People want the world to remain that way.

He simultaneously wants to advertise himself as a man and a victim. A man who's been wronged by these feminists, right, and these left-wing witch hunts.

But there are now hundreds of rockets start-ups and satellite start-ups that are looking to build what I described as a type of computing shell around the earth, just like one data point for people from 1960 to about 2020, we had put up 2,500 satellites into the lower earth orbit.

AndI was a kid who grew up in the '80s, kind of a child of the Cold War. And I think I am the second western reporter and the only one who brought a video camera into the old Soviet ICBM factories in Ukraine. And it was fascinating to see. I went to the ICBM factories. I want to the secret rocket testing sites in the forest, and it was just fascinating for me to be in this place that you never imagine you'd even be allowed into when you were growing up. And also, a bit sad to see the state of it all. I mean, it felt like it was frozen in the 1960s, and there was a tiny fraction of the number of people working there that used to work there. But nonetheless, that was probably my favorite trip.",
