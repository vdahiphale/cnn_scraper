Just three points separate the two candidates.We have a team of correspondents covering the state of the race. Let's begin with CNN's Priscilla Alvarez. She's following the Harris campaign in Pennsylvania. OK, so, Priscilla, Harris is looking to shore up this support with a key demographic, and that's black men. So what's her latest effort?",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's exactly right. She is trying to lock in her coalition and fill the void when it comes to questions about what -- about her economic agenda and her proposals if she were to win in November.That is what she is focused on today and unveiling here in Pennsylvania. That includes, for example, forgivable loans to black entrepreneurs, up to $20,000, promoting apprenticeships, and legalizing recreational marijuana, among other measures. Taken together, this is a sweeping proposal, again, trying to appeal to black voters. While polls show that she still has the majority of black voters, there is erosion there when compared to other election cycles, and that is exactly what the campaign is trying to target, fearing that there may be voters who sit out the election or who vote for her Republican rival, Donald Trump. Now, all of this is an extension of what she did over the weekend, where she was in North Carolina there. She met with local black elected officials, as well as faith leaders, and again tried to drive home her own message and shore up that support among the community. Now, one of the other messages that we're likely to hear from the vice president today here in Pennsylvania and over the course of the week, is also about the former president's transparency. Yesterday, she launched a new line of attacks, saying the former president was hiding by not doing the \"60 Minutes\" interview or by not releasing his medical records, which she did do over the weekend. So anticipate some form of that to come through in her remarks later this evening. But just to show you how important Pennsylvania is, she is returning to the state later this week. She's also heading to Michigan. Tomorrow, she's participating in a radio town hall with Charlamagne tha God, who has millions of listeners, most of whom are black. So she will be focused on that there, as well as later in the week also returning to Michigan and Wisconsin, hitting, of course, those blue wall states. So, certainly a blitz that this campaign is launching today and will be under way over the course of the week, as the vice president, again, tries to lock in that coalition and secure that path to 270 -- Alisyn.",

It failed because the former president said, no, we are not going to have success or progress on immigration before the election. So this is at the root of all of this immigration discussion. I was in Arizona last week. It is absolutely a critical issue. Border security is a critical issue. But the voters I talked to on both sides actually want solutions.

Bakari, I want to start with you, because in light of Harris releasing this opportunity agenda targeting black men, a \"New York Times\"/Siena College poll released this weekend shows that Trump is making a dent in Harris' margins among likely black voters, with one in five black men saying they are supporting Trump. Do you think what's in this agenda, the forgivable loans, the legalization of recreational marijuana, the apprenticeship promotion, investing in more black teachers, do you think that's enough to sway the demographic?",

I mean, I think that, today, black men should be able to take a victory lap, because we have been raising our concerns for a very long period of time, wanting candidates to hear our calls and hear our cries about what we want to see done and what we want our government and elected officials to do. And, finally, you had a candidate who actually went out and put pen to paper and did some of those things. The other thing I want to talk about is this narrative that people are pushing that somehow she is losing ground with black voters. I mean, if you look at the CBS poll, it was 81-12, which is what it was exactly back in 2020, when Joe Biden became president of the United States. But, yes, I mean, there's work to be done. I'm in Detroit, Michigan today with Don Cheadle doing that work on the ground, meeting black voters where they are. And the plan is so robust because one of the things we didn't mention was the sickle cell database or ensuring that the Affordable Care Act covers colorectal and prostate exams, because we all know that black men die at disproportionate rates because of that. And it talks about putting money in our pockets. I mean, look, there's something in there for everybody. We may not like it.

Look, I looked at the medical records. I think Dr. Sanjay Gupta talked about it. The vice president appears to be in exceptional health. She clearly has the issue of potential prostate cancer because of her mother. And she's been going on with the necessary testing, I guess, yearly. I think a lot of Americans have experienced that if they have lost a parent due to that form of cancer. But for the most part, Boris, I don't think this is really going to matter. I mean, this is just Trump throwing things out there. For the most part, my personal beliefs on this is, this is a tight race. And if I'm advising the former president, I have always argued, guys, that I think this thing is going to come down to Pennsylvania. You heard Jeff Zeleny talking about it. So when Trump is in the area, a place that he lost in 2020 to President Biden, what message is he going to deliver to those voters who voted for him in 2016, but that may now be skeptical of Vice President Harris, but sort of on the fence of whether or not they want to vote for Trump again?

Vance who has some just bottom-dweller type of favorability ratings.So, yes, it matters. And I think that Kamala Harris is showing the transparency. She's doing things like sitting down with Bret Baier on FOX News on Wednesday. She sat down with \"60 Minutes.\" She's challenged him to another debate. And Donald Trump ain't doing none of this. I mean, he's simply saying I'm a 78-year-old man who has slowed down. You can tell by his schedule and rally schedule. I'm not the same man I was in 2016. You know, I weigh a good bit, and I eat McDonald's and KFC on my airplanes. And so vote for me, because that's who I am. And I think that lack of transparency should matter.

I think, as Americans, most Americans that I have met, they think that this is despicable, especially now as we try to deliver those resources, not only in North Carolina, but all these impacted locations across the United States, most recently with Milton. I think Americans are caring, they're considerate, and they're giving, and these things undermine that mission. It is demoralizing to the FEMA staff and our partners to have this happen, door to door, trying to make that handshake with a disaster survivor to get them to register for services and resources from the federal government, undermines this complete mission.
