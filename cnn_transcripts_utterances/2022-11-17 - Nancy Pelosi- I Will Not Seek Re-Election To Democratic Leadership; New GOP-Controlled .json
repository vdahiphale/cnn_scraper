He, at the moment, is expected to be the lone Democrat running for that position is called party leader. He has not yet formally announced his run, but it is widely expected that he will do so. And we do expect two other Democrats from his generation also to consider running for this number two and number three spot. That's Katherine Clark of Massachusetts and Pete Aguilar of California for the number two and number three position. This after not only Pelosi announced she was stepping aside with Steny Hoyer as well. In addition, Jim Clyburn, who is the South Carolina Democrat, who was the number three in the inner part -- of his party leadership right now also indicated that he would support those three younger Democrats just take their place. This indicates that potentially this could be a smooth transition if no other potential candidates emerge. It's uncertain that what will happen if the no-leadership elections are on November 30 but the caucus had been -- there had been a faction within the Democratic caucus, who had been pushing for this generational change for some time. Pelosi recognizing that kind of deal several years ago, saying that 2022 will be her last time as Democratic leader, the end of this year. She didn't firmly shut the door, which led to some drama ahead of today but by making this announcement, now Democrats are preparing for the next act, guys.",

And months before we learned that Republicans would take back the House, this is a White House that has also been gearing up for that very scenario. It is by far among the earliest and most comprehensive preparations by any White House before a midterm election to prepare for the onslaught of investigations by the opposing party.And it began last spring with the hiring of several key officials including a veteran white-collar attorney Richard Sauber as the White House's Special Counsel handling the response to all of this. Ian Sams, the White House spokesman also hired Anita Dunn, a senior adviser to the president coming back into the fold. Key hires also made at the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security. And over the summer, this team at the White House has been mapping out possible Republican investigations, paying very close attention to the hundreds of letters that Republican lawmakers have been sending to the White House and to agencies with requests for documents. They've been paying close attention to top Republican lawmakers' TV appearances, where they've really been telegraphing what they're going to do. And what they've also been doing is coordinating across the administration with key top lawyers at various agencies. One of those meetings I'm told took place more than four months before the election in the Roosevelt Room of the White House with top lawyers from the White House and the Department of Homeland Security sitting down together to map out the potential Republican investigations and also decide how they're going to respond. So, one of the things Republicans have been threatening, which is to potentially impeach the Secretary of Homeland Security. And those meetings, I'm told have happened with other agencies as well. Lastly, a lot of hires are still going to come. They have a team of about 10 lawyers at the White House handling oversight, more are expected to be hired in the next two months.",

For context, I was probably you know, in preschool at that time.But often she's been looked to as the adult in the room, right? She's somebody who was effective, she could get things done, she could rally the troops, so to speak, even in a really diverse Democratic caucus. So, that sense of stability and someone who's really a sort of guiding the ship, I think has been important for Democrats. And now those are some really big shoes to fill. But, you know, Nancy Pelosi and her speech pointed to this as a moment for fresh ideas, a moment where you know, it's time to move. And I think a lot of people are ready for that. We know that there were some tensions between Pelosi, AOC, and the so-called squad, right? And I think that that represents that again, it is time to move forward and there are a lot of people who are actually looking forward to this change.",

I remember as long ago as 2010 the RNC using fire Pelosi, you know, messaging.But honestly, I think it's a moment for Republicans, for my party, to learn from. This -- it takes leadership to acknowledge when it's time to pass the baton. And Nancy Pelosi is reading into the midterms, saying that Gen Zers came out in droves and that that's the new base for Democrats. So, she's saying it's time for next-generation leadership. My party could take a lesson from that. We shouldn't be running again the same candidate we've now run three times for president. We should think about new leadership in the House of Representatives, which, you know, is still an open question since Kevin McCarthy has to get 218 votes on the House floor in January.",

So, she's pointing to the fact that you know, if we say we want America to truly be a democracy that means everyone needs to be part of this democracy.

And those folks want to see this. They think that the top priorities are investigating Hunter Biden, which by the way, I would note he's already under investigation by the Department of Justice.

I wouldn't make too much of their choice of language. It just seems to me they're sugarcoating it. The corner is on record as saying it was the most disturbing, horrific, bloody crime scene they had ever seen in their lives.
