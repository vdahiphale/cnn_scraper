KATE BOLDUAN, CNN NEWS CENTRAL CO-ANCHOR:  Important -- really says something when you see that interview that you did now -- these years later now after what he's facing and many years behind bars. Great stuff, Sara. The historic impeachment trial against Texas attorney general -- the Texas attorney general continues today. The man at the center of it all is Ken Paxton, you'll remember, pleaded not guilty to impeachment charges yesterday. Paxton is a longtime fixture in Texas politics and a Republican, but he has been suspended from the job ever since the Republican-led State House impeached him for abusing the power of his office, even bribery. CNN's Ed Lavandera is at the Texas Capitol in Austin for us. Ed, they held a vote yesterday but what does it say and tell you about Paxton's future here?",

They could have dismissed this. It was a simple majority. But on all of those votes, Ken Paxton only got six to eight votes.So, we're kind of reading the tea leaves, here, Kate. It seems like the attorney general has about six to eight votes in his favor. Now, whether or not that can withstand the course of a several-week impeachment trial is left to be seen. But Ken Paxton needs 10 votes to be acquitted. So, it's not exactly clear as well if those votes are there for them, but there is a great deal of political pressure mounting on these senators, and all of this comes down to the Republican senators here who are listening to all of this. There are pro-Paxton groups that are mounting challenges and threats of voting these people out of office if they vote -- if they don't vote for Paxton. So, that pressure will continue intensifying.

Jean Carroll earlier this year for statements that he had made in October of 2020. There is a separate lawsuit and separate litigation relating to statements that Trump made about the same conduct and the same statements, essentially, in 2019, that case is set to go to trial in January.What the judge has found now is that the jury's verdict holds on finding that these statements, both in 2019 and in 2020 were defamatory. So, that is something that this new jury will not have to find. So, in other words, the judge saying that the jury in this case coming up in January will only have to make the decision of how much money Donald Trump will have to pay E. Jean Carroll in damages for the statements that were defamatory. And so, they're going into this trial with that conclusion already made, that the statements Trump made when he was president denying allegations that he had sexually assaulted E. Jean Carroll in the mid- 1990s, and his denials that he even knew her and that she wasn't his type, that will all be found in E. Jean Carroll's favor as this jury trial would begin in January. So, the question on the table is how much he will have to pay her in damages? And the jury, earlier this year, already found that Trump has to pay her $5 million for the previous defamatory statements. Trump's lawyers had asked this judge to put a cap on any future damages. The judge saying here that he will not do that. So, it's just a matter now of how much more the former president may have to pay E. Jean Carroll when this case goes to trial in January. Kate.

JIM MESSINA, CEO, THE MESSINA GROUP AND CAMPAIGN MANAGER FOR OBAMA 2012 RE-ELECTION CAMPAIGN:  Well, look, I spent most of my August break getting calls from panicked Democrats who ruined my vacation. So, I decided, Sara, to just look at the data and pretend we never heard of Joe Biden or Donald Trump. And just look straight at the data about the misery index about unemployment, about various statistics that really prove who is likely to win presidential elections. And when you look at the data, Joe Biden has a much better chance than Donald Trump to win the presidency. It doesn't mean it won't be close because it absolutely will. It doesn't mean Trump can't win, because he can. But I just wanted to actually give real data to folks to say, if you were playing poker, you'd much rather have Biden's hand than Trump's.",
