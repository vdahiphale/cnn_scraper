The Foreign Ministers of the European Union showing that they stand solidly behind Ukraine by moving their meeting to Kyiv. Former U.S. President Donald Trump expected to be in court in person at the start of his high stakes civil war trial in New York. And the Nobel Prize in Medicine honors the work of scientists who worked on the COVID vaccines. We have a live report coming up. First, let's check the action on Wall Street. U.S. futures are pointing to a mostly lower open on this first trading day of the new week, new month and new quarter. The deal to keep the U.S. government up and running for another 45 days is not giving stocks much of a boost today. It will be a challenging week for investors with lots of economic data set for release including the read on the health of the U.S. jobs market. A historic event that is how Ukraine's Foreign Minister is describing today's meeting with EU Foreign Ministers in Kyiv. The bloc's Foreign Policy Chief says Ukraine's future lies within the EU, today's gathering is happening just after the U.S. Congress passed a short term spending bill that does not include the $6 billion the Senate had requested for aid to Ukraine. Our Frederik Pleitgen is covering the developments and joins us from Eastern Ukraine. And Fred the EU's top diplomat Joseph Borrell called Russia's war in Ukraine an existential threat to Europe. As they know, this meeting is historic because the EU Foreign Ministers are meeting outside of the EU to show their support for Ukraine. Take us through the purpose of today's meeting?",

      "sentences": "Yes, outside of the EU, and certainly inside Ukraine. And I think that's really the mainpurpose of all this to show unwavering support for Ukraine on the part of the European Union and 27 Foreign Ministers especially in this time of possible turmoil and of questioning in the United States, for instance, about the future of support for Ukraine. But also of course, in many other countries as well, as you look at, for instance, Slovakia, you look at countries like Hungary, you look for instance, Poland recently telling the Ukrainians that they're not going to continue to supply weapons to Kyiv, so there are a lot of things where Ukraine has gotten some pretty bad news over the past couple of days. And I think it was important for the European Union to show that their support is going to be ongoing. I think one of the things that Joseph Borrell also said is that he said that the support for Ukraine would be unwavering. And he also said that the Russian shouldn't think that just because of the political events that happened in the United States and in Europe in Slovakia over the past couple of days, that that support was in any way, shape, or form waning. And I think that was something that was very important to hear for the Ukrainian, certainly for the Ukrainian Foreign Minister, who called this visit by the 27 Foreign Ministers in this meeting, who call that historic, Lynda. We've also been speaking to the National Security Adviser of Ukraine as well in the wake of the United States funding issues of all that's been going on in Congress. And he says that he is sure that Ukraine is going to continue to get military aid from the United States. But of course, it is an issue of concern for Ukraine simply because they are so dependent on aid from the United States, not just military, but economic aid as well. And they also believe that a lot of countries within NATO and certainly European countries within NATO are supplying aid to Ukraine, as far as the military is concerned, also, because they know that the U.S. is supplying aid as well Lynda.",

Well, Slovakia'sForeign Ministers among the European voices in Kyiv expressing their full support for Ukraine. So the huge support comes at a pivotal moment in Slovakian politics. Over the weekend, a party led by a pro Kremlin figure wants Slovakia's parliamentary elections, but it failed to secure enough votes to govern on its own. Robert Fico is now poised to start talks to form a coalition that could undermine Western support for Ukraine. CNN's Scott McLean is following the story for us from London. So Scott, at least until now Slovakia has been a one of Ukraine's staunchest allies in its war against Russia. But as expected, Robert Fico narrowly took the lead in this election. He is a Russian sympathizer. He is a man that said I will not send a single cartridge of ammunition to Ukraine if elected. So what could his election mean for Ukraine?",

      "sentences": "Yes, he also blamed Ukrainian Nazis and fascists in his words for provoking Russia into the war. Obviously, this isnot good for Ukraine if he were to become Prime Minister, because it would be one less country sending weapons sending ammunition, potentially. But there are a lot of other factors at play here. Obviously, Slovakia is not a huge country, only 5.5 million in terms of its donations to Ukraine, it is obviously only able to send so much but it has sent helicopters, artillery systems, air defense systems and its entire Soviet era fleet of fighter jets. So certainly it is not insignificant by any stretch of the imagination. I think what the West is concerned about right now, the European Union, NATO, they're concerned about how this might look that there are members of the Western alliance supporting Ukraine right now that perhaps are wavering in their support. And the Russians have made no secret about the fact that they think that they may be able to simply wait it out and wait for the West to fatigue over the Ukraine issue and cease to support them in the long run. And certainly while you have the Foreign Ministers there in Kyiv, trying to have the show of solidarity, there are definitely differences especially on you know, the Slovakia issue the Ukrainian Foreign Ministers sort of deferred comment on this waiting for the dust settles on the negotiations. While the Hungarian Foreign Minister said that look, the elections Slovakia is an opportunity since Robert Fico seems to see eye to eye with the Hungarian viewpoint on a lot of things, including on the war. At the same time you also had the Slovak Foreign Minister from the outgoing technocratic administration there in Kyiv saying that they are there to support Ukraine's territorial integrity and their own sovereignty. But of course, that may not be for long depending on what happens with these coalition negotiations, Lynda?",

He will get the first crack ahead attempting that, but it is not necessarily an easy path. There is a natural ally for Robert Fico's party in the Hlas Party which actually broke away from his party so lots of common ground there. He had not ruled out also partnering with a far right party that sees eye to eye with him in fact, it's even more extreme on the Russia Ukraine question but they actually didn't reach the 5 percent threshold needed to get seats in parliament. So now he has seven parties that he can try to partner with --",
