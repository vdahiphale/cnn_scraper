If you said James Buchanan put your hands up. Buchanan served as the 15th U.S. President from 1857 to 1861. He did not seek reelection because he had promised to serve only one term in office. Today is February 12th and it`s Abraham Lincoln`s birthday, did you know, born in 1809. Lincoln is one of the most iconic presidents in our nation`s history. And some parts of his presidential legacy have become almost mythological. Our Tom Foreman separates facts from fiction with some of these myths. And while you watch, keep in mind, these are short bullet points. We hope this serves as a guide. So you can talk to your teachers, dig into the research and discover the real life of this inspiring president. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)",
