This is a commercial solution in light of the Swiss finance news that it's an acquisition by UBS.

Without aggravating Europe an important trading partner any further.For President Putin's part, his role in all of this is to woo President Xi. Is to win him over. Is to get him on his side. This is an absolutely critical moment in the conflict. President Putin does need help. It's been a year of war now. Western officials say he's running out of weapons. He's running out of men on the ground. He's faced some major battlefield losses. He needs not just a show of support from Beijing, he needs actual material support. And as you pointed out there, that's something that U.S. officials have been concerned about. Pointing out that China could be considering sending lethal aid to Russia. And President Putin ahead of this visit has really been taking steps to show his strength, show he's in charge, show he's on the ground. You have that visit to Mariupol. Of course, the city that became a symbol of defiance for its fight against President Putin's army which absolutely leveled that all-important town, Mariupol. President Putin showing up there, the first visit to that region since the start of the conflict saying really in that visit, I am present, I am here, I am victorious, despite the battlefield losses. And it came a few days after the ICC, the International Criminal Court, issued an arrest warrant for President Putin. And yet again, in this PR move, he's saying I don't care, I don't recognize the legitimacy of that international court. I'm very much in charge. So, demonstrating that strength in power just before this important visit absolutely critical for President Putin. And as you pointed out there are concerns that this visit could conclude in some sort of an announcement from China. The United States is already preempting that, I want you to take a listen to what John Kirby, a top U.S. official said about that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN KIRBY, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL: If coming out of this meeting, there's some sort of call for a cease-fire, well that's just going to be unacceptable. Because all that's going to do, Mike, is ratify Russia's conflict to date. All that's going to do is give Mr. Putin more time to refit, retrain, reman and tried to plan for renewed offenses at a time of his choosing. We hope -- and we said this before -- that President Xi will call and talk to President Zelenskyy. Because we believe the Chinese need to get the Ukrainian perspective here. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That is according to a GoFundMe page that has been verified by CNN.And while authorities have not announced any sort of connection between Smith's death and the Murdaugh family, back in June 2021, the South Carolina law enforce vision or SLED, did announce that it was re-opening an investigation into Smith's killing. That was based on information that they gathered while investigating the double homicide of Maggie and Paul Murdaugh. And to this day, there's still so many questions surrounding Smith's death. According to a SLED report, pathologists indicated and stated in this report that it appeared that Smith was hit by a car. But according to highway patrol, responding officer who was there onsite, they didn't find any skid marks, they didn't find any glass or debris or any injuries that would be consistent with Smith being hit by a vehicle. In fact, both of the shoes were on and slightly loosened. So that wouldn't be something very much consistent with getting hit by a vehicle. And investigators saw no evidence suggesting that he was hit. We do have a statement today from SLED saying: SLED has made progress in the death investigation of Stephen Smith, however this investigation remains active and ongoing. Now Smith's mother has been fighting since day one, since his body was found to get some answers into her son's death. She started a GoFundMe with the goal of performing an independent autopsy to get those answers and an exhumation. She thought that would be around $7,000. She set a goal of $15,000. And today has blown past that goal. She put up a post on GoFundMe saying: Our family is so very grateful to all of you who came together to help us in our fight for justice for Stephen.
