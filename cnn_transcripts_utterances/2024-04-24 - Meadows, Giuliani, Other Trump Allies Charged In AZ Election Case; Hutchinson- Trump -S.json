Trump himself though an unindicted co- conspirator. My source tonight is Mark Meadows' one-time top aide and confidante turned witness against her former boss, and Donald Trump. Cassidy Hutchinson is here, hours before the Supreme Court takes on the enormous question, tomorrow, are presidents above the law. Also, a major decision is still looming tonight for Trump, in that hush money case. Will the former President be punished for his repeated apparent violations of that gag order? And really, the bigger question, how? I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. And we're going to get right to that breaking news, tonight, as former top aides, attorneys and allies, all close to Donald Trump, with that in common, have now just been charged in the State of Arizona, over their efforts, in the fake electors scheme to help Trump desperately try to overturn the election that he lost, and to keep himself in power. A 11 people in all have been charged. Among them. Rudy Giuliani; former White House Chief of Staff, Mark Meadows. Boris Epshteyn, a name you may not be familiar with. This is the first time he's been indicted, but also a former Trump aide who I should note remains to this day, one of his closest top advisers. Also, pro-Trump attorney, John Eastman; former Trump campaign lawyer, Jenna Ellis, along with 2020 campaign official, Mike Roman. Donald Trump himself, you don't see his picture there, he's an unindicted co-conspirator, we are told. This indictment includes charges ranging from conspiracy and forgery to engaging in fraudulent schemes. This is Arizona's Attorney General, Kris Mayes, announcing these indictments, tonight.

In fact, I would argue he shows the exact opposite. He shows contempt for our institutions. But when you sign up to go into public service, that that's not what you sign up, to go into. And I think there are a lot of people who, like myself, who believe they're going there to do the right thing, and to serve the American people, and they get caught up in something that's so much more dangerous than they actually anticipated. But I think there are some people that went in with their eyes wide open, and unfortunately, they knew, and they feel that their loyalty is owed to Donald Trump.

Now, we have the power of hindsight, and thanks to a lot of the work done by the January 6 committee, and also what we have known from limited public releases, from Jack Smith and his team. It's a lot more intricate than even what I knew. I was privy to a lot with Mark. I was not privy to everything. So, when I look at his role in the post-2020 election, he was involved in a lot, but he also knows a lot. He's a person that has critical information, I believe, in every single investigation.

Donald Trump's character has been evident for a very long time. But he's had a team of people around him, who have really isolated him, in this false identity of a strongman, and somebody that truly believes that they want the best for the American people. That's what his actions show, though, is he's not for the American people. He's for himself. He's willing to go to whatever ends necessary to make sure that he is not put in prison, like he is currently facing, and that the American people don't know the truth about him. It's important that the Supreme Court acknowledges that he does not get to evade consequence and accountability for this.

The police about an hour ago gave them a warning that if they stayed on Alumni Park, which is this area of grass that I'm standing on right now, where commencement will be happening in a couple of weeks. The protesters were told if they stayed, they would be arrested and liable for criminal trespass. The police then found out they were found along three sides of this park, allowing people, who wanted to leave the chance to leave. A lot of people did leave. But Dave (ph), if you pan around -- oh, you see that's one more person being arrested. Dave (ph), if you pan around, we can actually show the kind of knot of protesters right in the middle, who stayed. Those people stayed. They linked arms. Some of them put helmets and safety goggles on. Many of them put on masks, to disguise their identity. They were determined to stay and be arrested for this cause. Does he have anything to say? No, he doesn't. Now, earlier today, there was a bit of a scuffle, when the tents were taken down by campus police. The campus then asked the LAPD to come in and assist them. The campus, the college officials also closed the gates. Only people with USC ID were allowed onto the campus, because a lot of outside agitators have come on to join this protest. The college was trying to keep it small, trying to keep it contained. They failed. It got big, bigger as the day went on. And now, you're seeing the results. Young people, and others, from the City of Los Angeles being arrested. They say their demands have not been met. Their demands are similar to those on college campuses, around the country, at Columbia and elsewhere. They are doing this in solidarity. They are being arrested. Kaitlan.",

I'm going to maintain a degree of healthy skepticism, as to these fake elector indictments that we've seen, because if you look across the country, there's not much rhyme or reason. I mean, they're literally all over the map. We have seven states, where there were fake electors. We've now seen indictments in four. But nobody charged in the other three. Some of the states have indicted all the fake electors. Others have picked and choose. Georgia indicted some, but not other fake electors. Donald Trump is indicted in Georgia, for his involvement, in the fake elector scheme, but he's not mentioned at all in the other states. But then he's mentioned as an unindicted co-conspirator in this one. And there has not been a substantial conviction, in any of these cases. There's not been a trial conviction. There's not been a felony guilty plea. So, I'm going to maintain a healthy degree of skepticism until I see some actual results on these cases.",

Why do 20 states and counting ban abortion or nearly ban abortion? It's because of Donald Trump. Donald Trump created that court. He brags about overturning Roe. And since that Dobbs decision, we've seen state after state legislature, enact draconian extremist bans. Donald Trump created this. He did this. He owns this. And what we know from today is that Donald Trump is also responsible for women having to be airlifted, out of the State of Idaho, because they have been forced to the brink of death and life-altering medical conditions, because of a draconian ban. This is Donald Trump. And as we face November, the stakes could not be more clear. Anyone who cares about that?

You're not seeing him flanked by his children as he walks into court. They're not sitting there every day. They're really not even sort of actively social media championing their father.
