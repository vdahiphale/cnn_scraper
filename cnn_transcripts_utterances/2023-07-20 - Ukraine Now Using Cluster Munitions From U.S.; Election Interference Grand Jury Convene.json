And part of the purpose of this was first to make sure that Ukraine had enough artillery ammunition with its counteroffensive going slower than anticipated and slower than both Ukraine and the West would like to see. But also to be able to use the effect of the cluster munition, to saturate a small area with the bomblets that the artillery itself carries to be able to attack Russian defensive positions and formations. And that's exactly what they're doing with these, at least according to the White House.A spokesperson for the NSC says they're using them as was agreed between the U.S. and Ukraine, meaning they're not being used in tight urban areas or against civilian targets. They're being used against Russian defensive lines, lines that have been very difficult to breach or to penetrate as the counteroffensive has continued.   The White House saying they're using them to disrupt Russian defensive formations and positions as Ukraine tries to push forward with its counteroffensive. The question, of course, is how effective have they been, because it was a controversial decision to send them, because, first, many other countries have banned the use of them, but also because of their effect, because of potential duds in these bomblets that can explode at a later time. So it was a difficult decision from the Biden administration to send them. The question of how effective, though, that's still something U.S. officials are waiting to learn from the Ukrainian counterparts as they use these more throughout the combat, again, as they try to make progress in this counteroffensive, Brianna?",

Trump's lawyers have said they have until today to respond to the special counsel's target letter and say whether Trump will come in and testify to the grand jury.

      "sentences": "Well, Brianna, it's been a long day of work for the grand jury, apparently. They do work behind closed doors, confidentially, but we do know that they were hearing from at least one witness today, very likely two or even more.And that one witness was in this morning. And his testimony appears to have gone a little long. His lawyer was late for another separate hearing that he had to appear for at two o'clock and got to the courtroom a little bit late for that because the apparent grand jury proceedings were still ongoing. But this is a grand jury that has heard so much evidence over so many months, not just starting with the special counsel's appointment last November, but even before that, there were witnesses, there were subpoenas, there were documents incoming. And all of that is going to be brought together in some way that the Justice Department believes forms an indictment against the former president and potentially others as well. We know that is coming just because we know the Justice Department has sent that target letter to Donald Trump indicating that he is very likely to be indicted here and also identifying for him a couple of different criminal statutes that he's likely to be charged with related to potential obstruction of Congress around January 6th. That appears to be one of the possible charges. Also a conspiracy possible charge, which means that Trump would have been working with at least one other person on some of the actions that the Justice Department believes they can take to court, that they believe they could prove may be illegal. And so all of this is coming together. We don't have any word of an indictment yet, nor will we get one until it actually goes through the court system, until the Justice Department brings the indictment to the grand jury, presents it to them for approval. They vote on it in secret and then they present it to the court system. And the court then would have that indictment, and hopefully we would get it not long after that. That may come today. But I really hope, Brianna, you and I and we all can be very patient, because it may not be today. There could be many days ahead of us in this investigation at grand jury court. All of these things can be quite unpredictable and we don't know yet the next time the grand jury is scheduled to meet.",

So first of all, when we talk about expunging these impeachments, it's important to note the context that we have in clarification from the parliamentarian's office, in which they say that there is no clear procedural consequence if you actually expunge these impeachments or put forward a proposal to do so and it's not going to change the congressional record. These were votes that were taken in 2019 and 2020 that will remain on record.However, there has been a conversation about whether or not House Republicans would do this. It's something that Trump has suggested they do. We know that it's something that when he's been on the campaign trail, actually voters have said, why haven't House Republicans done this for you yet. And it's something that McCarthy has said that he personally backs. And we've learned that in a phone call with Trump, the House Speaker, Kevin McCarthy said that he personally backs this idea of this proposal to expunge his impeachment. But no promises were made. And there was no promise that this was going to be voted on in any way. This was just a conversation in some parts - some ways did seem as though McCarthy might be attempting to placate the former president, because this came in a conversation after Trump was very angry. [15:10:02]   His advisers were very angry when McCarthy did an interview in which he said that Trump might not be the strongest candidate in 2024. So along with an apology came this concession or this backing of this expungement. But again, it's not entirely clear it's even doable. We have multiple sources on the Hill who say that even leadership doesn't believe that there are the votes to do this, to pass this if it was to come up.",

Just ask Christopher Kise, who he gave $3 million retainer to, who is a very well-respected Florida lawyer, a former Florida solicitor general, and he was shelled because Trump didn't like what he was selling.

He's the in- House consigliere who has never tried a case, and he keeps telling Donald Trump good news, news he wants to hear.Well, that's not so good when then you get blindsided by something that everyone else was expecting. So this is a real problem in the Trump legal circle, and that's why they're bringing on new lawyers. They need to regroup because this is really serious. Although I still think, Boris, that the documents matter is the strongest case because there's a direct tie between Trump and the alleged criminality there, the January 6th case is probably the most important because it involves the attempted overthrow of our government, the attempted end to our democracy and it's something that the public really knows about because they were watching it all unfold on live TV.",

You're allowed to have your votes counted.And when Trump goes ahead and tries to prevent the votes from being counted, the certification of the votes or goes into Georgia and tries to add new votes, dilute the vote by adding 11,000 so forth the votes, that could violate that statute. And that statute gets you up to 10 years in prison. So you've got that, you've got the other two statutes, the obstruction of an official proceeding, which can also get you up to 10 years in prison and conspiracy to defraud the United States, which would get you up to five years in prison.
