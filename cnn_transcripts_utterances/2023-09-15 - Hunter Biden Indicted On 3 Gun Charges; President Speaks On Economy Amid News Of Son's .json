Special counsel, David Weiss, recently elevated to that role, brought this case tied to a 2018 firearm purchase. And we're expecting the President to speak at any moment, that was previously scheduled, as he becomes the first sitting president to have his child indicted by the Justice Department. But that's not the only reason that this is extraordinary.A few months ago, this gun case was literally minutes away from being resolved, but the plea deal collapsed in court in front of a judge - before questions from a judge. And this could mean a Hunter Biden trial in the middle of his father's reelection bid, adding to the already unprecedented 2024 political landscape. We have full coverage of this. Let's start with CNN's Evan Perez. Evan, walk us through the charges here and how this five-year investigation - let's reiterate five years - got to this point.",

      "sentences": "Look, Hunter Biden is trying to put a good face on it, but he's in a bad place, as anyone would be if you had just had federal charges filed against you. He was under investigation for five years and they believe that this would have been resolved with a plea deal. Even when that plea deal appeared to implode in that initial hearing, they were still optimistic that a judge would ultimately approve it and they could move beyond that. Then, of course, over the past weeks, we've seen that is not the case.Now, David Weiss is a special counsel and Hunter Biden has just been indicted. He is millions and millions of dollars in debt for the legal fees that he has incurred throughout the course of this investigation. Going up against the Justice Department in any case is extraordinarily expensive. It is almost impossible for him to find employment and it is increasingly difficult for him to find sources to help him pay for these legal fees. Now, the good news, I suppose, is that according to sources in the White House and in Hunter Biden's team, he's still very close to his father. They enjoy a good relationship. I'm told he tries not to bring up his criminal cases. Look, I don't have a wiretap into their phone. I don't know if that's true, but that's what people in his camp tell me. But they also believe that the White House, writ large, advisers around the President have not been supportive, have left Hunter Biden out to dry. We know some White House advisers, though, had some reservations about the recent, more aggressive strategy that Hunter Biden has taken since the beginning of the year, bringing on very aggressive lawyer Abbe Lowell. Hunter Biden and his longtime friend and attorney, Kevin Morris, have gotten a lot more aggressive, suing people who they believe have gone after Hunter Biden. Just yesterday, they sued Garrett Ziegler, a former Trump White House official, claiming that he hacked into Hunter's laptop and iPhone. They've been a lot more aggressive. That is something that has made the White House uneasy because they weren't sure what else potentially could come out. And, of course, today we see criminal charges, but it's unclear if these will hold up in a court of law.",

The question is going to be, how does this, in fact, affect their investigation that is ongoing into the President.Remember, one of the big questions that they had was whether or not to subpoena Hunter Biden. That has not happened yet. There's been a lot of pressure, particularly among members on the right, to push for a subpoena, how will that impact that, will they be able to get some of those questions. They have tried to lump in the investigation into Hunter Biden. David Weiss, the special counsel's investigation to Joe Biden himself suggests that there was some sort of interference by the White House into this initial plea deal that ultimately collapsed. There's no evidence that the White House was involved in that at all. But that's all part of their broad investigation into Hunter Biden, as they tried to find anything to pin Hunter Biden's actions to Joe Biden. Now, talking to a number of Republicans and Democrats, the argument from Republicans is that this was simply not enough. And Democrats are saying that justice - this is a sign that the Justice Department works. Have faith in the Justice Department. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL): I'll be honest.

He goes to the highest heights. He gets to the vice presidency. His son, Beau, dies as Attorney General of Delaware of brain cancer. And then as he's about to launch a presidential campaign and achieve his lifelong career dream, they are dealing with the ramifications of Hunter's drug addiction and how all of his troubles are going to play into the campaign and consider that into their political calculation. Remember, Jill and Joe Biden put out a public statement when Hunter Biden began a relationship with his brother's widow, and they actually like publicly addressed that prior to the campaign. There have been more emotional ups and downs for this family. And this is now another day where the President is going to suffer an emotional down that his son is under these criminal charges.
