So, you know, we have a tendency now to sort of think, oh, Trump just does things like this.I just want to put it in perspective or at least chronological perspective for viewers. So, we think of Australia, most people don't know, it's one of our major intelligence partners in the partnership called Five Eyes. It also is part of a deal just sealed by the Biden administration of the selling of nuclear submarines to Australia to -- our nuclear submarines to counter the China threat. So, it's a key player in geopolitics geopolitics. This billionaire is well-known in Australia. He has lots of contacts, as we've seen, journalists, prime ministers and others, is not -- you know, joins Mar-a-Lago and everyone -- if you are a member of Mar-a- Lago now, you know what you're going to get out of it. You're not there for the golf, you are there for the closeness to Donald Trump, who is more than willing to abide with two pieces of information that are not public for a reason, how many nuclear weapons are on each of these submarines, in other words, what's their capacity, and, second, how close they can get to enemy territory, whether it's Russia or China, without being detected. Those numbers are -- if an adversary knows them, they will be able to calculate what counterstrategy they would want against us. So, this is not just him being careless, this was purposeful.",

It's going to be the proximity issue because -- so think about an adversary aligning its strategy around what they know now, excuse me, which is can we get our submarines out without being detected by the U.S. submarines. So, I'm not thinking about Russian anymore, I'm thinking about China.And so that is the kind of information that you would want as our adversary because then you can plan your tactics, as many of our military analysts have said. I think the second issue is, regardless of the specific number, right, our allies, including Australia, but also the U.K., other members of Five Eyes, NATO, now know that that number is out there. They also know that Trump, unless something happens, is likely to be the nominee. So, if you are aligning your intelligence-sharing apparatus now in anticipation of what the United States could look like a year from now, you are paying attention about how much information about your own systems you would want the United States to know now with the possibility that Donald Trump could be president again.

You're calculating what could happen to the United States if Donald Trump gets the nomination. And, remember, if he gets the nomination he begins to get intelligence briefings at that moment. It doesn't wait until he's president because, if he wins, you want him to be ready on day one.So, access to information is going to be available to Donald Trump. Secret Service are going to be assigned to him as they -- not just as a former president but a future one, access to the intelligence apparatus will be afforded him in some measure when and if he gets the nomination. So, you're looking at a couple months, you know, less than a year where our allies are now going to assess how much do you want to share.

The funding comes from a Trump era 2019 appropriations bill.Now, President Biden says his hands are tied and he is required to use this money, despite his stance that border walls do not work. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  The money was appropriated for the border wall. I tried to get them to reappropriate -- to redirect that money. They didn't. They wouldn't. And in the meantime, there's nothing under the law other than they have to use the money for what it was appropriated. I can't stop that. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That's really the resounding message from the administration over the course of yesterday and going into today, that these were funds that were appropriated in 2019, that they were going to -- they were facing deadline and they had to use these funds that were only for the purpose of border barriers, so they had to do it. And the president, that you are hearing there, saying that he doesn't agree.And we also got a pretty forceful statement from Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas yesterday who similarly said he doesn't agree with this either. He doesn't think that the border wall is the answer, but the reality, John, is that you have a president who campaigned on not building an extra mile of wall when, because of these funds, they say, they're going to have to do exactly that and up to 20 miles of it.",

And now, starting this week, they're going to do exactly that.Here is why that's important. Most of the border crossers that are crossing today are Venezuelan. That is because there is a historic wave of Venezuelans across the western hemisphere. In fact, more than 7 million Venezuelans have left that country. To give you some context, John, that is more people that have fled Ukraine which is -- where there is an active war. And it's economic and political turmoil that has pushed people to leave that country and many of them move north. And so that has been a very unique challenge for this administration. Just in the month of August, they had more than 30,000 Venezuelans at the U.S./Mexico border. That number went up in September and is expected to continue to go up. So, this is a way for the administration to say we are going to levee consequences against this population and we are now going to deport them. And it sort of suggests a bit of a thawing of that frosty relation with Venezuela, which up until this point had not accepted their nationals. We are still trying to get answers as to what was the big breakthrough that had Venezuela changed their position on that. But, nonetheless, the hope here by senior administration officials is that by deporting them directly back to Venezuela, it shows consequence and, therefore, tries to drive down those border crossings.",
