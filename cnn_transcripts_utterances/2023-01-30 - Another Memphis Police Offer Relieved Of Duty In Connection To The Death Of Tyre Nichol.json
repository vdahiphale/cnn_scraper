They're tired. It's been very hard to recruit. We've been trying to get people for quite some time. The council has increased salaries. We've been pushing to hire more people, as has the mayor. And it's been very difficult to do. Two years ago, Wolf, we had a murder rate of 347 or so people in one year. To give you that an idea, that same year, New York with a population of 8.6 million as compared to our 650,000, had a murder rate just under 500.

      "sentences": "No, I don't. You know, one of the things that we tried to do here is we've initiated something called a group violence intervention plan. It's about 80 percent social work and about 20 percent directed police work. It was described in a book called \"Bleeding Out\" by Thomas Abt. He was someone who worked with the Obama administration.We were trying to figure out how to handle gang violence. You know, we were able, after the SCORPION unit came into being, to lower our murder rate to next year from 347 to 302. Now, can you prove that those 40-plus less murders were a cause of this intervention? You can't. But that particular program in other cities has gradually lowered the murder rate by about 10 percent a year. And the idea behind the program is you identify people who are actually killing each other and you try to arrest them. But you also go into each one of these groups and figure out what they need. Do they need housing? Do they need a job? How do you get them out of the gang so they don't kill each other? We have, you know, groups with automatic weapons driving around Memphis all the time shooting each other and killing bystanders in the wake. I think last week I talked to our police department, we're averaging 30 car thefts a day. The day before it was 45. And these are kids with guns going carjacking and, you know, breaking into cars. In Tennessee, you know, we have this law that says your car is part of your house and you can keep your gun in it. [17:10:01] So, every night, kids just go around and try to break into cars to try to find guns. In my mind, what this is more a problem with, Wolf, is we have devalued black males in our society and it's a systemic problem. It's not just in Memphis. That's why you see it all over the country and it's been going on for decades. It's the residual of slavery. And, you know, we as a society need to get a hold of this and figure out how do we help these people who've been devalued for years and become part of our society and not be victims of police when we're in this type of situation.",

Joining us now, our chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst John Miller, CNN political commentator Van Jones, civil rights attorney Areva Martin and defense attorney SHAN Wu.John, I'll start with you. So, you heard, of course, (inaudible), the sixth police officer has now been relieved of duty. What are you learning about this officer's actual involvement in this incident and the consequences he has faced at least so far? JOHN MILLER, CNN CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp; INTELLIGENCE ANALYST:  Well, this is the first officer we actually meet when we start to watch the video. He is the one driving up in the car. You see him here in this picture, actually holding up his graduation certificate from the crisis intervention team, which is a special course the Memphis P.D. actually developed and created an actual model to avoid injuring people in crisis when you encounter an unhinged individual in the street when the police are called. But he's the guy we see rolling up on the scene when the other officers who were already there are yelling at Tyre to get out of the car, to get on the ground. They're screaming. They're cursing. He comes out of the vehicle, approaches, tries to get involved with taking Mr. Nichols into custody. At one point, when Tyre Nichols gets up and runs away, he's the one who fires the taser which doesn't connect and doesn't stop him. There's a provocative comment where he's listening to the radio and he hears they are searching for him up closer to where Mr. Nichols lives, and he says, you know, they should stomp on him when they get him. He doesn't go to that second scene. So, right now he's not in the criminal mix, but he's on the criminal radar. Right now, Officer Hemphill is much more in the administrative mix which is, did he follow procedures? Was it a proper use of the taser? Did he put it over the radio from the body camera? It appears he did. But not going to the second scene is probably what keeps him on the lower rung of this triage, Wolf.

This community is not going to rest until everyone involved in what happened with Mr. Nichols is actually held accountable, and that includes criminal charges, if there are criminal charges that can be filed.",

And things like placing the sixth officer on leave even though he was not at the scene of the beating captured on tape is a really important step, Wolf, to stripping away this presumption, this de facto presumption that police officers are supposed to engage in violence, physical abuse and verbal abuse of members of the community.And it's only if we start to strip that away that we get a semblance of normalcy and normal laws can apply. I mean, putting on my prosecutor's hat, having lead police misconduct investigations, it's not just police that look the other way. Prosecutors fall into that presumption, too. And the district attorney said the speed of the indictments was unprecedented. He should be applauded for that speed, but it should not be unprecedented.

The way you look at it is, does this police department tend to single out black people in black neighborhoods for this type of behavior.And I think you will find in Memphis that that is overwhelmingly true. And so, you can have a police department that in one neighborhood has a warrior mentality and anything goes, and in another has a protector mentality. And it's like you will find in Shelby County, it's the black communities that are being brutalized and the white communities that are not. It's still an issue of racial bias regardless of the color of the cops. BLITZER:  Areva, I'm interested to hear your perspective on this. Go ahead.",

You can have these strike forces, call them SCORPION. The name itself is meant to put fear in the lives of people as well as the name obviously attracted the kinds of officers that would engage in this kind of aggressive behavior. And basically, these kinds of police tactics say to black people, you either live in fear of crime or you live in fear of the police. And it shouldn't be a binary choice.",

And to -- we at this point, we have to tamp down on the warrior mentality.It's not just militarization in terms of the equipment. It's the culture and the mentality that they're at war with the populous. You see the enormous rage in that video. Over what?
