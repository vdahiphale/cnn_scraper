Former Vice President, Mike Pence, is here live.And few Republicans are now defending Senator Tommy Tuberville, after our explosive interview, last night. What Alabama's senior senator is now saying, tonight, about White nationalists. Plus, she was originally sentenced to death, then supposed to spend life behind bars. Now, a follower, of Charles Manson, has just been freed, more than a half a century, after two gruesome murders. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Tonight, we have news, on three separate investigations, with Donald Trump, at the center of them all. In Georgia, a grand jury has now been formally sworn, in Fulton County. That is the grand jury that could decide to bring more criminal charges, against the former President, this time, for trying to overturn the 2020 election, in Georgia. District Attorney, Fani Willis, has indicated that potential indictments could come as soon as next month. In neighboring Florida, delay tactics appear to be afoot. Trump and his attorneys are asking for the entire classified documents trial, to be pushed back, indefinitely. Meanwhile, in Washington, today, the Special Counsel's top prosecutors were seen, for the first time, in weeks, at a federal courthouse, in the same area, where the grand jury, in the January 6th investigation, typically meets. Someone, who has testified before the grand jury before, is here, tonight, with us, former Vice President, Mike Pence. Mr. Vice President, thank you so much for joining us, tonight. You obviously have been testifying in that investigation. MIKE PENCE, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Thank you, Kaitlan.",

But the question of NATO membership, and I spoke about this with President Zelenskyy, I think, should all wait on after the war is won. And I must tell you, as I heard again, from President Zelenskyy, that I honestly think President Biden has done a very poor job, explaining our national interests, there. But also, I heard President Zelenskyy's frustration, with how slow the United States has been, in fulfilling our commitments, for military support. Kaitlan, we promised 33 Abrams tanks, back in January. They're now being told, I heard on that trip, that they might get them in September. They're still waiting, on the approval, from the United States, for F-16s. And now, I hear there's a deal for F-16s, with Turkey. Look, President Biden said, in his State of the Union address that \"We're there as long as it takes.\" Well, Kaitlan, I believe it shouldn't take that long. We ought to get on with it. We ought to give the Ukrainian military what they need. They've demonstrated their toughness. Let them fight and win, repel the Russian invasion.

And in my interactions with him, I conveyed that, that firmness.But I will say I'm proud of the fact that however, President Trump spoke about, or continues to speak about Vladimir Putin, our Administration, as a whole, stood firm. We rebuild our military. Our Armed Forces, and ISIS (ph), actually took down 100 of those Wagner Russian mercenaries, in Syria, when they moved on our troops. We used cruise missiles, against Syria, when they used chemical weapons, on their own people. I think there's no coincidence that Vladimir Putin did not even try to redraw international lines, by force, during the Trump-Pence administration, because we were strong. We were committed to American strength. We showed a willingness, to use American military power, to defend our interests, and our allies. And frankly, in the aftermath of that disastrous withdrawal, from Afghanistan, I think this administration, in that respect, in trying to beg around, to get back in the Iran nuclear deal, has been, frankly, projecting weakness, on the world stage. And it's emboldened the enemies of freedom. But -- so the rhetoric was different, the way I spoke about Putin, in our day, the way President Trump spoke about him.

But I got to tell you, the thing that I learned, in all of my years, not as Vice President only, but also 10 years, on the House International Relations Committee, is that the leaders around the world respect actions, more than words.

And I had been in George, earlier in the day, rallying folks, for that special Senate election. And I remember, he said, \"Mike Pence has got to come through for us. And if he doesn't, I won't like him so much.\" And then he paused and said, \"No, no, one thing you know about Mike is he's always going to do the right thing.\" And I remember, in that moment, Kaitlan, thinking, maybe he's coming around, and starting to see that the people that had told him that I had some authority that the Constitution simply did not give me, nor should ever give to any one individual. The presidency belongs to the American people and the American people alone. But it was not to be and, sadly, things went downhill from there. But I had hoped all along the way to persuade him, of the rightness, of our cause and our position. Let the process work in the Congress. Let the objections be heard.

She has this grand jury, sitting now, for two months. They will meet as often as she needs. And the process from here can really be very streamlined. Because remember, they put all the primary evidence, the actual live testimony, from Mark Meadows, from Brad Raffensperger. That went in front of the special grand jury. And what you can do now, as a prosecutor is, you don't have to recall all those people, and have them take the oath, and testify again. You can just present that testimony, to this grand jury, which unlike the prior grand jury, has the power to indict. So, it really could be any moment.

What's interesting, when I talk to people, who were -- that I still talk to, in Trump world, they see each of the cases, kind of differently.

January 6, they're worried about it just re-litigating the worst day of the President's former presidency, and kind of getting the footage of the Capitol being stormed up again.
