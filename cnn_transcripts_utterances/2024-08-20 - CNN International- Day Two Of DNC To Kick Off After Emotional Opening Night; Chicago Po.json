      "sentences": "Yeah. I think if Democrats want one thing from President Obama, it is to make this affirmative vision for Kamala Harris. For one thing, he is the most popular figure in the Democratic Party, along with his wife, Michelle Obama, but he also is someone who has actually known Kamala Harris for quite a long time. They have a relationship going back 20 years. Actually, she was in the convention hall in 2004 in Boston when President Obama, who was then-candidate Obama, delivered the keynote address that essentially thrust him into national politics. Back then, he described himself as this skinny kid with a funny name. Today, he is coming on the convention stage essentially as an elder statesman.And when you talk to people who are around Obama, they do say he has sort of a difficult needle to thread here. He wants to make the case, the affirmative case for Kamala Harris and her running mate, Tim Walz. He will also have to separate her somewhat from the record of the Biden administration that hasn't resonated with voters, and he is also trying to sort of recoalesce the coalition that helped propel him to the White House in 2008. So, it's a tricky task. But, there is a reason they've given it to probably the best speech maker in the Democratic Party. He has spoken at so many conventions and so many memorable lines, and I think back to the one in 2016 when he was warning about a Donald Trump presidency. He said that Trump was selling a deeply pessimistic vision of a country where we turn against each other and turn away from the rest of the world. Not much has changed in the last eight years. You can imagine him reviving many of those themes this evening. And when you talk to Obama advisors, they say that he views this as an all-hands-on-deck moment. He is ready to commit to do whatever is necessary to elect Kamala Harris. In some ways, he is paying the favor. Back in 2008, Kamala Harris made the trek to Iowa before the caucuses there, to knock on doors, to make phone calls, to hand out pizzas. President Obama probably won't be handing out pizzas this fall, but certainly he is ready to do whatever it takes to get her to the White House.",

DIRECTOR, ASPEN INSTITUTE CONGRESSIONAL PROGRAM: Well, I think Republicans clearly recognize that the Democrats have a lot of energy and enthusiasm going into their convention. No question about that. They're very pleased by what's happening. And I would have to think that the Republicans are anxious. They want to slow this momentum. They're probably not going to be able to do it this week, maybe the protesters will, but it's not going to be from the Republicans. And frankly, Republicans know too that there were two defective candidates. Many won't admit that their own candidate is defective, but many know that he is, and of course, Biden wasn't. The Democrats did something about it. And the he fact that they have a younger, more enthusiastic candidate is really reflected in the polls, and this has really become a binary race at this point.

So, I think Republicans are still in decent shape to take the Senate. But, the House is a different matter. Republicans were feeling pretty confident when Joe Biden was at his lowest moment. They thought they could easily hold the House and maybe even pick up some seats. Now, they're not so sure.So the down-ballot damage has been mitigated for the Democrats just by swapping out Joe Biden for Kamala. So, it's very much in play. But, you can just get -- it's a palpable sense that particularly House Republicans know that they are at a deficit on fundraising as well. Democrats are outraising them, particularly in those key battleground districts.

I think they're executing very well here, I think tonight, with former President Obama speaking, as well as some Republicans who are not going to support Donald Trump.I think it is key for the campaign to communicate that there is a permission structure for independents and for Republicans to join the Harris-Walz team, to vote for them. They may not agree with everything and may not agree with all the policies, but they know for whatever reason, whatever issue they care about, whether it is protecting democracy or minimizing chaos in the White House, that there is a home for them on this campaign. And then look, we come out of this convention. We go into Labor Day. We're then going to go to the first debate and that is where the momentum goes from there.

Rescue crews in Gaza City dug with their bare hands through crushed concrete, desperately looking for survivors after an Israeli air strike on a school where displaced families were sheltering. Gaza's Civil Defense says that at least 12 people were killed, mostly women and children. Israel says that it conducted a precise strike targeting militants operating inside the school.Also today, Israel announced that it had retrieved the bodies of six hostages from Gaza. It says that soldiers found them in Hamas tunnels in Khan Younis. Families of Israeli hostages say that the government must finalize the ceasefire deal now and bring the remaining hostages home. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is trying to shore up support for the latest proposal, described as an attempt to bridge the gaps between Israel and Hamas. Today, he met with Egypt's President in Cairo, and now he is heading for Doha, Qatar. Let's bring in Jim Sciutto in Tel Aviv for more, Jim, let's start with this announcement about the hostages. Israel had already announced the death of all but one of these men in recent months. What more can you share here? JIM SCIUTTO, CNN CHIEF U.S. SECURITY ANALYST: Well, it's a sad fact, Rahel, that the number of hostages that may be released alive is constantly dwindling. Now, we are at 109 still being held, the vast majority of those following the October 7 attacks. But, here you have six more who were, we should note, taken alive on October 7. So, the IDF, as you know, knew that five of them were dead prior to today, and now a sixth. The thing is, it just shows you that in these 10 months of war that many of those hostages, that families here have been clamoring to get home, they'll never come home alive, right? And while they're not public with their estimates, it is a large number, a large percentage of the remaining hostages that Israeli authorities believe have died in captivity. It's a sad fact, because, you've seen, Rahel, how emotional and understandably so this is not just for the families themselves, but for the Israeli population to see those people left behind. Now, as you know, the Israeli Prime Minister has also come under criticism in this country for not prioritizing the hostages enough, and he gave a statement today in which he said, and I'm paraphrasing here, he said that he will make every effort to bring hostages home as part of these ongoing ceasefire-hostage release talks, but that he is not going to give up Israel's strategic assets, and that is that he wants to maintain some security control over Hamas presence there after a ceasefire, and even insisting on some security presence there, in particular along the border between Gaza and Egypt. The trouble is that position, Rahel, may stand in the way of any agreement to release hostages and come to even a partial ceasefire there. That's the state of the talks.",

On board, tech titan Mike Lynch and his 18-year-old daughter Hannah, Morgan Stanley Chairman Jonathan Bloomer and prominent attorney Chris Morvillo and their wives, an official told CNN. Lynch's wife, whose company owned the 56-meter yacht, survived. All the passengers were guests of Lynch, who was acquitted of fraud charges in the U.S. over the sale of his company. A local fisherman who was waiting out the storm saw the ill-fated yacht. FABIO CEFALU, FISHERMAN (Interpreted): We waited about 10 minutes to see the intensity of the tornado and we went out to sea. We were first to give rescue, but we found no one at sea. We only found cushions and the remains of the boat. NADEAU (voice-over): The luxury yacht's 72 meter, 236 foot aluminum mast snapped in the storm, sending 15 people into the sea, including a one-year-old girl whose mother carried her above her head in the wave, she told reporters. The survivors, including all 10 crew members, were rescued by a nearby sailboat who found them in a lifeboat.",

This area has been very controversial. There have been a lot of these kind of racial incidents over the past several decades. I will note, President Joe Biden has also been to this town specifically. This is a critical area in Michigan. A reminder here that this state itself is one of the most important states in this race.So, when I talked to Donald Trump's team, they insist that they had no idea that that had happened back in July. Obviously, we will try to see if he says anything about that in his remarks, although it seems deeply unlikely that he would address it at all. They said that they chose this area, one, because of the sheriff, because there have been increased crime rates, but also, two, Rahel, they are very focused right now on media markets. They are trying to reach big cities where they can actually talk to voters through the local media, through the local media coverage. This area where we are is also a suburb of Detroit, meaning the Detroit media market is covered by this area. And one of the things that we're seeing, we saw him go to Asheville, North Carolina. That seems kind of crazy. That's a blue area in a very red area around it. Why wouldn't he go to a place that's more Trump friendly? Well, part of that was because of the media market that Asheville is in. It touches a lot of surrounding areas. They believed that they'll go there and they'll get the local coverage and they'll reach out directly to voters. Again, this is part of a larger strategy that we're still trying to see if it's going to work, because this race is in such an unprecedented state right now with the change at the top of the Democratic ticket.",

It's a quite quiet. It was very late night for all those who stayed up to watch. That theme today is a nod both to the Democrat schools for the future and also the concept of outreach to younger voters. The youth vote is one that Kamala Harris' team has been focusing on since President Biden dropped out of the race. The Harris-Walz campaign has reached out to several youth voting organizations. Last night at the DNC, one of the youngest members of the U.S. Congress spoke to the convention about growing up in New York and about her work ethic. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP.

So, looking at last night's convention, there was so much energy in the air. I was sitting around a bunch of the credentialed creators, actually, who were there. The DNC has made a concerted effort to credential more than 200 creators who can reach their audiences on social media. Many of those followers are younger voters, in particular, and there was a lot of excitement. I think the speeches you mentioned, Representative Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez's speech, that was something that drove a lot of excitement. There were cheers echoing. And beyond that, I've been talking with young people since the speech wrapped up last night, and they were just saying that they could really feel how tangibly excited everyone there was.",

But, I also do think that there is -- this is a concern from young voters, and I've heard this, and in a listening session I held just last week before the convention started, they said that they are looking for what she is going to say on this issue in particular.But, I think it is also important to point out that while there are a number of young people who are deeply concerned about the situation in Gaza and the humanitarian crisis there, there is also a desire from -- for the hostages to be returned. This is something I've heard as well. So, I think it's -- there is a vocal minority that has been protesting very loudly since the start of this war.

And it's a drastic shift from what we saw when President Biden was at the top of the ticket.So, while at the end of the day, when they're going to vote, I don't think they're going to go vote because of a meme or a TikTok that they saw. I do think that they could see that on their For You page and then go and look up her policies. Or for example, if Megan Thee Stallion posts a video on Instagram, on reels, on TikTok, that gets millions of views, people who may not have Kamala Harris in their feed might have Megan Thee Stallion, and then may click the tag, go to the Vice President, see what her campaign is all about, and it could play a role in youth voter turnout in November.",
