      "sentences": "OK. So, you know you love Capitol Hill drama. You don't have to admit it, but you know you love it. And today is going to be one of those days. Very soon President Biden's son, Hunter, is arriving on The Hill and heading behind closed doors for what has become a highly anticipated moment, the face-to-face with Republicans lawmakers in the biggest moment so far in the Republican-led effort toward impeaching President Biden.CNN's Paula Reid, she's watching all of this, tracking all of this, hopefully has sneakers on because it's going to be wild. Paula, what is going to happen today? And what questions is he likely to face? PAULA REID, CNN CHIEF LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Look, I definitely wore my sneakers for today. Let me tell you how significant this is. They are actually moving this deposition to a bigger room than the one they usually use because they anticipate a record number of members are going to attend. This is a make-or-break moment for GOP lawmakers who so far have not been able to provide clear evidence to support their allegation that President Biden benefited from his son's foreign business dealings. Now, initially Hunter Biden said he would only testify publicly. They said they were worried about selective leaks from Republican lawmakers. But Republicans agreed not to videotape this deposition, unlike other witnesses in this inquiry who have been videotaped, and also swiftly release the transcript. So, these are two concessions that they needed to make in order to get Hunter Biden to sit for this interview. Now, among the topics that I think particularly Democrats may want to bring up is the fact that this appearance, Kate, comes just two weeks after the Justice Department charged an informant who had alleged that the Bidens received millions of dollars in foreign bribes with lying about that, with fabricating those allegations that are at the heart of the GOP's inquiry here. So, I think Democrats are really going to seize on that. And again, this is make-or-break for Republicans. I think they're going to try to find any way to get something to support the merits of this impeachment inquiry. So, this is going to be one to watch. It could be a late day. And right now we're just waiting for the president's son to arrive here on Capitol Hill.",

Essentially, this is the same thing that we've seen prior with Lyndon Johnson's brother, with Jimmy Carter's brother, with Richard Nixon's brother. I mean this is no different.

I think you're going to see Hunter basically, in response to some of these more afield questions, actually aggressively defend himself as a recovering addict. I think you'll hear him sound that theme.

All of that due to the five wildfires burning in the surrounding areas.Now, the air here is still full of smoke. It burns your eyes. It burns your mouth and throat. Residents are being encouraged to stay inside, to keep their pets inside. This is also one of the areas that folks who can get here from neighboring counties are being encouraged to come here for evacuation. We actually visited a shelter late last night. They're bringing in more cots to make it more comfortable to people who have sought refuge and shelter here. Governor Greg Abbott issuing a disaster declaration for 60 counties. That's six zero. And as of this morning, that blaze exploding to more than 500,000 acres. Now the Smokehouse Creek Fire, that's the largest of the five that's burning, being described as the second largest in Texas history. Now, a lot of these areas are rural. That means it's not just people that are impacted, but ranches, wildlife. There were some dramatic footage of horses and other animals trying to flee the smoke and the flames. The main facility that disassembles America's nuclear arsenal is located about 17 miles from where we are standing. That is the Pantex Plant. That had to shut down on Tuesday. It is back online as of Wednesday morning. Meanwhile, the city of Fritch, one of the areas that was evacuated, residents were asked to limit the water use so that fire trucks could be filled. They are also, that city, asking for outside help to bring their water system back online after that massive wildfire knocked out power there. Canadian, Texas, another area that was very hard hit by the blaze, one of the motel owners there told CNN that it looked like Armageddon. All of the trees are covered in white ash. The local hospital there had to evacuate all of their patients due to the fire on Tuesday. In other parts of the panhandle, people had to take shelter in schools, in churches. Not safe enough just to stay home. The blaze, just so powerful there. And now we are learning those fires spreading to neighboring Oklahoma. Back to you.",

I don't know how well you can see that, but, you know, you're matching letters and numbers, you're drawing a clock, for example, trying to draw a three-dimensional cube, identifying animals, remembering words. It takes about ten to 15 minutes.One thing to point out is that President Trump -- former President Trump had this done, I think twice. Both times at his own request. And I point that out to say that it wasn't the doctors necessarily asking for this. They typically ask to do a test like this, or recommend it, if there is some specific concern. And again, about 16 percent of people who are seniors will actually get that as part of a routine exam, meaning most don't. But that - that - it's a screening test, Kate. It's not a diagnostic test. It gives you some indication, is there a need to explore further? Is there some problem with memory loss or executive reasoning or speed of thought, things like that. President Trump, again, I think a couple years ago, a few years ago now, got a perfect score on the exam, he said 30 out of 30.
