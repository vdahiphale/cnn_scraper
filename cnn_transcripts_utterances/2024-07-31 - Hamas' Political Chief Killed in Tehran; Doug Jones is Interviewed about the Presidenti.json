      "sentences": "Israel only saying that they don't comment on foreign media reports. Now that is, I think, a sort of code that we've heard in the past when an event occurs or an act like this occurs that potentially has the hand of Israel behind it, their way of not denying involvement, but also not confirming it.We're in that curious position here but it hasn't, of course, stopped the Iranian - the president of the Iranian government. The Iranian supreme leader pointing the finger directly at Israel, essentially saying that a guest in their house had been killed and Israel should await harsh punishment for doing this. Quite what form that will take is key. And I think in order to enable Iran to fashion that response, they're going to carefully construct the details of exactly how this happened. We know very little about this apparent explosion, strike depending on what report you read that seems to have hit a special veterans guest house in northern Tehran where Ismail Haniyeh was staying. Now, it isn't clear quite the extent of the damage to the building. There are some reports saying it was limited, which would suggest an exceptionally targeted strike. And indeed the only other casualty is one of Haniyeh's bodyguards that's currently talked about. The phrase being used is, an airborne guided projectile, which, frankly, could be anything. It does seem to point away, though, from necessarily immediately accusing Israel of using a jet and an airstrike in all of this. So, the gravity in which Iran portrays its sovereignties haven't been violated here. That will be key in what they say they're going to do in response. And so we're waiting, I think, for more details from Iran and also potentially some greater clarity from Israel and - and the extent of its involvement here. Jessica.",

JONATHAN CONRICUS, FORMER IDF SPOKESPERSON: Well, I think that it's a - if it indeed is an Israeli assassination, which is what it looks like, I think it's a tremendous achievement to do so in the heart of Tehran and to send a very strong message to the Iranian puppeteers who behind the scenes have been actually controlling and monitoring and managing this entire situation that Israel has been facing since October 7. It is definitely tense. I agree with you that now Israel will be bracing for both Hezbollah attacks, Hamas attacks, and possibly an Iranian attack against it because in a matter of about ten or 11 hours Israel was able to assassinate both a very senior Hezbollah militant commander, Fuad Shukr, in Beirut, and the political leader and one of the key figures of - or key architects of the October 7 massacre, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran.
