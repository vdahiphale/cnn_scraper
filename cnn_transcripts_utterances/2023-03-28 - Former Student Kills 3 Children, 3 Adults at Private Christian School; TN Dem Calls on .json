Sad news to report this morning, right now, we are waiting for the release of police body camera video taken as officers confronted a shooter who killed six people, including three children at a private Christian school in Nashville. Three of those victims just nine years old. One of them, Hallie Scruggs, you can see a picture there from 2019. Just a little girl, the daughter of the lead pastor at Covenant Presbyterian Church, a church affiliated with the school. The other two children have been identified, Evelyn Dieckhaus, William Kinney. Among the adult victims, 61-year-old Cynthia Peak. The other two were school employees, 60-year-old Katherine Koonce, head of school, Mike Hill, he worked as a custodian. All of them lost their lives yesterday.Since the shooting, a memorial outside the school has been growing, something we've seen so many times. This morning, it's been adorned with balloons, stuffed animals, across as well decorated with flowers. The school has released a statement saying, in part, our community is heartbroken. We are grieving tremendous loss and are in shock coming out of that terror that shattered our school and our church. A woman who survived the Highland Park mass shooting in Illinois just last year, she was visiting Nashville. Yesterday, she jumped in at the end of a police news conference to speak out against gun violence. It was quite a moment. Here's what she had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It reads, \"One day this will make sense. I've left behind more than enough evidence behind, but something bad is about to happen.\" Now, Patton says that she received this DM from the attacker again in the minutes before the shooting took place. She goes on to call 911 police to let them know about this message around the time the shooting takes place. But according to her, officers do not show up to her house until about 3:30 in the afternoon, several hours after this shooting had taken place. Patton was on CNN This Morning and described her reaction to this entire thing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They did get the support of Republican senators for a more modest bill. It did not go as far as what the President wanted. It did not ban assault weapons. It did not enhance background checks to the extent that the Democrats want so called universal background checks. It had other measures, such as providing funding for schools to harden their safety, as well as providing money for so called state red flag laws and also dealing with how juveniles are treated in the background check system. But nevertheless, right now, that call to reinstate the ban on semiautomatic rifles, democrats are making that call. But in talking to Republicans today, they are making very clear they're not going anywhere near that issue. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. BYRON DONALDS, (R) FLORIDA: So, Second Amendment here in the United States, people are allowed to possess firearms. Need is in the eye of the beholder. I don't question why you need a blue suit, but you got one. And I know we're talking about something very, very different, but the Second Amendment allows American citizens to possess firearms.",

We've been doing everything. We make it harder to vote and to buy an AK. You can buy an AK out of a -- out of a trunk of a car in a Kroger parking lot in Tennessee. You know, we've allowed permitless carry in Tennessee, and our governor had the goal to sign that bill in a Beretta manufacturing plant here in Tennessee. I mean, that's the climate in which I serve. That's the uphill battle that I'm fighting and helping lead in the state of Tennessee. But, you know, what I need is the people of Tennessee, and I believe a vast majority of Tennesseans, want gun sense legislation. They don't think that allowing anyone to carry a handgun or an AK in public without a permit or without any training, you know, that they bought out of the trunk of a car in a parking lot.

And then from there it spread out of control, as you mentioned, killing at least 39 people, dozens others injured as well. The investigation as to what led up to all of this is still ongoing. We are told this happened last night, but a dramatic and horrific scene there as so many people have lost their lives. But this comes after months and months of frustration for many migrants, many from Venezuela and South America, who have been essentially stuck there on the Mexican side of the U.S.-Mexico border as they've tried for months and months to request asylum. The whole process has been extremely difficult for many of these migrants. So essentially many of them have told us over the last few months, just sitting there, waiting in limbo. So that really kind of speaks to the frustration and the anxiety that so many of those migrants are enduring there in that border city of Juarez.

Some of the progressives, like Senator Elizabeth Warren, they blamed some of the deregulation of the Trump -- the Trump era, specifically that bipartisan 2018 rollback of Dodd-Frank. And yes, the regulators for their part, they are pointing the finger at bank leadership.Michael Barr, the top banking regulator at the Federal Reserve, in his prepared remarks, he says that Silicon Valley Bank really mismanaged this by failing to brace their balance sheet for soaring interest rates. And then when they did finally act, they spooked their customers so much that there was this epic run on the bank. Barr summed it up this way, he said, \"SVB's failure is textbook case of mismanagement.\" I think the truth though, is that it's probably not one thing that caused these bank failures. It was probably a confluence of events, including soaring interest rates. But Jim, it is critical that they get to the bottom of what happened here.",
