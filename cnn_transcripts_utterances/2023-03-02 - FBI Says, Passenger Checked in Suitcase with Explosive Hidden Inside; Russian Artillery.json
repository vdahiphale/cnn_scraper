It happened at the airport in it Allentown, Pennsylvania. The bomb squad rushing into the scene there, and the FBI later arresting this man seen on surveillance video. Here's the breakdown of exactly what happened. The FBI saying the suspect arrived at the airport Monday morning and checked in his suitcase. After an hour, about an hour later, investigators say TSA agents found an explosive device hidden inside of that suitcase. According to the FBI, the suspect left the airport when security started calling for him over the intercom. The FBI's bomb technician who responded to the scene says the device was circular, wrapped up in wax-like paper and plastic wrap and hidden in the lining of the baggage. He says there were two fuses, a quick fuse designed to ignite explosives quickly, and a so-called hobby fuse that burns slower. Straight now to CNN's Andrew McCabe, our senior law enforcement analyst and the former deputy director of the FBI. Good morning, Andrew -- Andy, I should call you. This is really scary stuff. I mean, what is your impression of the device allegedly found in this -- his name is Muffly, his last name -- in Muffly's bag, what sort of damage could these materials do?",

What it lacked was an initiation device, like an altimeter or a timer or a cell phone connection that would have enabled Muffly to ignite the device while in flight.So, now that doesn't mean it wasn't dangerous. That compound that he used, that commercial grade firework, can actually be ignited with heat and friction and things like that. So, it certainly could have gone off in the luggage hold.

That is a move that will likely only make the tensions already under way between the United States and China worse. The State Department says it's a move they think is necessary to enable it to maintain a sufficient self- defense capability, all of that amid concerns with a possible future attack. China is unsurprisingly not happy with this and says it firmly opposes the move and will take, and I'm quoting Chinese officials now, firm and forceful measures to protect its sovereignty given China claims the island as its own. The new package would include the F-16 fighter jets. Those could be crucial to Taiwan's defense if there were to be an air attack from China. Taiwan's foreign minister is responding to all of this saying, quote, in the face of China's continued military expansion and provocations, Taiwan will continue to elevate its self-defense capabilities. All of this is coming as several lawmakers and former top national security advisers are making public their concerns about a backlog in the actual delivery of these weapons to Taiwan.

MCMASTER, FORMER TRUMP NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER:  As all of you know, there is a $90 billion backlog of what the Taiwanese have already purchased to make that island indigestible and to achieve deterrence by denial, by convincing the People's Liberation Army and Chinese Communist Party they cannot accomplish objectives through the use of force.

He said, you know, he wouldn't comment on this. We emailed the address associated in the file and we didn't get a response back. [07So, we went and we were talking to people. We went to the New York State election officials. We asked if Andrew Olson was associated with any political campaigns in New York State. They said that he is not. It's not a name that they know. We've reached out to the spokesman for the Republican Party of Nassau County. That is part of George Santos' district. They said never heard of the guy. That's according to the spokesman. He said also that the head of the GOP party out there also is unfamiliar with him. So, then we went to the apartment building that was associated, the address included in the FEC filings. It happens to be the same apartment building that George Santos' sister had lived in up until January. And now, this treasurer was just named last week. So, there's a month where no one knows Santos has lived in that building. But that is the address that they placed on this form saying that that is where he is. It was where the campaign uses their address because she had lived there but she hasn't lived there for a month. We went there. They said that no one by that name lives in the building. There are three businesses that are also in this mixed use building. They said no one by the name of Andrew Olson works for their businesses. So, we really came up empty in trying to find him. So, we talked to some campaign finance experts and asked them about this. And one had said he never seen before that it's a complete mystery that who the treasurer is for a sitting member of Congress. You know, so the question still remain of who he is. Hopefully, he'll respond to us or Santos will provide more clarity. But it certainly is interesting that we don't know a lot about the person or where they came from.

Because from the perspective of Paul Ryan, you are not happy with the current state of your party if you're Paul Ryan and you're looking to transform your party beyond this moment, beyond Trump's group on it, beyond the January 6th event, all of it, right? So, he sees this as we can't do that. We can't move the Republican Party to a place that is broader, more representative across the country if Fox is not part of that because Fox, as we've seen, guys, through this case and throughout these years in politics, it is so part of the firmament of the Republican Party, it is such a critical piece. So, that when it is selling lies, its viewers are believing the lies and the party gets infected with lies. And so his pieces -- well, Fox needs to be part of whatever we're doing.
