      "sentences": "And a very warm welcome to the show, everyone, I'm Paula Newton in Atlanta in for Isa Soares. Just aheadfor us, Chinese people are rushing to book overseas travel after the government announced it would finally reopen the borders in January. But meantime, across China, COVID-19 cases are rising, prompting some countries to impose measures on travelers coming from the country. Then Russia's foreign minister gives Ukraine an ultimatum, either Ukraine accepts Moscow's demands including giving up four occupied regions or the Russian army will take action. And officials in the U.S. state of New York are begging residents to stay off the roads as an arctic storm has claimed at least 29 lives in the area. We will be live in Buffalo. Now, at last, freedom to travel when China is now dropping its last major COVID restrictions of the pandemic, and that is even at this hour as cases right across the country continue to soar. Now, the government announced it will no longer prevent Chinese nationals from traveling overseas and will not require incoming travelers to quarantine. Now, that will be effective January 8th. And it is re-listed now COVID to a class B disease. And that's significant. It is a dramatic turnaround in fact, for a society that just a short time ago locked down entire cities, you'll remember that, and subjected citizens to draconian measures hoping to contain the pandemic. But not every country is ready to welcome Chinese travelers with open arms. Japan and India say they still will require a negative COVID test upon arrival. Now, you have to remember though, for many inside and outside China, lifting the travel bans mean they will finally see their loved ones again. CNN's Selina Wang has more for us now from Beijing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SELINA WANG, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The world's harshest quarantine is no more as COVID sweeps through China. The country is scrapping quarantines for inbound travelers from January 8th and promising to gradually restart outbound tourism. Since the start of the pandemic, China has severely limited who can go in and out of the country, drastically cutting the number of flights, and forcing all incoming arrivals into government facilities. I went through multiple quarantines in China this year, lasting as long as 21 days. There is no choice in where you go or what room you get. Once the doors close, you can only open them for COVID tests and food pickups. Workers spray disinfectant in the hallways every few hours, food delivery is not allowed. But breakfast, lunch and dinner are part of quarantine fees. All of that is now soon going away. It's a huge relief for Chinese nationals living overseas like this woman in New York City.",

We know that the elderly are particularly susceptible to COVID, and the under-vaccinated elderly are the most susceptible. And so they don't have highly effective vaccines there. They have the Sinovac and Sinopharm and activated vaccines. That's such a technology that most of the rest of the world did not embrace because of prior evidence that coronavirus vaccines made with that technology would not be as effective. And the limited studies we've been able to do suggest that they are less effective, both in terms of protection against infection, protection against severe disease and also in durability of the immune response. So this population is under vaccinated, and they haven't had previous waves to provide some immunity from convalescence that they would otherwise have.

And when youhave a lot of people getting infected, then you're going to have a lot of those mutations. And it provides an opportunity for the virus to evolve to get around immunity this present. And so when you have a partially-immune population, it's sort of the worst possible scenario for generating new variation. The question is going to be whether those variants have greater ability to evade than the ones we have. And the U.S. and many other countries, we have some highly evasive variants. The one that is most widely-circulating in China, the BF.7, evades all of the monoclonal antibodies that we have previously been able to use as antivirals. And so, as you mentioned, they have paxlovid, but they don't have a lot of other options. It's really a tough situation for controlling this virus and mitigating severe disease.",

And unfortunately, they didn't use the time well. And so, I think we can expect a great loss of health and likely loss of life. I don't think that travel restrictions at this point are going to have a big positive impact for the rest of the world. I think, you know, we need rational use of rapid tests. And people need to be thinking about using their masks and other means that they have at hand, because we are in for some changes, and we don't know how big an impact this Chinese epidemic will have on the rest of us.",

The Ukrainian deputy defense minister saysRussia is focusing most of its efforts now on military equipment and weapons on the eastern city of Bakhmut. But he says Bakhmut is holding in Ukrainian hands and is acting as a quote \"eastern fortress\" against Russian aggression. Now, there is also heavy fighting elsewhere in Luhansk region. On Monday, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the battlefield situation, quote, \"difficult and painful\". Meantime, Russia's foreign minister says Kyiv needs to accept its so-called annexation of four Ukrainian regions or else its military will take more action. Ukraine says, giving up any territory is non-negotiable. And one adviser to President Zelenskyy is warning the world not to trust anything Russia says about peace negotiations. Ukraine's energy minister meantime says Russia may be -- may use the upcoming new year's holiday to fire more missiles at the country's energy system in order to cause, quote, \"maximum damage\". He says the situation right now is really difficult with about 9 million people in the dark as of Monday. And it's hard for everyone, but especially for people who rely on powered medical devices.

ANDRIY ZAGORODNYUK, DISTINGUISHED FELLOW AT ATLANTIC COUNCIL'S EURASIA CENTER:  Russia throwing any amounts of people to east because they are desperate to show their leadership basically, their military leadership to the political leadership, at least some achievements. So, for them, it's important as they say and they're basically trying to win. Because so far, they've been losing all the year long. And obviously, they need to justify themselves. And that's why they're bringing any amount of Russian people, for them, casualties is not such a big deal. And they can essentially tolerate politically. They can tolerate any amount of casualties so far, at least at this point of time. But they're still struggling and they cannot reach their operational objectives because they don't have enough skilled officers.

Thousands of migrants along the U.S.-Mexico border are waiting to see if America's Supreme Court will put an end to the Trump era policy known as Title 42. The policy was put in place in the early days of the pandemic and allowed the government to expel migrants to their home country. Currently, there are approximately 22,000 migrants and shelters and makeshift encampments right across three northern Mexico cities. CNN's Camila Bernal spoke with one migrant family that is waiting to find out what happens next. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CAMILA BERNAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  A dream come true in the form of a hula hoop, toys their parents say they would not be able to afford in native Venezuela. An opportunity for his children, says this 30-year old, who left his country more than three months ago with his partner and four children. In November, they made it to the U.S. and turned themselves in to immigration authorities. \"They sent us back,\" he said. And because they're not legally married, the two got separated. And after about a week in a detention center, they ended up in two different cities in Mexico. Elvin's partner, Caroline, says she was told they were being sent back to Mexico because of Title 42, which allows border agents to immediately expel migrants, citing COVID-19 concerns. And this is what they say led them to an illegal crossing 20 days later. \"I wanted to cross legally,\" says Caroline, but as a family, they felt they had no other option. It's a desperation felt by many here. And, as a result, they end up on the streets during a cold front in El Paso. The city accommodates those who have documentation taking more than 400 people into this makeshift shelter in its convention center over the holiday weekend. Others ending up in Washington, D.C., outside of Vice President Kamala Harris' residence.",

Now AliDaei says a Dubai bound flight carrying his wife and daughter was rerouted and forced to land on Kish Island in the Persian Gulf, where the pair were removed from the flight by authorities. Officials have yet to offer a direct explanation as to why the soccer star's family was removed. But in a now retracted article, Iran's state run news agency reported that his wife and daughter were barred from traveling as they had not informed authorities of their decision to leave the country in advance, despite being ordered to do so. Meanwhile, Iran's semi official news agency said his wife had been barred from leaving the country by court order over her alleged participation in what they described as riots. The pair are not believed to have been arrested. In an interview with Iranian media, Daei said he is in the process of arranging for their return to Tehran. He also said that he was not aware of any travel restrictions placed on his wife or daughter. This comes amid ongoing anti regime protests in the country which have been met by violence and oppression by the regime's security forces. The footballing legend himself has been a vocal supporter of the protest movement, writing in a post on Instagram in September that, instead of oppression, violence and arresting the Iranian people, the regime should solve their problems. And in November, he said he had rejected an official invitation to the Qatar World Cup in a show of solidarity with Iranian protesters at home. Now there are fears that Daei and his family may become the latest in a string of notable Iranian figures who have faced repression at the hands of the regime for showing solidarity with protesters in Iran -- Nada Bashir, CNN, London.
