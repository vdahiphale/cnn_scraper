Here's another number for you, $49 million. That's how much money has been sent so far -- spent so far in ads alone, ahead of California's Senate primary. That's a lot of money even for a very big state like California. It is a solidly blue seat.

On the GOP side, former LA Dodger Steve Garvey is running. Now, this is very contentious. It is very expensive, as I mentioned, and it's largely because of the way the primary system works in California.
