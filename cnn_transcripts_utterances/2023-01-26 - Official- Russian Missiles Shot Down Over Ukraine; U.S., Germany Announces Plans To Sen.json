The governor of the Mykolaiv region says at least two rockets flew through his area. This news after we learned of emergency power outages in Kyiv and several regions across the country because of a threat of a missile attack.Ukraine's largest private energy company called the move a preventative step to avoid damage if missiles strike the energy infrastructure. Well, meantime, a united front from Ukraine's Western allies, as the United States and Germany announced their plans to send dozens of sophisticated tanks to the battlefield and they're not alone. Germany's main governing bodies says its country along with other allies will provide about 80 Leopard 2 tanks in total to Ukraine. And this is the type of military equipment Ukraine says will work as an iron fist to break through Russian lines. Berlin's decision to send 14 of its own tanks came after weeks of pressure and diplomacy. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz made the announcement reiterating his country's support for Ukraine. But getting Germany to this point took a U.S. commitment to do the same. Shortly after the news from Berlin, President Joe Biden said the U.S. will be providing Ukraine with 31 Abrams tanks. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy says the decision to send main battle tanks to his country proves \"freedom is only getting stronger.\" (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE (through translator): The key now is speed and volume. The speed of training our military, the speed of supplying tanks to Ukraine, the amount of tank support, we have to form a fist of tanks, a fist of freedom which will not allow tyranny to rise again last fall.

It will take months just for them to arrive in Europe and months more for Ukrainians to be trained on them.And these are not all the tanks Ukraine needs.

Former U.S. President Donald Trump may soon be back on Facebook and Instagram. Facebook's parent company Meta says it will restore his accounts more than two years after he was banned for allegedly inciting violence when his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on January 6. The decision comes on the heels of a similar move by Twitter. CNN's Donie O'Sullivan explains why Meta made this decision DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Mera announcing the most politically consequential decision in its history, certainly here in the United States announcing on Wednesday that it was going to let former President Donald Trump back on its platforms which include of course Facebook, and Instagram. Now you might remember Trump was kicked off the platforms in the days after the attack on the U.S. Capitol. Facebook at the time saying was too dangerous for Trump to be able to have that megaphone that he might incite further violence. Two years later, Facebook, Meta has now said that it has reassessed its ban, it has determined that there isn't as greater risk of imminent violence or harm caused by -- posts by Trump. And that they are going to allow him back on the platform in the coming weeks. Now, this is a boom in Trump's campaign for 2024. He has of course announced that he is running for president. Again, we have seen in the past, the Trump campaign really effectively used and spent hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising on Facebook, because it is a very effective way they have found of targeting voters but also fundraising. As you can imagine, a lot of people on both sides of the political spectrum here speaking out for and against this decision. Of course, many people saying it's important to be able to hear from a former president and candidate for president. That's including the ACLU who had this statement, they said this is the right call. Like it or not, President Trump is one of the country's leading political figures. And the public has a strong interest in hearing his speech. They said indeed, some of Trumps most offensive social media posts ended up being critical evidence and lawsuits filed against him and his administration. And we should know we filed over 400 legal actions against him. And that's a very important part of all of this, of course, the ACLU saying they're -- although we might not like Trump, we believe that what he's saying should be able to be seen by voters and citizens in the United States and people around the world whether it be good, bad or ugly.

We don't know if it's beyond the capital city at this point. But what we have heard is from a memo that was given by the protocol department and that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Russian embassy.One of the very few still populated within Pyongyang, most diplomats left long ago, posted it on their Facebook page. So, what it says is that there is a five-day special anti-epidemic period.  So, from Wednesday to Sunday, and they have been advised that they should not be -- they should restrict their movements to the embassy grounds and beyond. They should minimize contact with other people. They are being asked to take their temperature four times a day, and then report that. And also, within this memo, it does say that it could be extended to another three days if the need arises. Now the reason for this, according to this document is that they are saying it's an increase in flu and other respiratory diseases. Now, North Korea did not specify COVID-19 in this memo, but in the past, they've often said respiratory diseases when they're talking about COVID. And they certainly haven't been transparent when it comes to COVID-19 outbreaks. In fact, for the first year and a half, they claimed that they had zero cases which many epidemiologists found highly unlikely. They did admit back in May 2022 to an outbreak, but then just a few months later claimed that they had beaten COVID-19. So, potentially, we are looking at another outbreak either of COVID-19 or as we know in the northern hemisphere at the moment during the winter months. There are a number of other respiratory diseases that are swirling around as well. So, it's unclear at this point exactly what they are dealing with. It's -- the potential is that this is all we will hear from North Korea unless they decide to announce it publicly. What we have been waiting for, though, is February 8th which is the 75th anniversary of the foundation of the army in North Korea. They were potentially expected to hold a military parade. We had seen from 38 North, for example, a think tank that they had seen, commercial satellite imagery showing preparations for a big military parade. So, it's unclear at this point what this kind of period of restricting movement within the Capitol means for something like that. Rosemary?",
