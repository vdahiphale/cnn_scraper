The Israelis are running into a big, big problem now, which is that all of their lobbying techniques, their propaganda techniques, their PR techniques that have succeeded for a century, really, since the Israeli-Palestinian conflict started a century ago, they've succeeded really well except for the last, like, two years because the world sees what they're doing and, therefore, they can't just keep doing the same things.",

But there is a, I wouldn't call it pluralism, but there is a kind of collective decision-making that happens after they present their different views -- the judiciary, the revolutionary guards, the elected president, the government, the supreme leader. So, the thing that Iran has, which most other countries in the region don't have, is a very strong tradition of national identity, which is now, of course, under an Islamic identity since the revolution, but that's relatively recent. They have set up a system that is quite powerful and is able to withstand all kinds of shocks, like the terribly amazing sanctions they've been put under, probably the worst sanctions any modern country has suffered, the intrusive inspections of the IAEA, the nuclear energy agency, and they're still there, moving along. So, they have a kind of a depth to their national identity and their national institutions. And, of course, the Israelis have been attacking and assassinating some of their key people, especially scientists and the head of the revolutionary guards, Soleimani. So, they've suffered these kinds of losses without really making much difference. So, I don't think it's going to have much of an impact.

Now, the defense has wrapped up their cross-examination of him, and we should point out Cohen has been on the stand for nearly 16 hours over the course of four days. Now, the prosecution is redirecting questions to Cohen, likely hoping to repair some of the damage done during that lengthy cross.

In April, he supported a major attack against the country in an unprecedented response to a suspected Israeli strike on the Iranian consulate in Syria, which killed several Iranian commanders. Throughout Raisi's presidency, Iran pressed ahead with its nuclear program, violating an international agreement while blaming the U.S. for withdrawing and European states for not living up to their end of the deal. Tehran also supplied lethal drone technology to Russia, fueling the conflict in Ukraine, allowing Moscow to strike deep behind the front lines.

Now, of course, we know very little about what actuallyis being planned behind the scenes within the halls of power in the regime when it comes to the secession. It's a very, very sensitive issue. There is a tremendous amount of nervousness about it. But it was quite clear that he was at least being considered, perhaps he was a leading figure. And this is going to be much more of an issue compared to, you know, the role that he played in policymaking, because he was, by and large, being groomed to be the caretaker, to be the one that would take over from the supreme leader. And if it turns out that that really was what they were betting on, then that option is now gone, and they're back to square one. And this is a very, very tense power struggle behind the scenes about who will replace the supreme leader. This is part of the reason why the regime has really made sure that the last few elections have been rather meaningless. They have made sure that all levers of power in Iran are controlled by conservatives, precisely because they want to make sure that the next supreme leader is a conservative and that they won't have to deal with any major challenges coming from centrists or reformists. And the way to do so has been to simply exclude them from all of these different institutions of power.",

The defensewrapped their long cross-examination a short time ago, and the prosecution has been asking more redirect questions during their opportunity. And Cohen has been a very key witness essentially for both sides. And in his final moments on the stand, it contains some pretty major drama during cross-examination today. Cohen admitted that he stole from the Trump organization by billing them $50,000 for an expense that only cost him $20,000. And yet, another instance of Cohen's credibility being challenged on the stand. But will it make a difference? Joining me now to provide some legal analysis is National Security Attorney Bradley Moss. Bradley, thank you for taking the time. Now, look, one part of redirect, the prosecutor read a line from a letter Michael Cohen's attorney sent to the Federal Election Commission as part of that statement saying, quote, \"the payment in question does not constitute a campaign contribution. And when Cohen was asked whether that was a true statement, he said no, and then testified later that that letter was intentionally misleading. What is the prosecution trying to do here during redirect?",

And back then, yes, this is what Michael Cohen did. He provided these statements that were at a minimum highly misleading, if not straight out false. He ultimately pled guilty to federal felonies tied to this. This was at the core of basically him being the subordinate taking the fall for Donald Trump at whose behest he was committing these actions. They're outlining this now to demonstrate Michael Cohen explaining and accepting responsibility for purposes of credibility, to rehabilitate Cohen's credibility after that very lengthy cross-examination.",

So, the prosecution's job right now on redirect as they're rehabilitating Cohen is to clarify what transpired with respect to these phone calls. Remember, the one that was brought up on cross was October 24th. There was other evidence indicating the real subset of discussions with Trump was actually October 26th. As the story was about ready to come out, they had to get this payment done to silence Stormy Daniels. That's what they're going to discuss on redirect, and that's going to come up, no doubt, in the prosecution's ultimate summations and closing arguments next Tuesday when this trial comes to a close and we get ready for jury deliberations.",

If they don't, if they don't believe his story that connects this to Donald Trump specifically, that will be extremely difficult for the prosecution to overcome and could result at least in a hung jury.

They've largely not been able to bring in their expert. The reason, as far as everyone can tell, that this is getting pushed is because tomorrow would be summation. There's no trial Wednesday or Friday. Thursday's a shortened day. Almost, certainly that would break up some rhythm. And so the judge basically said, we'll push it off until after the holiday.
