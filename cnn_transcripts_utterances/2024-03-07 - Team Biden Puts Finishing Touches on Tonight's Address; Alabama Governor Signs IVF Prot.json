A live look at Capitol Hill, the scene of all the action tonight for the president's State of the Union address. Good morning, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt. It's wonderful to have you here. Game on. The rematch that most Americans don't want officially kicks off tonight when Joe Biden delivers a State of the Union address that could set them up for four more years or make his road to reelection tougher. He is expected to highlight the accomplishments of his first term while warning the country about the existential threat to the nation that he believes Donald Trump presents. The president's challenge: convincing voters who are concerned about his age and stamina that he's fit for another term. Trump, fresh off a near-sweep on Super Tuesday that forced Nikki Haley out of the race, is challenging the president to a debate and vowing to deliver a running play by play on social media during the State of the Union address. Let's bring in our panel on this important morning. Democratic Congressman Pat Ryan of New York is here. Sarah Longwell, Republican strategist and executive director of the Republican Accountability Project. And former ABC News White House correspondent Ann Compton joins us.

They want more of that passion that people say that they see in private but that doesn't seem to make its way out in public as much. They think it could counteract some of these concerns about his age. There was a moment at the State of the Union last year that sort of showed what -- what -- what we understood to be an off-the-cuff reaction by President Biden, where he really kind of came out on the top of that interaction.

And obviously, there's the content of the speech that we were just, you know, talking about, the policies.But there's also the performance aspect. And for Joe Biden, that may be the thing that matters the most. What do you hear from voters about what the risks are, what they're looking for from him, and kind of the balance of do they expect him to be bad, and it'll be better if it's good, or do they expect it to be good? And like, if he's bad, that's bad. SARAH LONGWELL, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST/EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, REPUBLICAN ACCOUNTABILITY PROJECT: No, no, no. Here's where they are. Right? So Republicans have done one thing that I think is a little bit of a mistake, which is that they have set the bar at dementia, right? They tell their voters that Joe Biden has dementia. And so he can clear a dementia bar, and that's probably a win. And even better if he does what he did last time. Like, I understand why Democrats are saying you need to have a fiery speech. I think the stakes are enormous for him this time, because the age is such a concern; and that is left, right, and center. Right? Age is a concern across the board. They just need to know this guy is with it. He can fight. He can still -- he can still do the job. And I think, you know, Republicans have done him a bit of a service by setting that bar so low. So he just really needs to clear it. But the performance is way more important than the substance, because people are not that -- some in the far left, but like, swing voters aren't as mad at him on the substance.

Speed was clearly the priority for lawmakers here after that state Supreme Court ruling just sparked public outrage.This was a Republican-dominated legislature that push this bill across the finish line. And it was a Republican governor that signed it into law. So let's dig into it: what it does and does not do. This is a law designed to protect those who are receiving or providing IVF by offering them civil and criminal immunity. So this is very crucial, because IVF clinics routinely dispose of frozen embryos that are nonviable or are unwanted. This law applies immediately, and it applies retroactively. So now let's go into what it doesn't do. It does not address when life begins. This question of personhood, as you said, is at the heart of this Alabama Supreme Court ruling that embryos are children. This does not answer that. Let's now go into the three clinics that paused IVF treatments in the wake of that Supreme Court ruling, state Supreme Court ruling, starting with the Center for Reproductive Medicine at Mobile Health. This is the same clinic involved in that case that went to the state's highest court. It said it will not resume services. Mark Nix, the CEO of Infirmary Health, telling CNN they need legal clarification as to the extent of immunity that they have. Also telling us, quote, \"At this time, we believe the law falls short of addressing the fertilized eggs currently stored across the state and leaves challenges for physicians and fertility clinics trying to help deserving families have children of their own.\" Then there's Alabama Fertility. Dr. Mamie McLean, telling us that they are set to resume IVF treatments as early as today or tomorrow. And then there's the University of Alabama at Birmingham. They were the first to pause IVF treatments. They say that they are working to move promptly to resume IVF treatments -- Kasie.",
