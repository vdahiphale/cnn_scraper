David Pecker was questioned by the prosecution about the catch and kill scheme to quiet Daniels story of an alleged affair with Trump weeks before the 2016 election.Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer, testified he found out from his editor in chief that Daniels was trying to sell a story that she had a sexual relationship with Donald Trump, and it would cost $120,000 to kill it. Pecker said he told Trump's attorney, Michael Cohen, about the story which he called very damaging. He recalled explaining to Cohen that he was not going to pay Daniels saying his company already purchased two other negative stories for Trump totaling almost $200,000. He said he told Cohen, I am not purchasing this story. I am not going to be involved with a porn star. Cohen, he recalled, said the boss would be furious. Trump denies having an affair with Daniels. Pecker also discussed in earlier scheme involving former Playboy model Karen McDougal. She alleged having a nearly year long relationship with Trump, which the former president denies. Pecker told the jury he would not have entered into the deal with McDougal if it wasn't going to benefit Trump's campaign, saying we didn't want the story to embarrass Mr. Trump, or embarrass or hurt the campaign. Trump's attorney Emil Bove use his time cross examining Pecker to show how the mutually beneficial relationship between him and Trump went back almost two decades before the 2016 election. He confirmed with Packer that he had been giving Trump a heads up about negative stories during that time. Bove asked Pecker if it was standard operating procedure for media to work with politicians including sometimes to win elections. Pecker replied, yes.",

      "sentences": "Yes, absolutely. Quite the diplomatic dance for both sides involve here. We do know that Antony Blinken right now is meeting with the Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, this is according to state-run Xinhua. And in doing so, maintaining this critical channel of communication at a time when US-China relations are at a crossroads.This meeting underway between Blinken and Xi at the moment, they did meet last time when Blinken was in Beijing. And this also comes after the US President Joe Biden held talks by phone with Xi Jinping earlier this month, which was their first conversation since their summit in November. Now earlier in the day, Blinken met with China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi for an epic five hours. And Blinken call that encounter extensive and constructive. And in that meeting, he discussed concerns about China's support of Russia, about concerns over China's activities in the South China Sea, and the need to avoid further escalation in both the Middle East and on the Korean Peninsula. Blinken also met with China's Minister of Public Security. You saw a video from earlier today of that meeting, and that was presumably to discuss stopping the flow of fentanyl precursor chemicals from China to the US. Now, this visit this comes at a very sensitive time because it's on the heels of -- after President Biden signed a bill to counter China's military might to defend Taiwan and that separate bill that could result in a ban on TikTok in the United States. I want you to listen to what we heard from the foreign minister of China earlier about the US China relationship and how he frames it as the choice that needs to be made. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WANG YI, CHINA'S FOREIGN MINISTER (through translation): Should China the United States keep to the right direction of moving forward with stability or return to a downward spiral? This is a major question before our two countries, and tests our sincerity and the ability. (END VIDEO CLIP) STOUT: Now, last year Blinken visited China to stabilize relations during a time of peak tension. Last year, he had a meeting with Xi Jinping. You're looking at fresh video of his meeting that just happened this afternoon between Blinken and the Chinese leader Xi Jinping in the Great Hall of the People. And as these two leaders meet, relations have improved from those peak loads of last year and the back of the spy balloon incident, but yet quite a number of unresolved issues remain that both sides need to discuss. China's support of Russia and its war machine, China's assertions of sovereignty in the South China Sea, the fate of TikTok and it's forced divesture from the United States, the fate of Taiwan, especially as it swears in a new president human rights including Xinjiang, fentanyl, precursor chemicals, trade and the issue of Chinese overcapacity. Again, you're looking at fresh video coming in from the Great Hall People in Beijing of the meeting that just took place between Xi Jinping and America's top diplomat. We'll continue to monitor developments for you, Max. I'll hand it back over to you.",

Those issues being climate, public health, artificial intelligence and also cracking down on fentanyl. That's the reason why today Blinken not only meeting with the Chinese leader Xi Jinping as well as Foreign Minister Wang Yi, but also met with China's Minister of Public Security to discuss that very issue, which I've heard from officials is a priority not just for the United States, fentanyl being a leading killer of Americans in the ages of 20 to 40, but also the precursor chemicals existing and stemming from China. And that's something that China's security apparatus wants to crack down along as well.So this is what's happening here, communication, the channel communication maintaining that, keeping it open between these two powers, acknowledging points of contention and friction also focusing on areas of collaboration. And we also have to note, just the flurry of diplomatic activity that has led to this moment. Not that long ago, the US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen also paid a visit to China. Back to you, Max.",
