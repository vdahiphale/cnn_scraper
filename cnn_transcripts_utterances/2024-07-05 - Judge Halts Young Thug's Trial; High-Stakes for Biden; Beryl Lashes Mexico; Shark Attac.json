There's too many defendants being charged. There's too many witnesses being called. And, obviously, the state has a right to prove their case, but they also have to ensure that there's due process. VALENCIA (voice over): The case has dragged on for months. That's a major concern to some defense attorneys who spoke to CNN who wonder if D.A. Willis is miss applying the RICO statute.

But to have the Democrats, at this late stage in the game, disrupt the process and bring in a new candidate in an uncertain environment is not -- is a very risky thing for the Democrats to do, especially given the power of incumbency.I contrast this with Republicans. And I'm not saying a Democrat should do the same thing, but Donald Trump was impeached once and Republicans stuck by him. He was impeached a second time, Republican stuck by him. He was indicted. The Republican stuck by him. He was indicted a second, third, and fourth time. Republicans continue to stick by him.

If the election were held today, yes, Joe Biden might not do so well. But, you know what, the election is not held today. And once you get the fall campaign going and people have a chance to actually go in the voting booth and look at the candidates, I'm convinced that more people will come back to the Democratic fold. Plus, Democrats have won the popular vote in seven of the last eight presidential elections. Clearly the Republican Party brand is unpopular. And Donald Trump himself is incredibly unpopular. He is a convicted criminal who will be sentenced in September, if he doesn't find another way to delay that. And the idea that the American people would go to the polls, the ballot box, and elect a convicted criminal two months after he is sentenced is preposterous. That needs to be the point, not about Joe Biden's bad debate, it's about electing a twice- impeached, quadruple indicted, convicted criminal to the highest office in the land.

A third beach goer was injured, though not bitten. A fourth said they felt a sharp brush against them.Meantime, in Florida, a shark did bite a man on the foot while he was in knee deep water. The 21-year-old was ultimately taken to the hospital for non-life-threatening injuries.

Take a look at these photos because according to a CBP official, there happened to be members of the elite BOR (ph) star unit. Now, this is a unit that rescues people for a living. And they just happened to be at the right place at the right time. And they jumped into action. According to the CBP official, they ran into the water, pulled a victim out of the water, and started rendering immediate medical aid. Now, according to this official, they applied a tourniquet. And if you know anything about first response, if somebody needs a tourniquet, they could bleed out in a matter of minutes. Now, I talked to the city of South Padre Island. They say that there are no fatalities. I don't know the specific condition of this individual. But according to them, there's no fatalities. Now, the response was not just by land, it was also by air. Take a look at this video that we obtained by the Texas Department of Public Safety. And this is from Lieutenant Crisol Uveitis (ph). You can see the actual shark. How do they know that this is the shark? Well, according to the lieutenant, the helicopter pilot was flying very low on South Padre Island trying to keep that shark away from people. So, these were maneuvers that the pilot was doing to make sure that that shark didn't come back closer to shore where humans were. Now, according to Uveitis, the Texas DPS stayed there until there was no threat. Now, just imagine being one of those beachgoers. And take a look at these photos that we obtained from social media because there was a family there, a mother from Arlington, Texas, this is in the Rio Grande Valley, she says that her two daughters were in the water when the shark was in there and all of a sudden she heard her daughter screaming. They started running out of the water. One of her daughters had blood on her leg. That's the 18-year-old that you see with a gauze. Both of them are OK according to the mother. And then there was another incident. Another man also was in the water. They -- the two men were actually swimming and the father-in- law of the man says that he just saw his son-in-law go under. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RAYNER CARDENAS, SON-IN-LAW WAS BITTEN BY A SHARK: I turned around and he wasn't there anymore. I started swimming towards him and then he jumped up out of the water saying, shark, shark, shark. And that's when adrenalin kicked in and I went in right after him. (END VIDEO CLIP) FLORES: Now, Erica, according to officials, there were at least four counters, at least two individuals were taken to the hospital. We don't know their conditions, of course.
