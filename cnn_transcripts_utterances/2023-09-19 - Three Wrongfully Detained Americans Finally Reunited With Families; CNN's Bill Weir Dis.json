And later, never before seen the WHO's first-ever report on the global impact of high blood pressure. Their life-saving recommendations ahead. Hello, I'm Lynda Kinkade live from CNN's World headquarters in Atlanta. Welcome to \"One World.\" Well, those stories in just a moment. But we begin this hour with the United Nations General Assembly which is underway right now in New York City. President Joe Biden addressed the assembly a short time ago. He said the U.S. seeks a more secure, more prosperous, a more equitable world for all. Mr. Biden added that no nation can meet the challenges of today alone. He also made a forceful call for the United Nations to stand up to Moscow's invasion of Ukraine saying that Russia alone was responsible for the war. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: If you allow Ukraine to be carved up, is the independence of any nation secure? I respectfully suggest the answer is no. We have to stand up to this negative aggression today and to deter other would-be aggressors tomorrow. That's why the United States, together with our allies and partners around the world will continue to stand with the brave people of Ukraine as they defend their sovereignty and territorial integrity and their freedom.

Meanwhile, some key players are skipping thisyear's summit, including the leaders of Russia, the U.K., France and China. I want to bring in CNN's Richard Roth who has been covering the U.N. General Assembly for years. We'll get to who is missing the summit in just a moment, but I do want to start on the U.S. President's comments regarding Russia's war in Ukraine, speaking about this illegal war of conquest, saying that if we allow this to happen to Ukraine, it could happen to any nation. Talk to us about how those comments were received and what we can expect when the Ukrainian President speaks later. RICHARD ROTH, CNN SENIOR U.N. CORRESPONDENT: Well, I've been trapped in this room. We haven't really been able to approach. I did ask actually, when you kind of think about it, the President of Lithuania who was here, and he understood the need for a tough guy approach, though he doubts why we need all of these speeches, which we've had over and will have over the next week and a half. But otherwise, for President Biden, he said he knows the position of the United States as a leader, but this is the way he sees it. On Ukraine, as we heard, he told the General Assembly in the audience that if you allow Russia to carve up Ukraine, the jigs up. I mean, that was why the U.N. was established, so that country A would not attack country B. The world has changed, so that could happen and nothing is done about it.",

And that's why you heard the U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin today at the Ukraine Contact Group call on other European nations who are part of this continuing aid effort for Ukraine to provide as much as they can. Whether it's artillery or long-range missiles or some sort of missiles because U.S. officials know that their chance to give aid could be running out, could be curtailed by a coming change at the White House.",

It can lead to heart attacks, stroke, heart failure and kidney problems. And they call it that silent killer because only about 54 percent they estimate of people with high blood pressure have actually had a diagnosed. They find that only one in five cases globally is actually controlled and that by treating more than 50 percent of high blood pressure cases effectively could prevent 76 million deaths between now and 2050.

But ofcourse, there are also lifestyle changes that you can make. Eating a healthy diet, exercising, avoiding alcohol and tobacco, and really lowering daily sodium intake. That has been a big focus, really, around the world. The World Health Organization recommends no more than 2000 milligrams of sodium each day for adults. And the global average is more than double that, 4300 milligrams a day. In the U.S., the average is 3400 milligrams per day. And even in a country that's a high-income country like the United States, we still have ways to go to try to meet these goals. About 32 percent of people in the U.S. have hypertension. They say if you could treat effectively 75 percent of those folks, you could avoid more than a million deaths. We are currently controlling about 48 percent of cases here, if we got up to that goal of effectively controlling half of cases, that would be 693,000 more people who need to be treated. So, the scope of this is large, but they say these are interventions that are possible to make and countries really need to focus on them.",

The Spanish Football Federation was plunged into a state of profound crisis by its former president, Luis Rubiales, who kissed the player, Jenny Hermoso, during the medal ceremony. He has since resigned, and the coach Jorge Vilda has been fired. But things are not getting any better. In fact, they might just be getting worse. On Monday, the team's new coach, Montse Tome, named the squad to play two upcoming Nations League games against Sweden and Switzerland. And there were some raised eyebrows because her squad included 20 players who had said that they wouldn't line up for the national team. This is what Tomei had to say about that.

In the statement, they said, quote, \"We will study the possible legal consequences to which REF, that's the Spanish Federation, has exposed us by putting us on a list which we had asked not to be called up due to reasons which we had already explained publicly, to take the best decision for our future and for our health. We regret once again that our Federation places us in a situation which we never would have desired.\" This would be a truly remarkable situation for any team, not least the newly-crowned world champions. The Federation has publicly acknowledged the need for reform and yet it seems the players feel as though they are being forced back into the national team. It's a reminder of the challenges so many women face in sport and in the workplace, but these players are clearly determined to fight for a better future. Back to you.",
