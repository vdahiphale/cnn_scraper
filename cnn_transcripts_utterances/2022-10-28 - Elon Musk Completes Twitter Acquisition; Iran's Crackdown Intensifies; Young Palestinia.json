Elon Musk now owns Twitter, one of the world's most influential social media platforms, and he is wasting no time in changing things. Sources say Musk immediately fired three top executives, including Twitter's CEO. He says more widespread layoffs are coming. But the biggest question is what he will do about censorship and content on Twitter. Musk is a free speech advocate and has said he thinks it was a mistake, for example, for Twitter to ban Donald Trump. But in a tweet, he told advertisers, quote, \"Twitter cannot become a free-for-all hellscape where anything can be said with no consequences.\" Let's bring in CNN Business senior media reporter Oliver Darcy. Hey, I love the term you used for that. He's bought the company, at the big question is whether Trump with 88 million followers before being banned in the wake of the January 6th attack on the Capitol will be allowed back on. But before we talk about that, what happens next at this organization?",

      "sentences": "Well right now, there's a great uncertainty I think over at Twitter. You know, Musk came inyesterday after this deal closed, and the first thing he did was fire the entire executive team, and so the question really is, who is going to lead this company? Is it going to be Musk and only Musk? I mean, he needs leadership in those key roles, and so I think that will give us a really good indication of where he plans to take it. But like you said, there are all these bigger questions, too, after he hires his team about how he wants to set guidelines for speech. He has indicated very strongly that people will be permitted back on the platform, people like Trump who were booted for violating the Twitter rules, but how far will that go? Will people like far-right figures like Alex Jones be permitted back on the platform? That's all up in the air. And you know, I think this comes at a very key moment for free speech in America. There's been a lot of talk about, you know, limiting misinformation, curbing hate speech on platforms like Twitter and Facebook, and all the rest. And how do you balance that against wanting everyone to have free speech rights, obviously, on the platform. Musk tends to lean towards the free speech absolutist zone, but he needs his advertisers, and they're not going to want to have their content appearing next to hate speech. And so it will be very interesting to see how he balances this.",

I'm sure those who work for Twitter would appreciate some visibility and some transparency because that must be extremely difficult at present. Thank you for that. Well, a human rights group says Iran is employing teargas and weapons of war to brutally crack down on anti-government protesters. This, after four people were killed Thursday in Mahabad, the Kurdish city in Iran. As mourners gathered at the funeral of a slain protester the Norwegian-based Hengaw Rights Group says special forces stationed on the roofs of government buildings opened fire on demonstrators. Meanwhile, government supporters marched in several Iranian cities on Friday after the regime called for nationwide rallies to condemn a deadly attack on a Shia shrine. The government killed 15 people in the city of Shiraz. ISIS has claimed responsibility. Iran says a bomb planted in that city was defused. Well, without providing any evidence, the Iranian government says anti- government protesters are complicit in that shrine attack. CNN's Nada Bashir is tracking the story from London and joins us from there. Firstly, let's get our viewers the latest details on that attack. 15 killed. What's the government saying?",

      "sentences": "Well, look, Becky, the government has of course outlined that they have accused three assailants of this terrorincident as they described it. But crucially they have noted that these three individuals were foreign nationals according to state media, and that is important considering the timing of course. This is taking place in the context of widespread anti-regime protests and the regime has long held that these protests or riots as they've categorized them have been encouraged, instigated, and facilitated by people working for foreign agents as they have termed it, mainly pointing the finger of blame at the United States and Israel. And there are concerns now that this incident at the Shah Cheragh Shrine in the southern city of Shiraz on Wednesday evening could potentially set the pretext for the Iranian regime to intensify its already brutal and deadly crackdown on these anti-regime protesters who, according to rights groups, have of course been largely peaceful. That is the primary concern now. We've already heard from the Iranian armed forces saying that any protesters taking to the streets are complicit in this violence. They say that this is all to do with foreign meddling involved in Iran, attempting to create chaos, instability, and unrest in the country. We've heard from Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei saying that the regime will take decisive action in response to that attack. And that has of course raised concerns that that may be a veiled suggestion that there will be an intensification of that crackdown on protesters. But as you said there, we've seen pro-government rallies now taking place across the country following Friday prayers. They were called for by the regime, by the regime's propaganda authority, calling on the Iranian people to show their contempt for that attack in Shiraz. But of course this is all playing into the government narrative that the unrest that we're seeing, that the protests that are still gaining momentum across the country, are not anti-regime demonstrations, but rather attempts to create instability in the country by foreign actors.",

And partly because Russia is targeting those parts of these power plants that are themost susceptible to being hit, i.e. the bits that are outside of buildings, but they're also the most sensitive because they contain components that are hard to repair or hard to replace. And thinking about the power generating stations here in Ukraine, the vast majority were built during the Soviet era, so the components are old and the difficulty for getting the repairs up and running is because some of these power stations are still under attack. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ROBERTSON (on-camera): The sirens are going off. We've only just arrived at the power plant. Everyone is going into the bunker. We're going to have to go in, too. (Voice-over): There's no fuss. Everyone here knows what to do. We've agreed not to show faces or name the power plant for security reasons. (On-camera): We've been given these safety jackets to wear. Officials here are telling us it's quite normal for them to end up in the bunker several times a day. (Voice-over): The coal-fired power plant hit twice since Putin began targeting electrical facilities 17 days ago. Cards, dominoes, messaging loved ones passes the time. But as this 29- year veteran of the Soviet era plant tells me, every minute in the bunker is time wasted. They need to be up top repairing the bomb damage. An hour and a half later, the all-clear. Everyone back to work. (On-camera): One of the first things you notice here is just how quiet it is. No generators thumping away. (Voice-over): Around the corner, engineers already out of the bunker making repairs. But those cables, the easy bit. Russian cruise missiles and drones ripped through the hardest part of the plant to repair. (On-camera): The drone, they say, got tangled up in the high voltage cables up here, ripping equipment apart. All on the ground here, all around, burnt-out cables. And over here, burnt-out equipment. And the problem, officials say, is that this part of the site was the most sensitive part. It's been offline since.

It was two Palestinians -- I think two,speaking on the correction there, were killed and others have been killed in operations also in Nablus. Now these operations the Israelis say against these militant gunman groups. And Nablus is called the lion's den, the group there, and they're outside even of the purview and control of groups like the Jenin Brigade. They are a new much more organic movement that is causing deep concern for the Israeli Defense Forces. They say that this is the idea they're seeing a pattern in the north of the West Bank of more and more of these militant groups. And it's a similar pattern that I've observed in the run-up to the Second Intifada now a long time ago, some 22 years ago where you had grassroots groups expressing frustration as much almost against their Palestinian leadership, the official leadership, as against the Israelis. And of course, it's these Israelis who would be targeted in the first instance but ultimately a great deal of frustration there and then the issue will be, can the Palestinian leadership control it? It's early days yet and the Israelis have launched a significant operations, a series of what they say, a pinpoint operation, to try to snuff out these armed opposition groups before it grows too fast, before that conflagration that the commander there was warning may be coming can ignite -- Becky.",

So I think that that is a hotbed of resistance in a much wider sense in that many people there, and certainly the militants I spoke to do not believe in a two-state solution, they do not believe in the right of the Jewish state to exist. That's the Jewish state. Now that presents of course Israel with an enduring problem because particular on the right in Israel but across the board, when you hear that kind of comment, people get very anxious about whether or not a viable Palestinian state would be an existential threat to Israel. And if that can't be overcome, then ultimately the settlement project and the continued perpetuation of this occupation in areas across the West Bank perpetuated and that will generate inevitably a pushback from particularly more radical groups within the Palestinian community. But on top of that, there is also the role of the international community, the European Union, spending some $450 billion a year just on the Palestinian Authority trying to tie it all together, to keep it going effectively -- Becky.",

In this case, short-range ballistic missiles fired about 230 kilometers at around noon local time that's splashed into the sea east of the Korean Peninsula. The U.S. Military said they posed no immediate threat to U.S. personnel or to U.S. allies in the region, but it made the South Korean military unhappy and we have seen the North and South Koreans in recent weeks firing artillery and warning shots on several occasions across the maritime -- into the maritime buffer zone between these two rivals. And North Korea has said that some of these missile launches are in response to military exercises being carried out on the other side of the Demilitarized Zone. We've seen exercises between the U.S. and South Korea and Kapan just this week. The South Koreans were conducting their own amphibious assault exercises. North Korea does not like these. And it is likely to get angry again next week because the U.S. and South Korean air forces say that they are going to conduct air force drills for the first time in years involving more than 200 aircraft, including the new F-35 B, a U.S. stealth fighter jet.

Notably making this a little bit easier for police to investigate is the fact that our understanding based on multiple sources is that there is video that the Capitol Police can access that captured this incident. The Capitol Police is the protected agency for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as well as other members of leadership, and for the actual physical grounds of the Capitol and other locations throughout the Capitol complex. So they are basically the police department who is responsible for congressional lawmakers. In San Francisco where this happened, San Francisco Police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation currently taking the lead on the investigatory aspects that are being generated out of San Francisco. But here's what we know. This happened at around 2:00 in the morning. Again this was a very violent attack. The assailant using a hammer during this attack, attacking Paul Pelosi, who is 82 years old. Again, the speaker's office saying that he's expected to make a full recovery. We're continuing to get more details, but the big question here is who this person is and why it happened. Why it happened will have a giant ripple effect throughout the country as Capitol Police assesses the threat environment for the lawmakers, especially as we lead into an election season that all of law enforcement agencies here in Washington and the federal law enforcement agencies including the Department of Homeland Security believe is a heightened threat environment, something that has persisted since the January 6th, 2021 Capitol attack.
