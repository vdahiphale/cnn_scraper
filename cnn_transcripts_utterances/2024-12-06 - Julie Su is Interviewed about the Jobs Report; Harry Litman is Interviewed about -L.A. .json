The U.S. economy adding 227,000 jobs in the month of November. The unemployment rate ticking up just slightly.Joining us now to talk about this is the acting secretary of labor, Julie Su. Secretary, thank you for coming back in. This is seen as a strong report. Jobs bouncing back after that rough October moment. Take this report and add it to reflect on really the last year.

I think that's the one sentence version. I will say, you know, October was an aberration. We talked about this last time because we were - we were hit by two hurricanes, and there were tens of thousands of workers on strike. This month's report is much more consistent with what we've seen throughout the year, which is a story of continued growth. This is the only administration that will leave office having seen job growth every single month since we've been here. And that's when you consider what - what we faced when we came in here with the pandemic and the economy hurtling toward collapse and many people saying that it was going to be impossible to recover as quickly as we have. Something that we - we're happy to see and also, you know, proud to, you know, hand off and hope for continued strength and growth that is really inclusive and continues to prioritize working people.",

Investments we're making have powered an historic economic recovery. But as we know, voters did not agree. People voted for Donald Trumpbecause of how unhappy they still were with the economy.

      "sentences": "So, AI could now be - soon be utilized to measure bias in the next news article that you read. The biotech billionaire who owns \"The Los Angeles Times\" now says he has plans to implement an AI bias meter on news articles in his publication. He says it will help give readers both sides of the story, but journalists working for that paper are pushing back. The union representing them says that with this move their boss is publicly suggesting his staffers harbor bias without offering evidence.This decision, and others recently, have already led to some notable departures from the publication, including someone you may recognize. Harry Litman, who has appeared here on CNN NEWS CENTRAL multiple - many times, is now a former contributor to \"The L.A. Times\" since he just resigned. In doing so he wrote this, in part, that Patrick Soon- Shiong has made moves to force the paper into a posture more sympathetic to incoming President Donald Trump. Harry joins us now to talk more about this. Harry, thanks for coming in. You spent 15 years working with \"The L.A. Times.\" Why walk away now? HARRY LITMAN, FORMER LEGAL AFFAIRS COLUMNIST, \"L.A. TIMES\": Yes. Well, now I think we're at a really very critical juncture, Kate. We have a crippling problem in the country that we can't even agree on what the facts are. And it's the indispensable role of the media, in that setting, to tell us, first and foremost, what the facts are. To get to your A-1 proposal, I think they can tabulate different people's views and the like, but it won't tell us what's true. And I think \"The L.A. Times\" knows what's true. I think CNN and MSNBC and Fox knows what's true. And that's got to be the north star, especially because it happens that we have a president-elect who doesn't have much regard for the truth. So in that setting, the idea of balance really means sort of tacking toward him. And when you begin to tack toward a powerful leader based on caprice but not truth, you know that's what happens in authoritarian societies, not democracies. And Trump has captured so many of the important checks and balances and guardrails. And if the media doesn't stand up, we're in a woeful state. Two of the most prominent papers in the country, \"The L.A. Times\" and \"The Washington Post,\" pulled endorsements for no real reason other than their personal stakes. That - that I found to be a really alarming development.",

Times,\" of course, had gone for a couple of years making judgments, and that would have led naturally to an endorsement that was pulled at the last second.Why, I don't want to try to psychoanalyze the paper, but I know what it wasn't. It wasn't any thought about Trump's immigration policies or Harris' problems. It was something else. And both of these papers are owned by people with multiple holdings. And Trump has made clear, if you mess with me, I'm coming at you. And the media is his target. Others have been cowed by that. Media, in the past, have not. Think about Watergate and the finest moments of the media. So, it - it - if it's in response to that, and there's - there's no other really apparent reason, that really bodes ill, not just for the paper and the readers, but for all of us who have to look to established media, to tell us the facts of the matter.
