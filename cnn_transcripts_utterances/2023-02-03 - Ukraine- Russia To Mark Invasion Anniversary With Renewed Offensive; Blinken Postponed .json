Now that square that I was in is almost completely deserted.That the latest figures from the government say that at least 77 people have been killed by Russian bombardment since the city was liberated. Sometimes they are seeing 60, 70, as often more than 50 strikes with direct fire from tanks, from mortars, from grads. And this is all coming from the Russian positions just on the other side of the Dnipro River. Now, that is a natural defensive barrier for both sides. So, it's unlikely to escalate into a ground war there, Jake. But what we have been seeing and what the Ukrainians are speaking very bitterly about, those that can remain in the city, mostly trapped by poverty, unable to leave, is that they are being bombarded at random in a systematic attempt by the Russians. We've seen it in so many other cities around the country to take on and try to break the will of Ukrainian civilians if they can't break the lines of the military, Jake.",

But what I think they're doing is ramping up the rhetoric around what is a very real threat. That is a large number of possibly 300,000 troops massing or at least in training and mobilization on the Russian side. The Russians have been moving more troops and probing more on the southern front. Of course, the fighting in the east in Donbass around Bakhmut has been extremely bloody and bitter and continues that way. And there have been exercises in Belarus.

He allegedly shot at someone after selling them drugs, shot at a police officer, opened fire inside a Whataburger fast food joint after his credit card was declined.He's facing state charges for all of that, but the federal charge stemmed from guns that authorities found at his home, which were unlawful to possess because he had a restraining order against him after he allegedly beat up his ex-girlfriend. But in this controversial new ruling, this conservative court ruled that despite that violent past in that restraining order, he can still have guns. And their rationale stems from that landmark 2022 Supreme Court decision you mentioned that essentially determined that gun laws have to be tied to historical precedent. I'll read part of that ruling. They say that \"Courts are required to assess whether modern firearms regulations are consistent with the Second Amendment's text and historical understanding. There must be a well-established and representative historical analog.\" Basically, Jake, in Layman's terms, that means that since there was no domestic violence law involving firearms at the time the Constitution was written over 230 years ago, according to this court, this particular law is unconstitutional.",
