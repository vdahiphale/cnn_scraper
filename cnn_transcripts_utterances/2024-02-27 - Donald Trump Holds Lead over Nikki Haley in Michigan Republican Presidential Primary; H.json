But Johnson's lonely dilemma is being sharpened as the administration singles him out as the one man who can thwart or enable Putin's attempt to wipe Ukraine off the map. It's down to one man to decide the fate of Ukraine, essentially, and that's not Biden, that's not Putin. It's a relatively inexperienced House speaker, is the argument here. Do you see it that way?WILLIAM TAYLOR, VICE PRESIDENT, EUROPE AND RUSSIA AT THE U.S. INSTITUTE OF PEACE:  No. I see it more broadly. This is a decision for the House of Representatives. The Senate has made its decision. Then Senate in an overwhelming 70 to 29 vote, bipartisan -- almost all the Democrats, 22 Republicans in the Senate, they supported the Ukraine package. That's where it's going now into the House. And yes, the speaker does have a lot of decisions, a lot of authority to make a decision about when it comes to a vote or if it comes to a vote. But there are other people in the House who are looking for options to either get the speaker to allow a vote on something that they could put together, or to actually go around him, which is possible to do. If he sees people going around him, it may encourage him to make the decisions, OK, bring it to a vote.",

They plan to send a message today with a protest vote. It may give Biden an inkling of how big of an issue this might be in November.As for Donald Trump, he's looking for another big margin victory. Another big question, though, will Nikki Haley make a dent in that number with a strong showing and help keep her campaign alive. She'll pitch herself to the voters right here on CNN News Central.

That happened in Iowa, that happened in New Hampshire, that happened in South Carolina.So now we're going to see what is sort of the natural baseline of support inside the context of a Republican primary for Donald Trump? We talked a lot on Saturday night about that 40 percent and what that represents in terms of his exposure in terms of general election vulnerabilities. Today, since it hasn't been a fully engaged primary campaign in Michigan, I think we're going to learn just what is that slice of the Republican electorate that even without a fully engaged opponent against Trump is resistant to Trump, and what does that tell us about his vulnerability in a critical battleground state come November.",

She's joining us now. Lauren, what could come from this meeting? What are you hearing? LAUREN FOX, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, certainly the stakes are really high at this moment as lawmakers meet with the president today at the White House, and specifically the question on the table is whether or not they're going to be able to come to some kind of an agreement to avert that government shutdown, which will happen Friday at midnight. And right now, it's not clear what the path is. And this isn't really a divide necessarily between Republicans and Democrats. This is kind of a divide between House Republicans and everybody else. You are starting to hear so much frustration from both Republican and Democratic senators as they arrive back to Washington last night over the fact that everyone knew this deadline was coming, everyone knew what was at stake, and yet they are still grappling with coming to some kind of an agreement on those four spending bills that are due on Friday at midnight. Here's some Senate Democrats expressing that heartburn. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA):  What is wrong with these people? This is, this is the central thing Congress is supposed to do. The Republicans can't seem to get themselves organized just a sign off on the basic work they're supposed to do.

They said they were really concerned about selective leaks from Republican lawmakers, which is why they were pushing for a public hearing.And as you know, the leadup to this day, it has been quite something, lots of a political stunts, two unannounced appearances by Hunter Biden on the Hill, some political sniping, and some hardball negotiations that resulted in at least two concessions from Republicans that have made this possible. The first is that Hunter Biden's deposition will not be videotaped, and that is a departure from other witnesses related to the Biden investigation whose who's interviews have then videotaped. Now, there was also an agreement when it comes to the transcript. There were concerns that if the majority got Hunter's transcript first, they could potentially selectively leak parts, try to shape the narrative before the full document was made available to the public. But we've learned that there is an agreement that it will be made simultaneously available to both parties and then released to the public pretty quickly, possibly within 24 hours. Now, Hunter Biden is certainly the most significant witness that they have secured on the Hill in their investigations related to an impeachment inquiry into the president. But it comes just about a week-and-a-half after a significant blow to the allegations against the former president and his son. Of course, the FBI has charged an informant, Alexander Smirnov, with making false statements, with allegedly lying about things he said about Hunter Biden and President Biden receiving bribes. So Republicans, not necessarily feeling as confident as they were before those allegations. But this is still a significant witness that they're really only able to get in the chair because they were willing to negotiate here.",

They don't know what the president was basing that assessment on. And interestingly, we're also hearing some cold water being poured on this by Hamas as well. Osama Hamdan, a senior official for Hamas, saying that the leaks that have come out about the state of these negotiations about the progress that is being made, in his view, portray a false sense of progress. Now, of course, these are both parties to these negotiations. They are posturing as much as they are giving insight into the state of those negotiations. Qatar, for its part, which is a key mediator in these talks says that they believe that there is a positive trajectory here, but they didn't go quite as far as President Biden did. In fact, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, when asked about President Biden's comments, simply referred questions back to the White House on that, but they are hoping that an agreement can be reached before Ramadan, and that is the tight timeline that we are currently under as we look to see whether or not a deal can be reached. Ramadan is less than two weeks away, and there does seem to be some significant progress being made in these talks. Based on sources that we've talked to familiar with these negotiations, the latest framework that is being discussed, would see the release of perhaps around 40 hostages over the course of about six weeks. Israel very much pushing for that to include what they believe to be five Israeli female soldiers who are also being held by Hamas. And it's clear that Hamas has backed off some key demands, whether that is ending the war altogether, being willing to enter an initial agreement without that condition being met, and also in terms of reducing the number of Palestinian prisoners that they are demanding, but it's also clear that a deal has yet to actually be reached. But as long as these parties are talking, and they certainly are. An Israeli delegation has been in Qatar over the last couple of days working on some of the technical details of this deal, then there is the possibility of progress, there is the possibility of reaching an agreement but whether that actually happens by Monday, which President Biden suggested, nobody in the region seems to believe it will happen that fast -- Kate.",
