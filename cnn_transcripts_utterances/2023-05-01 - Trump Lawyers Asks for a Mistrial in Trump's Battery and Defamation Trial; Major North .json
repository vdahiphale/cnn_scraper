This is also traditionally May the 1st. This is a day when people come out to protest in any case. So, the police had expected this particular day because of the pension reform protests we have seen that have gotten so violent in these last few weeks to be even better attended than some of the protests we have seen recently. And possibly, the attended May the 1st protest we have seen in many, many years. Certainly, they're proving to be some of the most animated so far and very early on in the day that we've seen in a long time, Kate.",

From September, the French will incrementally start working more and more each year until they reach their retirement age by 2030 of 64. Pretty low by European standards, but here in France, a very soft nerve as you can see. And the way that Emmanuel Macron carried it out, you mentioned a moment ago the Constitutional Council, by pushing it through without a parliamentary vote has really added to a lot of the anger.Now, a lot of the people that you are seeing around me here, the Black Bloc, these are the most -- some of the most extreme elements. You're talking about the very far left, they come out to these protests seeking confrontation with the police. The vast majority of the protesters that are following in the march, I think it's important to add, the trade unions, the people who have come out here to peacefully demonstrate, are in the vast, vast majority. But the point is that all of the people out here on the streets today, whether they are the Black Bloc, whether they are the peaceful protesters behind me, know that they are coming out to protest against the pension reform that maybe going through but that is vastly opposed by a majority of the French population. So, it is something like 62 percent of the French that are opposed to this reform. And I think most importantly, Kate, one of the most interesting statistics is that since this began on January 19th, the protests, the strikes, they have now continued through all of those months with all of the trouble at difficulty and chaos and gridlock that that brings to the French people. The popular support in favor of this movement, in favor of this protest movement, has actually risen by 11 percent. So, that is really what the people out here on the street are hoping to tap into. The fact that the French are extremely angry about this reform, and that anger has appeared to grow.",

The State Supreme Court has rolled back a previous decision that struck down a congressional map that was drawn by Republicans.Take a look at what the original map looked like. This was what was used in the 2020 election. Now, let's fast forward. Here is what the new map looks like. You can see how it split up some of the Democratic majority districts to give the GOP a much better shot at winning. The State Supreme Court originally ruled the map was gerrymandered so great egregiously that it violated the state's constitution. Now, a GOP-led court has now swung things the other direction.

There was the partisan gerrymandering ruling, a voter I.D. ruling, and a ruling that revoked the voting rights for people who had them restored after being convicted of felonies.That -- two of those, that partisan gerrymandering and the voter I.D. ruling, both of those had been decided by a Democratic majority Supreme Court, just months before these rulings. But when the Republicans won control of the State Supreme Court, justices are elected in North Carolina in partisan elections, they -- the state legislator went, asked them to review these rulings, just a few months later they agreed and they reversed these rulings. Now, when we talk about this partisan gerrymandering ruling, I cannot overstate how big of a deal this is. The new chief justice, Paul Newby, a Republican, stating in his opinion, it is not within the authority of this court to address partisan gerrymandering. He wrote that the state constitution says that the elected General Assembly, with limitations, is solely responsible for drawing their own political maps when it comes to redistricting. In her scathing dissent, Justice Anita Earls, who was once a voting rights attorney herself, noted that this is not how democracy should function, saying that it basically allows Republicans in power to draw maps so they can stay in power regardless of the people's will. She added that the court shows that its own will is more powerful than the voices of the North Carolina voters. Now, look, North Carolina's congressional map is currently split seven-seven. That is likely going to change. Something that, on a national level, Democrats are concerned about. On a state level, looking at legislative maps, there was concern there as well.

She was one of five women legislators in the State Senate that joined together to stop a proposed near-total ban on abortion from passing. State Senator, thank you very much for coming in. I wanted to ask you what you thought when you heard Ronna McDaniel say that yesterday, her take that she thinks that abortion is going to be a key issue in 2024 and Republican candidates need to make it front and center. STATE SEN. SANDY SENN (R-SC):  I think that must be the advice she has given the governor, I think he was from Nebraska, which I think is going to be a very losing strategy for our Republican candidates. I know that in my state we have two presidential candidates, Senator Tim Scott and Former Governor and U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley. They have softened on the issue of abortion. Whereas, in my state, generally, you had to be very hard and strong on it in order to win election. They have softened, as has Lindsey Graham and Nancy Mace, as they should, because that's the only winning strategy. Certainly -- I mean, in my state, we are 51 percent female. BOLDUAN:  And I want to ask you about that. And first, I want to play for everyone what you said on the Senate floor last week.
