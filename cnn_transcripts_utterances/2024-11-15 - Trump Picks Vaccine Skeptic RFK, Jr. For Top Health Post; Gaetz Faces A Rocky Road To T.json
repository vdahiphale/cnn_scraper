Make America healthy again. What we know about RFK Jr. and why his appointment is rattling the medical community. Also ahead, deprived of food, water, and supplies. We'll bring you an update on the hundreds of South African miners that the government is still refusing to help. The slap heard around the world. Mike Tyson takes an early shot at Jake Paul ahead of their much anticipated rumble. Hello, everyone. Live from New York, I'm Bianna Golodryga. Zain is off today. You are watching ONE WORLD. Well, Donald Trump's plan to put an outspoken conspiracy theorist and prominent anti-vaxxer in charge of America's health and well-being is the latest in a line of provocative picks for his new administration. The U.S. president-elect has selected Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. Kennedy is controversial not only for falsely claiming vaccines can cause autism, but also for a series of bizarre events. Now, the former independent presidential candidate is being investigated for allegedly decapitating a dead whale and taking it home two decades ago. He also is admitted to dumping a dead bear in Central Park. Kennedy claims doctors found a dead worm in his brain years ago. And he denies once eating a barbeque dog, clarifying that it was actually a goat. Still, Trump had nothing but praise for Kennedy on Thursday night. But he also took a not-so-subtle jab.

But now, you have the speaker saying that he does not want the House Ethics Committee to do that.

It's also important to point out that at the end of the year, starting on January 3rd, that committee will then be led by incoming chairman, Chuck Grassley, a Republican. So the committee is transferring from democratic power to Republican power. And I was pressing Chuck Grassley yesterday on whether he wanted this ethics report if he's going to push for it.

She, from day one, clarified the reason for Russia's special operation in Ukraine, the anchor says, criticizing the actions of the Biden administration. Gabbard's words in 2022 right after Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine caused even panelists on Russian state T.V. to cynically ask if she's a Kremlin agent. Yes, the host said, without providing any evidence. But the Russians ripping into designated secretary of defense Pete Hegseth and national security advisor Mike Waltz. Waltz, at the Republican Convention, proposed deploying more American drones in the Black Sea and bragged about how Trump threatened to bomb as he put it, Putin's Kremlin.

There does seem to be more and more speculation about what a Trump policy would look like, and that could very well lead to Ukraine being forced to give up a significant portion of the land that Russia has now conquered in this war.

So that will put President Trump in a position of either, you know, appeasing Russia and accepting what they are proposing, which is basically a complete victory for Russia if Ukraine is not given some kind of security guarantees. And I would point out something that, you know, President Trump said about the Middle East. He said, we've got to address, you know, what is going on here and prevent things from recurring in 10 years. Well, it's the same for Ukraine. You can't agree to Russia's maximalist positions and expect that there will be no further aggression that we will have to deal with down the road. And so I also think that President Trump does not want to go down as, you know, the greatest appeaser of Russian aggression in history.

And in 1968, we go way, way backthat an old FDR coalition was blown apart by the Vietnam War and all the kind of various social pressures working on the left. Bill Clinton, in 1992, reassembled it. And it's always had a kind of like, there's been this sort of, you know, kind of working class sort of idea about the Democrats since then, but it hasn't really been the heart of the party. It hasn't been sort of their raison detre. And what's taken over in its place has been this, you know, identity politics, this obsession with immutable traits. And that has been extraordinarily sort of deleterious for the party's political fortunes. And so if they want to become a national party again, where we would have real serious political competition and we don't have this map where there's like these kind of vast seas of like red that like spread across the country and you actually want to have like real political competition in every state, Democrats are going to have to respond to, you know, the kind of right-wing populist agenda with a left-wing populist agenda. And there are all kinds of ways of imagining that. And it doesn't have to be the Bernie Sanders left. It might be more market-oriented or whatever. But it's got to be an agenda that addresses the questions and concerns, the yearnings of countless voters who have been saying for a long time now, we are sick and tired of America declining inexorably. We want -- we want people in Washington. We want the people in charge to lead us out of the morass. And until Democrats actually address that and start talking about the same things that Republicans are talking about, I think they're going to -- they're going to be on the margins.",

Well, we are taking a closer look at President-elect Donald Trump's pick for U.S. attorney general, Matt Gaetz. If he's confirmed by the Senate, one of his major duties would be to oversee the U.S. prison system. CNN is learning more about Gaetz' possible mindset on prisons. Back in July, he took a tour of one of the world's toughest prisons and suggested that it should be a model for the U.S. This prison is where El Salvador keeps the, quote, worst of the worst, murderers, rapists and gang members, including some who were deported from the United States. El Salvador's president released a video of some of Gaetz' comments after visiting the facility.
