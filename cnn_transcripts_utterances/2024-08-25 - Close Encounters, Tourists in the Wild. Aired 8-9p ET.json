And before we go, a very cute reason why there is caution tape closing off this popular California beach. Hundreds of mostly male sea lions suddenly showing up. A marine biologist tells CNN they don't know why yet, but the sea lions may hang out there for about a month. Monterey Bay is home to a marine national sanctuary and the sea lions are protected by federal law. Well, thank you for joining me this evening. I'm Paula Reid in Washington, in for Jessica Dean.

And part of the draw is the opportunity to see wild animals like bears, elk, bison, and wolves in their natural habitat. But sometimes tourists accidentally hike or camp too close to wildlife or intentionally get close to take pictures or selfies. That's led to dangerous and sometimes deadly outcome for both humans and animals. CNN's Ed Lavandera and his team took an unforgettable trip to Yellowstone National Park. And over the next hour, you'll see some of these close encounters and learn what to do and not do when you get too close to a wild animal. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

We're in Gardiner, Montana, and just trying to take a walk through town. And you got to navigate more than just cars and crosswalks. These are rocky mountain elk. (Voice-over): Gardiner is just outside Yellowstone's north entrance. The motel over there has a sign that says do not pet the fluffy cows. You constantly have to be reminded about this stuff because you're walking around town and you think that they're just part of the atmosphere and that they're friendly. You have to remind yourself they're wild animals. (Voice-over): Friendly stranger reminds us of that in a loving way. This is \"Close Encounters, Tourists in the Wild.\" It didn't take us long to figure out what not to do. There is such a thing as getting too close to wildlife.

SHOLLY: Well, you also on the first park in America, it's the first national park in the world. It started a movement in this country and how incredible the resources are that we protect, how important the stories that we tell are the good, the bad, and the ugly of this country's history. It truly has created the best national park system in the world. LAVANDERA (voice-over): My team and I are incredibly thankful we got to make this visit. Watching such majestic animals roam the land is a reminder of what it feels like to be wild and free. We hope you get to feel it, too. Safely of course. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
