Now the focus of a criminal investigation with prosecutors looking into possible charges of sexual assault and a six- hour long emergency meeting Monday at the regional bodies which make up the Federation has ended with a request for his immediate resignation all of this over his behavior at the Women's World Cup, including that kiss with a star player during the trophy ceremony.Luis Rubiales has insisted the kiss was spontaneous and mutual. But Jenny hum Hermoso says at no point did she give consent to it and she called the move sexist. Regional soccer chiefs issued a statement condemning his behavior as unacceptable, seriously damaging the image of Spanish football. Rubiales has already been suspended by FIFA for 90 days. Hundreds of protesters gathered in Madrid Monday demanding Rubiales step down. They chatted it's not a kiss. It is aggression. But he has the backing of the Football Federation and is vowing to fight to the end. Meantime, there are concerns this lingering controversy will hurt Spain's bid to co-host 2030 World Cup. Atika Shubert picks up the story from here. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ATIKA SHUBERT, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Euphoric celebrations for an historic Women's World Cup quickly turned into a moment of reckoning. When Luis Rubiales, president of the Spanish Football Federation planted a forceful kiss on player Jennifer Hermoso doing the medal ceremony in Sydney. The kiss she later said she had not consented to. Facing domestic and international criticism, Rubiales was pressured to resign but he defiantly refused. He doubled down saying the kiss was consensual to the applause of men in the room. LUIS RUBIALES, PRESIDENT OF THE ROYAL SPANISH FOOTBALL FEDERATION (through translator): You think I have to resign? Well, I'm going to tell you something. No, I will not resign.",

Molecular genetic examinations have been completed the investigating committee says according to their results, the identities of all 10 dead were established they correspond to the list in the flight sheet. The news shocked some in Russia but appears to have surprised few as makeshift memorials have been popping up in various cities like here in Moscow.

They are heroes for our country, this woman adds a brilliant future awaits Wagner. Everyone makes mistakes it happens. And this man says it doesn't leave any new emotional feeling, it just confirms that we are united and there are less and less of us. The Russians say the investigation to find the cause of the crash is ongoing while the Kremlin called speculation that Russian President Vladimir Putin may have ordered the jet taken down quote an absolute lie. But Putin spokesman now says it's not clear whether the Russian leader will attend Prigozhin funeral pollutants words for the deceased Wagner boss lukewarm. He was a man with a complicated fate, Putin said, and he made serious mistakes in life. Putin had called the mutiny precaution unleashed in late June treasonous the Wagner private military company once one of the strongest forces fighting for Russia in Ukraine has been in limbo since then.

Her agency, the Commerce Department has been imposing a growing number of export controls targeting China, especially in semiconductors and advanced computing. That, of course, has greatly angered the Beijing leadership, including President Xi Jinping himself. That's why, you know, Raimondo has been trying to say that the export controls out of national security concerns account for only 1 percent of America's export to China. So there's still a lot of room for growth for cooperation. But that kind of arguments may be a little difficult to make -- may not be that convincing to her Chinese counterparts who actually don't see much difference between derisking, which is what U.S. officials have been saying and decoupling. But of course, they are trying to focus on a positive because they have agreed to strengthen communication also to establish a new working group involving officials and the private sector to work out some of those disagreements and disputes.
