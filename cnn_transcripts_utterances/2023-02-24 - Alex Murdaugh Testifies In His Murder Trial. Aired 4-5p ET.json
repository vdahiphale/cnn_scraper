I'm John Berman, in for Jake.Today, we have been watching the dramatic cross-examination of Alex Murdaugh, the disgraced South Carolina lawyer, charged with murder in the deaths of his wife and son. Now much of today's questioning focused on the timeline of the day when these two people were killed. He was repeatedly questioned, Alex Murdaugh was, on where he was and what he was doing, and he told attorneys today he told prosecutors, he was not trying to manufacture an alibi when he now admittedly lied to investigators around that time. Here with me is CNN's Jean Casarez who has been watching so much of this trial. And, Jean, just what jumped out to you at the end here, particularly the dramatic finish of that cross-examination?",

They are both criminal defense attorneys and former prosecutors. Bernarda, just -- let's start in a bigger sense. How would you assess how this has gone so far for Alex Murdaugh on the stand? BERNARDA VILLALONA, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY &amp; FORMER PROSECUTOR: John, this has been completely the Alex Murdaugh show. He took control of the complete direct examination, which we expected, but also of the cross-examination. It has all been about Alex Murdaugh, and he has controlled the answers that even the questions in this case and he's the witness on the stand. He's not even the attorney who is asking the questions. But this just goes to show you, when you have a professional civil litigator, a trial attorney, and you convert them and they're the defendant that's on the stand, they know how to work that courtroom. He has been preparing for months what his answers were going to be, and he was able to get the story he wanted to be out there. He had to own up that he's a liar and that he's a thief. We knew that. And he owns up to it each and every time. The one question that wasn't asked, hey, you've been honest about that you stole from these people and you regret all of this, but guess what, you still pleaded not guilty and still have these old charges. What is the jury to decide now? Can I believe this guy who's a con artist and who's bamboozled so many people that is still close to him? What should we do now? Again, it's the Alex Murdaugh show in this is courtroom.",

Did they land any serious legal goals this afternoon?MARK EIGLARSH, CRIMINAL DEFENS ATTORNEY &amp; FORMER PROSECUTOR:  Yes, the prosecutors were effective at times, but that was surrounded by a bunch of fat. This isn't a lean filet mignon like cross-examination should be, where we're artists, understand cross-examination, creating reasonable doubt, that's what we do as defense lawyers. Prosecutors rarely do it. So, there were a couple of moments that they had. You lied to this person, this person, on and on. The only ones he didn't lie to is maybe me and you. Everyone else he lied to. For two decades, he becomes a perfected liar. That was the point that was made. That, coupled with it's not you, who else? These vigilantes came in, didn't have weapons, they knew you would be in the kennel and then boom. Like that doesn't make sense. But those are big moments. But separated by a bunch of flop, a bunch of fat, which causes the prosecution to lose the opportunity to go for the jugular, giving him an opportunity to explain and arguably look sympathetic. I still thought he looked pathetic, but it's up to the jurors and only takes one to hang the jury on.",

He asked him that correctly, why were you making these calls and taking these steps in addition to the joking about, were you on a treadmill? Were you running in place or jogging in place?But he was pointing out he was making phone calls. Murdaugh seemed to say he knows he was checking on his father but didn't know who he was calling. He also made a strong point, the state did, in asking him close to the end, did you annihilate your family? Are you a family annihilator? Of course, Alex Murdaugh said he did not kill his wife and son. And the other point that he made, the state, if you had called and texted your wife that evening, and you were just up the driveway as we know it, two minute drive on the golf cart, why didn't you check on them when you were leaving house? Why did you leave the house? Why didn't you go back to the kennels if she wasn't asking your text messages or phone calls, why didn't you check on them? Which was also very interesting. But again, it's important to note that Alex Murdaugh's phone, John, was showing no activity from 8:09 to 9:02. No activity at all. He said he left it in the house when he was at the kennels and that's very common if he's going to run out briefly he was thinking he was doing, he said, but that is also very curious, something the jury will have to consider, John.",
