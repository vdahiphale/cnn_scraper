Prosecutors revealing investigators found items in several trash bags with (INAUDIBLE) and Brian's DNA.They accuse him of dismembering his wife and disposing of her body, saying that surveillance video shows a man fitting Walshe's descriptio, visiting various dumpsters. They also detailed more than a dozen disturbing internet searches that say Walshe made after his wife disappearance, including 10 ways to dispose of a dead body, if you really need to. I want to go right now to CNN national correspondent Brynn Gingras who is outside the courthouse in Quincy, Massachusetts. Brynn, what is the latest on this case against Brian Walshe?",

January 1st, in the early morning hours, that's when they began, according to prosecutors, where he googled how long before a body starts to smell. And it wasn't long after that, he asked, can you throw away body parts? Going into the next day, January 2nd, can you be charged with murder without a body? On January 3rd, what happens to hair on a dead body? As you mentioned, more than a dozen google searches in the minutes after, hours after, days after prosecutors say he killed his wife. And that wasn't the only searches prosecutors are alleging here, Laura. They also say in the days prior to January 1st, actually, on December 27th, they say he was actually googling, you know, what's the best state to get a divorce, possibly here pointing to a motive, Laura.",

Is he shaking his head? Is he shocked? Is he looking or appearing in a way devastated and grief-stricken?

He seemed very devoted to keeping his eyes straight ahead, not blinking. We're always looking for eyes moving left or moving right, trying to see if he's thinking or inventing or going backwards with facts. We call this kind of thin-slicing, too, taking whole body language and the micro expressions.At one point, he did a deep swallow. But, you know, some people like Robert Durst, everybody talked about his tell, that he would start swallowing when he was nervous, when he was being asked questions about the murders of which he was accused. And I think this guy is a very practiced. He knew that this was coming. And I wouldn't be surprised if he has a defense ready that's aligned with something like Robert Durst, where he is going to say, if the evidence is overwhelming, as Joey just really laid it out, that it was self-defense, that she attacked him perhaps in a fight, or even worse, she just died of accidental or natural causes and he panicked and got rid of the body. Without a body, he could make an argument that you can't convict him. So, I think that his brain is just processing, that if he plays this cool as a cucumber, assuming again he's factually guilty, he could get over on the system. Remember, friends of his father, you know, related to the white-collar crimes of which he is accused, has said that he was in an institution and was, this is again what they're saying, diagnosed as a sociopath back in the day. So, you can't read a whole lot when somebody is having antisocial personality disorder. Sometimes, the manipulation really goes the full length and you can't find any expressions on their face.",

I think this movement around DeSantis is really, really important in republican politics because you do see people at the ground level of the GOP who do have something to lose from really taking off the base, feeling like it's actually safe to go there and so we want somebody other than Donald Trump.DeSantis has become kind of the safe space for those people to go, right? You don't see a whole lot of people going on the limp for a Nikki Haley or Mike Pompeo yet. They got a steep hill to climb. But that path is available. It gives them permission to. Now, the other side of the coin, though, Laura, is that the fact that you have this movement to get past Trump, coalescing around a guy who has not said that he is running and who is not doing a lot of the stuff that you would typically be doing right now if you were going to run for president, get around the country, speak to an audience outside Florida, maybe try some muscles in the media outside of those reliable Fox News formats. Look, he has a tremendous opportunity to get into this race as a frontrunner or a cold frontrunner, certainly, the strongest alternative to Trump, but he has never been tested in the way he would be tested in that context.",

But that is absolutely right, nobody really knows yet. He has not been tested enough.That's kind of the point I'm making. There's a sense that because he's popular in the state of Florida, it is politically important that he has momentum and everyone is talking about him. I think (INAUDIBLE) his own momentum as soon as he starts running, which is why he is not saying anything yet. Let the mystery continue. It's almost a political strategy on his part. They don't know him well enough to not like him.",

      "sentences": "Well, first of all, Laura, it's great to see you and thanks for having me on. Not only were they displaying the Russian flag during this particular match, but my sources telling me that they're actually being quite rude to the Ukrainian player, these Russian fans.So, that did not go over well at all with the Tennis Australia officials. I think they made the correct decision here, Laura, to ban the Russian and Belarusian flags from being displayed. The Australian Open is a very international tournament. Fans come from all over the world. It has got a great vibe about it. People come from all over and display their flags for their favorite players. So, it's an unfortunate situation. It's certainly not the first time, as you noted, nor will it be the last time that politics comes into the sporting world and particularly the tennis world which is such an international sport. And you've got also the fact that you've got individual players. They're not allowed to show their flags if you're Russian or Belarusian. We show the graphics of the players, and we talk about their background and where they're from. So that's not happening. They can't show that in the draws as well for these players. This was the right move. Again, international team events are not allowing Russian and Belarusian teams to play in the tennis world. But individual players are allowed to play, although, you may remember, Laura, that they were banned from competing at Wimbledon, the biggest tennis tournament in the world last year. So, it will be really interesting to see what happens later this year as far as that goes, not the mention you mentioned Novak Djokovic who is here, by the way, trying to win his 10th Australian Open title. He's back. He's got the great reception from the Australian fans. And, of course, another big decision for the tennis world will be, will Novak Djokovic be allowed into the United States to compete, because as of now, he would not be allowed to compete because you can't get into the country as an unvaccinated, non-citizen of the USA.",

These are really world apart and yet the connective tissue really is the idea of how politics is intersecting.With respect to the ban on players, particularly for Wimbledon, for the Russian athletes, the Belarusian athletes, there's a lot of controversy and concern about whether it was fair to attribute and assign the behavior policy, the actions of a leadership with the actual players. But then there was this moment, if you may remember, with the Russian gymnast Ivan Kuliak, who wore that pro-war symbol in a competition against Ukrainian players. So, it wasn't just the idea of, hey, by virtue of your nationality, you will be banned. It was in part behavior. Is there still an ongoing discussion right now about the tension between what the leaders of a country are doing and what the players are punished for?",
