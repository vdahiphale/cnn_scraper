I am not seeing the driver get out yet, but police say -- yes, there is the driver getting out of the car now through the window and running. Police say he was then trying to stab people afterwards. Hamas has claimed responsibility for the attack. Saying it was in response to Israel's massive military operation that is still ongoing in the West Bank. The Palestinian authority says the operation in Jenin has killed 10 people and injured about 100. Israel claims the mission is necessary to, what it calls, dismantle terrorist infrastructure in the area.Joining us now is CNN Global Affairs Analyst Kim Dozier. She is the senior managing editor for the \"Military Times\". Thank you so much for joining us today. Can we start with just unusual it is for us for these airstrikes to happen in the West Bank, in particular in Jenin. We see these rockets coming over from Gaza and Israel responding with airstrikes, but you rarely see this happen in the West Bank.",

They see reports of corruption in their own government, they see reports of corruption on the Israeli side. They can see the U.S. and the International Community not making any attempt from their perspective to bring about new peace talks to give them their own state. And the frustration then grows and grows and grows. And people take acts of desperation. They consider things like back in the Second Intifada, there were more than a hundred suicide bombings against Israeli targets, restaurants, buses, cafes.Now, Israel created a wall and has locked down the Palestinian territory in such a way that it would be much harder to do something like, then you see, alternative acts of desperation like the horrific car ramming that happened today. Claimed by Hamas, which is one of the two parties that Israel would have to talk to, to create an independent Palestinian state. So, you can see, that's part of the reason talks would likely go nowhere.",

Not just for the way he plays the game with flare, with style, but for the emotion that he brings to the game as well.We all remember those scenes at the Laver Cup nine months ago when he retired, when he was in floods of tears alongside his rival Raf Nadal. But since then, John, we haven't really heard that much from the man himself. And for about half an hour, I had the chance to talk to him about everything, really. And he told me that, you know, he wasn't really missing tennis because he knew that his body couldn't cope with the rigors of tennis life any more. And the thing that he was enjoying the most was actually having the time to plan special moments with his friends and family, especially with his children. He took a trip to Lesotho last month to look at the charitable work for his Roger Federer Foundation celebrating 20 years this year Southern Africa. But you know, away from the family, John, we all know that Roger Federer has been having a lot of fun. You just got to look at his Instagram account for that. He has been at sporting events, he's hosted the Met Gala, and on Sunday he was up on stage actually performing alongside Coldplay in Zurich. But one of the funniest moments on the interview was when he told me that, you know, he might be adjusting to life after tennis, but a lot of tennis fans are having a hard time trying to place him off the tennis court.

I'm like, no, I don't know who you think I am. He was like, you're Nadal. I'm like, I'm so sorry, I'm not. You know, so I kept on walking and the guy looked and he goes, such a pity he's not Nadal.
