      "sentences": "At this hour, Adidas has cut off Kanye West over his series of offensive and antisemitic remarks. This ends a massive deal with the artists estimated to be worth billions of dollars. It also ends what has become a loud public campaign for Adidas to take a stand. In a statement, Adidas said in part this. That it does not tolerate antisemitism and any sort of hate speech. And also, that Ye's recent comments and actions have been unacceptable, hateful, and dangerous.Joining me right now is Jonathan Greenblatt. He's the CEO and national director of the Anti-Defamation League. It's good to see you, Jonathan, thank you so much for jumping on. This is a move that you have been pushing for and largely spearheaded to be quite frank, what is your reaction this morning? JONATHAN GREENBLATT, CEO &amp; NATIONAL DIRECTOR, ANTI-DEFAMATION LEAGUE: Well, as they say, you know, Kate, better late than never. I think Adidas has made a very strong statement of putting people over profits. The truth is, is that they announced two weeks ago after Kanye West wore the white lives matter T-shirt, and to be clear, white lives matter is a white supremacist slogan, that the partnership was under review the Yeezy partnership, as you said, worth an estimated $2 billion a year in gross revenue. And yet in the days that followed, he made a series of wild vicious antisemitic rants saying he would go death con three on Jewish people. And yet for some reason, while CAA and MRC and Balenciaga, and other brands Gap which had dumped him weeks before announced they were totally moving away, Adidas said nothing, which is why ADL launched our run away from hate campaign and we were able to get thousands of letters, we engaged with the leadership, we had talks with their institutional investors, and finally, they came to the right place this morning. Now again, I wish it had happened sooner. But this does send a strong statement that there are consequences when you express antisemitism in any form of hate. It's just not aligned with our values as a society. And I'm glad Adidas made that call clear. BOLDUAN: Look. An antisemitism, of course, is not new. The recent rise in antisemitism is something that you and I have, unfortunately, had to talk too much about -- so much about.",

Kanye has hundreds of millions of fans around the world. He had 31 million followers alone on Twitter. This is one of the most visible entertainers on the planet. And so for him to use that fame and notoriety to promote dangerous myths and make threats against Jewish people, look, the freedom of expression we enjoy in this country is not the freedom to incite violence.But all it takes is one person to say you know what if there really are, \"Jewish Zionists,\" as he said, out to get Kanye or a Jewish underground media mafia or any of the other kind of unhinged things, all it takes is one person, Kate, to say I'm going to go do something about that. That's why we were so worried. And as you kind of alluded to, this is happening against the backdrop of the highest number of antisemitic incidents. ADL has ever tracked in the United States. Last year, we had 2717 acts of harassment, vandalism, and violence targeting Jewish people. And we saw what happened in just -- in Los Angeles just this weekend.",

You need to embrace the sinner and help them understand why what they did offends, so they won't do it again and they're enlightened as a result.That's how as a society we move forward, which is why what Kanye did was so problematic because when offered, for example, to visit the Holocaust Museum, or when individuals like me or Ari Emanuel or others said, hey, let's work together. He not only rejected them, he used those as opportunities to spout even more antisemitic toxins. So, look, whether it's happening, you know, on the public stage, on a college campus, you know, at the voting booth, antisemitism and hate should never be tolerated no matter what the source.",

This is overwhelming some hospitals with nearly three-quarters of pediatric hospital beds in the United States now in use.Joining me right now with some important perspective is Dr. Jim Versalovic. He's the chief pediatrician at Texas Children's Hospital, the largest pediatric hospital in the country. Doctor, thank you so much for taking the time to speak with us. What are you seeing at your hospital right now? DR. JIM VERSALOVIC, CHIEF PEDIATRICIAN, TEXAS CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL: Well, good morning, Kate. We are certainly very busy here at Texas Children's, the largest integrated pediatric healthcare system in the United States and in one of the four largest metropolitan areas in the country. We're very busy. We have a census now of more than 40 children in our hospital with RSV infection. We have seen a steady rise of RSV during September and October. And this is the second wave of RSV in 2022. It's totally out of season. It's not predicted -- has not been predictable. And that has been part of the challenge. Chiefly, RSV affects infants and toddlers. We have seen more well, over 100 -- over 150 cases per week recently and a hospitalization rate for children, that is exceeding now 50 percent. And so that's notable. RSV is serious business, and we're here in the business of protecting children, their airways, and just giving them a chance to breathe easily. And that's the challenge now with RSV and with influenza A as well.",

      "sentences": "Well, it's a -- it's a very good point. The children born in 2019, and 2020, right, just before in the early phase of this current COVID pandemic would have been exposed very differently to viruses than children born previously, and that's an important point. We were thinking now that there may be altered development of the immune system early in life due to this pandemic, and the necessary changes in human behaviors and the necessary isolation of children early on.Now, children are mingling, more closely together, more openly, we want children to grow and thrive and play, of course, but it's also important to note that viruses too have something to say about this. These are RNA viruses, all three, we think of the big three COVID, flu, and RSV currently, they mutate rapidly, they're evolving, they're changing. We've seen this with the variants of COVID. We're seeing this with flu A, B. We're now seeing this with RSV as well. Last year we saw RSV B. This year, the children are seeing a different type of RSV, RSV A. We've seen two waves in 2022 versus a single wave in 2021. And we think it's both the human host and the virus behaviors have changed. As the children were more isolated, the viruses have been evolving differently, and of course, mingling in some cases causing co0infections that are new to us. And so it's created a challenge. We're hoping to get to an equilibrium. A new steady state at some point in the near future but right now, it's just impossible to predict.",
