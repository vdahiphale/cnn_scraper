KEILAR:  We're about to see for the first time a sitting American president walking the picket line. The United Auto Workers strike was already historic for opposing the Big Three automakers simultaneously. Well, now Joe Biden is expected to join the ranks of the UAW, a source saying union President Shawn Fain will be joining him on the line. Fain greeted the president at the Detroit Metro Airport here a short time ago. That is where CNN's Arlette Saenz is standing by for us. And less than an hour's drive to the north, we have CNN's Vanessa Yurkevich, who is with workers on the picket line in Warren, Michigan. Arlette, to you first here. The president is trying to shore up union support. He's trying also to convince Americans that his economic policies are working. He has a lot riding on this visit.",

We're expecting to see him any moment now as they have just arrived at a facility -- a facility, what appears to be a General Motors facility where there are some UAW members walking the picket line at this moment. The White House had not detailed ahead of time the exact location where President Biden would be simply, saying that it was in Wayne County, due to some security concerns that they were facing. But President Biden's mission while he is on the ground here is trying to show that support for union workers and also shore up support the president's working-class voters, who could be critical heading into the 2024 election. Now, the president arrived at the Detroit Airport about half-an-hour ago, where he was greeted by the UAW president, Shawn Fain. We anticipate Fain to also be there on the ground with the president at that picket line. Fain had extended this invitation for President Biden to come here to Michigan as these workers are striking. But it's noteworthy that the UAW has yet to endorse in the 2024 presidential election. The president was asked earlier what it would take to earn that endorsement. He said that's not something that he's worried about at this moment. The White House has tried to stress that this is a trip about showing solidarity with these workers as these negotiations are ongoing with the Big Three automakers. Now, the White House has walked a very careful line during these negotiations. They don't have any legal authority to be directly party to the negotiations, but they have tried to lend support in certain ways, and the president has come out in vocal support for the UAW since the strike has started. But one thing that the White House has refrained from doing is weighing in specifically on how the White House views the demands of the UAW as these negotiations are under way. Now, what's also playing out over the course of this -- these next two days is this remarkable political split screen, when you think about the fact that Biden is here today and former President Donald Trump is also expected in the Detroit area, where they're gathering a group of union workers to address. Now, it comes as both of these men are vying for working-class voters in very different ways. And it seems like... (CROSSTALK)",

So they're still making money on internal combustion engines, but the future is E.V.s. So that's why they want to go there. I don't have a problem with anything that the president has done so far. For our endorsement, we have a process that we go through. When you look at four years ago, in 2020, we didn't make our endorsement until the election year. So we're still on track to make our endorsement in a timely manner that goes along with our process.",

But even if the Senate does pass a stopgap bill there, are major questions remaining, like, will it have funding for Ukraine? Will Speaker Kevin McCarthy even bring that Senate bill to the House floor? And, if he does, will hard right House Republicans revolt and try to oust him from his speakership? CNN's Lauren Fox is live for us on Capitol Hill. All right, what more do we know about the status of this Senate bill, Lauren?",

They are still trying to find a deal that works for both Republicans and Democrats.And they're hoping that they can try and make sure that Republican and Democratic members would support it even before it comes to the to the floor, hoping that they can move this as quickly as possible, because time is of the essence right now. What they're looking at -- and this is still fluid -- is about a 45-day short-term spending bill, basically a bridge to get them to the next opportunity to have a broader negotiation on one-year spending bills. So that is what they're looking at the moment. But it's important to keep in context that there are some things that a lot of senators would like included in this short-term vehicle that may not get to the final bill. And a couple of those include Ukraine funding, as well as disaster aid. Now, again, things are still being negotiated. It's possible that some of that money ends up in the legislation, but it is important to keep in mind that Senator Rand Paul, a conservative, has already warned that if any Ukraine money is included in this package, he could potentially slow the process down. And because there's not much time to act, that is something that leaders want to avoid. If the Senate can unite and pass the bill, the question, of course, is will Kevin McCarthy put it on the floor? And every single day, we -- we give him this question. And this is what he said today when I pressed. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA):  I'm not going to take up hypotheticals of someday dreaming the Senate's going to do something. When they do something, come back and ask me. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
