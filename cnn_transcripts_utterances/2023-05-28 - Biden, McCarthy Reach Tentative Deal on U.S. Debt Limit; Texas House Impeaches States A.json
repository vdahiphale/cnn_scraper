(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MCCARTHY: After weeks of negotiations, we have come to an agreement in principle. We still have a lot of work to do, but I believe this is an agreement in principle that's worthy of the American people. It has historic reductions in spending, consequential reforms that will lift people out of poverty into the workforce, reign in government overreach.

You know, like any compromise, no side is going to be happy with the final product. It's a mishmash of priorities that's I think necessarily born more out of politics than thoughtful policy. I think mature voices on both sides realized that they were never going to get everything they wanted, that red lines were going to get blurred, that non-starters were going to go by the wayside. But, you know, of course, there are a lot of not very mature voices wielding clout in these discussions still, which is why we ended up in this situation in the first place.At the same time, you know, I think both sides can walk away and tell voters that they held their ground on the critical issues. And that's why I think that this will get over the finish line, which was always the goal. You know, Republicans can say broadly that they achieved deficit reduction. They can point to specific wins on work requirements for programs like food stamps. And Democrats can also say that they protected the most vital social programs. They can also point to particular victories, like avoiding overhauls of Medicaid. So the end, I think, hardline progressives, they might not forgive Biden for playing ball with McCarthy, and fiscal conservatives, they might resent McCarthy for caving too much to Biden.

You know, the fact that Donald Trump is weighing in, that other voices are weighing in from the Senate, often in conflicting ways, I think does pull him in lots of different directions.And the Republican Freedom Caucus, they given the power of Trumpism right now, I think hold a lot of clout. Even if their numbers are relatively small, their power is significant. And we saw that in the Speaker's debate. How much amplification of their voices was possible.

They've been used frequently, Paula, and they're quite easy to shoot down, but what they are intent to do, according to analysts here and indeed in the west, is to try to soak up Ukraine's air defense capabilities, particularly as Ukraine is continuing to prepare the ground for what is anticipated to be a significant summer offensive. So, there was one person killed by a falling debris from one of these Shahed so-?called drones. They're not really drones. They're not guided in the sense that they're not flown remotely, but they simply fly into the airspace and then fall with this warhead in front of them. But elsewhere in the country, there was also a very busy time in terms of cross-?border shelling, or cross-?frontline shelling, I should say, by the Russians of front-?line villages in the south of the country, and Kharkiv in the north was also hit. So, there is a sort of steady state of violence almost every night and day coming from Russia, sporadically, but it's clear really that at the moment it's the Ukrainians who have the initiative, not least, because they've been flagging this upcoming offensive, and the intent behind that is obviously to keep the Russians guessing, to try and get the Russians to over or misinterpret every military move, no matter how small the Ukrainians may make.

But then you've got the real-world truth behind it, which is that a relatively small number of Russian nationals fighting for Ukraine in the Ukrainian security services crossed into Russia and probed they, in fact, Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the Russian Mercenary Organization for -- in the Russian Mercenary Organization that's been fighting in Bakhmut. He said it was a reconnaissance by force. And I think that there is some truth to that. This was a movement into Russian territory, gauging the Russian reactions, working out what capabilities the Russians have to defend their borders in these potentially remote areas, timing the responses, working out where, if at all, counterattack would come from.

Just days before the U.S. government was expected to run out of cash and set off a global economic calamity, President Joe Biden and House Speaker McCarthy have reached a deal in principle to increase the debt limit. But as you can imagine, a number of lawmakers from both parties have raised concerns about this agreement, saying their demands were not fully met. Negotiators are now working on the final text, which would go to a vote. The House of Representatives, perhaps McCarthy says he could have that on the House floor by Wednesday. Now, the deal has a long way to go to get the approval of Congress. CNN's Manu Raju explains why there could be opposition on both sides of the aisle. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "After a furious round of negotiations and staring at the prospects of the first ever debt default in American history, the Speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy, reached a deal late Saturday with President Biden to raise the national debt limit and do that for two years' time. And also to include a range of other spending cuts and other policy concessions the Republicans had demanded, including paring back some social safety net programs that had been central to their efforts here.But the White House conceded on that, of those accounts. They ultimately shook hands, reached an agreement in principle, and now the real challenge begins, because there is pushback. Some conservatives do not believe this bill went far enough. They believe that it is a retreat of sorts from the Republican position, demanding even deeper spending cuts. This proposal would cut spending, go back to 2023 levels of federal spending. Republicans wanted to go back. Some of the conservatives wanted to go back to 2022 levels. But the White House had conceded substantially on that approach. They did not want any cuts whatsoever as part of this agreement. On the Democratic side, many did not want any sort of work requirements on social safety net programs like food stamps. Also, they had furiously opposed any spending cuts and so expect some opposition from Democrats now. Kevin McCarthy, in speaking to reporters in the immediate aftermath of this deal, said that a vote would occur on Wednesday, then the bill text would be released on Sunday. That gives them some 72 hours essentially to begin to lock down the votes. The question is going to be, how many Republicans will defect? We do expect several dozen Republicans, at least 35 at the moment, warning they will vote against it, that a number is expected to grow. But how many more will vote against this plan? And Kevin McCarthy keep a majority of his conference behind it. That is the hope and the expectation at the moment from Republican leaders. But that does not mean that's enough to pass the House. They will need to get support from Democrats. The number of House Democrats who are concerned about this bill will have to be convinced to vote for it. We do know that the House Democrats are going to get briefed by White House officials on Sunday. That'll be part of the White House effort to try to get their members in line. Can they get that coalition together, get it through the House by Wednesday? And then they have to worry about the United States Senate, which can take time to get any legislation through, several days, sometimes up to a week, depending on how members respond to this bill. So still some major questions despite the significant agreement that was reached late after these frantic negotiations, still uncertain whether they can get there and avoid nation's first ever debt default by June 5, the deadline for Congress to get the bill through both chambers and get it signed into law.

CNN's Carolyn Manno joins us now from New York with more. Carolyn, I mean, you can hardly believe your eyes when it's happening, right? You're looking at the clock. You're looking at the basket. Looking at the clock. So stressful for all the fans.",

      "sentences": "It really was, Paula. It was incredible. Because when the Celtics faces four straight elimination scenario, few thought that they could even put themselves in position and make history. I mean, a team gets down by three games and you think this thing is over. But they did it in the most dramatic way possible. That had all of our jaws on the ground. Boston up by two with less than 10 seconds to go. And Jimmy Butler got hot at the right time, had the ball for Miami, got forced into the corner, had to throw up this wild shot. He got fouled by Al Horford. So Butler, who struggled all game long, calmly sinking all free throws, giving Miami the lead, and then this was the end of the game here. Incredible, after a timeout, Derrick White inbounding for the Celtics. He passes to Marcus Smart. The three pointer comes up short, but nobody covers White. And he was able to grab this putback and let go of the ball just before the clock hits zero. Incredible awareness as the Celtics win 104 to 103, becoming just the fourth NBA team to ever force a Game 7 after being in a three-game hole to start the series. So it is winner take all, as you said Monday night. And, oh, by the way, it's back in Boston.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Check out this incredible save by Adin Hill, diving, losing his stick to stuff, the shot that would have given Dallas the lead. Hill couldn't stop Malvo (ph), unfortunately, and Ty Dellandrea put up two goals in the third period. So the Stars win four to two in this. They end up forcing that Game 6 back in Dallas tomorrow night. Had to get it done, and they did.And lastly this morning for you, this is a remarkable story in England that sounds like it's right out of Wrexham, Luton Town, punching their ticket back to the top flight of football with a dramatic win over Coventry City. It went down to penalties. So after being relegated in 1992, falling all the way to the fifth tier and being stuck there for nine years, the Hatters are finally going to make their long-awaited Premier League debut next season, along with $200 million congratulations as well. And just looking ahead for you, Paula. This is the biggest day of the year in motor racing as well, so a lot to look forward to today. It all begins with Formula One's crown jewel, the Monaco Grand Prix. It is absolutely beautiful there. It has been all weekend. And two-time reigning champ and points leader Max Verstappen is the man to beat, earning his first ever poll in Monaco. Flag drop at 09:00 a.m. Eastern for that. So that's coming up in just a couple of hours here stateside and then at 06:00 p.m., it the longest race of the NASCAR season, the Coca-Cola 600, with William Byron starting first in Charlotte, North Carolina. The 75th Anniversary of NASCAR this year, so that's always a big deal. And then sandwiched in between at 1:00 Eastern, it's the greatest spectacle in racing. And that is the 107th edition of the Indianapolis 500. And you've got Spain's Alex Palou getting his first poll at Indy as well. And also Britain's Catherine Legge, who is back in the field for the first time since 2013. She is actually one of just nine women ever to compete in the Indy 500. A century of history, and there's only been nine. And this year, she became the fastest ever woman to qualify for the Indy 500, outracing all three of her male teammates. But she did tell our Don Riddell earlier this week that she would simply prefer to be known as the fastest driver, period. [05:55:02] (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CATHERINE LEGGE, QUALIFIED 30TH FOR INDIANAPOLIS 500: When you set out racing, you don't set out to be a trailblazer or a role model or any of those things, right? You are focused on Catherine and being the best race car driver that I can be, and then at some point comes a realization that you are a role model, and with that comes responsibility. So while I don't set out to do that, I do appreciate that that's what happens. And a lot of young girls accept me. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
