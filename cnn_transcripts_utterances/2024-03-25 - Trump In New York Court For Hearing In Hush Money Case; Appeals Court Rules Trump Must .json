The judge overseeing the case is expected to set a court date after Trump allegedly bribed a porn star to cover up their affair years ago.Meantime, his meticulously crafted image as a real estate tycoon also at risk, Trump's assets including his, quote, babies, as he calls them, could be seized if you can't make a nearly half billion dollar bond payment in the 11th hour. May, I guess I suppose it's the 12th and the 13th hour right now. Our coverage begins with the hush money hearings. CNN's Kaitlan Collins is live in New York outside of the courthouse. Kaitlan, pretty big day for Donald Trump. I mean, obviously, we could hear a hearing date and a trial date for this Alvin Bragg case to get going. But the prospect that some of these properties is you and I've covered Trump for a long time, it just -- it's almost unthinkable that authorities in New York could be going after these properties, but we might be here.",

His wealth has always been at the center of that, something he campaigned on in 2016 and took him into the White House and something that is now at real threat. But Jim, obviously his attorneys are not, that is not the fullest issue that they are dealing with right now. Because those same attorneys are inside this courthouse behind me here in Manhattan, as we are waiting to see if the judge here, Judge Juan Merchan, decides when this case could go forward. This is the criminal hush money probe that was supposed to begin today, but was delayed because of documents that were not turned over to Trump's legal team.They are accusing the district attorney's office of a violation here. And that is the heart of what they're arguing about right now inside the courtroom behind us. We have CNN's Paul Reid and Kristen Holmes here with me. And Paula, we're getting live updates from inside the courtroom. And it's actually getting quite testy in there where the judge has just raised his voice for the first time as he is pressing Trump's legal team about what is a pretty extraordinary allegation that they are making against the district attorney's office.",

      "sentences": "That's right. They have accused the district attorney's office of professional misconduct, prosecutorial misconduct. They've even suggested that they should be sanctioned. And the judge said, look, that's a, quote, incredibly serious, unbelievably serious accusation, not only are you accusing the prosecutor's office of misconduct, but you're also trying to make me the judge complicit in it.And he pressed the Trump legal team to come up with some case law, some specifics to support this allegation, because the reason we're here today for this hearing, and not for the first day of the trial is that federal prosecutors handed over hundreds of thousands, assuming 100,000 documents. Now, that was not the Manhattan district attorney that did that, those are federal prosecutors. So the judge here is pressing the Trump attorneys on why you can accuse the Manhattan District Attorney's Office of prosecutorial misconduct because the Justice Department didn't hand something over. Now, the Trump attorneys argue that the district attorney's office should have pushed for these documents themselves, they should have asked for these specific materials. And they're having a pretty intense exchange now with the judge. You know, again, this is the first time the judge has really raised his voice, saying the fact that they don't even have any case law to support this very serious accusation is, quote, really disconcerting. So our colleagues tell us that the judge, Judge Juan Merchan, he has been pretty level throughout the hearing. But he's gotten a lot more animated. And it's interesting, because this shows that he is not going to tolerate just these throwaway accusations that someone is corrupt, right, or that they're engaging in misconduct. And he is holding their feet to the fire, asking for actual proof, support, case law for this accusation. So this is significant, and maybe a preview of how the judge will handle this trial.",

But the judge is pushing back on that saying no, it's actually not, he calls them the people because they represent the people of Manhattan, the people's job to do this. And I think this is important, because this is showing that the judge, not only is he upset at the fact that they've made this accusation and cannot support it.He's really showing how he's going to handle a criminal trial here. He's not going to allow the Trump team to get away with making accusations. They cannot support with facts or case law. And that is significant, because as we've reported so many times, this is part of defending the former president. You are not only playing for either a judge or jury, you're also playing for your client and playing to your client often.

Right now, the case is adjourned until mid-April, it's unclear if the case will start in mid-April, if they'll get a little bit more time if they will do 30 days from March 25th. The math is not exactly clear where he's going to land.But really at the heart of this is this question of why did you just get these documents now? And of these, how many are really relevant?

They instill are telling me that they're going to probably likely start the campaign for just Wednesdays and Saturdays, the days that they're not in court, because eventually this trial is going to start. This was huge for them. They were happy about it. Now you're seeing they're kind of pushing the envelope. And it sounds like the judge believes they're pushing the envelope here.

You are accusing the jurisdiction and the people of the jurisdiction of committing some sort of misconduct against this person.If you do not have a way to back it up, you should not say it. And this is a distinction between the Court of Public Opinion and a court of law. We're the judge going to say, well, what do you have to support this? It's not a tweet. It's not a Truth Social. It is a courtroom where you're telling me that they have withheld documents from you intentionally with an eye towards taking away your due process and your fair trial. If you don't have then you cannot say it. And so this judge is already telling us that they intend to insure it, this will be done by the book, you've already gotten one delay, but a delay based on nonsensical rhetoric or hyperbole or simply a lie is not going to cut it nor should it.",

I mean this is, as Laura said, this is not the political campaign trail where you just say whatever you want, fire off whatever you want, and it sort of plays itself out. You have to back up what you whatever you say here.And the key question that the judge seems to be focusing on is, was this some sort of intentional withholding of documents or was it inadvertent? And I will tell you that this type of problem where prosecutors realize sort of late in the game, whoops we have all these extra documents, we should turn over. It's not great, but it happens quite frequently, because you're responsible as a prosecutor for everything in your possession. Now, that's been expanded over the years to include, for example, police officers, FBI agents, who you may be working with. And I think the question this judge is probing is, does it include holding the state prosecutors responsible for what the Feds had across the street?

And every prosecutor wants to ensure that the next case they prosecute will also be given the same credibility and integrity aside as this one.And so this judge is not going to likely allow for simply a statement that is inaccurate or unsubstantiated to say, all right, well, you know what, because it could have happened, I'll indefinitely give you a delay.",

Jean Carroll defamation case, which has already secured a bond for more than $90 million, which is, I think, hampering his liquidity a little bit right now I would presume, is consequences, right?It is a different ballgame in the court of law. And I feel like we've been talking about this or around this over the course of the last several months, because it hasn't actually been happening. We saw it play out the defamation case. We saw it play out in the New York Attorney General's case, where he lost that case, when it came to fraud. When he's in a courtroom, the antics don't play, the lies can't stand up. And there are consequences for trying to play that game. And I think while this is certainly a more micro scale, you're seeing in a maybe a less hyperbolic way that we see on Truth Social. This is why this moment is different than perhaps what we've seen over the course of the last 10 or 11 months. Yes, politically, he has found a way to benefit from something that no politician should ever be able to benefit from. And there's no question about that. He's steamrolled to the Republican nomination. But it becomes different when he ends up in court when he's dealing with a judge, when his lawyers have to either defend his statements or try to, or try and play off his statements in a legal setting where they simply cannot.

We were essentially under the impression he had not come up with a, as you said, rabbit in the hat for the 11th hour that he was going to shift now to this idea of whether or not Letitia James was going to start seizing these assets.The other thing to point out here, when they approached those 30 or so underwriters, one of the big complaints that they were essentially having was that underwriters don't usually go for this amount of nearly half a billion dollars, they were saying that the underwriters were saying, OK, we'll do 100 million, that's kind of our cap. Now, there's a little bit of wiggle room, right, $175 million, it's still an enormous amount of money, a lot closer to what they were willing to do in the first place, then that $464, $500 million mark.

And I think it's important to the extent without getting too deep into the financial weeds to explain why this is so important and why the initial bond that had been set was so extraordinarily difficult for him to be able to meet. It wasn't just that it was $465 million, which was the judgment, it was that the way insurers work to underwrite that they almost without fail require 120 percent of the bond itself. So that pushed it over $550 million.The poll was also made, I think it's by Kaitlan or by Kristen, that these insurers themselves usually aren't trying to go over $100 million. It is not normal. The size of this, there's not a lot of precedent, when it comes particularly to an individual and a very small company. This isn't some massive public company that has huge revenues, has huge access to credit lines at major banks, most Donald Trump's banking relationships at all but disintegrated over the course of the last several years. And so not only is while Donald Trump is liquid, he's not that liquid, they're requiring cash and cash equivalents. They're saying no to any property, most Donald Trump's value is in property. What this allows by reducing this by about $300 million, giving them 10 days to find it is, one, he has cash. He's made clear he has cash and cash equivalents. And actually for Donald Trump, the records actually back that up. So he does have some cash. The other thing that's really interesting here, and Elie was talking about this last week, there's -- the Truth Social element of this, there's the merger that closed last week or is in the process of closing, could start trading as a public company by Tuesday or Wednesday of this week. While those shares which are worth billions of dollars for Donald Trump would technically be under a lockup agreement for six months, you wouldn't be able to use it. You wouldn't be able to sell them. He may be able to get a waiver to take out a loan against them right now, that would be impossible without waiver. If the board gives him a waiver, that's another avenue, significantly less money more time, and opens up some options that perhaps didn't exist.",

But the amount of the bond he has to post has been cut by more than in half. And here comes the appeals court at the 11th hour and 59th minute and 59th second, to give him this huge reduction. I just read through the order issued by the Court of Appeals. It's two pages long. There's next to nothing in terms of here's why we've come in with this huge reduction.But the fact that they've issued a substantial reduction, it happens. There are other cases we've seen where courts of appeals have come in and reduced bonds amounts by more than this, by 80, 90 percent. There is some I think, implicit judgment in here that the amount of the bond, the full $500 plus million was unnecessary or excessive. It's not necessarily the passing judgment on the case as a whole. But what the Court of Appeals is saying is we the court system will be fine with a bond of $175 million.",

In order to actually go through the appellate process for Trump, he had to have posted this bond. Now many would look at this issue and say, well, hold on a second. That doesn't seem fair inherently that you have to resolve this money prior to the full appeal process happening. So that ticket with legislature if that's your issue, by the way in the court rules, but there's -- the court is likely saying right now, we are confident that with this amount of money, that there is enough there to support that he can go forward with the procedural aspects of the appeal.I wouldn't read the tea leaves to suggest that they think that Engoron was wrong in his ultimate ruling, or that the proportionality is so skewed.

This isn't a criminal hush money probe that was supposed to start today was then delayed because documents were not turned over to Trump's legal team in sufficient time, they argued. And now it has become the point of intense questioning inside this courtroom.CNN's Kara Scannell was in there for all of it. And Kara is this questioning was going on, what can you describe to us about what questions the judge had for Trump's team and what the exchange was like as well as Trump's demeanor as all of this was playing out?",
