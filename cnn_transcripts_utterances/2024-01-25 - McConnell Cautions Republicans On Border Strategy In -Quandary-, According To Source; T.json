McConnell has been pushing hard to get this deal done because Republicans have insisted there must be a deal on immigration and the border first before they agree to more funding for Ukraine at a critical time in the war against Russia.But because Trump has come out publicly and privately, lobbying against any sort of immigration deal that is not, \"Exactly what Republicans have demanded\". There are fears on Capitol Hill that that essentially could scuttle the process, entirely derail this national security package. And that is the message that Republicans are grappling with this morning, including one, Senator Mitt Romney, who made very clear that he believes that Donald Trump is simply urging members to kill this because he wants to campaign on the issue of immigration.

Funding for Ukraine. Funding for Israel. Funding for Taiwan. All we're supposed to tie together in this massive package, including this new border policies that they hope to get out of the Senate as soon as this week, and then try to get it over to the House where the politics are even more complicated over there, given the Republican- led House and the alliance of the GOP leaders there with Trump.

McConnell was trying to make the point that Trump tried to get these things while he was in office and couldn't do it because of Democratic opposition. Now, Democrats have moved, he says, towards a Republican position on this issue. And they say that this is the opportunity to get this deal at this key moment, particularly as Joe Biden recognizes his own vulnerability on immigration. But the politics is so complicated here and the fear among Trump and his allies that cutting a deal could give Joe Biden something to campaign on clearly driving the negotiations, clearly driving the political reality and the legislative outlook here on this major issue.

They are -- wealth is up after adjusting for inflation. And prices have come down over the past year. Gas is now down below $3 in most of the country, and around $2.50 in many parts of the country.

It's giving up alcohol for the month.With us now, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta. Sanjay, my question to you, do I need a drink? And how has that advice changed if I had asked you that question five or 10 years ago? DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, I don't know for you, John, whether you personally need a drink. The advice, though, if you talk to most major medical societies, and you're not going to want to hear this, is that no amount of alcohol is good for your health. But before I explain that, let me just tell you, if you go back and look over the last 100 years, the advice has changed considerably. But take a look at this graph here, John, I think you will find this interesting. This is from 100 years ago, back 1920. And this is what really launched this idea of a little bit of alcohol can be beneficial. This is what's called the J curve, I don't know how well you can see that, but basically it shows that between, you know, just one drink to about 2.5 drinks, mortality is actually lower. It's below that baseline of mortality, suggesting that a little bit of alcohol can be helpful. So, that was sort of conventional wisdom for a long time, John, really up until like the 1980s where you started to see studies for the first time coming out and saying, hey, look, there seems to be an association between alcohol consumption and things like cancer, things like stroke. It got a little confusing again a few years later because of something known as the French paradox, John. The idea that the French are eating saturated fats, they're smoking, they're not exercising that much, and their mortality is still low. Why? Well, they said maybe red wine is the, sort of, reason why. But over the last 10 years, to your question, John, the evidence has really started to accumulate that there's all these associations with other types of cancers. And now where you hear most of the medical community, sort of, landing on this is no amount of alcohol is good for your health. Let me show you something else that I dug up for you. If you go back about 100 years, just after prohibition, how have American attitudes towards alcohol changed or not changed? Sort of interesting, that's that line there, John. It's about the same. It hasn't changed that much, which is really interesting. So, about a third of Americans totally abstained, two thirds will drink some, some more than others. But that has, sort of, stayed the same. Dry January, let me just answer that part of the question here. I find this really interesting that if you stop drinking for a little bit of time, it does seem to have significant benefits. I worry about heart disease myself. Having a dip in alcohol consumption can lower your blood pressure, but also all the things you see on the screen. Liver enzymes go down, sleep and your diet improves, and the bad habits start to improve as well. John.",
