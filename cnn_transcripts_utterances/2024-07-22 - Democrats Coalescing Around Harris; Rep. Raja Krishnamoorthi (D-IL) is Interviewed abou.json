There were so many effecting movements attacking Joe Biden over his Afghanistan record from the families of the soldiers who died there. And those were some of the moments that are now going to be more difficult to attack senator - or Vice President Harris over. And we're going to get our first glimpse at the campaign's message going forward later today. Senator JD Vance will be holding an event behind me in Middletown, Ohio. This is the town he grew up in. It's where the setting was of \"Hillbilly Elegy,\" his - his memoir and the Hollywood movie. And so we're going to see him for the first time step out on the campaign trail on his own.

This obviously comes off the tails of last night when you saw a number of rank and file Democrats swiftly coming out, both to celebrate Biden's legacy and then turn their attention on the fact that they will do everything in their power to try to elect Kamala Harris to be the next president of the United States.You also, this morning, are hearing those two top Democratic leaders in the House, both Peter Aguilar and Catherine Clark, coming out in support of Harris. And I want to read briefly part of Aguilar's statement. He says, quote, \"make no mistake, this election will be the fight of our lives. The American people have a clear choice. We can restore reproductive freedom for millions of women living under a cruel abortion ban, continue to lower everyday costs and ensure the American economy works for every family in every zip code, or we can re-elect Donald Trump, who will sign a national abortion ban into law, eliminate the $35 a month insulin guaranteed to our seniors and roll back thousands of American clean energy jobs.\" As you noted, John, we are still waiting for word from both Leader Jeffries and Leader Schumer over in the Senate to see whether or not they will endorse Harris this morning. Our colleague, Dana Bash, had reporting yesterday that they had been holding off in part because they wanted members, the rank and file, as well as voters, to have an opportunity to sort of reflect on what they wanted next. Now that so many Democrats are swiftly coming out in support of Harris, though, that may change quickly. Lawmakers are back in Washington in the House starting this evening. The Senate returns tomorrow. But, John, obviously, we have seen a lot of endorsements coming out over the last 24 hours for Harris.",

Harris only down by a point. Trump was only up by a point.We see the same pattern in Virginia. Biden, led by three points. But look at that, Harris did better, plus five. So, we see that Harris overall seems to be doing about two points better in these key battleground states.

When you're an embattled incumbent, and in some ways they're each embattled incumbents, we can talk a little bit more about that in Kamala Harris, you want to make the race about the other person. And Trump had successfully done that. And primarily because of Biden's age.Some of the issues remain the same. But their message was, the world's out of control. Biden's not in command. He's weak. Trump is strong. Vote for Trump. And they were having success with that. More complicated now because Kamala Harris is far younger than Trump. She's energetic. She can take the case to Trump. And she - though she - they will try and tie her to Biden's record, certainly on issues like immigration, she isn't Joe Biden and she can, in some ways, craft her own message and go on the attack. So, this is a race that the Trump campaign didn't want. They may prefer her to someone completely unknown who would be harder to caricature in the way they want a caricature her. But they didn't want this race. They thought they had it won. They had built a whole campaign around Joe Biden. Now Joe Biden is gone, its complicated.",

And that is an aspect of her that I think she should lean into. She should have her own perspective on how to - how to address issues like the border. But I think, more importantly, she needs to shift the issue debate to issues that favor her. Clearly on the issue of abortion rights, she's going to be there. She's been the administration's spokesperson on that.But there are a lot of sort of middle-class, working class economic issues on which Democrats are in one place and Donald Trump is in a different place. And it's not on the side of working class people, whether, you know, it's taxes or regulation or any other - any other - any number of others whose health care, pharmaceuticals, and she needs to go on the attack here and she has the capability to do it.
