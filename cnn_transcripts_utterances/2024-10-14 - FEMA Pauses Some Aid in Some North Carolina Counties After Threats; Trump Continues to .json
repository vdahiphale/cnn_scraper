And then just about an hour later, Parsons was located and then arrested in his car outside of a grocery store that's being used right now as a relief site where people are getting donations, people are getting food. He had a couple firearms on him, including a rifle.And as you mentioned, he has now been charged with going armed to the terror of the public, a misdemeanor. We don't know. The sheriff's office has not said that he was there specifically at that point to harm FEMA workers, but it was enough that FEMA called back a lot of its crews. Said we do not want these response teams going door-to- door. You are only to work in secure facilities where you have security around you. And that is currently the situation right now. That's because they're worried about these threats.",

But again, it speaks to the heightened level of concern FEMA, these workers have been dealing with harassment, dealing with threats. And so it is -- it took very little for them to say, we are now on high alert and we do not want people just out in these communities without security and safety.",

Trump has been saying for weeks that the Biden- Harris administration is failing the people in North Carolina.His not so subtle claim is that Democrats are letting Republicans die on social media sites like X, a little bit further down the funnel. There are crazy conspiracy theories about FEMA workers trying to hurt citizens, maybe even trying to kill people. Those crazy conspiracy theories. It is a little bit like a game of telephone, online rumors that spread and spread and spread. But the funnel is all connected. And Trump at the top of the funnel makes those conspiracy theories more believable.

I always think about that slogan, even in this age of social media, in the disinformation age, where in a very poisoned environment, have more information, right? The government is trying in this case, for example, the FEMA administrator to get out accurate information to dispel some of the lies.But lies and liars and lawbreakers oftentimes win in the court of public opinion. So ultimately, these cases have to fall to actual physical courts. Think about January 6th and the huge federal response trying to hold people accountable for those crimes. Most of the accountability for those lies has been in the actual court system. I think that's why it was important to see this arrest today as well in North Carolina. It's another example of how to hold people accountable when disinformation actually leads to real world harm.",

They have no plans to bulldoze your communities that have been affected here.They have not given away all FEMA relief money to undocumented immigrants. And again, this is a Republican congressman in this area. But this is what people are hearing. And look, there's also a major concern, not just for the safety of these FEMA employees, not just for the people who are now maybe going to have to wait longer because of issues of delays now that FEMA's work had to stop a little bit.

But these are six brand-new lawsuits just filed today coming from Houston-based attorney Tony Busby, who I interviewed a few weeks ago.You may remember, this was the attorney who alleged that he had at least 120 victims that were going to come forward with suits against Combs. And these are the first six of these suits that he alleged and told us that he was going to be filing. Now, one of these lawsuits comes from a John Doe, who alleges that he was 16 years old at the time. He says that in 1998, that he was at a white party, one of Diddy's infamous parties in the Hamptons in New York. And he alleges that he was sexually assaulted by Combs there. Now, another lawsuit coming from a Jane Doe, who alleges that she was 19 years old. She was a college student. She alleges that she was raped by Combs back in 2004 at an after-party for a photo shoot in a hotel room. Another one of these suits, an allegation coming from 1995 from another Jane Doe, who says that she was violently attacked by Combs, who in this suit, she alleges, threw her up against a wall so that she fell and was hurt. And that is when he raped her, according to this allegation. Now, as you said, these coming from both men and women. There are four John Does, two Jane Does in these six new lawsuits. Again, no comment yet from Combs, but I do want to state that he has denied all wrongdoing from these civil suits that have come out. By my count, I believe that we now have 18 civil suits that are against Combs, but there is one that has been settled. That is the one that came from his ex-girlfriend, Cassie, back in November of last year.",

And is it possible that over billions of years life has formed in those oceans and perhaps there's a complex ecosystem there?

But, you know, that's probably 100 years from now being able to do that.So what we'll do now is we're going to orbit, you know, send this spacecraft and have it get very close as it flies around the moon, Europa. And we're going to look for cracks in the ice. And we see that. It's like icebergs, you know, that are constantly shifting, buckling. And we think that there's water upwelling, you know, through the ice and forming new ice -- sorry, from the ocean to the top of the ice. And that may carry chemical signals of what's going on below. So this first step is to, as the spacecraft passes, do deep spectroscopic imaging, all kinds of scientific instruments, to tell something about what's going on in the surface of the ice. And maybe that'll tell us what's going on 10 miles below.",

You know, one of the most dominant theories of how life formed on Earth was deep in the oceans in what we call deep-sea thermal vents, places where magma from deep in the Earth, the heat comes up. And then all with that heat, when it reaches the ocean bottom, it comes up and you get all kinds of chemical shenanigans there, which may have started biochemistry.So on Europa, because the gravity of Jupiter is so strong, you're constantly squishing the inside of Europa like a silly putty. So that means you have a lot of heat being generated. So you could get these deep-sea thermal vents in Europa, you know, at the bottom of that 100- mile deep ocean, and maybe the same processes happen there. So it's really possible that life may have formed inside these, at the bottom of these oceans. And then, who knows?",
