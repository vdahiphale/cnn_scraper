Today we're asking, with the Democratic convention now two days away, can Kamala Harris distinguish herself enough from President Biden without alienating his supporters?Then, friendly fire, Donald Trump's latest foot and mouth moment, which could cost him support from those who honor our nation's greatest heroes. And later, from tacky to trendy, the surprising comeback for a fashion item and a word people have hated for years. The panel is here and ready to go. So sit back, relax, and let's talk about it. Up first, at the Democratic convention next week, Kamala Harris has to pull off a delicate maneuver, showing she intends to build on Joe Biden's record without breaking from it, all part of an effort to carve her own path without coming off as disloyal.

In some ways that blank canvas, Natasha, that you were talking about, at the time when she was vice president it was sort of seen as a bad thing, right? The administration, do they not trust her? Why are they not putting her out there on things? What has she actually done for the last four years? But that is now, weirdly enough, allowing her to have this break, to be this person who is her own person on issues like the economy where voters were trusting Donald Trump over Joe Biden by huge margins. Now, she's running much closer to Donald Trump.So by having this opportunity at the convention to introduce herself. It's a big, important moment. And if it is overshadowed by chaos, that makes voters think, oh look, Democrats can't even control their own convention.

I mean, that's the objective of protests, right? They want attention, they want there to be accountability. There is a huge portion of the younger part of the Democratic Party that is very upset by what's happening. And that's why I think you're seeing the clock ticking right now in terms of what's happening in Israel and the ceasefire. I mean, I think there's a real push to try and make that ceasefire happen as quickly as possible to try and dampen these protests. But at the end of the day, I think those images of chaos, if chaos there are, will be damaging to the Democratic Party. That said, protest is part of what makes America what America is.
