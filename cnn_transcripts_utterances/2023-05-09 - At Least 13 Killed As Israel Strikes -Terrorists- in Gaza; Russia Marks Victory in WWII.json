These batteries behind me, they launched interceptors tried intercept rockets before they managed to reach populations centers in southern Israel.All of this took place as a surprise overnight around 2:00 a.m., is when the Israeli military operation taking place. The Israeli military and Islamic jihad saying at least three other commanders were taken out. These are people, everything ranging for the commander-in-chief of the al Quds brigade, who have been wanted, the Islamic jihad, for more than 20 years, to others who are considered a senior commanders not only considered responsible for rocket launchers, but operations in the West Bank targeting Israeli troops and Israelis. The Israeli military saying that they took them out, also especially after last week's more than 100 rockets were fired by Islamic jihad in Israel after the death of a prominent Palestinian prisoner who is once a spokesperson for the Iranian-backed militant group. He died after an 86-day long under strike. The Israeli military responded initially to those more than 100 rockets, but no major damage or takeouts were reported. And that, obviously, changed last night. The Israeli military said they had been planning this for sometime. Now, the question will be, of course, what will be the retaliation. As you noted, 13 people in total died. Among those commanders, including some of their family members, including four children and at least four women. Islamic jihad and Hamas have vowed a retaliation of some sort. The funerals have just taken place. Everyone is essentially waiting for that response. The Israeli military has called up reservists. They have also told Israeli residents in this area, in southern Israel, to stay close to their shelters. Things like schools have been canceled in preparation for what the response will be. But, the biggest question will be Hamas and whether Hamas who runs the Gaza Strip, the Israeli military says nothing happens in Gaza without his knowledge, whether they will get involved, because if they do, this will turn into a much, bigger and much longer conflict. If you remember in August, there was a 2 to 3-day long conflict between the Israeli military and Islamic jihad. Hamas stayed on the sidelines then. That may be a different story today and that is what everyone is waiting to see. What will the response be and will Hamas get involved -- Christine.",
