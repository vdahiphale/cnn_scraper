Until this morning, we really hadn't seen any cracks at all. Until this morning.This was Congressman Mike Quigley, who spoke with Kasie Hunt on CNN a short time ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE QUIGLEY (D-IL): But I think he has to be honest with himself. This decision he's going to have to make. And he clearly has to understand I think what you're getting to hear is that his decision not only impacts who's going to serve in the White House the next four years, but who's going to serve in the Senate, who's going to serve in the House, and it will have implications for decades to come. But we have to be honest with ourselves that it wasn't just a horrible night. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But to, you know, I think the campaign had put out a statement once. It was just a bunch of bedwetters and angry podcasters. And I think that's not a great thing. So, I think what Mike's saying there is not necessary, you know, Joe Biden needs to get out, but what he's saying is, you've got to address this head-on because this is in the American people's soul right now.

So, you need to find out where that weaknesses is and what happened on the debate. You know, what is it that people are seeing and how do you - how do you counter that? Because Joe Biden has got to beat Donald Trump.I mean Donald Trump has been - and the Supreme Court yesterday basically said that Donald Trump can do whatever he wants to stay in power now or - or when he's in office.

I look at it and I say, look, Joe Biden had a bad night. He is - he has every right to stay in as the nominee because he won that nomination. So, it's a decision all the Democrats have to make.From my perspective, whoever runs, and right now it's Joe Biden and probably will be Joe Biden in November, whoever runs has got to beat Donald Trump and will be far better than Donald Trump. And this is my only advice to the campaign. And I'll tell him this one on one too, which is, continue to prosecute the case for why Donald Trump would be awful for this country and why Joe Biden would be better.

But generally, you know, people cross party lines.This - this, yesterday, I don't understand. This - this surprised many people. What it's basically said is that if you're president of the United States, you can do anything. And even if ultimately it is determined that it doesn't fall under immunity, you have - immunity is - is -- presumed immunity, which means that somehow however to prosecute that president, you have to go through a whole court system to say it's not real immunity because its presumed at the beginning. I think they - they made a terrible mistake. They have potentially allowed whoever comes to office at some point that is bad, they've allowed them to take advantage of a system that our founding fathers never intended.

They were thrown into the ceiling panels. One man, you can see him there, had to be pulled out of overhead luggage. That bin there.

Air Europa says 30 passengers received what they call minor injuries. According to reports, Brazilian public health officials say passengers got head, neck, and chest injuries. Want you to listen now to one of the passengers who was on board this flight. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAXIMILIANO, AIR EUROPA FLIGHT PASSENGER (through translator): From one moment to the next, the plane destabilized and went into a dive. The people who didn't have seat belts went up in the air and hit the ceiling, and they got hurt. Those who had seat belts on, not so much. Then we landed here as an emergency. They helped us on the runway. We were on the plane for three or four hours without being able to move. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "We'll get to the part about seat belts in a second. But the question for investigators now will be how this happened since airlines are getting better at forecasting turbulence all the time.It's an invisible phenomenon to pilots. Onboard radar can detect some of the major causes, like thunderstorms. Though important to note here, our CNN whether team says there were no thunderstorms in the area at the time. There's also mountain wave turbulence, which creates shearing columns of wind. There's wake turbulence, which is created by another airplane, just like the wake on a boat. Then there is clear air turbulence. That's the turbulence associated with none of those tale tales. The bumpy patches at high altitudes that are more frequent in the wintertime. Remember, Brazil is in the southern hemisphere and its wintertime right now. So, the big takeaway here for passengers, keep your seat belt buckled as much as you can. I know that's hard on a flight like this, 12 hours long. So, when you're up and walking around, going to the bathroom, stretching your legs, treat it like a bit of a risk. We're going into a huge period for international travel right now. But remember, the National Transportation Safety Board says turbulence is the number one cause of injuries on commercial flights. The good news is, the data says that U.S. airlines have become pretty good at avoiding it, and the passengers are following the rules, Sara.",
