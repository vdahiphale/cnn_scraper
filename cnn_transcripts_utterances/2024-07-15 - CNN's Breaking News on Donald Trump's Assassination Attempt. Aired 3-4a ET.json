I'm Rosemary Church and this is \"CNN Newsroom.\"Former U.S. President Donald Trump is speaking out after surviving an assassination attempt over the weekend, saying in a new interview, quote, \"I'm not supposed to be here. I'm supposed to be dead.\" His comments come as Trump prepares for the start of the Republican National Convention, kicking off in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in just a matter of hours from now. Trump says he has rewritten his convention speech to focus on unity, saying he believes this is a chance to bring the country together. The attempted assassination of a U.S. presidential candidate has shaken the country. The FBI says the motive for the shooting at this stage is still unknown. U.S. President Joe Biden is condemning the violence. In an address to the nation from the Oval Office late Sunday, he said it's time to come together and cool down the political rhetoric. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: Yesterday's shooting at Donald Trump's rally in Pennsylvania calls on all of us to take a step back, take stock of where we are, how we go forward from here. Thankfully, former President Trump is not seriously injured. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "It is not clear exactly how this happened, but the questions are certainly centering on the Secret Service's preparation and response, as well as many questions about the shooter. What we know right now is that this building where the shooter had climbed up onto and shot the former president from was outside the security perimeter.This building was about 150 yards from where the former president was speaking at the podium. And multiple law enforcement sources that I have spoken with have expressed real concern, real shock, that a building that close, 150 yards or so from the podium, was not included in what they call the hard perimeter, which means it would have been subjected to an extensive security sweep, that it would have required anybody trying to enter that building to go through a magnetometer. So many more questions there. Additionally, the big question, again, centering on this building, is in what way this building did factor into the overall security plan. So another question is whether or not the building was left out of the perimeter, because for whatever reason, the Secret Service decided that it did not present a security risk. For example, did they determine that the building was in, could not be accessed, that the doors were locked, that no one was inside, no one was likely to go inside. These are the questions that the service would have been asking as they assessed the site, as well as continuing to ask themselves in this extremely pivotal moment. The investigation is also shifting to the gunman here. This is 20- year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks. What we know now is that he was not known to the FBI, he was not in any databases, that he used an A.R.- style 5.56 rifle that belonged to his father that was purchased legally, and that law enforcement has his cell phone. And what they're trying to do now is get into that cell phone and get some insight into what his motivation was. That is the big question. And at this moment, it is not clear why he did this.

Well, forensic analysis of audio from Saturday's shooting suggests that as many as three weapons were fired. The first three shots were consistent with alleged weapon A. The next five were consistent with alleged weapon B. And the final acoustic impulse was emitted by a possible weapon C. That is according to experts at the National Center for Media Forensics at the University of Colorado. The FBI says that the shooter acted alone and sources told CNN that the gunman was killed by the Secret Service.

I know the designation of any political convention is called an NSSE, a national special security event. It's the highest elevated event in terms of planning. You get federal, state and local authorities working together. You have an incident commander. It's a very sort of long process, 12 to 14 to 16 months.And so it's a well-structured. So, in other words, it is secure. But the idea that you wouldn't respond or the Secret Service wouldn't respond to a new threat environment, which we're clearly in, seems odd to me. And I thought that that was just a weird first salvo by the Secret Service. Their job is to not only assure the protectee that they have his or her back, but that the American public can have confidence that what was once an elite law enforcement agency can perform its primary function to protect the people who represent the constitutional order, that they -- that they can continue to protect them.",

We're going to learn a lot more.I'm going to be a little bit cruel here. I think that the president should put the head of the Secret Service on leave. I think that they essentially had one job and they failed. And I think if this agency is going to move forward, people have to pay the consequences for it. You can't simply put this on. Oh, it was that agent or that agent. As I said, this was the -- this is their primary function and they failed. I think that if you can begin to -- to think about the Secret Service of getting new leadership and potentially, honestly, outside leadership, the Secret Service needs an outsider to come in and to really focus on what its primary duties are and what happened in this -- in this terrible incident.",

So why would you leave the one building? I mean, we've all seen the maps, the one building that looks basically out of a movie set in terms of it's you know, this is where the sniper is going to go. Right. If you saw that map. Right. Of course.And how come they could leave it so -- so open? Seems surprising to me. I think people have the wrong conception of what a security perimeter is. A security perimeter is really a crowd control perimeter. It says if you come into this area, you will get metal detectors or whatever kind of primary, secondary screening. That does not mean that what's outside the security perimeter is safe. It simply means that there are other layers of defense and security that go into place.

Violence in any form and anywhere must never prevail. (END VIDEO CLIP) SEBASTIAN: Now, Russia was the outlier when it came to those initial reactions, the Kremlin spokesman coming out and saying that, well, he didn't blame the current U.S. administration for what happened. They did, he said, create an atmosphere which essentially provoked this, this clearly an attempt, if not to heighten divisions in the U.S., at least to emphasize them, which serves Russia. But now, look, that we've seen the initial sort of shock settle down a little bit. The debate is being revived internationally about the relationship between media rhetoric, online rhetoric and actual physical violence. Here in the U.K., there was a pretty unfiltered tweet from the head of Reform U.K., Nigel Farage. Take a look at that. He said, mainstream media have spread a narrative of hatred against my friend Donald Trump. I hope they are proud of themselves, calling them disgusting people. So, look, he has an agenda there. But we've also seen a more sober debate on television here about how politicians can balance the needs of democracy, of getting out in the people and also their own safety. And in Israel as well, within hours of the news breaking through at a cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Netanyahu criticizing law enforcement in what he saw as failings in protecting him. Ministers were shown a video of clips of incitement against the prime minister and him saying essentially that, you know, people in the U.S. are saying that the writing was on the wall here. We see the writing on the wall in Israel. So he has already been criticized for that being self-serving. Obviously, he is fighting for his own political survival amid the war against Hamas. But I think this shows internationally that this has come in a context not only of a heightened political climate in the U.S., but also internationally.

Former President Donald Trump arriving in the city Sunday night with one of the biggest decisions yet to unfold. That, of course, is who he will name as his running mate. That is expected to take place Monday afternoon when Republican delegates from across the country gather in the Fiserv Forum here behind me to formally start nominating and voting for the delegates. Now, there is no question this campaign has changed dramatically given the events of the weekend. One question hanging over all of this convention and indeed the rest of the campaign is, will there be a sense for more unity from both sides? That was the plea of President Biden delivering an Oval Office address on Sunday night. And former President Donald Trump is conveying through his advisers he would also like to invoke themes of unity. Of course, that remains a very open question, giving the tenor and tone of this campaign so far. But there are some indications the program here is changing somewhat. Former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, one of the longest standing rivals of Donald Trump in the primary campaign. She has now been invited to give a speech here on Tuesday night. I'm told she will be invoking themes of unity for Republicans and indeed the country as well. There is no question that this is an entirely different moment in this campaign because of the assassination attempt. Former President Donald Trump will be greeted here as a hero by Republican delegates. Yes, it's his third Republican convention. But the one four years ago, of course, happened during a pandemic. And eight years ago, when he first won the nomination, the party was still divided.

And so Biden will probably be the nominee at this point, but he's a weak nominee and his opponent, former President Donald Trump, is getting stronger. And I think the combination of how, again, this unfolded, the unity surrounding the reaction to the assassination attempt culminating with a convention might really solidify Trump in a way that seemed impossible about a month or a month and a half ago to many Americans.",

And you can see Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer for The \"New York Times,\" Doug Mills, highlighted here. He was where he often is when news is happening in the front row. And he captured the chilling moment as a bullet whizzed past the former president's ear. Mills explained how the chaotic scene unfolded as he was capturing photos of Trump by the podium when he heard the gunshots.Our Kaitlan Collins spoke to Mills earlier. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DOUG MILLS, PHOTOGRAPHER, THE \"NEW YORK TIMES\": I guess I was, you know, trying to put him between the flag and the podium and photographing there. And then when he kind of gestured to his right and I heard the pops, you know, I don't have a gun, so I don't know what an A.R.-15 sounds like. Never heard one. I first I thought it was like a motorcycle or some sort of machinery. And then when I saw him grab his ear and he kind of winced and then immediately went down, I thought, oh, my God, he's been shot. I mean, I get chills saying it now. And it was there was so much adrenaline going on then. And once he went down, my first reaction was to run around to the side and try and get a picture of him down on the ground. And by that time I got there, he was completely covered by the Secret Service agents that are on his detail. And, you know, all the staff is yelling. The Secret Service is yelling at me, yelling at all the other photographers. There were four of us in the -- in the buffer zone, as you know. And it was pretty chaotic. And they just kept yelling, get down, active shooter, get down, get down, get down. And I probably didn't do the safest thing because I reacted and went straight to the stage and started shooting. Just, you know, shoot taking pictures just like a lot of the other photographers. KAITLAN COLLINS, \"THE SOURCE\" ANCHOR: Then you take this photo. I mean, this is the photo where in that red circle, that's what appears to be the bullet that ultimately pierced his ear. Did you know that you had no idea? MILLS: No, I mean, when I started looking through my Sony camera to try and transmit him back to the office, the first things I was thinking of is I got to get the pictures of him coming off stage, showing his bloody ear and that defiant fist pump that he gave.

We are really seeing two different paths of response from China.On one hand, we have the official government response that is expressing sympathy and concern to former President Donald Trump. Yet on the other hand, we have state media, which could be argued as a mouthpiece for the government, that's taking a much more critical view, a much more critical response to this incident in the United States, very much falling under this idea that President Biden brought up of foreign actors getting involved, fanning the flames. Let me show you some of the reaction that we are seeing in Chinese state media. First, an editorial that appeared in \"China Daily.\" It's an English publication by Chinese state media. The headline there reading Trump incident reflects U.S. polarization, divisions. Another headline piece in China's \"Global Times\", also state media. The headline there reading shooting at Trump rally shows rising political violence as U.S. divides further. This again, all serving as a tool for China to discredit the American political system to the Chinese population and to the world as a whole. I should also point out that we're seeing a lot of chatter, a lot of highlights on Chinese social media, which is typically heavily- censored by the Chinese government. For example, on Weibo, which is China's version of X or Twitter. We saw one response that said, what democracy and freedom? I now really think elections in other countries are not so different from talent shows; The world is but a circus. Another comment discrediting the American political system. People are also referring to this as a house of cards, referring to this unstable political environment in the United States, but also some more benign comments about gun violence in America and how this may bolster Trump's chances in the election. Some people felt that he came across looking strong after this. Others calling him lucky. Rosemary, this is just a sample of the social media and government response that we are witnessing here in Beijing.",

      "sentences": "We have new information now on the shooter's movements just before and during the assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump.CNN's analysis shows that the shooter was roughly 150 meters away from where Trump was standing at the time he started opening fire. That's less than 500 feet away from the former president. We're also told by Butler County Sheriff Michael Sloop that law enforcement officers, local police officers got word of suspicious activity on the rooftop around there and went and investigated it. At that point, according to the sheriff, one officer hoisted himself up to the ledge of this rooftop here, saw the gunman. The gunman saw the officer, according to the sheriff, and pointed his weapon at him. At that point, the sheriff had to drop down for his own safety because he was clinging to the ledge of the roof and did not. He was not able to draw his weapon to engage the shooter. So he had to drop down for his own safety. Also, we're told by a senior law enforcement official that just before the shooting, the shooter was seen acting somewhat suspiciously in the area of magnetometers. They would presumably be in these areas here. Not clear exactly where he was around these magnetometers, but according to a senior law enforcement official, he was acting somewhat suspiciously around the area of the magnetometers. The key question is, what was he doing? Was he probing for a possible shooting position? Was he on a recon mission that will be brought out in the investigation? Another piece of information that we're getting here is that this is according to Ben Maser, who is a witness who told CNN affiliate KDKA of the shooter's movements just before he took that position. According to Ben Maser, he saw the shooter move from roof to roof to roof in the moments before he took that position to take shots at the former president. So these had to have been these roofs here because this -- these buildings are all seemingly attached. If this witness saw the gunman moving from roof to roof to roof, it would have been right about there and these buildings right there. Also, we have some video of the gunman in the moments just after he was neutralized by law enforcement. The body of the gunman lying on the -- on the -- on the roof -- of the -- of that building where he was, and as we look at the post shooting scenes here, what I can show you is there are some scenes here of the chairs and the debris. But when we take a look at the grandstand, I'm going to pause the video for just a second here. You take a look at the grandstand. We have new information also from the governor of Pennsylvania, Josh Shapiro, who told us about the deceased victim, Corey Comperatore, a firefighter from Butler County. Corey Comperatore was in these grandstands. He might have been in this one here. We're not sure if he was in that one or possibly this one. But he was hit with gunfire and was killed. But according to the governor, Josh Shapiro, Corey Comperatore committed a very heroic act during the shooting. He dove on top of his own family to protect them from the shooting and, of course, was killed by a gunshot in the process. Again, we're trying to find out which of these grandstands Corey Comperatore was in when he was shot and killed. As we go back to the scene here, we were told that President Biden has ordered an independent review of the shooting. And according to our law enforcement analyst, Andrew McCabe, the most basic elements of securing an outdoor site, especially outdoors, is that you have to eliminate the sight lines to where a protectee is standing or speaking. A key component of this investigation is why was that sight line so close to the former president not eliminated? Brian Todd, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
