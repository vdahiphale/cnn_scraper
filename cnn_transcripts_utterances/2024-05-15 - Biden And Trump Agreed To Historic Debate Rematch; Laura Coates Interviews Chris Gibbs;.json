I'll explain.Also, tonight, we'll take you inside the other criminal trial in Manhattan. How Senator Bob Menendez is trying to explain away those gold bars and stacks of cash in his bribery trial. Plus, after years of silence, he tweeted one image and sent meme stocks soaring. The bizarre comeback of the one they call \"Roaring Kitty,\" tonight on \"Laura Coates Live.\" Well, it's one of the longest presidential campaigns ever. But who's counting? With the oldest candidates ever. Everyone is counting. And now, it'll feature the earliest debates ever. Welcome to the latest twist in this 2024 race. Donald Trump and President Biden have now agreed to face off in June and September. The June 27th debate will take place right here on CNN, long before any votes are cast. So, what's the reaction been like? Well, it's been sort of mixed. But listen to Senator Romney's view on all of it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MITT ROMNEY (R-UT): Well, the image that comes to mind is those two old guys on \"The Muppets,\" you know, that sat in the balcony.",

Maybe there's no reason to maybe thump one's chest.The CNN debate will be held in our own Atlanta studio with just the moderators, Jake Tapper and Dana Bash, present. And Biden's team wants the microphones to be cut off automatically when the time runs out to avoid interruptions. It's unclear if that's actually going to be agreed upon. Also, our microphones are really great, and so you could hear people who are next to you even when it's not your microphone. But, you know, details. The elephant in the 2024 race won't be in that room, though, at least for now. I'm talking about RFK Jr., who currently does not make the cut and has a pretty tough hill to climb to make that cut. He'd have to hit 15% in four national polls and be on enough ballots to maybe reach 270 electoral votes. And by the way, he's nowhere near that right now, but he claims that he will get there in time for at least the June, if not later, debate.

So, hold on to what you have because there's not enough, and be afraid of anybody who's trying to take it away from you.Instead of saying, you know what? There's plenty for everybody.

Let me ask you, though, finally, when you look at -- I mean, registered Republicans outnumber Democrats more than, I think, eight to one in your county. And I can't help but think your frustrations over tariffs, your frustrations about retribution as a priority as opposed to perhaps policy stances that could move a needle for your concerns.I wonder if you're alone in thinking and feeling those frustrations, even if your, you know, decision has been public. Are there more Chris Gibbs, you think, in your county?",

So, what we're doing is trying to get people out from hiding. You know, in Shelby County, the Democrats are in hiding. In these red rural counties, they're literally in hiding. I hear these stories every single week, about folks that are scared to put out a sign because they've got neighbors that are either legacy Republicans or some MAGA Republicans, for sure.So, what I have to do is get these people lifted up and get them out from hiding and tell what they're for. And that's what we're doing here in Shelby County. I tell people, hey, get in behind me. I'm just a farmer. They can't hurt me. I don't have a storefront to protect. Let's go. I'm self-made.

And while they're doing this, you see there's not a lot of running around. They manage their crossfire. And you'll note the guy in the rear, back by the back of the toll booth, you know, he's watching their flank. What you're seeing is almost Special Forces tactics. It's split-second timing, speed, the element of surprise, violence of action to overwhelm your opponents. And in just a couple of minutes, they are off the set, they are in their getaway cars, they set fire to the car they used here, which he's doing in a minute, and then they find the getaway car is burned out, which means they already had switched cars. They leave the highway. They take the local roads, avoiding the license plate readers and the cameras. They trained for this. They knew what they were doing.
