Trump has announced former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee to serve as the next U.S. Ambassador to Israel. Also, a short time ago, Trump officially announced Congressman Mike Waltz as his National Security Adviser pick.Sources tell CNN Trump's likely pick for Secretary of State is political rival turned fierce supporter Florida Senator Marco Rubio, who is a staunch China hardliner. And we're told that Trump's choice for Homeland Security Secretary will be South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem, who has been lockstep with Trump on immigration and will oversee its enforcement alongside border czar Tom Homan. And Trump's expected pick for Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy, Stephen Miller. Both of those figures key players in Trump's controversial family separation policy of his first term. Here with us now is CNN National Correspondent Kristen Holmes and CNN Senior White House Correspondent Kayla Tausche. And Kristen, I know you have some new reporting that Trump is actually expected to name a slate of these deputy chiefs of staff in the coming days. I know people might think, oh, secretary, that's a big role. Yes, it is. But this idea of deputy chief of staff, we should note, doesn't have to be confirmed. This could be very powerful.",

I am being told right now that they believe he's going to be deputy chief of staff of politics. We also have heard Dan Scavino is going to be named a deputy chief of staff. And of course, as we reported, Stephen Miller. Now, these are all people who have been with Donald Trump since truly 2021, when he left Washington, when he was really isolated by a number of different Republic, particularly after January 6th. These are people who never really left his side. Dan Scavino has been with him since long before the first administration. He started as his golf caddy. Now he is one of his most trusted advisors. And James Blair as well as Stephen Miller, they could have a big impact on policy. Remember, one of the things that we've been reporting is that Donald Trump has been thanking the people around him constantly for winning this election.

[14:05:007] And then there's the gauntlet of the Senate confirmation process and the background check process. And some of these people who care very deeply about the policy aspect here in advancing the President agenda, they feel that they could actually be more influential in a role that sort of sits above that in between the agencies and the President. And of course, as we know, President Trump thrives on proximity. Often it's the last person who speaks to him, whose idea he actually takes and runs with.

He's also being told, I'm told in part, what these people have said about him maybe negatively in the past, which obviously there's a lot of people that are on this list who have had not kind things to say about the former President. They want him to be briefed on that. But then there's also the circus aspect of this, which is the nighttime as soon as those meetings are over and you get into members bringing guests. And I was actually told that some members have been offered money to be brought -- to bring in certain guests because people want proximity to the former President. People have been shouting out ideas to him as he walks by almost every night. He has a standing reservation on the patio at 9:00 p.m., occasionally he's with Melania. Recently he's been with Melania and Elon Musk. Obviously, as we've talked about Elon Musk's growing power here, but people are trying to get any kind of FaceTime that they can with the former President, now President Elect.

We should note though, a couple things.One is I don't know a president who is coming into office that has put somebody in a cabinet position that is not incredibly, 100 percent loyal to them. So I think we have to put that on him. However, him circumventing the process, what the founders wanted, that in itself, you know, is troubling. We should note though, Barack Obama had czars, George W. Bush had czars. Czars have been in play. Interestingly enough, it was Republicans who really had the worst to say about czars.

      "sentences": "All right. Donald Trump's election victory is already having an impact on another one of his criminal cases. Today, Judge Juan Merchan hit the pause button in the President Elect's hush money trial, giving the DA's office and Trump's lawyers at least another week to make new arguments on how his election win impacts the case. Judge Merchan is now expected to decide the next steps in the case by next Tuesday.We have CNN Chief Legal Analyst, Laura Coates, our legal czar, if you will, joining us now. What does this delay tell you more broadly, ultimately about where you think this case will go? LAURA COATES, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CHIEF LEGAL ANALYST: It's probably going to go nowhere towards sentencing anytime soon, let alone perhaps at all. Many people may be wondering, why would a Supreme Court ruling on immunity based on actions in office have any impact on what was done during a hush money involving a campaign? Well, it's because some of the testimony that came in, the lawyers for Trump are arguing, had to do with the official office. People like Hope Hicks and beyond, they were a part of the administration. And whatever the jury may have heard actually was about things that could have been, in their minds, immunized testimony. So they're thinking about this. What impact could it have? But ultimately, you had this balancing act taking place right now between a jury guilty verdict and honoring the regularity of that process and the fact that he is now the President Elect. And the idea of a state court either seeking incarceration over a president of the United States, not only unheard of, but not likely to actually pass muster in any case. So you've got this really big balancing act. They have now, a week from today, to make their arguments from the prosecution whether they should proceed further. I think the judge is looking for an opportunity to have somebody else perhaps decide the key issues and allow him to massage them after that.",

She's infamously saying, this is not a king at the state court level that you run up against this idea of the supremacy of the federal government and the roles they have versus a state action.And so that could be part of what's coming into play. In any event, it's hard to decipher from a jury perspective what weight they assign to testimony that could have fallen under the umbrella of what could have been immunized. In a federal case versus what they heard, a jury looks at the overwhelming evidence and the ideas of guilt. But if they were to pinpoint a particular moment or had the ability to do so, who's to say they didn't focus on Hope Hicks or something else, as opposed to the breadth of all the evidence coming in, that's where the judge has to balance those very notions.",

Now, one of the things that both Cornyn and Thune had been doing over the last several months is crisscrossing the country, fundraising for their colleagues, appearing on the campaign trail for members who were trying to get into the Senate for the first time. And a number of Republicans are still not saying who they are going to vote for tomorrow. And that is for a few reasons. One, it is a secret ballot election, which means they can vote for whoever they want to behind closed doors. And no one, including the incoming President Donald Trump, is going to know who they voted for. Meanwhile, you also have a number of Republican senators who've been on the phone with President Trump and Elon Musk trying to make the case for their respective leader who they want to see in this position. But at the end of the day, one thing that you're starting to hear from Cornyn and Thune is that they want to open up the process on the Senate floor. They have the experience to lead. Thune has been the Republican whip over the course of the last several years. Cornyn held that position before him.

They broke the law. The people that -- there were people there who were peacefully protesting. However, they were there unlawfully and they kept us from doing our job and securing the Capitol grounds that day. But the people that assaulted the police officers, I have no sympathy for them, even if they were there to protest a stolen election or they got caught up in the moment. That's no excuse for the crimes that they committed and they need to be held accountable.
