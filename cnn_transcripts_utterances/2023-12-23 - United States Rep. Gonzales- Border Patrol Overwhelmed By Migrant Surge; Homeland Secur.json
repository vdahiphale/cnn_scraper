I'm Omar Jimenez, in for Fredricka Whitfield, we've got a lot to get to.We're going to start with some U.S. officials are warning the southern border is near a breaking point, with thousands of migrants there waiting to be processed. CNN is learning that federal authorities are reporting a seven-day average of more than 9,600 migrant encounters at the border this month, which is among the highest that's ever been recorded. Republican Congressman Tony Gonzales, whose district covers a large portion of the Texas border with Mexico, says the resources of border towns already are stretched thin, and are being pushed past their ability to handle the unprecedented surge. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. TONY GONZALES (R-TX): When there's these large numbers of people that come over, what ends up happening is Border Patrol gets overwhelmed and what they ended up doing, they have to feed and they have to clothe and to house these people. So, where do they go? They go to the local grocery store, just the other day, they bought 8,000 loaves of bread, cheese, food to feed these people. Well guess what happens when you go shopping at that local grocery store? You don't have groceries. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

This is where Border Patrol agents bring immigrants once they surrendered to authorities after crossing the border so that they can wait there before being processed. The numbers of immigrants crossing here in Eagle Pass and more widely in the real sector are staggering, Omar. On Friday, Customs and Border Protection released the latest on the number of apprehensions here at the U.S. southern border. The U.S. Border Patrol recorded a total of 191,113 in November of what they call encounters with immigrants at points along the border other than a regular point of entry. That compares to 189,000 or 4,000 more than the month of October. If we add people who enter through points of entry, the figure is close to a quarter of a million. And this is just in a single month, Omar, I had an opportunity to talk to a local immigration activist, who told me that the current situation is unsustainable. Let's take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JESSIE F. FUENTES, MEMBER, EAGLE PASS BORDER COALITION: It needs dire attention. And I would say that what we are doing, or what we have been doing over the last 2-1/2 years is just damaging an incredible ecosystem, along with committing cruelty against humanity, for the way we're treating human beings.

When we do focus groups, in a -- in Times' opinion, when my colleagues in the newsroom and at CNN are out on the trail, talking to folks, when you start talking to Republican primary voters about conviction and whether they would stand by him, they sort of find themselves kind of imagining a world that just doesn't exist, where Donald Trump has done nothing wrong, where he needs to fight this until the very end.

Donald Trump has been one of the biggest threats to democracy that this country has faced in decades. That is unchanged. But the reality is, you know, most people who are going to be participating in this election, know what happened on January 6th. They saw it for themselves. They know that Trump is not some cheerleader champion for democracy as we -- as we knew it. So, mobilizing on democracy, I sort of understand certainly why it's happening. The Biden camp has to figure out a way to talk to younger voters, to talk to independent voters, and democracy, and protecting democracy can do well. But to go back to your question, it really is the economy, pocketbook issues, kitchen table issues that have moved people. The one area that's really been interesting, as you know, has been around abortion, and the way that that has been a real energizing issue for a lot of democratic and independent voters to support the Democratic position. The challenge with that is that Joe Biden has never been the best messenger on abortion rights. So, how he and his campaign figure out ways to do that in states is still kind of an open question.",

And in fact, their combat forces are going to be on the ground throughout the Gaza Strip. They believe that they have essentially now obtained operational control of Northern Gaza. That's the area that was most heavily bombarded at the beginning of this war that began back on October 7. Now they're moving operations into central Gaza and sending people notices telling them to evacuate. But Omar, where do they go? That is the big question. That's certainly the question that a lot of people are asking, considering that NGOs that have been on the ground in Gaza have said repeatedly, there is no safe place for these families to go. And some of them have already had to relocate once, twice, or even more. And I don't know if you can see because it's dark outside. But there is tremendous rain, there were thunderstorms, bitter cold winds.

The potential kill zone from that crater can spread up to 365 meters, that's 1,200 feet, an area equivalent to roughly 60 soccer pitches or around 90 American football fields.

That's how it's historically been done.But as you know, circadian rhythms, what's going on in your personal life, all of those come into play as far as fatigue and rest and how well rested you are?",

The Department of Transportation says the FAA has more than 3,000 air traffic controllers short at this point of the staffing that it needs. Why has it been so difficult to increase that workforce?",

I was at the Academy in Oklahoma City with a lot of these traffic controllers as they got washed out of the program. And a lot of them that you would think would be very capable of doing this.You actually have to think in the fourth dimension, not only what's going on at the moment, but what's going to happen. If these airplanes are going this fast and going that far, will they intersect? Will they collide? You would think all of that is automated. And it is to some extent, but basically that goes on in your mind. It's hard to find someone that's ready and prepared to actually handle that type of mental acuity and vigilance to follow all that movement.",

      "sentences": "Yes, I mean, look, you talked about the fourth dimension, essentially, I went out to the aviation school at University of North Dakota and I sat with them and learn how their air traffic controllers worked. And even there are times where if it's whiteout conditions or fog, they are essentially operating blind. They can't see visually, as the number of planes are actually coming in, and they're trying to manage those things.So, couple that with the ability to actually recruit folks as well. Should people be worried as they head out on flights this holiday season? Or is this more about just trying to operate at an optimal level?",

      "sentences": "Well, Omar, it's important to remember just that we're in the absolute safest aviation system in the world. It's the safest mode of transportation, regardless of what we're doing. So when you talk about safety improvements, people get a little worried. They're like, well, why are we doing this? Why do we have to do this, and it doesn't mean that it's an unsafe system. This isn't a critically -- critical issue that has to be addressed today.But in looking forward at what it could turn into these indicators of these near misses and near collisions, you notice we're saying near miss and near collision, not collision and not missed. So understand it is a safe system. But we are looking always have/ I've been with the FAA -- I was with the FAA for 17 years. And since then, working in the areas in the safety and improvement programs, we're just trying to make things better, but get that caliber tighter. And this chan transition from prescriptive into a performance based system is where the key is here. I think we're going to get there. There's some new clients out now.",

The flight lasted a total of 12 minutes flew about 50 miles, but the company says it is working with the FAA to certify the technology for commercial operations.What do you make of that? Do you see that as something that's scalable, really, and even to a point where it reaches the general population?",
