In addition to that, we're seeing video from Saadallah Al-Jabiri Square, which is a very large open square in the more modern part of Aleppo. And there we're seeing rebels praying and cheering there. So, it does appear that after their initial entry into the western parts of the city, they're now very much in the center of the city. Now, there are other areas that they have not appeared to have reached. But what we're seeing is this is the culmination of what can only be described as a lightning offensive, launched just on Wednesday. They had earlier today claimed that they had taken control of 66 villages to the west of Aleppo, but certainly, given the fact that they were expelled from Aleppo, Syria's second largest city back at the end of 2016, their ability to get to the center of Aleppo without apparently much resistance from government forces certainly indicates that on the one hand the rebels led by a group called Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham, which is basically a group that used to be affiliated with Al Qaeda, they're also joined by remnants of this free Syrian army backed by Turkey that they have definitely improved their fighting capabilities. Now, one of the reasons it's believed that the resistance has been so weak to this rebel onslaught is that Hezbollah, which provided the regime with very sort of disciplined, well trained ground troops has essentially withdrawn from Syria and is now -- has been engaged in the war in Lebanon and obviously, the group has been decapitated and mauled by the Israelis there. The Iranians have come under steady Israeli attack in Syria as well. So, they've been crippled by that. And of course, the Russians who have had a military presence, largely an air asset presence in Syria since September 2015, even that has been reduced because of the war in Ukraine. So, the Bashar al-Assad regime, at the moment, is very weak and very exposed. Richard.",

The viewer has to remember here that this is a minority led regime, an Alawite offshoot of Shia, Islam led regime, and the vast majority of Syrians are, of course, Sunni Muslims. So, there is a communal element to this. Though they are -- some of them are sort of what's left over of what used to be an Al Qaeda affiliate, they have since broken with Al Qaeda very affirmatively, but then there are also some that are more secular minded and are backed by Turkey. I think what we're seeing today in Syria is a power play by Turkey, given the changing balance of power in the region. It reminds me of the seminal book written by the British historian Patrick Seale, \"The Struggle for Syria.\" Syria used to always be a battlefield and an arena for regional powers before power was centralized under the Hafez al-Assad regime. And so, with Iran now weakened because of the war with Israel -- with the U.S. talking about withdrawal, the Trump administration wanting to withdraw from Syria, Turkey through these rebels has clearly made a move for itself.",

Of course, they do have aworking relationship and work together during Donald Trump's first term. I'm also told that they had spoken by phone. But of course, this comes at such a pivotal moment, just days after Donald Trump had promised to impose sweeping tariffs on both Canada and Mexico should they fail to crack down on drugs flowing over the border and migrants. Donald Trump said specifically that he would sign, one of his first executive orders, once he was sworn in on January 20th, would be raising a 25 percent hike on all goods coming in from Mexico and Canada. Now, Richard what I also find very interesting is we actually heard the Canadian prime minister this morning address reporters and say himself that if Donald Trump were to carry out that threat that he would -- or that he believed that it would actually hurt Americans and American businesses. I want to just read for you, because I know this is very breaking news, I don't think you have this statement, but I'm going to read for you some of what he told reporters, Justin Trudeau, this morning. He said, quote, \"It is important to understand that Donald Trump, when he makes statements like that, he plans on carrying them out. There's no question about it.\" He also went on to say, \"Our responsibility is to point out that he would not just be harming Canadians who works so well with the United States, but he would actually be rising -- raising prices for American citizens as well as hurting the American industry and business.\"",

And so, I think, you know, we have heard, just from myself, covering Donald Trump for as long as I have, he likes to have these meetings face-to-face. He believes that he's a great negotiator, that when he is in the room with someone or speaking over a dinner table, as he will be doing this evening, that that's really where the best deals are made, and that he's his own best best deal maker. And so, I think, you know, I was told when I spoke with the source who confirmed the details of this meeting to me, they said that we are expecting to get some sort of readout of what is discussed. I'll hold my breath for that later this evening, once that wraps. I'm told it hasn't kicked off yet. But it will be very interesting to see whether or not Donald Trump moves from that threat or if he stays stubborn on it and decides that unless he sees some real changes relating to the crackdown on drugs and immigration that he is going to move forward with that massive hike in 25 percent on all goods coming from Canada.
