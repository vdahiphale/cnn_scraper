      "sentences": "Well, this is something that happened overnight, Pamela. This was a drone intercepted by Russia over this air base.Now, just to be clear, this is an air base that is well within Russian territory. We're talking about an air base some more than 300 miles, maybe 400 miles to the Ukrainian border to the east. It's strategically important for Russia. It's the air base that holds nuclear-capable bombers and an air base from which they launch strikes on Ukraine. What happened, in the early hours of Monday morning, this drone was intercepted killing the three servicemen as the debris fell down. It was not the first time it happened, Pamela. It was on the 5th of December that this very same air base was struck. It's, of course, a huge embarrassment to Russia that drones should be making it this war. Ukraine tends neither to confirm or deny these sorts of attacks. And yet, we've been hearing from Ukraine's air force that these kinds of things are the direct consequence of Russian aggression. So an indication that Ukraine may be at least alluding to some sort of responsibility without doing so outright. The fear across Ukraine there would be retaliatory strikes as we saw after December 5th, that's what happened last time. It comes amid the power outages widespread. Not just about Kyiv, but Lviv, Kharkov and Zaporizhzhia, as a result, said the electricity company, of nine Russian strikes against critical infrastructure. Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian president, warning that the next few days are going to be dark and difficult for Ukraine -- Pamela?",

Taiwan's Defense Ministry says 47 Chinese aircrafts have crossed the median line on the Taiwan Strait into its airspace on Sunday. CNN Pentagon correspondent, Oren Liebermann, joins us live.

      "sentences": "Pamela, the U.S. and Taiwan see China do this repeatedly, and it's becoming more frequent for China to use larger numbers of aircraft to send into Taiwan, the self-identification zones.On Sunday, China sent 47 aircraft into Taiwan's zone. And there's another group of aircraft that doesn't quite cross that median line of the Taiwan Strait. For China, this serves a few purposes. First, it is an open statement of their military capabilities and sort of an open threat that one day they'll use the militaries if they decide to take Taiwan from China's perspective to reunify with force. But another, to reset a baseline for activity around Taiwan. Before House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visit to the island, the U.S. is used to seeing a level of activity. Since then, that level has been raised intentionally by China as they try to set a new bar for what is China's military activity around Taiwan. China said the exercises were a response to provocative actions or a provocation by the United States. It's certainly worth noting that President Joe Biden just a few days earlier signed the National Authorization Act that had steps to boost Taiwan's capabilities -- Pamela?",
