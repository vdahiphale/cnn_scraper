And then there's also the fact that Biden aides continue to believe that he is the only person that has and could beat Donald Trump. And even some that I've spoken to in recent days point to 2016, and they point to this election, and they say that remains true.All that to say, though, the party is doing some serious finger- pointing, suggesting that had Biden announced that he was not seeking reelection, as roughly 80 percent of American voters suggested he should do back in 2023, that there would have been a robust primary process, perhaps someone else, another rising star within the party, could have been picked and could have been a stronger candidate than Vice President Kamala Harris ended up being. All that to say, you know, there's also an acknowledgement that hindsight is 2020, and there's going to be a long road of evaluation of exactly what went wrong.

And it has everything to do with our National Security, with American interests, with American jobs. That's the lens I think that we should apply. The National Security lens is one that will be used.And there are issues, frankly, with this company from the past of unfair trade practices. We'll have to navigate through that. But it's certainly not anything that I'm advocating for or against based on the nationality of the country. It's based on America's primary interests. KEILAR: So former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is an advisor to Nippon Steel in this deal. And Nippon Steel plans to invest a huge amount in steel production here in the U.S., which would create a lot of jobs in the U.S. And Pompeo has warned that if the deal falls through, it would mean the U.S. has to import more Chinese steel.

They don't play by the same set of rules. You think about Japan's perspective, they're even more proximate to the threat of China. And if you look at what China has done in the East China Sea surrounding Japanese islands, the Senkaku Islands there, if you look at what they're doing in the South China Sea, frustrating trade routes, building artificial islands, Japan's interests are very much aligned with ours from an economic standpoint and the National Security standpoint as we look at China.

If he thinks it is, well, the sentencing gets tossed, too. But if that doesn't work, they're going to make this constitutional argument.

These are just in to CNN. We are projecting that former Congressman Cleo Fields, a Democrat, will represent Louisiana 6th. This is a seat drawn after a federal court mandated the state have another majority black district. This seat, a pickup for Democrats. Meantime, in Nevada, Democrat Dina Titus has won re-election in Nevada's 1st House district. Titus is a fixture in Nevada politics, previously serving in the state Senate. Also, in Nevada's fourth district, Democrat Steven Horsford has won re-election in the fourth district there. He's perhaps best known as the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus.",
