Tonight, a deadlyday in Ukraine as Russia strikes hit a children's hospital and residential buildings killing dozens. We will have the very latest for you. Then, political turmoil here in France as a left-wing coalition force the far-right in a stunning result. I'll dig into what this means for President Macron and the country as a whole. Plus, a defiant Joe Biden says he's not going anywhere as the pressure builds on him to drop his presidential bid, that and much more ahead this hour. But first, tonight, I'm here in Paris for you, the capital of France where the country has been plunged into political uncertainty. In a shock victory, the left-wing coalition has won the most seats in parliament, faulting really the far-right's attempt to take power. But with no party gaining a majority, there is political turmoil ahead, I am going to be digging into all of this in more detail in just a moment. But first, I want to begin with other major news out of Europe, and a deadly day in Ukraine after Russian attacks killed more than 30 people across the country. This is new video you're looking at from inside Kyiv's Children's Medical Center, and that is the largest in Ukraine. Large parts of the complex were reduced basically to rubble in that attack. Volunteers and hospital staff scrambled to remove debris brick-by-brick as you can see there on your screen, and help evacuate the young patients, two of which were said to be in the operating room when the hospital was hit. They were taken to safety in the basement, dozens were killed and more than 120 people injured after Russian strikes targeted cities across Ukraine during morning rush hour. In Poland for meetings, Ukraine's President said justice will come to the Kremlin for ordering those attacks. Have a listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT, UKRAINE (through translator): Beyond any doubt, we are going to rebuild everything that these Russian terrorists have destroyed. And beyond any doubt, we are going to answer these savages from Russia. Everybody that was injured will get all the help they need, and will pledge to work on bringing Russia to justice for the terror and Putin for his orders to carry out these strikes.

He -- the assessment there was he came in and it was a bit bold and a bit brash, and you know, every Ukrainian official you listen to talking about support coming from NATO allies and partners since then, reiterates the mantra, thank you, we're grateful, thank you, we're grateful.

Hence, Emmanuel Macron's decision to hold the elections, hence, the success of the National Rally in the first round.

(voice-over): Doubling the number of its parliamentary seats, with a far- left doing well too, the radical parties gains largely made at the expense of President Macron's centrist.

Instead, to much of the surprise of a great deal of his party and all of France's political classes, apart from a bit -- a little group of counselors and close advisors around him, he made the extraordinary decision to dissolve parliament, wanting to listen to what the people had said. This of course, has thrown the country into this, particularly a curious level of political turmoil. But what it has meant is that he now faces -- he's going to have to work with the National Assembly that is more fractious, more divided than it was before he dissolved the election with the radical parties, both the far-right and the far-left emboldened with more seats than they had before.

So, very few members actually have weighed in about their views, about their concerns. Some of them have talked privately, have given anonymous quotes to reporters about their concerns, but will they go public? That is a big question right now, Isa. And the big question too, is what the Democratic leaders Hakeem Jeffries and the House and Chuck Schumer in the Senate, what they say, their messaging will be critically important if they side with Joe Biden, perhaps that could tamp down those calls within the ranks to push him out. But if they believe there should be a change because of their concerns that Biden at the top of the ticket could undermine their efforts to take back control of the House and keep control of the United States Senate, if they come out and raise concerns about Joe Biden staying on the top of the ticket, pressure will undoubtedly mount. So, upcoming, Isa, are key meetings, one, tomorrow morning and the House Democratic caucus behind closed doors, members will be talking about Joe Biden airing their concerns and saying whether or not they believe he should stay. And then Tuesday afternoon, there will be a meeting with Senate Democrats over lunch. Their weekly lunch. The first time they will meet since the debate -- disastrous debate performance by President Biden.

And I'll get that -- more on that in just a second. President has also strongly encouraged greater partnerships between the NATO alliance and friendly nations around the world, particularly in the Indo-Pacific as you will see. And the president knows that the global threats and challenges that we all face, including from authoritarian actors and terrorist organizations are inextricably linked. He has also encouraged our NATO allies to join him in making significant investments in our mutual defense and deterrence capabilities. And when the Biden-Harris administration took office, only nine NATO allies were spending at least 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense, 2 percent was the whale's pledge. That was the goal that every member of the alliance had swore that they would get to. Today, a record 23 NATO allies are at or above the minimum level of 2 percent of GDP on defense spending. More than twice as many as in 2020, and nearly eight times higher than when the allies first set that 2 percent benchmark a decade ago. Now, just quickly turning to the schedule. Tomorrow evening, President Biden will welcome NATO leaders and he and Dr. Biden will host a 75th anniversary commemoration event at the Mellon auditorium. That is the site.

But he has already had discussions with his national security team in the lead-up to the summit, as you might expect that he would. He's reviewing material. He's doing his homework and getting ready. He's got the first major set of remarks tomorrow night at the Mellon Auditorium. He's working his way through those remarks, as you would expect him to do. And he's getting ready for the -- at least the two bilateral meetings that we know he's going to have specifically with the new prime minister of the U.K. and President Zelenskyy later in the week. So what I have seen from my perch is the normal amount of preparatory work that he does before a major international conference, no different than how he prepared for the G7 or for the events in Normandy or previous international fora.

When youwere here last Tuesday, you were asked if the President had any medical examinations since his physical in February or that included the time period after the debate. You said flatly no. Three days later, you admitted that the President had a short check-in with the medical team thereafter. I mean, those are two very different answers. JEAN-PIERRE: No, no, no, no, no. Actually, if you were to listen to the -- I think I did a 30-minute gavel on Friday, 30 minutes, with -- I think it was -- with the pool. And I said he did not have a -- I cleared it up. You're right. You're correct. I said he didn't -- I still stand, but he didn't have a medical exam. I said that in the gavel, and you're right, I said that in the briefing. He had a check-in with -- and he said this on Friday. He had a check-in with his medical doctor, which is something that he does a couple times a week, as you know, and I stated this as well. He has -- for those who don't know, obviously, outside of the briefing room, outside of the White House, many Americans don't actually understand this, let's take a step back. They deal with their medical issues or physicals very, very differently. They are very, you know, they are lucky if they get to see their doctor once or twice a year, right? They have to get in a car, they have to either take public transportation in order to make that happen. The President's medical unit is literally down on the other side of the colonnade. It's just down the steps from the residence, and so a couple times a week he does a check-in, a verbal check-in with his doctor while he's exercising. That is something that happens often. Matter of fact, he did a check-in today because I know folks were going to ask about if he was tested for COVID. He was not. We are following CDC guidance. He was not tested for COVID, just to let you guys know about that one. And if he has any symptoms, obviously, we would test him. But --",

It was a couple of words that were spoken to each other, and that's how we were able to give you that answer. But he did not have a medical exam. He did not have a physical.",
