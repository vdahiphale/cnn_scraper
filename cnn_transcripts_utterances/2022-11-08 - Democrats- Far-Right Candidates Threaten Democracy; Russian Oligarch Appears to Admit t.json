At the end of the day, he has accepted the results, and so I think the fact that that election went -- you know, that the results held, I think was very encouraging for the global perspective. I think if that had been challenged, to the degree that we saw in 2020 in the U.S., we will be a bit more worried on the global scale.With that said again, across Europe, across much of the world right now, we see this, you know, real drive behind many right-wing parties that are if not threatening the institutions themselves, are certainly are questioning some of the liberal values that I think many have been taken for granted for quite a while.

So, I think the more that states like Russia feel they can stoke those divisions, they see it as a demand advantage for them and further diminishing the stature of the U.S. abroad.I think Americans are very aware of that.

Hunkering down in the basement for 10 days under Russian occupation, this is the picture of the Russian tanks arriving just 15 minutes after she fled. When we left, they were shooting at us from behind, she tells me. Now, I realize what kind of a second birthday I got. What kind of a gift? Because those people who left right after us were shot. As this city tries to put the pieces back together again, there is another, more sensitive, perhaps even more difficult kind of rebuilding underway. The U.N. children's fund UNICEF has placed pop-up tents full of warmth, light, and care. All these children have been traumatized and some have been forced to witness unspeakable horrors.
