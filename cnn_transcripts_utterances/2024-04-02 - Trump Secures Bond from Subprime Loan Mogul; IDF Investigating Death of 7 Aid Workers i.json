A live look at Capitol Hill on this Tuesday morning. Good morning, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt. It's wonderful to have you with us. Donald Trump's properties safe for now. The former president posting a $175 million bond as he appeals a massive civil fraud judgment against him. That means that New York Attorney General Letitia James can't begin seizing Trump's assets until at least September when a state appellate court hears his appeal. The bond is 100 percent underwritten by a California-based insurance company, even though Trump vowed last month to use his own money to cover it.

I might spend a lot of money on my campaign. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Good morning, all. Thank you so much for being here. So Jonah, the former president found someone to basically save him, right. It's $175 million bond. It's underwritten by an insurance company owned by Don Hankey, who is the chairman. He is a subprime car loan dealer, basically. What does it tell you that this is the kind of person that Trump had to look to to solve this problem for him? And obviously, he is, you know, lashing out on -- on Truth Social, et cetera. That's kind of par for the course, calling this all a witch hunt. But here we are. We're going to not deal with this till September currently.",

People don't find that to be persuasive. They don't feel like it connects with their lives. So, you know, he in theory has an opportunity today in these states to make a case. And he is very likely not going to make a case that is going to resonate with people -- with people's lives in a real meaningful way. That is a missed opportunity for him.

Kate Bedingfield, I want to start with you, because look, this -- the World Central Kitchen, Jose Andres's operation has become world- renowned for showing up in the moments when humanity is having some of its toughest experiences and helping people.

From a policy perspective, I think they've been trying to drive toward a longstanding sort of post-conflict plan. I think Bibi's own domestic politics have made it so that he is unwilling to engage in that in a serious way. And so every instance of horror like this gives the Biden administration were opening to put clear contrast between what they're trying to do, what they would argue they're trying to do responsibly in the region and what Netanyahu has been unwilling to do. I personally think it's good for them. So I think they need to be clear that this was unacceptable. It was horrific.

It's just difficult.When they tried to do with the trucks a couple of months -- about a month ago, it turned into a free-fire zone. And it wasn't, as what was immediately reported by a lot of the press and as claimed by Hamas, it wasn't Israel opening fire on aid trucks. It was the fact that these trucks were being seized by Hamas. Whenever there's bombing, Hamas runs into tunnels and hides and leaves the civilian population above. That makes it a very dangerous place for the civilian population. I -- I think that part of the problem is that it's just a terrible situation, and the only solution is down the road.

Bad timing with some warnings for tornadoes around Paducah, Kentucky. You see this map looks much better than from what I showed you about an hour ago: many more green dots on here.

We have a moderate, level four out of five, severe risk from Columbus and Cincinnati, Ohio; down into Louisville, Kentucky.
