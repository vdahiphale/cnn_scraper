Sources say mediators will present a plan to representatives from Israel and Hamas separately, but a number of key sticking points remain, including possible last-minute demands by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.His office denies his changed positions and accuses Hamas of adding unrealistic demands. U.S. President Joe Biden is pushing back on questions about what he's doing to pressure Israel and Hamas to come to the negotiating table but he acknowledges he has concerns about the talks, given the threat of an attack on Israel by Iran.

We've heard from the State Department that President Biden's Middle East coordinator Brett McGurk is heading to the Middle East, will be in Egypt and also in Qatar. Those two countries are the key mediating countries when it comes to trying to secure this deal.And he will be doing that this week. The Biden administration is trying to create a final bridging proposal, which will be acceptable to both sides. We also know that Amos Hochstein, who is the special envoy for trying to plicate the situation between Israel and Hezbollah, will be heading to Beirut as well. So, it's really a multi- pronged diplomatic effort by the United States at the same time that they are putting some significant military assets into the region as well. And as you heard from the U.S. President, Joe Biden there saying that he is concerned at the situation at this point. We have though heard from two Biden administration officials that they don't necessarily believe that Iran has decided exactly what its retaliation will be at this point. Remember, this is a very new president in Iran. It was just the day after his inauguration that the Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated. So, they believe he hasn't necessarily decided on the exact course of action but there are hopes that it will not be a course of action that will trigger a far wider conflict and all-out war in the region. But there are many concerns that that one could affect the other, that a retaliation could affect these ceasefire talks, which are still planned for Thursday at this point. Now, we've heard from Hamas that they don't want to rehash the talks. [02:05:00] They don't want to try and change the proposal that they believe was on the table back in July and one that the U.S. President Joe Biden was very vocally supportive of. They say that they are ready to sign up to that one. Israel saying it's going to send a delegation on Thursday. We did hear from two diplomatic sources, though, saying that all of this last-ditch mediation effort is unlikely to impact in any way on Iran's planned retaliation. Rosemary?",

So, what do you tell the Russian people? Don't sensationalize this. Don't talk about a second front.
