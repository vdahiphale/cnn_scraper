On day two of the G7 talks in Italy weighing in on one of the mostconsequential and controversial issues of our time, artificial intelligence, he described AI as an extremely powerful tool touching all aspects of our lives. He said it represents a true evolution. But there are challenges and concerns. He is addressing those G7 leaders in Puglia. He has now become the first pontiff to participate in the summit. And he has been speaking at a session dedicated to artificial intelligence. He will also meet privately with U.S. President Joe Biden in the coming hours, there. Well, there is -- Mr. Biden departs the summit later today, leaving behind -- which has been heavily focused on the war in Ukraine, but also on the crisis in Gaza -- just been hearing, the opportunity and challenges posed by artificial intelligence more on that later in this hour with my full interview with the UAE's Artificial Intelligence Minister, that is coming up. Let's get you to Nic Robertson, who is there covering these talks, he is, of course, our International Diplomatic Editor live for you in Italy. Let's address what we've just heard from the Pope. And we know I think it was a report in \"The Washington Post\" this morning, reminding us that it was Ben Smith or Brad Smith, sorry, the Head of Microsoft to visited Pope Francis back in 2019. And the report talking about the discussion that the Head of Microsoft and the Pope had, back then about the benefits and challenges of artificial intelligence this is something that the Pope has been exercised by now, for some four or five years. What did you make of what he's just said?",

China will be on the table has already been on the table today in terms of Indo-Pacific and the concerns and the alignment that President Biden hopes for with other G7 partners to sort of try to head off Russia's rather China's malign trade practices as they have seen, whether it's exploitative trade practices, whether it's overproduction. All these sorts of issues that are leading to huge trade tensions with China, that is looking for better global alignment on that issue. Immigration was, again, an issue on the table today, as it was yesterday. And the concerns about supporting and developing nations, developing economies in Sub Saharan Africa is. You know, the broad understanding you can connect migration with climate, with development that these developed G7 nations with their strong economies have a responsibility to try to support so that's been an issue. Also, women's Reproductive Rights is a topic that's come up. We understand that the host here Giorgia Meloni, Prime Minister of Italy would like to keep abortion out of that final communique. These communications are pages and pages long. And the 43rd paragraph in the communique that came out of Hiroshima in 2023 of the last G7 really spoke about strengthening the women's Reproductive Rights. And spoke specifically about abortion and support after abortion for women. And this is something of a debate here President Biden wants to see that language followed through and amplified so to President Macron of France.",

And he talked about how AI will touch all of us, in society, around the world, wherever you are. And you make a very good point, he is, wanting to ensure that there is equality in the access to AI.

And he's had meetings with, as you know, other people there. And so I'm not really surprised. I think he uses every avenue, whether it be pop culture, whether it be television personalities, actors, Martin Scorsese, has met with him, Leonardo DiCaprio, because Leonardo is involved in the environment, as you know. So if someone's going to have influence, and have a voice and Pope Francis can use that toward his ends. He's going to welcome them. He's a pope who welcomes everybody. So I think it's kind of funny upon that they're there. But I do think that it doesn't surprise me because they want to be there, interestingly. And most of them, not all of them are Catholic.

But the last few days they've skyrocketed after that Tuesday night Israeli strike on a house in Southern Lebanon that killed the most Senior Hezbollah Field Commander yet since these hostilities began. Now overnight, there was an Israeli strike on a building about 20 kilometers north of the border. According to the national news agency here, two women were killed more than 10 people were injured, but we're still not hearing anything about possible fatalities, or casualties among Hezbollah fighters. So we don't know quite yet what the significance of that fairly large airstrike was. But what we've seen for the third day in a row is a higher number of Hezbollah strikes on Israeli targets, and Israeli counter strikes as well. At this point in the day, at 4 o'clock in the afternoon, in Beirut, there have already been nine Hezbollah strikes on Israeli targets. As usual, most of them are on military targets. And that has been the case mostly by the Israelis as well. It's so far been very much focused on military targets on both sides. They're trying to stay within these so called unwritten rules of engagement. But there's the very real danger at this point, that as these hostilities escalate, that those rules of engagement could simply fall by the wayside. And we also know that the Israeli government led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is under intense pressure from the Israeli populace to do something to allow the more than 60,000 Israelis who have fled that border region to come back to their homes, Becky.",

The President of the UAE where I am here, Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed out now on. AI is being positioned at the forefront of his country's future. That is demonstrated most by this man, Omar Al Olama. He became the world's first AI minister back in 2017, overseeing a strategic vision to embed the transformative technology at the heart of pretty much everything that goes on here. And in doing so, hitching his country's prospects to the United States, describing the relationship when it comes to investments in strategic partnerships in AI, and other advanced technologies as a -- We'll just the past couple of months, Microsoft announcing a 1.5 billion dollar investment in Abu Dhabi's G42 global AI technology group.
