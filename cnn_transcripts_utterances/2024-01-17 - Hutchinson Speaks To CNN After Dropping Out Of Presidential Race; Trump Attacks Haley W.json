      "sentences": "Plus, a change in tune, North Carolina's second highest ranking elected official and possible candidate for governor used to be all in on being against abortion. Now he won't even use the word abortion. Why not? Well, let's see what CNN's Kfile team found when going through his public statements.And leading this hour, only six days away from the next contest in the 2024 race, the New Hampshire Republican primary. Three major candidates remain. Governor Ron DeSantis is wrapping up a day of events in the Granite State, Nikki Haley will hold a rally there tonight ahead of her new CNN Presidential Town Hall in New Hampshire tomorrow night. And Donald Trump is also expected to head to New Hampshire after spending the day in court in New York. Let's bring in former Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson for his very first TV interview since he ended or suspended his 2024 campaign for president. He finished sixth in the Iowa Republican caucuses. Governor, I want to start with the fact that the Democratic National Committee put out a rather snarky statement about you suspending your campaign, saying this news comes as a shock to those of us who could have sworn he had already dropped out. A number of Democrats actually objected to this pointing out that you have actually been out there telling the truth about Donald Trump and standing up for democracy. And I understand that President Biden's Chief of Staff, Jeff Zients, called you today to apologize. ASA HUTCHINSON (R), FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR: Well, that's correct. And of course, I didn't pay much attention to what the DNC said but it's actually gratifying to see a bipartisan rebuffing of this snarky tweet as you say or comment. And to me, it's just doesn't reflect the best of America whenever you have ridicule or sarcasm that is leading the path. And so, I'm grateful for Jeff reaching out to me today and took his time away, and he apologized. And I -- it meant a lot to me. And to me, that reflects the good parts of American politics. You fight hard but then at the end of the day, you want to make sure you treat each other with respect. So I appreciated the call.",

And actually, that's one thing that I observed during the course of his campaign is the stranglehold that Donald Trump has on the apparatus of the Republican Party, both at the national but also in many of the states and movement -- having some have moved to caucuses, so.And then now, you see many of the Republican members of Congress and senators falling in line. So there's a brave few that say, no, that's not the right direction for us. And in Iowa, that message didn't work. And I think what happened toward the end, you saw a movement back toward Nikki Haley, as she was the most logical alternative to Donald Trump. And so, I think that's one of the reasons that we came out of there poorly, and of course necessitated my suspension of the campaign.

He has continued to say that Haley is recruiting Democrats to come out and infiltrate the Republican primary.And just to make very clear, Democrats cannot vote in the Republican primary in New Hampshire. Independents and registered Republicans can. Now they do believe this is partly why Nikki Haley's polls are rising, because Independents don't all identify as conservative. There are also left leaning Independents, but his team is keenly aware of that. The other thing to point out is this idea that he is leading Nikki Haley in the polls by a huge margin. That is incorrect from every advisor that I have talked to. They are working very hard to try and stop her from having any momentum, something that Donald Trump knows and has continued to say on the campaign trail that he is attacking her going after her on multiple fronts. Now, I do want to point out that one of the things he said in his speech, I guess, is what we're calling it, was that the judge would not stop the trial or delay the trial because of his wife, Melania's mother's funeral. We should point out that this is all voluntary. He does not have to be in court. He is choosing to be in court. Part of this is a campaign strategy. There is a reason that he set up a press conference or remarks after he was in court. And that is because as we know, there were no cameras in court. This is a way for him to take control of the media narrative as well as take all the oxygen out of the 2024 race. That is why he is using these court appearances, and that's what we are told by advisors that they are maximizing this. So that's something else to note here.",

He said that women who end pregnancies, even after just 24 hours, were murderers and called abortion providers, the butchers of humanity.Now, Jake, the backdrop to all of this is that Robinson now says he never said he supported banning abortion without exceptions for rape or incest. He's sort of toned down his rhetoric and said that he favors bans, but supports exceptions for rape or incest in there, and he's also even admitted that he himself paid for an abortion for his wife, who was then his girlfriend in the 1980s, which is a decision that he now says that he regrets.",
