      "sentences": "Hi Fredricka. Yeah. Obviously, this is being met with a furious reaction from the Israelis. But, across the wider Middle East, this is broadly being welcomed. You have the Qataris, for instance, who are obviously deeply involved in the ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas, saying that the way to peace is a Palestinian state recognized under the 1967 borders, and said this, quote, \"The Ministry of Foreign Affairs voices the state of Qatar's hope for more countries to recognize the state of Palestine and promote the efforts aiming to implement the two-state solution.\" Now, the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as the capital, is also theplan that Turkey endorses, along with the Egyptians. Both countries put out similar statements welcoming this new recognition. And the Saudi Foreign Ministry also reacted, saying \"The kingdom calls on more countries to swiftly take the same stance which would contribute to finding a reliable and irreversible path to achieve a just and lasting peace that fulfils the rights of the Palestinian people.\" So, that irreversible path to a Palestinian state is the condition that the Saudis have put up for normalizing relations with Israel. Now, the Israeli Prime Minister has made abundantly clear that he does not support the creation of a Palestinian state, and it seems that there is growing impatience at this very fact. This is how the Irish Foreign Minister explained it yesterday in an interview on CNN, saying that the Prime Minister is taking steps to undermine the peace process here, and that there is really no political will for this in Israel right now. In Europe, we're seeing a slightly different tack from other countries, Germany, one example. The head of the Foreign Affairs Committee in that country said that he is not convinced that recognition is appropriate after the horrific massacres that we saw on October 7. Now, broadly speaking, the Germans are in favor of a two- state solution, but they want it to be done through a dialogue process and a peace process. And you have other countries like the UK and the U.S. who would like to see something similar. You don't want to recognize Palestine before there is any progress toward a peace agreement.

We'll have more from our correspondent in Iran in a few minutes. All right. Turning now to Mexico where nine people are dead and dozens more are injured following a stage collapse.

As part of those drills, dozens of fighter jets carrying live ammunition conducted mock strikes alongside its warships. This complicates things for Taiwan's new leader, who was sworn in just days ago, and called on China to stop intimidating Taiwan. Beijing claims Taiwan as its own, despite never having controlled it.

Well, they're responding to a speech that Taiwan's new President, Fred, gave a couple of days ago at his inauguration, where he not only said to stop the intimidation, but he flat out told China that they need to acknowledge the existence of Taiwan. He even used this island's official name, the Republic of China, which was considered very inflammatory by Beijing, and a much less cautious, frankly, than his predecessor Tsai Ing-wen, who was always very careful not to say anything that would give Beijing an excuse to launch military drills like this.But, of course, they did it anyway. They did it after Nancy Pelosi. They did it when President Xi met with the then-Speaker McCarthy in California, and now it's happening again. We just got an update from the Taiwan Defense Ministry. We're not even halfway through these two- day drills yet, and already at least 49 Chinese aircraft near Taiwan, 35 of them crossing over the median line of the Taiwan Strait, entering Taiwan's self-declared air defense identification zone. You have 15 warships, 16 Coast Guard vessels patrolling near the outlying islands. No aircraft carrier spotted just yet. But, these were pretty significant. And yet, not the largest that we've seen. It was back in 2023 in September when 103 Chinese aircraft were detected in a single 24-hour period. So, this is provocative but not unprecedented. And people on the streets of Taipei, we were out talking to some of them earlier, they've lived with the looming threat of a potential conflict with China for their whole lives. This conflict, this question of Taiwan sovereignty goes back more than 70 years. And so, people say, yes, they obviously worry about what could happen. But, life essentially does go on, and they say that they have confidence in their government and their military. Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE (Interpreted): If the Chinese Communist Party does attack Taiwan, it won't be easy for them to take Taiwan. Taiwanese people are not afraid of war. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (Interpreted): I believe leaders will prioritize people's happiness. So, I'm not worried. I think peace will be maintained. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They've also lived very close to each other, constant threat of conflict, and yet, it's just something that you learn to live with. But, Taiwan has been investing billions in bolstering their own self-defense. They're expanding the military training, both for mandatory conscripts. They have to actually spend a year now. Every young Taiwanese man has to go in and serve for a year and then they get recalled back regularly for training. Some of my friends just got notices. They're going to have to do expanded military training over the summer.So, there certainly are real-life impacts here in Taiwan. But, nonetheless, it is unsettling, albeit regular now for people here to see this sort of military activity. It's been going on. China has almost been normalizing, Fred, this escalatory military drills, if you will, encircling Taiwan just miles from the shores of this island, and some have said that it is essentially a dress rehearsal for this possible invasion down the road, which China has never ruled out, unless this democratically elected government were to suddenly reverse its policies and ignore the opinions of the Taiwanese public who have elected them into office and just accept Beijing's offer to be reabsorbed into the mainland. They say that's just not going to happen. So, unfortunately, that means this tension is just likely to continue in this cycle, and really, nobody knows where it's headed, Fred.",

On that front, the two leaders met with business leaders just yesterday to talk more about economic cooperation and private sector investments.But, they're also expected to make a slate of announcements today. That includes, for example, unveiling a document called the Nairobi- Washington Vision, which will call on creditors to help ease the burden of debts for Kenya. It will also include the President designating Kenya a major non-NATO ally, which would essentially allow for more of that military cooperation. So, this is a partner that the President is focused on today, has been focused on. In 2022, the President said that he was, quote \"all in for Africa\". But, he also hasn't visited despite committing to over the course of his presidency, as he has had to grapple with multiple foreign conflicts.

Now, Live Nation leadership in the past has defended their practices, and they have said that the pricing has been set by artists and by their teams, and that they have been able to cut out scalpers with a lot of the ways that they structure ticket pricing. But, Fred, it is potentially quite a rocky road ahead in court.
