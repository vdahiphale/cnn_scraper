So, we heard President Zelenskyy going into the summit, saying that it was unprecedented and absurd. His tone softened over the following 48 hours as it became clear that he was going to be getting significant short and long-term aid packages and security guarantees. We saw the G7 promise long-term security guarantees and other kinds of support.So, they are hailing this as a success, but it is less than what they hoped for. Eventually, they will join NATO. And that's what they are really grabbing on to, is this real assurance that once this war ends, that they will join NATO, and they'll join it in a streamlined fashion because the process was essentially reduced from two steps to one step.

This isn't like the old days, where you could maintain your own email with the server down the hall. Governments, banks, critical infrastructure, they're trusting the private sector companies like Microsoft, to get it right.

This was a trusted certificate that said, hey, I'm from Microsoft, you can trust me.And that allowed them the Chinese actors to print their own access into email accounts.

That they've been unable to produce any evidence about related to President Biden. So, they said this is the guy as recently as Friday. Chairman Comer was saying this is a very credible witness. Well, it turns out with the unsealed indictment from yesterday, or the day before, that Gal Luft himself is a fugitive from justice, who's at large.Who is facing an eight-count indictment from November of last year for being an unregistered foreign agent for Chinese government interests, for making false statements to federal agents and for engaging in unlawful arms trafficking deals and export trading Chinese arms for Iranian oil. And this is the guy that our colleagues want us to depend on for, you know, blowing the cover on some nonexistent bribery investigation. So, look, the fact is that what they're going after, was already considered by Donald Trump's appointee, a U.S. Attorney in the Western District of Pennsylvania under William Barr. And they found nothing, they found no reason to proceed from an assessment of the evidence to a full-blown investigation.",

They already looked at all of this evidence, or alleged evidence, but they looked at these tips, and they led nowhere and now they're recycling the same old Giuliani allegations through the guise of this guy who wants to wrap themselves in the cloak of that House Oversight Committee.And we've got Senator Ron Johnson over on the other side of Capitol Hill saying he should be given immunity. In other words, he should be given a clean slate for all of his arm's trafficking crimes and his false statement crimes and failing to register as an agent for the Chinese government. So, he can talk to the Oversight Committee about tips that have already been thoroughly discredited and repudiated by Donald Trump's own Department of Justice.
