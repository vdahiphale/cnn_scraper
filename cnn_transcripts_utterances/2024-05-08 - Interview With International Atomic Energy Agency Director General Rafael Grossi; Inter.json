And, as fears of a wider war between Israel and Iran persist, so do the nuclear concerns. My conversation with Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Then, this. As the world remembers the victims of the Holocaust, I'm joined by Yehudit Tzamir, a survivor of the Holocaust whose family narrowly avoided death amid the October 7th attacks. Also, ahead, India decides. We discuss the colossal impact of the biggest election in human history with Robbie Agrawal, the editor in chief of Foreign Policy. Plus, \"Minority Rule,\" Author Ari Berman tells me about his new book, examining the integrity of American democracy. Hello, everyone. Welcome to the program. I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York, sitting in for Christiane Amanpour, who will be back next week. Well, the United States has paused a shipment of ammunition to Israel, including bombs weighing 2,000 pounds. All of this amid concerns over their potential use in Rafah in Gaza. That's according to a U.S. official. It comes as Israel says its military operation in the Southern Gaza City will continue until Hamas is eliminated or until the first hostages return home. Roughly 50,000 people have left the area in the last 24 hours after evacuation orders. Meanwhile, in Washington, the deadline is fast approaching for a high stakes report on whether Israel has violated international humanitarian law in war, something that could have repercussions for future U.S. armed supplies. Let's go to CNN's Jeremy Diamond now, who is following all of the developments for us in Jerusalem. So, Jeremy, as we're following Israel's operation, what is being described as a limited operation for now in Rafah, talk to us about the humanitarian impact we're already seeing and some of the concerns that lie in the days to come.",

      "sentences": "Well, as you said, Bianna, the military operation may be limited to the part of Eastern Rafah, around the Rafahborder crossing, but the impact is quite enormous and it will only grow larger in the coming days if that Rafah Border Crossing is not reopened. We have already watched as this operation has now forced one of three functioning hospitals in Rafah to shut down. Al Nasser hospital in in Eastern Rafah fell within that red zone that has been ordered to evacuate by the Israeli military, and it has now closed its doors to patients. Patients and staff have fled. They've tried to set up a new field hospital further west in Central Rafah, but that hospital only has about a third of the capacity of the actual hospital that has now been forced to shut down. Humanitarian aid officials are also sounding the alarm about a lack of fuel in Rafah, warning that in the coming days, if more fuel doesn't get in via that Rafah Border Crossing that that will pose enormous problems for the remaining hospitals and medical facilities in the area. And of course, that Rafah Border Crossing is critical not just because it's an entry point for humanitarian aid and fuel, but also because it's where medical evacuations can take place to Egypt. It's also where humanitarian aid officials are able to get in and out of Gaza from. So, a lot of critical impacts as a result of these military operations and the ongoing fighting. The Israeli military, for its, part isn't signaling how long this operation will last at this stage. But what they say that they are doing is conducting what they call targeted raids against Hamas militants in the area as well as uncovering infrastructure belonging to Hamas, including discovering, they say, several tunnel shafts in the area.",

      "sentences": "Yes, I mean, my Israeli sources have repeatedly emphasized to me that this Rafah operation could end if the two parties, Israel and Hamas,are able to reach an agreement for a hostage release and a ceasefire agreement. But as of now, it appears that these two parties still remain quite far apart. But there is a lot of work to try and bridge the gap. We saw today that Israeli delegation that left for Cairo, Egypt yesterday, they remained there today to continue further negotiations on a separate front, on a separate higher level I should say. The CIA director, Bill Burns, arrived in Israel today meeting with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, as well as the head of the Mossad, David Barnea, to have a high-level conversation about the state of those negotiations. The Israeli war cabinet, as I understand it, is currently meeting right now in reduced numbers given the sensitivity and the importance of the matter to discuss the state of those negotiations. We know that there are several key differences between the proposal that Hamas seems to have agreed to and the one that Israel helped craft with Egypt and tacitly endorse. One of those being, of course, that Hamas is still pushing for Israel to commit to a permanent ceasefire in a second phase of this agreement. There's also the notion that Hamas is saying, look, we're not sure if we have 33 living hostages meeting that first humanitarian category, women, children, the elderly, the sick. And so, they are proposing to fill out the remaining number of those 33 with the bodies of hostages who are dead and who Hamas is still holding in Gaza. An Israeli source of mine familiar with the talks, telling me that that is a total nonstarter. So, those are just two of the issues among several others that are still separating these two sides. And so, it's clear, a lot more negotiation needs to happen. And then, of course, there's the question of political will on both sides. Yahya Sinwar in Gaza, does he want this war to end? Does he want a ceasefire to bring reprieve to the Palestinian people? And same goes for the Israeli prime minister, who is beholden, in many ways, to a right-wing governing coalition that favors a military offensive in Rafah over the release of hostages. So, a lot of different factors at play here. A lot of different pieces of this agreement to still iron out and a lot of uncertainty, Bianna, about whether or not it can be achieved.",

Jeremy Diamond, thank you.Well, now, as the conflict in Gaza continues, fears of a wider war still remain, while last month's exchange of strikes between Israel and Iran appears to have de-escalated for now. Iran's nuclear development, left largely unchecked, is a cause for concern, particularly after Donald Trump pulled out of the nuclear deal in 2018. Rafael Grossi is the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency and met with Iran's nuclear chief just yesterday in hopes of reaching a new package of measures. He joined me from Vienna today to discuss where things stand. Director Grossi, thank you so much for your time. I know Iran and the IAEA are still negotiating a deal from last year to try to expand inspections of the country's nuclear program. You just returned from Iran and you said that cooperation in terms of Iran regarding its nuclear program is \"completely unsatisfactory.\" How specifically is Iran being uncooperative?",

But what I have been saying is that we are not inspecting at the levels and with the degree of visibility that we should be taken into account or given the nature of the program, the breadth and depth of the program. So, the situation in this regard is in a deficit, if you want.

There are other things that are necessary before you can have an operational nuclear warhead.

It is 1-30th that of the United States. So, even though India is growing rapidly, it's from such a low base and it has such a ways to go that you kind of have to see it in that perspective. I think where Modi has done particularly well is infrastructure. So, every year India is building about 6,000 miles of roads. The number of airports has doubled in the last decade. So, all kinds of infrastructural pushes that are led by the prime minister, and he's very good at marketing these wins, he puts his face on every single thing that he can do, that helps. And people see him as moving the needle on some of that. But there are problems. India has a very high unemployment rate, given if you compare it to its peers. More than that, youth unemployment is dangerously high, at about 15 percent. 83 percent of the number of employed in India are actually the country's young. So, in as much as almost half of all Indians are under the age of 28 or so, many of them don't have great prospects in the future. And at some stage, that might catch up with Modi electorally.",

Modi has not done anopen press conference in India where journalists just lob questions at him. He does not sit down for interviews with journalists who are going to ask him tough questions. He has sat down for interviews recently with some Indian outlets as well as \"Newsweek,\" but those interviews are widely seen as ones that were either planned ahead of time or didn't run as actual Q&amp;As. They sounded more like press releases. Freedom of the press in India has declined. If you look at global rankings, India ranks about 161st in the world out of 180 countries for press freedom. That is a ranking that has dropped precipitously in the last decade or so. But by and large, you know, Indians see the media landscape and there isn't enough at this moment internal criticism about the media. And I think that is something that would need to change and India's civil society would need to demand from within changes. Because when they see Interviews like this one, which will be broadcast in India, by the way, and will be dismissed as a western point of view, some of the criticism from within, I think, will be much more powerful, and that's really what India needs more of, domestic media that can speak truth to power.",

That's very popular in a country like India, which, in this current, moment looks down on dynasts. The opposition, the main party nationally, the Congress Party, which is, you know, the party that gave India its first prime minister and many of its early leaders dominated India's early years, it is run by the great grandson of India's first prime minister. He is largely seen as an ineffectual dynast. That may change at some point. But for now, that's the reason why we think India's Modi is going to win.",

But in a new book, journalistAri Berman points out that democracy that is equal representation for all has never really existed in America. In \"Minority Rule: The Right-Wing Attack on the Will of the People and the Fight to Resist It,\" Berman warns that a constitution designed to protect the rights of the privileged faces new threats from a systematic campaign of election subversion. Berman is a veteran reporter on the Voting Rights (INAUDIBLE). And he joins me now. Ari, thank you so much for joining us. Welcome to the program. If we could just get back to that statement that we constantly hear from President Biden, a warning to voters, I would say we've heard it not just in the 2024 election cycle, but in 2020 as well, democracy is on the ballot. What does that even mean? Do you think that line resonates with voters?",

But it's also important to note that this is not a new conversation, that we've been having these debates about political power and about democracy going back to the founding period. And that's what I traced in my book, is that actually, our democratic institutions were not all that democratic when they were created. And there's been this tension throughout American history of who should democracy benefit and who are democratic institutions created for.",

And we now have Republican elected officials who have said in recent weeks that they are concerned that some members, some factions within their party are parroting Russian talking points, Hungarian talking points. I'm talking about Viktor Orban, Vladimir Putin, who was just now inaugurated, and I say that, you know, in air quotes for a fifth term.

They want to create a what's known as in a liberal democracy, right, where you have a democracy in theory, but democratic institutions have been rigged to benefit the party in power. And I think that's what Trump has been trying to do. He has tried to weaponize democratic institutions when those democratic institutions have not worked for him. In the case of losing the 2020 election, for example, he has tried to topple those democratic institutions, and he's really looked to authoritarian regimes abroad as the model, in many ways, for how they want to do things.",

I mean, there wasbasically a very strong consensus after January 6th that this was an awful act. And I'm writing about minority rule in my book, the insurrection was the most brazen attempt to overturn the will of the majority in modern times. And it was repudiated by pretty much every single elected Republican. And now, we have, just a few years later, 70 percent of Republicans saying that they believe the election was stolen, the attempt by Trump and his allies to rewrite the history of January 6th, to turn the insurrectionist into patriots, this is very, very dangerous. And my worry here is that we are normalizing one of the most abnormal things that's happened in American history. And people are just saying either forget it or move on when this was an attack, the worst attack we've had in modern times on the core of U.S. democracy.",

I mean, we were talking about January 6th and the certification back then.

Bush, Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, they would have of course said they would accept the results of the election. And so, this is a way in which Trump has normalized this radicalization against democracy, that the big lie of a stolen election has become a litmus test within the Republican Party, saying that you'll contest the 2024 election is the only way that you'll make the V.P. shortlist, and this just mirrors it a broader movement against democracy within the Republican Party. And one of my frustrations about how the election is being covered is it's being covered as Biden versus Trump, a battle between two personalities, as opposed to the question is, do we have one party that's largely committed to democracy and the other party that's largely committed to authoritarianism? And I think the danger of authoritarianism in this election cannot be overstated. You've covered it a lot of in other countries, Bianna, it's happening right here too. A lot of the illiberal tactics that are going on in all other parts of the world, they're happening in America right now, and it's very alarming the extent to which it's becoming normalized.

You look at thecurrent composition of the Supreme Court, for the first time in U.S. history, five of six conservative justices were appointed by Republican presidents who initially lost the popular vote, and confirmed by senators who represented a minority of Americans. So, the Supreme Court is a product of minority rule, and then they have deepened minority rule by issuing decisions doing things like gutting the Voting Rights Act that has made the country less democratic, doing things that are directly at odds with public opinion, like overturning Roe v. Wade, and then doing things that seem to protect Donald Trump's authoritarianism, like preventing a trial on January 6th, when, as you said, the vast majority, pretty much every major legal expert, says that there's no way that the president enjoys blanket immunity. So, I think the Supreme Court, under the current conservative majority, has both tilted the political system to benefit Trump, and it now seems to be protecting Trump directly. And that's very dangerous in a system of checks and balances, when the court, the Congress, and other institutions are supposed to act as a check when presidents commit lawless acts, like inciting an insurrection.",
