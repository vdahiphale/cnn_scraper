People who have experience operating in that federal district in Miami in the -- in the Southern Florida.And so, we expect that this is probably not the end of this. But he is announcing on his social media platform that Todd Blanche, who is already working on his -- on his behalf in the Manhattan DA case, that he is going to be leading the efforts on his defense of this indictment in Miami. This is the indictment of the classified documents of Mar-a-Lago. He thanked his attorneys, Jim Trusty who you've seen on our air a number of times, and John Rowley. Those are the two attorneys who we've seen a lot of -- who have been handling a lot of the interactions with the Justice Department. But that just what the former president as he is wants to do. He has just made this announcement on his social media platform you know as he is getting ready for Tuesday which is something that behind the scenes, law enforcement is already working on, the secret service, the U.S. marshals. I'll lay out to you what the current plan is, guys, on Tuesday. The former president will be brought down to Miami. The secret service is trying to figure out the best routes. They've come up with a number of specific routes so they bring him safely to the federal courthouse. They're going to just bring him there for processing by the federal marshals. When he enters in that courthouse, he will be given into custody by the U.S. marshals, they'll place him under arrest, formally arrest him, and begin the processing of the former president for these chargers. He is going to be electronically finger-printed so they're -- you know not going to see any chance of the former president merging with ink on the hands and saying this is what they did to me. It's going to be electronic. And secondly, any pictures that the U.S. marshals take which is very -- you know part of the process that goes on there, none of that is releasable. Under the Justice Department rules, they don't allow for the release of booking photographs, Sara.",
