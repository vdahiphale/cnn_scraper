She said, \"I want to read this to you, that Bret Baier now says his mistake, he ran the wrong Trump enemy from within clip during the interview with Harris. News flash, when wrong clips run, which happens, the host can easily say, sorry, that was the wrong clip. And he or his producers would have known it was the wrong one right then. And so that just goes to show you, I think, that it's been a kind of a contrast between the interview that we saw Bret Baier do with Kamala Harris, and then the interviews that he's done in the past with Donald Trump. Actually, our colleagues, Brian Stelter and Liam Riley, did an interesting article comparing these two interviews. And what they found was that Bret Baier interrupted Kamala Harris nearly twice as much as he interrupted Donald Trump. And that the tone of the questions were much different. Obviously, it was a very contentious interview with Vice President Harris -- guys?",

Earlier this year, Reese says she considers her WNBA salary a bonus on top of her endorsements deals, which is how she earns the bulk of her income. CNN sports analyst and author of \"On Her Game, Caitlin Clark and the Revolution of Women's Sports,\" Christine Brennan, is with us now. I mean, Christine, we compare Reese, a seventh overall draft pick in the WNBA, to the seventh overall draft pick in the NBA, $73,000 to his $6 million. And she averages more points.",

Exactly, exactly, Alex, yes.Brittany Griner and so many of these players who go overseas in the off-season of the WNBA, which, of course, is now for many of them, as the playoffs are finishing up over the next, either today or to Sunday, the finals for the WNBA. Brittney Griner wasn't going to Russia for the weather or the ambiance or Vladimir Putin's hospitality. Of course not. She was going to supplement her income. She was going to make money, lots of money, which is where the money can be made, sadly, in WNBA and that these players get overseas. Again, that's about to change, I think, in a big way, moving forward with the new TV rights deal that's four times bigger than the previous one. And that will kick in in 2026. As well as other things in perks that are going to happen because of the Caitlin Clark effect, as you mentioned. But that's what was going on and that's why, in the case of Brittany Griner, Alex, was making about a quarter of million dollars, so about $250,000, which is the high end for the WNBA, and when she went to Russia and Steph Curry was making over $40 million. So that decimal point. Those numbers need to go -- several numbers need to go on the left side of that decimal point for the WNBA players to even get close to the NBA players. No one's, by the way, saying that's going to happen anytime soon. But something that is more equitable and fair. And, yes, the Brittney Griner situation and her imprisonment, that terrible story, that terrible burden that she bore, was bearing, that emanated from this same conversation of the lack of equal pay, equitable pay or any kind of reasonable pay for these wonderful female athletes.",

And there have been so many documents that have been sealed, so many documents redacted, the gag order. As prosecutors said this morning, now you're going to learn the rest of the story. So this story starts back seven years ago, and this is when two young girls, Abby -- Abigail Williams and Libby German, were dropped off at the trail in Delphi, Indiana. This is a large, wooded area. Everybody goes there. Delphi has less than 3,000 people. Everybody knows, everybody. They don't have crime like this. But here is a pivotal piece of evidence that prosecutors talked about in openings today that they say is going to show who did this to the girls. We want to show you one of the girl's cell phones that captured this video -- it's believed very short in time -- before they we're murdered. Law enforcement found the video. They took it to the public years ago to try to find out who did this. It's a man that was on the bridge, right with the girls. Listen to what he says. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
