We are just 47 days from Election Day and we're getting some new polling from the states that will decide the election. And it shows how close the road to 270 really is. In the latest Quinnipiac poll, Kamala Harris now leads Donald Trump 51-46 in a head-to-head matchup in both Michigan and Pennsylvania, this among likely voters. The poll shows no clear leader in Wisconsin, Harris with a one-point edge there. But let's take into the key issues. When asked who would be better at handling immigration, Trump is still leading there, but Harris is gaining ground. Quinnipiac's pollster says these results show, quote, three crucial swing states wave a red flag at the Trump campaign. The GOP's most go-to attack strategies against Democrats on immigration and the economy may be losing momentum. Likely voters now see little daylight in most cases between Harris and Trump on who can best handle those key issues. Now, both candidates were talking about immigration on the trail yesterday. Donald Trump, once again, attacked Haitian migrants in Ohio, while Kamala Harris called out his mass deportation plan. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

She is political editor at \"Bloomberg News\". Laura, good morning. Wonderful to have you. So these -- let's start with a new Quinnipiac polling. It shows honestly some results that I think once I have some more time to call my sources, I might hear a little bit differently from people who are really watching these race racist closely, especially in Pennsylvania. If we could throw those numbers up, at 51 percent, having Harris over 50 in Pennsylvania, I would be surprised if I had a source on the ground who thought the race was this far apart in Pennsylvania. Wisconsin, they're showing as a very, very tight. That's interesting to me, I think a lot of the others, when I when I again talk to sources, they don't necessarily think it is that close in Wisconsin. They think Harris may have a bigger, a bigger edge there and there they are more worried about Pennsylvania. What do you make of these numbers and what they do tell us about the race?",

The two issues we know that will probably decide this election. Biden had a large deficit there, and Harris has been gaining multiple polls have shown that. So that's sort of a sense that that is probably a strength for her that's building.",

She came out this week saying she wanted to limit childcare costs to just 7 percent of income, which would be a big decrease for people, I'm talking about, you know, expanded childcare or child tax credit.So these are things that are resonating.

FOSTERanything new. You'll remember that 2016 election, when Donald Trump called for Russia to find thousands of emails, but only to Hillary Clinton, in the end, Russia did find some emails and try to leak them. So a lot of this isn't new. This is interesting because they're trying to undermine campaigns. There's a separate Russian campaign that Microsoft exact was also talking about, which is simply setting up fake accounts on social media yeah and spreading conspiracy theories. That very much targeted at the Harris-Biden campaigns because they would see Donald Trump I think is probably a favorable to their perspective on the war in Ukraine. They'd rather have that outcome. So it depends which axis you're looking at here and what sort of tactics they're using a fundamentally, they're trying to sow discord in the U.S. election, chaos, and trying to undermine it that way in their own interest.",
