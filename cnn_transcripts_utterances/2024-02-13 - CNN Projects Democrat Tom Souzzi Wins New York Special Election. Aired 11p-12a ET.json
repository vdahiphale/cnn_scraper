      "sentences": "A major victory for Democrats this evening. Tom Souzzi winning the special House election in New York, picking up the seat previously held by the expelled Republican fabulist, George Santos, and eroding the Republicans' already razor-thin majority in the U.S. House of Representatives.Suozzi, a former congressman, now congressman-elect, defeating Republican Mazi Pilip in New York's third congressional district in the Long Island area. Let's take a look at the status of votes right now with 87% of the vote in. Suozzi still has a commanding lead with 54.2% of the vote, 83,405 votes. That's 12,990 votes ahead of Republican Mazi Pilip, who has 45.8% of the vote. This is something of a shellacking in a district that had pulled pretty much neck-and-neck throughout the race. And this is why this House race matters so much. With Suozzi's win, the Democrats win, Democrats will now have 213 House seats compared to 219 with Republicans, with three seats still remaining vacant right now. So that means Republicans now face an even tougher path to push through legislation as the 2024 election year unfolds. With that six-vote majority, they can only afford to lose three republican votes in any one vote. Let's go to Miguel Marquez, who is at Suozzi campaign Headquarters in Woodbury, New York. And Miguel, a huge win for Suozzi and Democrats this evening.",

You know, there was growing confidence when they saw the early votes come in, the absentees, and they kind of felt that they had some momentum going.But the republican machine here in Nassau County is renowned. They can get the vote out. But that snowstorm hit, that may have helped Democrats as well. And I think that they expected to have a decent night tonight. I do not think that they expected to call it this early. You know, Suozzi talking up there today just a short time ago saying that this will send a signal to Democrats everywhere about how they have to win and what they need to win in November. And for Republicans in purple districts, they better pay attention because they are coming for them. It was a very, very sort of strong statement about what worked in this specific race. There were a couple of protesters who tried to break in, but there were shouts of Suozzi, Suozzi as soon as they did, and they moved them out. They also -- to be fair, they also had a mic issue, so he was buying time up there so that people could place their mics up on the lectern because that the system they have here did not work. But, you know, he -- even the protesters showed what a pro he is in campaigning. He basically just said, I love America. He wants people to be able to speak. He's very, very quick. He ran a very, very aggressive campaign and never wasted a minute. His entire campaign staff was completely on it every single day. That's something we did not see out of the republican side.

You're right, in the special election for what was a republican seat, the margin is surprising.So, how does he do it? Number one, in the smaller piece of the district but critical for the Democrats, Queens, the actual part that is New York City, he runs it up, pretty good, right? Sixty-two percent, bringing about 6,000-vote margin there, right? If you come for that, little less than that, but 6,000 votes, that's in the Democrat. You heard him thank labor tonight, very important in this part of the district right here, helping turn out votes. A lot of that done again. Organized labor has a very good early voting program. And you come in here now, Nassau County. This is the part that will be studied. Again, it's one special election. One special election. So, don't project everything through November. However, this will be closely studied. Was it just Tom Souzzi who's a no name? Was it how he handled immigration? Was it how he handled Israel? Was it how he handled the economy? That'll all be studied now because in the suburban part of the district that George Santos won, when he won the seat in 2022, he's getting 53% of the vote. All right, maybe that margin closes a little bit, but 8,000 votes there, right? Remember, I said a little shy of 8,000 votes there. So, he did what he had to do in the Democratic area, but he also won in the more suburban area here, the more affluent, the more highly- educated part of the district. That will be the part that is studied now because this seat now turns blue, right? So, let's come back out -- let's come back out to the big map. Let's come to where the House is right now. Again, that was red when George Santos had it, right? You had this gentleman in the House tonight, Mr. Lawler. He's going to be worried about this, right? Because this is a district Joe Biden carried. He's going to say, okay, what just happened there? Because that used to be a Democratic district as well. I mentioned him because he was in the House tonight. But let's come out to the full map and just show you some districts here. So, again, this might get overdone by people, but that was 18 this morning, right? House districts held by Republicans that Joe Biden carried, that was 18 this morning. When you're trying to figure out what did we learn tonight, this is where Democrats are going to start. They're going to start in the districts that Joe Biden carried. Most of these districts, not all, are somewhat similar to this, meaning they're suburban, they tend to be higher educated, more affluent than the national averages. So, the Democrats are going to look at these, saying, if we want to win back the House majority, there's your building blocks. Doesn't mean because Suozzi won, that the Democrats win these seats, but that's where it goes. So, this is the challenge as you look ahead to November.",

She said that's -- I said, you know, what about a guy like Suozzi? He doesn't even want Biden to campaign. She's like the most important thing is that we get the majority. So, here's my question. Suozzi was obviously given some rope to be independent. You know, to get some leeway, to be independent, to badmouth Biden, to distance himself from other Democrats. Are Republicans who are the majority makers for the majority right now, are they able to do that? Are Congressman Lawler, are LaLota and other Republicans who represent Biden districts, are they allowed to be independent or are they forced to stay in line so that Donald Trump doesn't start attacking them?",

So, will there be some -- will the next race sort of pull people in a direction of saying, look, we actually have to pass something and we're going to convince people that we should be in charge, or is it just still so valuable to large parts of the party who are following Trump to just do the messaging part of it, play the part, do those performances, and don't worry too much about whether or not something passes because you don't want to hand a victory to Biden anyway?",

He has a primary challenge. Others do as well. But that's what I wondered tonight, will some of those Republicans be taking a lesson that Trump may not be good for us in the long term? But I think something else instructive. In the Biden campaign statement tonight, they mentioned Donald Trump four times. They once again are trying to do one thing above all in this election, to make this entire election about Donald Trump. And he often helps them out with that case. But again, as so many people have said this evening, I think there are some lessons tonight, but they're limited as well because the general election is going to be much more fully engaged.

Now, I interviewed Steve Scalise, the House majority leader, a little bit earlier tonight, and I asked him, is there going to be any regret inside the GOP if Democrats do end up flipping this seat tonight? He didn't go quite as far. He said, it is what it is. And he also downplayed the national significance of a potential republican loss in New York three. But no doubt, Kaitlan, this is going to have massive implications for the slim majority and the GOP's ability to govern. And so, those frustrations and floor fights only likely to grow louder in the coming days. Kaitlan?",
