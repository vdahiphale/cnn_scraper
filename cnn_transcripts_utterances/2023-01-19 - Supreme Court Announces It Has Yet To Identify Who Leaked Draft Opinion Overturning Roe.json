They asked the clerks to hand over -- to undertake affidavits, signed affidavits. So they have been doing a fulsome, thorough review here. But the take takeaway on this report released today, January 19th, is that they have been unable to identify anyone particularly responsible for this leak. It remains unanswered. It appears, at this point, guys, it's at a dead-end at this point.",

      "sentences": "All right. Let's also bring in CNN legal analysts, both, and Supreme Court analyst, Joan Biskupic and Steve Vladek.Joan, first to you. What this move means moving forward. Does this mean the end of the investigation, suggesting that we may never know the source of the leak? JOAN BISKUPIC, CNN LEGAL ANALYST &amp; CNN SUPREME COURT ANALYST: Well, as Jessica, yes, that's a very real possibility. They're going to continue, they say. But I'll tell what you this suggests. Since they haven't found out who did it, how it was done, there's a very big question of, how can they prevent it the next time around? This was so stunning. It was the largest breach ever in Supreme Court history, to have this kind of extensive draft, nearly 100 pages released at that early point of the process. And the opinion turned out to be almost identical to what was released. So this was quite stunning. They took about nine months to try to figure out who had done it. They stressed all of the steps they took to try to figure it out, try to eliminate the people in their I.T. section, tried to screen through the law clerks, look at the permanent employees, and came up with nothing. And I think the message they wanted to send is that they were being thorough here. Not only were they using their own resources in the Marshal's office, whoever oversees the police force there, not only were they using those, but they went to an outside private group, the Chertoff Group. I think, you know, the underlying message is, we did everything possible to try to figure out who's done it, but by coming up with nothing -- which, you know -- empty essentially. And, you know, it is a large mystery. Apparently, it is really hard to figure out who did this. But it also lead to the fact that it means, how can they prevent it in the future? Now they mentioned throughout this thing certain security steps they added, some of which they didn't want to obviously broadcast, new security. But will those be enough? Or is there a chance this can happen in the future? Without it knowing hose it than this time, that's a real question. This timing, also I should say, it's interesting. I've been among the people who said , you know, Chief Justice Roberts announced on March 3rd, the day after \"Politico\" published the draft opinion, that he was launching this investigation. Several of us were saying, what did you find, what did you find? It appears, in part, in the report today is in answer to that. Look at the steps they have taken. I think they want to show they were asking competently, smartly, with the resources they had. I do think that message comes through with all the things they did. They says the number of interviews they did, the ways they tried to eliminate various people in the building, various people who had access to the document itself. Yet, as I say, they don't know how to fully prevent it if they don't know how it actually happened.",

Number two, before I got to Congress in the last term, my position has always been clear, that if you're going to continuously increase the debt ceiling, you have to address the long-term spending ramifications and the debt bubble growing in the United States.

They collected that. There were some presumptive tests at the scene to see if it possibly was blood. They took those with them. They also found part of a mattress cover with stains, several hair strands, because they obviously want to try and find the victims associated with him in his apartment. An animal hair strand. Remember, Kaylee had her dog. Nitrate-type black gloves, store receipts. One was from Marshalls. One was from a Dickie's tag, which is a manufacturer of work clothes, heavy duty work clothes. So that is what they received, which is significant because they are able to do more forensic testing on that to try to associate him with that crime scene. Because that's the point, right? They did not find the knife that they asked for. They did not find clothing. They had asked for black pants, black shirts, black masks. The shoe -- remember the shoe imprint that they had found at the scene that had diamonds in it? They did not take any shoes at all. That's significant in and of itself, right, to not find that shoe imprint in his closet? And some other things they took, a computer tower, right? They took a dust container from the Bissell Power Force Vacuum. So all of this could be significant, but they obviously wanted to find more. Now, this is interesting. In all the paperwork, they also say we want a search warrant of his office at Washington State University because he was a PhD criminology student, right? Nothing more is said in the documents about that, if they actually applied for it, if they got it, if they executed a search for the return. But that could be significant.",
