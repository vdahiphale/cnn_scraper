Again -- there's a box there. Yes, you can see this image here. Again homes. You can see it's up to the second stories in some of these areas. Look at this. You've got flash flood warnings, flood watches all around, and it's because of the ongoing -- this is the live radar. So, this is all the rain that's moving through Dallas and headed right for Houston as we speak. And some of that is incredibly heavy rainfall that's going to be coming down. Now, the flood watches are in effect for all that green area you see there. It also does extend into portions of Oklahoma and Arkansas as well because they are also going to get some of that heavy rain. Here's a look at it. By noon -- again, that first wave starts to spread into areas of Louisiana and Arkansas. But then notice these two, you've got that secondary round that's going to fire up later on this afternoon and bring additional showers too. The only good news is that finally, by this evening, we should finally start to see an end to the rain for this area. But it's the short-term that's the concern. Again, take a look at this. This is the area at risk for excessive rainfall. That target point being right over Houston and a lot of the northern suburbs. Yes, part of that is because of the amount of rain we expect today. But also taking into consideration all of it that's already on the ground right now. So, it's that twofold there. And also, the rivers. A lot of them are already many swollen, some to even record high levels, now we're adding more water onto. You've got eight river gauges at major flood stage, 17 at moderate, and 31 at minor flood stage. Then there's also the severe component. Now, for tomorrow -- this is where we're looking at for tomorrow. Again, that target point right there in the center of the country, but it extends from Dallas up to Sioux Falls. Notice too, though, that some of the areas that could see the severe storms tomorrow includes Omaha and Oklahoma City, the same areas that are still recovering from tornadoes that hit there just a little over a week ago. And then Tuesday, we start to see that spread a little bit farther east as well. BLACKWELL: Allison, thanks so much.

And this is what happened.In this video, you can see officers advancing steadily on a group removing umbrellas and tents. At one point, you even see some sort of smoke or mist up in the air. Now, it's still unclear if any sort of chemical agent was deployed. UVA Encampment for Gaza claiming that it was tear gassed but campus police not responding to our requests to verify that claim. The Department of Safety and Security at the university did announce that it was an unlawful assembly on Saturday afternoon. A couple of hours later they declared the situation to be in their words, stable. The university did respond to a request for comment from CNN saying that it had informed the participants repeatedly that the tent policies are in place and that these sorts of tents that were set up violated said policy, and that's what initially prompted the university to respond. But really wider picture, this just reminds us that UVA is really just the latest university where tensions between protesters and the police have resulted in some confrontation.

And Pearl, that little koala actually survived with human assistance.What I saw during my journey is that Australia is a country and a continent that's very much on the front lines of climate change. The natural disasters that some areas are prone to, horrific fires or floods, they're getting more and more unpredictable and more extreme. And another phenomenon that we witnessed, my team and I, were the beginnings of what turned out to be a mass bleaching event on the Great Barrier Reef. This sprawling marine habitat of coral reefs that's the size of Italy where record high ocean temperatures were, you could argue, cooking the coral and killing it. And that's part of a planet-wide trend that we've been seeing for coral reefs around the world with these record-high ocean temperatures. Put together, what we're seeing in Australia is not only natural habitats that under risk and that very much at threat, but also cities and towns. And again and again, I was hearing from ordinary Australians, you know, we've never seen a fire or a flood this bad before and it's prompting some people to consider leaving some of these much more vulnerable communities.
