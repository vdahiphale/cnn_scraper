      "sentences": "The Texans general manager has weighed in with some colorful language. Plus, the White House blindsided as chaos unfolds in South Korea. The country's president declaring martial law, troops marching on the parliament building. Protesters filling the streets. We're live on the ground in Seoul, South Korea, with the latest.Leading this hour, however, a number of top Trump picks on Capitol Hill today as they prepare for their upcoming confirmation fights, and while many Senate Republicans seem completely on board with the president-elect's elections, others are raising potential concerns today. Let's bring in CNN's Kaitlan Collins, who's covering the Trump transition for us in West Palm Beach, Florida. Kaitlan, we're just learning that the Trump team has signed a memorandum of understanding with the U.S. Justice Department, which means that Trump's nominees, including those on the Hill today, will start undergoing background checks. Tell us more. KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN ANCHOR, \"THE SOURCE\": Yes, Jake, this is a notable development given the delay here. Typically, this is something that an incoming president does pretty quickly after they win an election. They do sign this agreement and others with the current administration so this process can start. And obviously, the Justice Department memorandum of understanding has been one of the biggest ones because it does allow the FBI to start conducting those background checks on the senior most aides that Trump is trying to put in his Cabinet or in his top positions inside the White House. It means that they can start looking at classified information as well as this begins to get underway. And the reason, Jake, that this is so notable that it's happening now is because we are hearing from a lot more vocal Republican senators saying that they do want to see the FBI conduct background checks, that the ones that the Trump team had talked about having private investigators or private companies carry out just was not going to carry the same weight with these Republican senators, some of whom may be on the fence about some of these nominees when it comes to how they're vetting and looking at them. Because obviously the FBI background check process is done to make sure that these people have a full understanding of what is in their background and whether or not they should be trusted with the nation's most classified secrets. And so looking at that from that perspective, Jake, this is announcement that came today from the Trump team with a statement from the incoming chief of staff, Susie Wiles, about getting this process going because there had been some concerns internally. One, the Republican senators were going to ultimately demand this, certainly those that are on the fence, and two, that it would delay the confirmation process because typically for the attorney general, for the secretary of state, for those top jobs, those are done pretty quickly after the incoming president is inaugurated because they need those people in place that those obviously those key and critical agencies, Jake. And so a few things, though, to note here. One, it's not totally clear that they are going to submit all of Trump's picks to get background checks. That is something that we're still trying to determine from our sources of what this process is going to look like and if every cabinet pick is actually going to have to submit to an FBI background check for these senators who are going to be vetting them and what that looks like. And Jake, I'll also remind you, this was a big issue in Trump's first term when it came to security clearances. It led to the ouster of his staff secretary, Rob Porter, after they found troubling information in his background in regards to women. But also when there was -- Trump was given advice by top officials in his administration not to grant Jared Kushner a security clearance, he overrode those concerns and granted him one anyway, even though he had said at the time that he wasn't going to be involved in that process. So how this all shakes out still matters, Jake. But this is notable because it does jumpstart that process as we were hearing from key Republican senators saying that they did want to see background checks.",

And they specifically asked the judge to once again read them the instructions as it relates to the law and the charges. Now that's interesting, Jake, and I'll tell you why. The judge in this case was very clear in his instructions. In order for the jury to find the defendant guilty, they have to find that Daniel Penny was justified in his actions.And there are two charges here. The first count is manslaughter in the second degree. The second count is criminally negligent homicide. They cannot convict him on both charges. Now, if the jury finds that the evidence showed beyond the reasonable doubt that Daniel Penny was justified in his actions, then the jury must acquit. Now, the assistant district attorney, Dafna Yoran, focused on justification during her closing arguments today, saying that Penny had, quote, \"Needlessly, recklessly and unjustifiably killed Jordan Neely.\" She called the case tragic. At one point, even saying that Daniel Penny had the right intentions. But then she said, quote, \"The defendant started out trying to do the right thing, as the chokehold progressed, the defendant knew that Jordan Neely was in great distress and dying, and he needlessly continued. The defendant was given all the signs that he needed to stop. He ignored them and he kept going until a man died. He must be held accountable for that.\" So it's in the hands of the jury now, Jake. And if Daniel Penny is convicted, he could face up to 15 years in prison on the top charge. The defense, as you know, has said that their client was simply responding to a threat posed by Jordan Neely and that his only intention was to protect his fellow passengers. We expect deliberations to continue tomorrow morning. And there are some real political implications in this case to be considered. Some New Yorkers believe that Penny should not have been prosecuted and that Alvin Bragg, the district attorney here in Manhattan, was responding to political pressure when he decided to prosecute the case.

But when you restrain someone, if that person becomes unconscious or is in any event no longer the threat that was the reason for this restraint in the first place. You really ought to think about easing up. I mean, you know, Daniel Penny of course, is not saying necessarily, at least out loud that he wishes it didn't happen this way because he has this causation argument that Stacy talked about. But you can bet that he does, right? That he wishes that he had eased up, let the other passengers help, just hold him down until they got to the station, and that would have been it.

Yet, that's not stopping a push to release this much discussed House Ethics Committee report. This afternoon, Democratic Congressman Sean Casten of the State of Illinois re-upped a resolution to get the entire House Ethics Committee report released. And he joins us now. Congressman Casten, thanks so much for joining.You're calling for a vote to release the report. Matt Gaetz is no longer in contention to be Attorney General. He's currently not even in public office. Why should a report centered on allegations Gaetz is denied be made public? REP. SEAN CASTEN (D-IL): Because ultimately, we have to hold ourselves to a higher standard. The -- there is an ample precedent. There have in fact, in going back to 1987, there have been at least four members of Congress we've identified who were under ethics investigation, who resigned. And that ethics report was completed and in three of those cases was then released to the public. And that's important because the reason we have the Ethics Committee is to make sure that we hold ourselves to the higher standard. The American people look to us and say Congress comports themselves with a dignity. These charges against Mr. Gaetz, allegations to be sure. But these charges are -- are -- are damning and disgusting sex with a 17- year-old child. If we say that you can simply resign from Congress and then all of these problems go away, then we would have to assume that this institution that I love will fall in public respect in the way that so many institutions that we are all aware of who have shuffled sexual assault allegations under the rug, who have moved people around, who have allowed them to resign their way out of disclosure, the way that the respect for those institutions have fallen. And I don't want and I don't think we as Americans can afford to have the U.S. Congress fall down to those levels of disrespect.",

In terms of the calendar, that means Thursday. The -- now to be fair, this could go away if the Ethics Committee released their report. I would remind your viewers that the Ethics Committee was prepared to release this in July. They were then prepared again to release it in November. They're now saying they're meeting on this Thursday as well. So if they release the report, we have nothing to do. But we just need to make sure that Congress is saying that a closed door meeting of the Ethics Committee cannot be the last word if that last word is to shovel this under the rug.",

These, you know, these women who came forward very bravely in a private situation and disclosed fairly, you know, in -- intimate information to the committee, we want to make sure that we've got every ability to protect their information.

There are a ton of ethics cases where, you know, maybe it's a political, you know, somebody wants to file a political claim against somebody. The Ethics Committee investigates says there's no smoke there's no need to release that information. So I don't think that's a precise comparison. But where we have a situation where we know objectively that Matt Gaetz resigned from Congress in order to prevent this from becoming public, that is the precedent we need to protect ourselves from.

The airline has since announced she will be flown out tomorrow with two French security escorts.Joining us now, pilot and CNN aerospace analyst, Miles O'Brien. Miles, what do you make of this latest twist in the saga? MILES O'BRIEN, CNN AVIATION ANALYST: Well Jake, I -- I think Delta is a little concerned about the fact that she was rather difficult when they tried to return her over the weekend, to say the least, so much so that the pilot had her removed from the flight. So they want to make sure there's an appropriate amount of security around her. It is the responsibility of the airline to return individuals who arrive in another country without the appropriate visa or passport, and they face all kinds of penalties and fines if they don't do it. And they have to be transporting them back to the point of origin. So it's on Delta to do this. But clearly they're concerned about their -- their other customers on the airplane at this point.",

If it was discovered much sooner, and as you know, it was discovered just before landing at Charles de Gaulle, which is kind of interesting on its own right. But if it had occurred within a few hours of departure of JFK, they probably would have turned the plane back around to avoid, if nothing else, the penalties and fines which Delta now faces for allowing this individual to arrive in Paris without a visa to be inside the Schengen line.",

It's a topic you and I have discussed in the past. And, you know, it's all the way back nine years ago was the concussion movie. And I think that woke a lot of people up around the country, not even necessarily football fans, about the dangers of concussion. The NFL has had players who have killed themselves, shooting themselves in the heart so that their brains could be studied. This is a serious issue. It has been. If it -- even if maybe public attention has waned a bit over the last few years since the movie and since the attention back about 10 years ago. But the reality is the NFL has taken this seriously. And Al-Shaair has had punched a player, a Chicago Bear earlier in the year. He's had two instances of late hits. So this is about fourth now on the list of things that he has done, mistakes he has made, penalties or bad play in this season alone, Jake.
