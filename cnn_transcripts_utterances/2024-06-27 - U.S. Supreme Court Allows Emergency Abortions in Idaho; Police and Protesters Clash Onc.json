      "sentences": "Well, both of them were anticipating questions about abortion and reproductive rights from the beginning. The way they were going to handlethem are really very different. We know on one side, the Biden team was really planning on playing it up, talking about the fact that Donald Trump is really the modern day architect of the overturning of Roe v. Wade. They want to bring back some of the passion that they've seen in voters in the past two election cycles when it comes to reproductive rights and abortion. So, despite -- or even with the ruling today, they were still planning on really honing in on reproductive rights and attacking Donald Trump over that. Now, Donald Trump on the other side, they have spent a lot of time preparing for questions on abortion, on reproductive rights. But just remember, for the last several months, even longer, we have seen Donald Trump tried to walk a fine line between one  cleaning that he has overturned Roe v. Wade, but also too, staying away from the topic of abortion overall. He doesn't believe that it's a real strong political winner for himself or for the Republican Party. So, what you're likely to see tonight on Donald Trump's side, and this is coming from some of the senior advisors, is, he's going to continue with that line. We've heard time and time again that yes, overturned Roe v. Wade, but he kicked it back to the states, and that's the final decision maker. What you're going to hear in a little bit of a change there is, after he is done, expect to see him doing some pivoting, to go back to focusing on issues like inflation, like crime, like immigration, because they don't want him to spend too much time on the issues that they know are not helpful to him with American voters. They want him to really hone in on that core messaging.",

That's one of the reasons why Biden wanted this debate to happen in June which is far earlier than debates have been in previous cycles, usually you get them in September and through October. So, the president is under real pressure to try and shake up this race, which has actually been pretty stable ever since the candidates or Republican nomination started campaigning more than a year ago.",

So, that is exactly what he's going to try and do tonight, is to cast that comparison. What Biden over Trump is going to try and do is try to make the election a referendum on Biden's first term. He's going to narrow in on high immigration, the sense of lost economic security among Americans. He's going to paint a dystopian picture of a country soiled by violent crime, which if isn't true, it can still be a powerful message. So, as Sara was saying, it's really interesting that we've got two presidents who are standing on stage and both of their first term legacies will be under the microscope. The one that succeeds, I think, in making the election about the other is probably the one that's going to win in November.",

The far-right populist side of American politics believes that there is this entrenched bureaucracy that makes it even impossible for Republican presence to carry out their most conservative policies. What Trump and his allies are proposing is to wash out that bureaucracy, what he calls the deep state.

Of course, we won't be on tomorrow because at the same time of our show, you'll get to watch the full debate. And just hours before the debate, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a major decision on abortion, a topic that certainty -- that's certain to really play a role as we head for Kristen Holmes at the top in tonight's showdown. Justices rule 6-3 to allow emergency abortions in Idaho, a day after the opinion was mistakenly posted on the course's website. We brought you that breaking news just yesterday, three conservative members of the court sided with their liberal counterparts. In another major decision, the court ruled that the family that owns Purdue Pharma cannot be shielded from further legal action against them involving the opioid crisis in the United States under the terms of a multi-billion-dollar settlement, the Sackler family was protected from any future lawsuits. A very busy day, of course. Justice correspondent Jessica Schneider has been keeping an eye on it all for us. So, Jessica, four opinions released today, but let's start first with this Idaho abortion ban, which of course, you and I, we were talking about this inadvertently posted yesterday.

And really, this is a decision that at least for right now, it holds this Idaho law that was in near-total ban on abortion. What it doesn't do though, Isa, is it doesn't definitively decide if this whole Idaho law is proper or maybe as the Biden administration had argued, if it improperly conflicts with this other federal law that requires doctors in emergency rooms to perform abortions if necessary, to prevent severe injury to a woman. Because remember, conversely, the Idaho law only allows abortions if death is imminent. So, this is just an incremental win for the women and doctors in Idaho.",

The Kenyan National Commission on human rights said that there is some national anger in the country that President Ruto has to address or it threatens to blow over. And I think that's what you saw today. Again, mostly young people, some of them told me they have nothing to live for, I have to fight for my future. And the disillusionment here, the disappointment is in President Ruto specifically, because he came into power on the back of young people's votes, who saw him -- in him, a reflection of themselves. He said he is the son of a nobody, if he was elected, he would make sure the country -- that Kenya is a country for everybody. And so, that hustler- in-chief narrative was very popular with the young people who feel disenfranchised, who feel cheated when President Ruto has had to introduce a raft of taxes to make sure that he can raise revenue and pay off debt.

Just give us a sense of -- from your conversations that you've had, what voters want to see. What kind of clarity are they looking for here, Tia? TIA MITCHELL, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, ATLANTA JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION:  Well, I think, number one, voters are just needing to tap in. And I think that's something both campaigns are aware of. Democrats, of course, feel that voters aren't listening to Trump and what Trump has been saying about what a second term could look like for him. But I think Republicans also feel that if voters listen to Biden, they might find that the Biden vision is out of step with their reality and their needs. So, on both sides, I think it's not so much that people have their own opinion -- well, people have their own opinions, but they're not always based in what the candidates are actually saying.

Now, Donald Trump, we know is not necessarily the policy guy, but for him, he would like to have a chance to create a narrative about the Biden administration, about Biden being an unfit president. That's something he believes and would like to communicate that to voters. But I think he would like to also create a narrative of Biden's America, if you will, that's overrun by immigrants, that's high crime in cities and where people are struggling to pay their bills and buy food.

On the Democratic side, there was a lot of energy around Jon Ossoff, the first Jewish senator from the deep south. And Raphael Warnock, the first black senator elected as a Democrat in the deep South. And so, Biden kind of has to stand on his own.

Israel said it's ready for war with Hezbollah, if necessary, as cross-border attacks have been escalating for the last several weeks. Israel says a rocket attack from Lebanon sparked fires in the town of Metula that happened yesterday. And Lebanon's state news agency reports an Israeli strike on a town in Southern Lebanon has injured 19 people. Well, the IDF say an Israeli sniper team commander was killed today during a military operation in the West Back town -- West Bank town, I should say, pardon me, of Jenin. It says 16 other soldiers were wounded when planted devices exploded. Islamic Jihad is claiming responsibility for an attack on Israeli military vehicles. Israel has dramatically escalated raids in the West Bank, as we've been told -- we told you just a week ago, and is drawing condemnation for this incident last weekend. Video surfaced showing an injured Palestinian man strapped to the hood, as you can see there, of a moving IDF vehicle in Jenin. Israel says it's investigating. Turning our attention to Iran, Iran's presidential election is just hours away, and two candidates have dropped out ahead of the polls, opening on Friday, leaving three conservative leaning and one reformist candidate in the race. The election was called after President Ebrahim Raisi died in a helicopter crash last month, and it comes amid high tensions over the economy and of course, the politics. Well, Israel and Iran are just two of the countries that we'll be watching closely to see who triumphs in the 2024 presidential election.

So, of course, Prime Minister Netanyahu will watch that closely because should he therefore just sort of carry on with his own policy and try to run out President Biden's presidency? If that's the gamble that he wants to take. Does that seem attractive to him? But also, let's say, the Saudis will be interested.

They think the climate change is going to cost them out of their pocket. So, they don't like it, or avoiding climate change will. So, on that, while the leaders may look at it and listen to what Trump says and recognize -- again, he may be an outlier as he was last time with the Climate Accord in Paris.
