      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to CNN \"Newsroom\", I'm Bianca Nobilo in London filling in for Max. Just ahead, change at the top. Ukraine's President replaces his Defense Minister right in the middle of a crucial counter offensive.Trying to avoid a food crisis, Turkish President Erdogan is meeting with President Putin in Russia, hoping to revive a Grain Deal with Kyiv. And bogged down at the Burning Man Festival, the Nevada desert turns into a mud bath and thousands of revelers are stuck. Three months into Ukraine's grueling counter offensive, a major military shakeup is underway and it is happening at a critical time. Earlier Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov turned in his resignation to Parliament, paving the way for Rustem Umerov to take his place. It comes one day after President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced Reznikov's dismissal. Meanwhile, NATO country Romania is condemning Russian drone attacks just across its border on Sunday in Ukraine's Odessa region that targeted civilian infrastructure. CNN's Melissa Bell joins me now in Ukraine South Central Dnipro region. Melissa, what impact is this change of Defense Minister likely to have?",

      "sentences": "Well, this incoming Minister of force takes over, Bianca, at a critical time. I think it should be made clear, though, that Oleksiy Reznikov had asked to step down, even if his resignation and his replacement do draw a line on what had been 18 months of very strong showing at the helm of what was a difficult task.But also a ministry, the Defense Ministry here in Ukraine that was plagued by allegations of corruption. There were procurement contracts that were investigated. Minister, Deputy Ministers have been sacked senior officials from within the ministry have paid the price and President Zelenskyy has been very keen to draw a line under that. The first few months of the war that did see some of these allegations emerge. And I think it should be specified. Also, Bianca, that we'll be talking about were largely allegations that concerned Ukrainian taxpayers money and Ukrainian weaponry in the very start the chaotic first few days of the wars, they sought to ramp up their military effort. What President Zelenskyy is trying to show at the moment, not just through this replacement, but also through a number of corruption cases, trials, sackings is that he's very keen to draw a line under those 18 months. And that is, of course, because it is about the war effort and convincing NATO allies. That they need to keep and in good faith and kill it delivering their weapons and their help to Ukraine. But it is about the longer term aims of Ukraine to join NATO. And perhaps even more than that, the long standing aim back from 2014 and started all this, or their aim to join the European Union. So this change does signal from the point of view President Zelenskyy a fresh page, the man who's taking over consider a very safe pair of hands. But he is coming in at a very critical time, Bianca, because it isn't just that it's about keeping all those many different parts of the alliance together and committed to this long term war effort here in Ukraine. And we're talking about money. We're talking about the arsenals of the countries involved with their own political changes and agendas, but it is about ramping up Ukraine's war capability, the long term weapons that will allow them to achieve their strategic aim of bringing this war to Russia, something they've been doing more and more clearly, Bianca.",

Vladimir Putin says he's open to negotiations on the Black Sea Grain Deal after withdrawing from the U.N. brokered initiative back in July. The Russian President is hosting his Turkish counterpart for talks in Sochi.Recep Tayyip Erdogan is trying to convince the Russian leader to re- enter the deal, which would allow Ukraine to export grain and ease a global food crisis. Nic Robertson joins me now to discuss that. Nic, could you expand a bit on the real politic of the situation? Why could it be in Putin's interest to re-enter this deal?",

World Leaders, scientists and environmental activists are convening in Nairobi, Kenya to address the urgent consequences of climate change. The three day Africa climate summit hopes to bring rich nations together with developing ones to find climate solutions that work for everyone. Organizers are hoping to showcase Africa as a place for climate investment. Let's bring in CNN is Larry Madowo, in Nairobi with more. Larry, obviously there's been many overtures to these kinds of plans for a long time now. Is there momentum and hope that this summit will actually deliver some real meaningful progress?",

      "sentences": "That's what the Kenyan presidency and the African Union are hoping they are co organizing this Africa Climate Summit, which is a key stepping stone into COP 28 later this year in Dubai. And the Kenyan President William Ruto has been very unequivocal about his ambitions for the summit for bringing all these experts on the climate crisis to get a Nairobies as well as the leaders who are most affected of the country's most affected.He pointed out, for instance, that Africa's carbon footprint is minimal. But the human toll of climate change is felt especially hard here, one example. And he's a Former Agriculture Minister in Kenya so he understands this. Since 1961, Africa has lost about a third of its agricultural productivity due to climate change. And that's why it's important for African leaders via chipsets to talk about loss and damage and finding financial mechanisms to make sure that people are protected here. So the momentum is a little slow. And that's why this conference acknowledges that there has been a division between the global north and the global south about how to address these issues. How to attend to the very real challenges facing the climate and they hope that they can find a way forward to build that momentum you talk about. So, one of the ways that looking at is taxes, taxes on fossil fuels, taxing industries that are especially harmful, such as aviation and maritime. But these are issues that tend to be very political at these conversations, whether it's a COP 28, any of the global gatherings or the U.N. General Assembly, because the countries in the Global South like Kenya, like small island nations feel that they are the worst affected. But often the ones that are least represented in these global conversations. And so they hope that by having this here in Nairobi, they can begin to find a way forward to COP 28, and especially making sure that financial flows are locked or unlocked from the rest of the world into places like Kenya that are most affected, Bianca.",

Well, according to China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs Premier Li Qiang will be at the gathering in New Delhi and this is the clearest sign yet that Xi is not attending the summit amid speculation that he would be a no show. Today Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ning said this \"At the invitation of the government of the Republic of India, Premier of the State Council Li Qiang will attend the 18th G20 Summit to be held in New Delhi, India on September 9 and 10.\" There was no mention of Xi in this statement.Now Xi has attended all other in person G 20 meetings since becoming President in 2013. In 2021, during the COVID 19 pandemic, he joined via video link. At this year's G 20, Xi would be missing out on key conversations on climate in Ukraine. And his expected no show New Delhi comes is China and India clash over a border dispute. It also comes as China battles a number of economic challenges with one of the country's largest homebuilders warning of default. On Sunday, the U.S. President Joe Biden told reporters that he was disappointed that Xi was not attending the summit, but suggested that he will be meeting with him in the future. And Biden did not elaborate U.S. tensions and tensions with China have flared over Taiwan trade and territorial disputes in the South China Sea and in a bid to stabilize the relationship. A number of senior Biden officials have visited China in recent months, including the U.S. Commerce Secretary. President Biden previously told CNN that he would be meeting with Xi Jinping in the fall, and they may still have an opportunity to speak on the sidelines of the APEC summit in San Francisco in November. Biden and Xi last spoke on the sidelines of the G 20 in Bali last November. And that has been the only in person encounter between the two leaders since Biden took office in 2021.
