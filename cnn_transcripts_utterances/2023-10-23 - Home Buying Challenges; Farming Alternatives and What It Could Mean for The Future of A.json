A lotof big farms in the United States rely on pesticides to battle pesky weeds, bugs, and diseases that can ruin crops, but they`re not cheap. And maybe there is a safer way to protect the crops that we consume. CNN`s Derek Van Dam went on a trip to Southern California to learn about something called regenerative farming, a method from the past that just may become the future of farming.
