Altogether, we are now talking of about 20 classified records that the Biden team has found and turned over to the Justice Department. The shifting story line has created a major political and legal headache for the president, who is now the subject of an investigation by a special counsel appointed in recent days by Attorney General Merrick Garland. This all began through discovery of government records, including 10 classified documents from the Obama era, at a private office in Washington that Biden used during the presidency of Donald Trump. And a second set of classified documents was found in Delaware on December 20th. But the White House didn't disclose any of this until just this week. Even then, they told him this leading story of only mentioning the set of 10 documents. The president's personal lawyer, Bob Bauer, issued a statement saying, \"Team Biden has tried to be forthcoming and cooperative.\" He said, \"The president's personal attorneys have attempted to balance the importance of public transparency where important and the norms necessary to protect the investigation's integrity.\" We should note that the Justice Department didn't prohibit the White House from disclosing everything that the president's team has turned over. We don't know the level of classification of the latest records that were found. But we do know that, among the initial batch of ten were documents marked TS/SPI, sensitive compartmented information. Now, these are among the most sensitive government secrets, which raise grave concerns about the exposure of sources and methods.

Plus, could President Biden be in more political trouble now that a special counsel is investigating him for having classified documents at his home than legal trouble? But next, a damaged spacecraft sits at the International Space Station. So how will Russia bring two cosmonauts and one NASA astronaut home? (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [20:15:20] BROWN: It is easy to call for a ride when you are stranded on a night out. But what if you are orbited above the earth? Two Russian cosmonauts and an American astronaut have been left stranded on the International Space Station after a significant leak in their original spacecraft one month ago. Now, Russian Space Agency, Roscosmos, plans to send a new spacecraft up to the space station but not for another six weeks. With us tonight is former International Space Station commander and retired NASA astronaut, Leroy Chiao. Hi, Leroy. So these cosmonauts have been stranded without a ride home for a month now. I mean, it is one thing if you are on earth and can't find a ride. It is another thing if you're in space. Their new spacecraft is supposed to launch February 20th. That's another month away. If an emergency were to happen, how would the crew get home? What would happen? LEROY CHIAO, RETIRED NASA ASTRONAUT &amp; FORMER INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION COMMANDER: This is something that has never happened before, we haven't faced before, but it highlights that space flight is still full of calculated risks. Their spacecraft was damaged, it looks, by a micro-meteorite strike that damaged a radiator, caused all the cooling fluid to leak out into space. The assessment was that they weren't comfortable, the Russian's, Roscosmos, the Russian engineers weren't comfortable in using that spacecraft to bring home the two cosmonauts and American astronaut, Frank Rubio. So they are going to send this other replacement vehicle up. But in the interim, in the time being when the problem was detected a couple weeks to the launch about six weeks from now, we have an exposure there. So what would happen if there was an issue they needed to get down? NASA has been working with the Russians to look at options. But, you know, ultimately, if push came to shove, they would probably try to come home in that damaged vehicle. The issue, of course, is that things would get hot. Of course, the crew would be hot. But the bigger issue is the computers would be hot and would they continue to operate.",

Most of them like the size of a grain of sand and they're not too big of a worry. But then there are the man-made pieces, the human-caused junk from spent booster rockets, pieces falling off of satellites and spacecraft and the odd anti-satellite weapon test that spreads debris. So the stuff stays up there a while depending on its mass and altitude and speed and all those things. But that is the biggest concern for all spacecraft.

They're bringing themselves down in a control manner, making sure they burn up in the atmosphere and anything that survives stays away from major cities and shipping lanes and things like that. So that's part of the solution. There have been different proposals on how to clean up space junk. Frankly, none of them to me have been very viable. But, you know, there's -- the stuff will eventually come down on its own by and large, but it takes time. The problem is, of course, if you keep generating more  -- and hopefully, more people adopt kind of these smart designs -- then hopefully, we can reduce the total amount of stuff up there.",

And that causes things like mudslides. One mudslide that crashed into the back of this apartment complex -- that's why you see yellow tape up there right now. Luckily, the people inside are OK. But 19 people had to be evacuated. Some of the other dangerous situations that we're learning about, just this afternoon, the Orange County Fire Authority shared this amazing video on social media showing how multiple swift-water rescue teams responded when, at about 3:30 p.m. local time, they received a call about a person stuck in a tree after there was swift moving waters in the creek. And those multiple teams got together and got that person to safety. You can just see that incredible effort by first responders to get that person to safety. And we also have seen incredible video from Pescadero, California -- photos, rather, from Cal Fire sharing that part of the roadway there really gave way and fell off a cliff.

And I have to confess, all the way through this classified document of battle, I've wondered, would they do it twice? If the Justice Department felt that it was going to move forward on indicting Trump for mishandling classified documents, would they then go forward on a second time to indict him on his role in trying to overturn the 2020 election? And that's what I mean by in some ways, if this Biden problem makes it less likely that the Justice Department acts on the classified documents, does that really -- does it possibly give them more latitude to deal with, but I think most Americans will agree is the bigger issue Trump's role in trying to overturn the 2020 election and in triggering the insurrection of January 6.",

Just insofar as my film tour taking our documentary around the world, I have been approached by dozens, if not hundreds of young Russian people, young Russian men and women, newly exiled from their country who for the first time through our film, were able to see a glimmer of hope to imagine a Russia without Vladimir Putin.

We want to dissuade the regime from killing him in prison. We want to dissuade the regime from ending his life. And I think we do that by making the consequences, outweigh the benefits. We do that by putting pressure on foreign governments. We do that by making sure everybody in the world can see this now, know the name Alexei Navalny, and make sure the name Navalny is synonymous with political injustice and the world's foremost political prisoner.
