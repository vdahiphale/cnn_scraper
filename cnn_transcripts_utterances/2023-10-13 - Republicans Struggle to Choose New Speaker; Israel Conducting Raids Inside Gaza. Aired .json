That's how the IDF phrases it, but, more importantly, to try and locate some of the hostages that we know, between 100 and 150 of them, remember, Israelis mainly, inside the Gaza Strip, scattered across the whole area in unknown locations. And it just underlines just how much danger there is for the military planners, how complicated it's going to be to try and conduct a big military operation with all those people on the ground.

I just want to tick through this so that people really understand. On September 28, so just over a week before, there was an assessment pulled from multiple streams of intelligence that pointed to Hamas possibly escalating rocket attacks across the border with Israel, between Gaza and Israel. And then, on October 5, so just two days before the attack, there was a product from the CIA that warned generally of the increasing possibility of violence by Hamas. And then there was this report that was circulated from the Israelis on October 6 that pointed to a change in behavior by Hamas, indicating unusual activity, those indications, we now understand, that this attack was imminent. The problem, Anderson, we're told from sources, is that warnings like this, the warning of violence by Hamas, the possibility of cross- border attacks, that had become the norm. But, taken all together, these three different products, warnings from Middle Eastern allies, it does beg the question if, at this moment, the U.S., the Biden administration, and the Israelis were taking this seriously enough. Now, I spoke with two senior officials from Middle Eastern countries who said that, over the course of the past year or more, they had repeatedly in all kinds of meetings with the White House, with the intelligence community, with the military raised the possibility of significant violence. And these sources say that, in all these meetings, that they were ignored, that the administration simply didn't understand the prospect of violence that Hamas could have carried out. There was an assumption -- and a senior Israeli official told me this as well -- that the next round of violence would simply look like previous rounds of violence, missiles flying across the border. Of course, we know now, Anderson, that it was extremely different, and it was much more deadly.",

So, that's the job of Austin in the region. But as you have spoken about, Anderson, Blinken also in the region trying to make headway not only on the hostage rescue effort, speaking with officials in Qatar and other Arab countries, but also says he's working with and the U.S. is working with international aid organizations to try to ensure any sort of safe zone in Gaza that civilians could go to, all of this a very great challenge for Blinken and Austin as they make their rounds there.",

The fear, of course, is that Hezbollah could open up essentially an operation into Israel, war coming from the north. How big of a problem could that be for IDF forces as they try to go into Gaza? BRIG. GEN. JAMES \"SPIDER\" MARKS (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Yes, Boris, the big question is, Israel has dealt with multiple fronts before. So, the question is the magnitude of what just occurred in Gaza, will it distract the IDF? I don't think it will. But the concern is, do they get target-focused down in Gaza and not pay enough attention to what's happening in the north? My short answer to that is, I don't think that's a concern. There's been a mobilization of close to 300,000 additional soldiers. What you see in the vicinity of the Gaza in Northern Israel, Southern Lebanon, it's one of the most highly patrolled militarized area in the world today. So, Israel, as a matter of routine, has a number of highly trained personnel. Plus, it has some really good intelligence capabilities that stretch across the border into Southern Lebanon.
