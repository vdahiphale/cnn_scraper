So, presumably, it will impact Russia's ability to lay waste to large parts of Ukraine. Not stop it, but at least impact it.The question is, does this lead to escalation, right?

It's an obvious strategy. It gets cold there in the winter. And this is forgotten on this.So, it's rich of the Kremlin spokesperson to talk about throwing fuel on the fire when Russia does that literally every day, right, since it invaded the country by its own choice in February of 2022. The trouble is, you have Americans that echo those arguments.

Now, Trump originally was a little bit skeptical about crypto. He said it was based on thin air. He has come around though. He is - he accepted crypto donations for his campaign. He attended a bitcoin conference in July. And he's surrounding himself with crypto friendly advisers. Elon Musk, well known, Howard Lutnick, who is actually being considered for Treasury secretary, and then some other big people in the crypto world. He's also helped create a crypto company, along with his family. World Liberty Financial. So, he has been promoting that on the campaign trail.

Thanks for coming in. And what John and Vanessa were talking about there is just, one, just noting how crypto stocks have just skyrocketed since the election, and also what - that this could - we could - we could be looking at the most pro-crypto Congress ever going forward. You've been pushing Democrats to be more supportive of cryptocurrency for some time now. If this does become the most crypto - pro-crypto Congress ever, is that a good thing? Is less regulation on this industry really an answer? REP. RO KHANNA (D-CA): Well, what we need is smart regulation. But here's what crypto does. There are three fundamental value aspects to it. One, it allows a store of value. It's a modern digital gold for a lot of young people. Two, it allows cross-border payments and a lot of the rest of the world transacts with it. So, with stablecoin (ph) it actually helps the dollar gain more adoption in the rest of the world. And third, if companies succeed to reduce merchant costs, it can eliminate some of the 3 percent middleman fee. So, my view is, it's an innovation. It has use cases. It needs to be properly regulated. But we shouldn't just reflexively be against it.",

So, where there are areas that there may be agreement, the Democrats should say, OK, let's work together.

Tulsi Gabbard, they should ask the views on Ukraine. On Representative Gaetz, they should ask questions about the politicization of the Justice Department and what is he - what is his views and make sure that the ethics report comes out.I think that if the Democrats approach this - these hearings factually with questions, it will allow the American people and the senators to decide.

And so now we're considering having to spend it before the holiday travel rush.You know, people really love to hate on Spirit, but I really want to tell you why you should care about this, even if you don't fly on Spirit, because it is an airline that really changed the industry, ushered in that term ultra-low-cost carrier. And that forced the major airlines to introduce the notorious basic economy fare. So, this really could have seismic implications for every other U.S.-based airline. It's a competitive industry, so this maybe could lead to ticket prices going up industry wide. Here is the good news, if you have a ticket or a credit on Spirit Airlines, you will not notice any change for now. Spirit insists in a statement this morning that guests can continue to book and fly without interruption, and can use all tickets, credits and loyalty points as normal. Also, no impact to workers. We're hearing from Spirit's flight attendants' union that they will remain on the job, their contract is in place, no changes to pay or benefits. So, no immediate furloughs like we saw airlines begin to implement during the pandemic. Also, Spirit underscores that its vendors will continue to get paid. Big questions now about what will happen to Spirit Airlines in the long run. Remember, Frontier Airlines tried to merge with Spirit back in 2022. Just a few months later, JetBlue topped that offer. But it's the acquisition of Spirit that was blocked by the Justice Department on antitrust grounds. And then Frontier ended its merger plans with Spirit earlier this month. So, no apparent lifeboats right now for Spirit Airlines, saddled with $3 billion in debt. Now it is really on passengers to pay attention. A top airline consumer advocate tells me that routes could begin to be eliminated in the coming months. It's really important for passengers to stay proactive, sign up for the alerts, check your flight status online obsessively. One silver lining here, no real impact on Thanksgiving or holiday travel, this consumer advocate tells me, with the Thanksgiving rush just days away.

It used to be a five-day period, starting with Wednesday and ending with the Sunday after Thanksgiving. Now it is a seven-day period, driven largely by the fact that a lot of people can work from home and a lot of people are waiting until after the Thanksgiving rush, the typical Thanksgiving rush, to begin to come home.So, 71 million people will drive 50 miles or more.
