We're going to have to wait and see whether the judge will allow them to continue being in the same place, communicating with one another as they await trial.

ELIE HONIG, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYSTinterest in this indictment. Really a remarkable document. The first thing that jumped out to me is just how significant and sensitive these documents are. The indictment tells us that these are documents created for and by agencies like the CIA, the Department of Defense, National Security Agency and the Department of Energy. And the indictment actually gives us a real sense of what's in these documents. These documents include information about our defense and weapons capabilities; our potential vulnerabilities to attack; United States nuclear programs; and plans for possible retaliation by the United States against other countries. It doesn't get much more sensitive than that. And that matters legally, because the first law that Donald Trump is charged under requires that the documents contain national defense information.

We now know that there were two incidents where Donald Trump used these documents up at Bedminster, his club in New Jersey. This is what our team, Paula Reid and team, reported before the indictment came out.This is the most important one. In July of 2021, Trump's meeting with two writers who were working on a book. And he wants to convince them that a certain story that appeared in the media is wrong. And so he is brandishing what appears to be a document, and he says to them -- and this is a quote from an audio recording, \"Secret. This is secret information. Look at this. See, as president I could have declassified. Now I can't, you know, but this is still a secret.\" That to me is one of the most important pieces of evidence in the case. And then the indictment tells us there's another incident about a month later where Trump shows a classified map to a member of a political action committee, also at Bedminster. So he's using these documents. He's showing them to other people who do not have security clearance. He's using them to try to shape favorable coverage for himself.",

They say, you have to give us all of your classified or sensitive documents at Mar-a-Lago.Trump goes out and puts together a legal team, including this lawyer, Evan Corcoran, and he basically says to Evan Corcoran, I'm going to have you search this area of the storage room. That's where the documents are. Corcoran does that, and he goes through the storage room, and he comes out with 38 classified documents. Corcoran and the team put together a certification, saying, We've done a diligent search. These are the documents we've found. Of course, we know, though, that months later there were over a hundred more classified documents found when the FBI went in to do its search warrant. How could that be? The indictment answers that question. There were, as I said before, documents kept in this storage room. And the indictment tells us that before Evan Corcoran went in -- he wouldn't have any way to know this -- 64 documents -- excuse me, 64 boxes of documents were taken out of the storage room, and then right before Corcoran came in, 30 why taken back. Now, we can do the math there: 34 boxes were left out of, removed from and left out of that storage closet before Evan Corcoran went in. And that's why Donald Trump and Walt Nauta are charged with obstruction, because they misled the lawyer, knowing that the lawyer, intentionally or not -- it appears not -- would mislead DOJ.",

We're going to talk about her more later in the shot, if I can tease that. She's been the subject of a bit of controversy, because she made a ruling earlier in this case on the special master in favor of Donald Trump that was then reversed by the court of appeals.

I've been speaking with several of Donald Trump's aides and allies over the past several days, and they told me that concern has begun to settle in regarding the legal implications of this indictment. And Donald Trump himself told Politico, in an interview aboard his plane on Saturday, that he is worried about being indicted. He said, quote, \"Nobody wants to be indicted. I don't care that my poll numbers went up by a lot. I don't want to be indicted. I've never been indicted. I went through my whole life. Now I get indicted every two months. It's been political.\" That's what Donald Trump said to Politico over the weekend. And that is what we've heard, as well, from my conversations with his team. They've repeatedly told me he doesn't want to be indicted. And it's similar to what what he saw when he was impeached. He didn't want to be impeached when he was in office.

And that is sort of democracy's first line of defense, if you want to put it that way.And you've got an increasingly crowded field. He's far and away the front-runner, according to all the polling. And this, at least for the moment, has only empowered him and created more of a buffer. But it is not 2016. All of these candidates have the benefit of history. He chose to learn from the lessons of history and the problem for the Republican field is they're split right now. Half are trying to figure out whether to say, this is so terrible, he's being politically prosecuted. And the other half are like, Um, he stuck a bunch of documents in the bathroom and pretended he didn't. So I think as long as the GOP primary field is divided about what the story is, it's going to be very easy for him to maintain, using this to his political advantage, even if he's in legal jeopardy.",

It makes a huge difference.Yes, when you're president, you can do virtually anything you want with these documents. Not when you're the ex-president. And notably, the indictment picks up on that. Because every -- the time frame starts in this indictment 12:01 p.m. on January 20, 2021. None of what he did when he was president is in play here. The other thing is, DOJ charged this case. And I think what is an interesting and, I think, smart way. There are about a half dozen federal statutes that govern mishandling of sensitive or classified information. But they chose only one, and they charged it 31 times for each of 31 different documents. That does not say classified or declassified. It says national defense. So whether those documents were ever classified or ever declassified is technically beside the point here.",

I think the fact that they made that phone call to him is actually a sign of concern. Because it essentially is saying, hey, get out there. Help me. Start saying stuff.
