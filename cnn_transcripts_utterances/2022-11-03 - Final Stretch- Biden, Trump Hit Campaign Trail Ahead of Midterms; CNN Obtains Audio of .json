He said this isn't about me. This isn't about the last 2020 election. It isn't about even next week's election. This is was about the future of the country. Now, it was really notable that he started his speech by describing in pretty graphic detail this violent attack against Paul Pelosi. We know that the president and his top advisers were very deeply disturbed by everything that happened there. And we also know that they have been watching with real trepidation and real concern as they have seen these election deniers on ballots. They have seen these candidates who have basically openly said, we're not necessarily going to accept the results of the election next week. And a surge in threats and acts of violence. And the president saying last night that the words allegedly that were allegedly used by the attacker on Paul Pelosi -- \"Where's Nancy? Where's Nancy?\" -- that those were the same words used by some of the members of the mob that breached the Capitol on January 6th. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

In fact, his advisers say the entire midterm elections are resting on his shoulders.

I know where his kids sleep. Yes, that's right, so he better kill himself. And if he doesn't, I am going to kill him.\" The Chicago man who made that voicemail, 21-year-old Scott Lennox, has been charged with multiple felonies for allegedly sending it. Bailey's Democratic opponent, who's the incumbent governor of Illinois, J.B. Pritzker, responded to the threat, tweeting, quote, \"The violent rhetoric and division that we are seeing across our country is unacceptable.\" A message that was echoed by President Biden last night in his speech. Also this morning, CNN has obtained another heart-wrenching call from inside a classroom during the elementary school massacre in Uvalde, Texas, at Robb Elementary.

According to new research by the Network Contagion Research Institute, the use of the \"N\" word jumped nearly 500 percent in Elon Musk's first 12 hours as CEO. Montclair State University published a study that found hate speech was used in more than 4,000 tweets from midnight to noon on October 28, the day Musk acquired the platform. And on Monday, Twitter came out and admitted that the company's head of safety and integrity said that there was a surge in hateful conduct, adding 1,500 accounts had been removed from the platform since Saturday. But late last night, the late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel spoke to mu colleague Jake Tapper on CNN, and that at this point, he said even posting something nice will be met by a surge of hate. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JIMMY KIMMEL, LATE-NIGHT TALK SHOW HOST: I noticed that, in the three days that Elon Musk has been running this Twitter, that it has gotten crazier and nastier.
