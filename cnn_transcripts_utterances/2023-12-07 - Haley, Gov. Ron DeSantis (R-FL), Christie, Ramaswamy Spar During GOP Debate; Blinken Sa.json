Guys, welcome. Lisa, I want to start with you because you had a recent piece, which may have been a motivating factor, may not, in some of Chris Christie's tone and posture over the course of the last several days, talking about a reality, which is behind the scenes, there are donors who want Trump to lose that want him to get out of the race and want Christie to drop out.

What he argues he's bringing is that he's the only guy who's willing to go after President Trump or former President Trump directly, and we certainly saw that last night.Now, whether that's enough, I think there's a big sense among donors and among the sort of wing of the party that wants an alternative to Trump, that they would be served better by narrowing it down to one candidate, that momentum has really been behind Nikki Haley. So, I'm not sure that changes the overall dynamic, but he certainly was showing to people that he had a role to play in this race. And, you know, particularly I would point to his exchange with Ron DeSantis where he really hit -- pressed Ron DeSantis to say whether he thought Trump was unfit for the presidency.

The campus huddled together for a vigil last night after sources tell CNN the shooter was at a career college professor. His name, we're just getting this, Anthony Polito, 67 years old, who police say shot and was shot and killed after the rampage.He reportedly had sought a job at UNLV. Polito's LinkedIn page lists him most recently as a full-time employment and business professor at East Carolina University. Here's what we do know. Three people were murdered, a fourth person injured. Four others are being treated at hospitals for what is being described as panic attacks from the shooting. Two law enforcement officers are also being treated for minor injuries. And for parents and loved ones waiting for word during the lockdown, some breathtaking revelations coming in one text message at a time. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He asked for funding now and Republicans are saying not good enough.You know, I've done this for a long time. This is stunning to me that Republicans won't fund more equipment to look for fentanyl at the border. It is stunning that that won't happen.

There is a risk that if Putin is allowed to go through Ukraine, he is on NATO's door, and then our sons and daughters could possibly be a part of conflicts.
