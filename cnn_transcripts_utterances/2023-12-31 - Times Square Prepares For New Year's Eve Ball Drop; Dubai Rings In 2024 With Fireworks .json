A great deal of excitement down there. People packed in. We've had acrobatic displays. We've had DJs. You can hear them now. And despite that slight drizzle, a lot of excitement at the fact that this fireworks display is about to get going. Now, of course, as you'd expect, 6, 000 policemen and women out in the French capital to try and keep the peace and make sure that things stay calm. And we've been watching those crowds. You know, it can get a little hectic down there. The pushing of the people just trying to keep order with that many people packed into his feet. Still, the city of light very much looking forward to a fireworks display that will be devoted this year to the Olympics. As you know, Paula, next year, 2024, will be the year of the Paris Olympics, also the year, by the way, that Paris will reopen the doors to Notre Dame Cathedral.

Two states have struck his name from the ballot, and Oregon is expected to decide next. That state's Supreme Court could issue a ruling at any moment. And this weekend, Trump's rivals are arguing that voters, not the courts or secretaries of state, should decide who will be the Republican nominee for president. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I will defeat Donald Trump fair and square. I don't need him thrown off the ballot. But if we open this door, you can't close it. GOV. RON DESANTIS, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It opens up Pandora's box. Can you have a Republican Secretary of State disqualify Biden from the ballot? CHRIS CHRISTIE, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Makes him a martyr. You know, he's very good at playing poor me, poor me. It's not good for our democracy.

But it really pains me to agree with Governor DeSantis and Nikki Haley and the Republican candidates, but they're right here, which is, this does play to Trump's advantage and there is not a conviction. Here's what I think the good thing about this is, the sooner the courts rule on this, the sooner we can get back to the campaign. What we don't need is this heading into the general election and having a discussion about whether he can be on the ballot then. And I think, you know, I think we can predict what the Supreme Court will say.

But at the same time, (inaudible) Chris Christie's, I think, staying in this race because he believes Trump could be convicted and this whole dynamic of this race in the primary might change.

I think where I disagree with Governor Sununu is, I've seen 25 point changes in New Hampshire in the polls between Iowa and New Hampshire. But that won't happen this time.

It needs to be fixed. They must bring some sense of order and stability and show that this is a sovereign nation that, that has an orderly system of entrance. They have to deal with this, and they have to fix the asylum system, but they can't fix any of this as long as there's mayhem. They have to deal with the DREAMers. They have to deal with E-Verify and agricultural visas, and of course the asylum system, but it's going to be very hard to do that as long as the border looks like it's in complete and total shambles.

There has been actually a maritime context that there has been piracy in this area with not only drones and forced boardings, but even limpet mines to ships that are coming out of the Gulf of Aden, the Red Sea, and the Arabian Gulf. Shipping companies have always been concerned about their ships and crews in these areas. And the Maersk company is suspending the operations is just an indicator of how concerned they are. They don't want their crews and their ships to be injured or damaged. So, yes, it's -- it is certainly something we have to watch. And I think John Kirby's interview earlier today noted all of that. But it's not something that I think the U.S. is extremely concerned about because, as Kevin said, we want to make sure that doesn't escalate even wider.",

But we're also going to see the intensive kind of airstrikes, missile and rocket attacks that we've seen from both sides over the last couple of days.

Under the new law, people with permits would not be allowed to concealed carry in places like schools, parks and hospitals, among others.

For example, in Idaho physicians or practitioners who provide puberty- blocking medication, gender-affirming surgeries or other treatments to minors could face a $5,000 fine and a felony charge.In Louisiana, it will become illegal for those under 18 to receive those treatments and healthcare professionals can have their licenses revoked for two years or more if they provide those services. On the other hand, Maryland, along with several other Democratic-led states, pass protections for gender-affirming care for all ages. And as soon as January 1st, the state will require Medicaid to cover them. When it comes to abortion, the state of Washington is enacting a law with the goal of making the procedure more accessible by eliminating out-of-pocket costs, including deductibles and copays. This is, of course, in response to near-total bans in several Republican-led states that took effect in 2023. In California, a law taking effect Monday protects local healthcare providers from out-of-state litigation over both abortion and gender- affirming care to people from other states. When it comes to laws that are not as controversial, nearly half of all U.S. states will increase their minimum wage in 2024. Washington will continue to have the highest minimum wage of all states at $16.28 an hour up from 15.74.
