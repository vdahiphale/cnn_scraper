About two-thirds of Black Friday shoppers say they're actually going into the store today.CNN's Meena Duerson joining us now.

Now we have 65 percent of shoppers saying they're planning to hit the mall in person.You know, we have lines in the mall behind us. Shoppers are waiting for these stores to open. A huge amount of shoppers, you know, 89 percent of young adults said that they were planning on shopping on Black Friday this year. So, it's shaping up to be a pretty healthy holiday season. Adults are expected to spend around $900 this holiday season. So, it's not extravagant spending this year, but it's supposed to be, you know, rebounding from years prior.",

Well, Erica, experts are saying that there are a few major categories of items that, you know, if you're in the market for these items, perhaps you should be looking at these deals today as an opportunity to save some money in case these tariffs do take effect. You know, some of these bigger ticket items could go up in price upwards of 20 percent if these tariffs do hit consumers, you know, as they're expected to.Those items include, you know, big household appliances. If you're in the market for a fridge or let's say a washer dryer, those are the kinds of things that if you stock up on now, you know, if those items do go up in price, you know, when those tariffs do take effect, you could be saving, you know, potentially 20 percent. Other big categories include, you know, laptops or tablets. These are items typically, you know, maybe imported from China, maybe Canada, Mexico, things like video game consoles. You know, we're seeing, experts telling us, those could be going potentially upwards of 40 percent of what they cost today if these tariffs do take effect, smart phones and even ebikes. So, those are things, if those are items are in the market for, potentially items to maybe keep an eye out for a deal today, and, you know, maybe that's something that could save you down the line.",

And these lawmakers include Representatives Joe Courtney, Representatives Jim Himes, John Larson, and Jahana Hayes.And as you mentioned, law enforcement responding to each of these threats and ultimately finding that there was no evidence of an actual bomb. But this is a part of a pattern and an increasing pattern of these kind of threats, in particular ones targeting members of Congress. We've seen members of Congress on both sides of the aisle receive bomb threats or these swatting incidents, be the targets of these swatting incidents, which is where law enforcement is essentially called to respond to a certain location despite in sort of a hoax type of way this is just the latest in a series of these kind of incidents that's increased over the last several years. And law enforcement officials tell us that these can often involve people overseas using a script of some kind and for various reasons and various motives. It's not clear what was behind or who was behind this latest round of incidents, but as you mentioned, it comes one day after several of Donald Trump's cabinet picks and top appointees were also targeted. So, law enforcement looking closely at this. And at the day, you know, 90 percent or so of these incidents are ultimately baseless. There's no real threat there, but law enforcement having to respond on the off chance that one of them is legitimate.",

New this morning, health officials in California say a second batch of raw milk has tested positive for the bird flu virus, and it's reportedly from the same farm in Fresno.CNN Health Reporter Jacqueline Howard is following this for us.

Both of these slots come from the same company called Raw Farm based in Fresno, California. And because these two lots have tested positive for bird flu, they have been voluntarily recalled. They have the lot numbers that you see on the screen here. The previous recall included a lot that had the best by date of November 27th. But now this second recall has a best by date of December 7th.And, Omar, no illnesses have been reported so far as part of this recall. It really is out of an abundance of caution because these lots have tested positive for bird flu. But this recall is part of this overall bird flu outbreak that we have seen sweep the country impacting dairy cattle in different states. And so far, as part of that overall outbreak, there have been 55 human cases of bird flu reported. But, again, Omar, this is really testing for the virus and looking for the virus in dairy cattle products. The human cases that have been reported so far, most of them were farm workers having direct impact with the cows, so they did have direct exposures. But, again, this testing is continuing out of an abundance of caution.",

The pasteurization process is a heating process. So, that's why pasteurized milk is still safe to consume. It's really the raw milk. And because there is this risk of exposure to pathogens in unpasteurized milk, some states even prohibit the sale of unpasteurized milk because of that concern.So, Omar, again, the real concern here is the raw milk.

      "sentences": "Yes. Both sides, Erica, saying that it was a productive conversation, and it seemed like they both walked away from it with a good sense of where the relationship is at, excuse me. But Trump on social media described it very differently than she described it yesterday.Let me read you what Trump had to say. He claimed that she has agreed to stop migration through Mexico and into the United States, effectively closing our southern border. We also talked about what can be done to stop the massive drug inflow into the United States and also the U.S. consumption of these drugs. Now, when she was asked about these remarks that she had promised to close the border, she said that's not even something that she can do. Listen to what she said. She said, everyone has their own way of communicating. But I can assure you, I give you the certainty that we would never, and we will be incapable of it, propose that we would close the border. It has never been our approach, and, of course, we don't agree with that. Now the disconnect, of course, is stemming from Donald Trump's threat to put a 25 percent tariff on Mexican goods if they don't do more to stop the flow of migrants and drugs across the U.S. southern border. However, what's not clear is what policy concessions Trump believes he has won, where the status quo is and also whether or not enough has been done for Trump to eliminate that threat of a 25 percent tariff. I asked Trump's transition team in the past 48 hours that that is something that he would consider after this call and have yet to get a response. But it's one of the many uncertainties entering this sort of weird phase where Donald Trump is conducting foreign policy and engaging in trade disputes before he has even taken office.",
