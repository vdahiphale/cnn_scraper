The state's largest hospital has paused it's in vitro fertilization treatment just days after the state supreme court ruled that frozen embryos are children and protected under state law. The University of Alabama at Birmingham health system is the first in the state to pause IVF procedures. In a statement the system said, quote, \"we must evaluate the potential that our patients and our physicians could be prosecuted criminally or face punitive damages for following the standard care for IVF treatments.\"Hundreds of thousands of Americans rely on IVF and other fertility treatments every year. A Pew survey last year found that 42 percent of adults have used fertility treatments or know someone that has. It's so many people older than 35, especially. The Alabama decision promises to inflame political passions that we've seen since the Supreme Court overturned Roe versus Wade and we're already seeing new impacts on the campaign trail. CNN's Kylie Atwood, covering Nikki Haley, who is trying to navigate this. Kylie, what's happening?",

And she responded by saying that she believes that embryos are babies, giving an indication that she does agree with the ruling. But what she didn't do in that conversation was talk about the other part of the ruling that says that those who destroy those embryos can be held liable criminally. And so yesterday, in a conversation last night with CNN, she sought to clarify her position on this. Listen to what she said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY (R), 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I didn't say that I agreed with the Alabama ruling. What -- the question that I was asked is, do I believe an embryo is a baby? I do think that if you look in the definition and embryo is considered an unborn baby. And so, yes, I believe, from my stance, that that is. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

In the past she has called for a national consensus on abortion. She hasn't said that she would back any national ban on abortion based on a set number of weeks.The other thing that she's doing in these conversations is talking about her own personal story. The fact that she was able to conceive one of her children using IVF, but she's avoiding, at least until this point, really talking about the chilling effect that this could have on families who would look to use IVF and now are concerned about doing that. She told CNN last night that the goal is always to do what parents want with embryos. So, we'll have to see what more she has to say on this in the coming days, of course, leading up to the South Carolina primary here. John.",

She's the executive director of the West Alabama Women's Center. She's a women's health advocate.Robin, thank you so much for jumping on. What do you see? Let's talk about the state's largest hospital, the University of Alabama at Birmingham health system. The fact that they are pausing IVF treatments, at least for now. What is the real impact of this health system doing so? ROBIN MARTY, WOMEN'S HEALTH ADVOCATE: Well, it's an impact not just for IVF, but it is a warning for all people to understand that when this decision came down, it wasn't saying embryos are -- frozen embryos are being treated as potential children and so it is a legal risks to do anything that might harm them. What they're saying is that frozen embryos, like all other fertilized eggs and beyond, are being treated this way. So, while we're looking at this through a lens of what this means for IVF, the reality is, this is opening all doctors who deal with any sort of pregnancies to have to reevaluate how they do this because any wrong move could open them up for a potential criminal or civil lawsuits. We've known that this was coming. We've been waiting for this action, and now it's starting to play out.",

And that's something that's a threat in Alabama. Long term, we need to start asking questions such as, if a frozen embryo is considered a person and that any action that causes harm to them could be seen as a criminal or legal assaults, what happens to all of those embryos that are currently in storage now? Are they all going to be at a point where they cannot be donated to science? Obviously we're hearing that they cannot be destroyed. Will they have to all be implanted?

      "sentences": "So here we're looking at Bryce Pedicini. And according to Navy prosecutors, he is now charged with 14 counts of espionage and the transfer of classified information, as well as other charges. Prosecutors say from November 2022 and over the course of the next several months Pedicini took classified information and gave it to a foreign government, both when he was in Norfolk, Virginia, and then later when he was stationed in Japan on board the USS Higgins.Pedicini has a long and successful career in the Navy. He enlisted back in 2008. He served on three different destroyers. He got three good conduct metals and a national defense service medal. He was most recently promoted in August of 2022 to chief fire controlman, a critical role on board a U.S. Navy warship. But several months later, Navy prosecutors say he began taking classified information and transferring it to a foreign government, at least six different times from November 2022 and over the course of the next several months. It was in May of the following year, 2023, that Navy prosecutors say he took pictures of classified information on a Sippar (ph) screen, a classified system screen, and was ready once again to transfer it to a foreign government, although the charging document doesn't say specifically what foreign government. That part it leaves unnamed. It was at this point that Pedicini was taken into custody, and he has been held since May 2023 in pretrial confinement awaiting the court martial here as that process moves forward. John, I will just point out that much of this played out as the Jack Teixeira, Massachusetts Air National Guardsman, was alleged to have been leaking classified information online. In fact, the sheriff was arrested in April 2023, just one month before Pedicini here. So, the military is still looking at how to secure its classified information, which can be difficult if someone is determined to leak that information. John.",
