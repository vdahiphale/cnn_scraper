Israel says Hamas was using an ambulance convoy outside the hospital to transport operatives and weapons.And all this comes just hours after the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met here in Israel with top Israeli officials. And while Blinken once again defended Israel's right to respond to the horrific terrorist Hamas attacks of October 7th, he delivered a strong message that suggested the White House' support for Israel is not without limits.

Just based on the people we've spoken to, it appears that they're glad that he's here to at least be the consoler in chief as he's done many times. And even as President Biden mentioned in his remarks he's had to do it at places all across the country, whether it's Buffalo or Uvalde or Monterey Park as well, and so, he offered that familiar wound that was opened yet again after these particular shootings.To give you a sense what he's done today, he's met with first responders, nurses, some of those that were on the front lines of these pair of shootings and then went over to Schemengees Bar and Grille which is one of the sites where this mass shooting actually happened and then made his way to here, where we are, at the bowling alley, which is the first place that those pair of mass shootings actually unfolded. And, of course, many people were wondering potentially if he would bring up the fight that typically comes after these types of shootings over how to prevent this type of shooting from happening again in the future. It hasn't had the best prognosis in places like Congress, not the biggest amount of progress. And he even broke it down to a much simpler level saying regardless of your politics, this is about protecting the freedom to go to a bowling alley, to go to a restaurant.

And that's why they target it. But, of course, the images we all see now show a huge civilian casualty toll around. Hospital officials talk about that high civilian casualty toll as well from this particular strike, and the death toll as we know from civilians in Gaza is now over 9,000, a casualty toll over 22,000 people. So when Secretary Blinken is in Israel speaking about the need to avoid civilian casualties, this, again, after a week of strikes in Jabalia Camp twice controversial, the IDF again going after they say Hamas targets, command and control centers, senior commanders, high civilian casualties. This is another instant of that and appears to be part of the process, if you will, that is closing the window for Israel to -- to continue operations to try to crush Hamas at the moment, Wolf.",

And there'd been an enormous amount of anticipation in advance of Nasrallah's speech, fear I might even say among residents here in the north, but of whom have fled, frankly. Also, the Israeli military that Nasrallah would definitively announce that Hezbollah was going to join this war, open up a second front on Israel.And while as you said he did at least hold out that possibility, at some point, he did not order it today. And that was notable and he's been quiet today in the wake of his speech. He did praise the October 7th attacks, remarkable, notable, horrible thing to hear given how depraved those acts were. But at the same time he also put distance between Hezbollah and the Hamas attacks by saying he used the phrase rather it was 100 percent a Palestinian operation, in other words saying at least publicly, claiming publicly that Hezbollah was not involved in the October 7th attacks and saying it was not aware in advance either, saying that he was not bothered by that, that he understands that Hamas needed the element of surprise. But that daylight is interesting because it would seem he did not want to associate himself with carrying out those attacks at the same time that he was not today as some anticipated, announcing he was joining Hamas in its war in Israel. That could change at any time, but it was not the -- it was not the alarming event some had been worrying about.",

One of those senators and joining us right now, Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland. Senator, thanks so much for joining us. As I'm sure you know, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier today said his government will only consider a temporary cease-fire in Gaza under one condition.

CHRIS VAN HOLLEN (D-MD):  Well, Wolf, of course, we want to work to release all the hostages, but what we are calling for and what Secretary Blinken and, of course, President Biden by extension have been calling for is a humanitarian pause, which as you said is simply designed to allow desperately needed assistance, water, food, medicine to the 2 million Gazans, including half of them children, who have nothing to do with the horrible Hamas attack on Israel of October 7th. That doesn't mean that Israel can't continue to prosecute the war against Hamas, but it does mean take a step, allow the humanitarian assistance to go through.
