They won't let us go any closer than this. But the Polish authorities have now confirmed officially within the past few minutes that two people were killed in this incident. Local residents who I've spoken to said that they knew those people, they were farmers working on a farm just a short distance from here, about 200 yards or so in this kind of direction, in a field basically over there. As pictures circulating of farm equipment that's been destroyed and those two people killed as well.Locals have spoken to me about how they heard a huge, terrifying whoosh as this -- just before the explosion took place. The explosion itself rattled the windows of a local school. I spoke to the caretaker inside that school and she told me about that, the children are all gone home, fortunately, but nevertheless a terrifying experience. And it's one that could have implications as well for regional security, of course, because Poland is a member of NATO. It's not confirmed that these are Russian rockets. In fact, the Russians have denied it saying that this is a provocation to suggest that these weapons are from Russia. But that's what's being investigated right now. That's why these Polish teams are coming to this location here. And it's, what, close to 11:00 at night here local time to try and establish exactly what kind of weaponry this was and who may be behind it.",

There has been no confirmation of the origin of what landed on the Polish side of the border, but there is an understanding and a very vivid one at bat about the repercussions of what this may mean. Obviously, as a NATO ally, the Article Five commitment that the President has been so unequivocal about over the course of the nine months of Russia's war against Ukraine, that really hangs heavy over everything here. But U.S. officials making clear they don't have all the details yet. And until they confirm exactly what happened, they will not say anything or lay out potential next steps. One thing to be sure of, obviously, the President here at the G20 summit where Russia's invasion and war against Ukraine has been the central focus over the course of the last 48 hours, many of those leaders are -- have been closely united with the U.S. in the response to that war. Over the course of the last several months, the President has been very clear that he didn't want to do anything unilaterally in response to what's been happening on the ground in Ukraine, that will most likely be the case here as well, all those leaders on the ground. Now there are two events scheduled for the President today. We don't have any idea right now, whether or not his schedule will shift. But we do know the President has been briefed, the President has spoken to his counterpart in Poland, so has the President's team. U.S. intelligence is still in the midst of gathering information trying to definitively identify what transpired here, but the President very awake -- very aware of what's going on and already talking to his counterparts in Poland and elsewhere, Jake.",

And the last explosion that happened in Kyiv was so close to my house that I had my windows fumbling (ph). I don't know if there are many victims, we know at least about one person who died that were residential buildings that were hit today, but -- they are defeated by Ukrainian army with the help of western partners on the battleground and that's why they're sending missiles to civilian infrastructure to kill civilians. And in this way, try to make us defeat, surrender.Let me say that just in an hour before this largest missile attack on Ukraine, I learned that there were 14 Russian jet flying with the missiles. Each jet would have at least eight missiles. So we were counting that there would be 112 missiles. And Ukrainian air defense system, with the help of western partners, managed to shoot down 73 missiles. All others hit the civilian infrastructure, we have problems with the light, electricity, water, hitting in different regions and still hear that it keeps attacking.

Was it in fact a Russian rocket or missile that struck and killed two individuals in Poland? And what's your reaction? SEN. CHRIS COONS (D-DE): Well, Jake, if this were an intentional missile strike by Russia on Poland, our vital NATO ally, that would be a major escalation. But we do not know, I do not know, at this hour, exactly what happened in the southeastern corner of Poland earlier today. Press accounts state that two people were killed when something fell out of the sky, either the parts of a missile that had been intercepted or a missile strike. So, first, I think we need to investigate more thoroughly and make sure that, we, the United States and folks in the international media know exactly what happened. And second, we need to give some time for our close and vital ally, Poland, whose national security leadership is currently still meeting to come forward and say what they believe has happened, and what response they're calling for. Poland has been one of the strongest and best allies in supporting Ukraine, welcoming millions of Ukrainian refugees, several of whom we met with when I was in Poland, and providing a critical base for material and supplies to flow into Ukraine. So they are all in in supporting Ukraine in their fight against Russian aggression.

It was overwhelmingly endorsed by those members of the U.N. who voted many abstained.

In fact, after 2015, I've never really said this publicly, but before Paul Ryan stepped up, I had Democrats approached me, they were sent to see me about, you know, get some votes, we'll provide the balance, and it never took off and Paul Ryan stepped in. But the point is, this has happened in Pennsylvania, it's happened in Texas, but you've had these types of speakers who are elected with a bipartisan coalition.

Now the lieutenant has been on leave from the police department, he's been on paid leave. Jake, we don't exactly know what this means by him being gone.
