I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. The summer has seen nations across the world battle wildfires and extreme temperatures. Now, it has dubious distinction of being the world's hottest summer on record, that's according to the latest European Union data. Just take a look at this graph that shows the soaring temperature over the past 35 years. In response, the U.N. chief, Antonio Guterres, says this shows that \"Our climate is imploding faster than we can cope with extreme weather events hitting every corner of the planet. Surging temperatures demand a surge in action,\" he said. Now, this comes just as the first ever African climate summit comes to a close, hosted by Kenya and the African Union. The event called for the establishment of a global carbon tax system. And in a joint declaration called out the world's richest nations saying, Africa is not historically responsible for global warming, but bears the brunt of its effect, impacting lives, livelihoods and economies. So, joining me now to discuss all of this from Kenya is Damilola Ogunbiyi. She's the U.N. special representative for Sustainable Energy for All and she's co-chair of U.N. Energy. So, welcome to the program from Nairobi. I really -- I guess, I have to ask you first, we've seen many, many talking shops. Year after year, we have pledges, we have the crisis explained, as the U.S. secretary general did. What is your assessment of this summit? How did it end? DAMILOLA OGUNBIYI, U.N. SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE FOR SUSTAINABLE ENERGY FOR ALL:  Well, thank you for having me on the show to start off with. I think the summit was a great success. For the first time, we had almost 19 heads of state in Africa coming together to explain the fact that they want to lead in climate action. I think this is one of the first times we had over 60 ministers saying that we want to grow our economy in a green sustainable way. So, the narrative had changed from Africa just being a victim of climate change, which it is, but Africa being the leader in climate action, in green growth, in manufacturing, using our critical minerals for electric vehicles. So, really, really leading the charge and then asking for the global audience, which included the U.N. secretary general and also the E.U. president to come on this charge with Africa and have Africa really the solution provider.",

And this financing has to be affordable and has to be accessible, and that was the whole quarter action in terms of the new architecture and how we have to reform the DFIs and the MDBs to actually lead this chart. I mean, what is really important on continent is that this isn't only a climate issue, this is a development issue. And we know on continent that we have to develop in a green sustainable way. So, this is really a once in a lifetime opportunity to say we do not want to develop like the Global North, we do not want to develop on fossil fuels, we want to develop on clean energy.

So, these would be South Africa, Nigeria, Egypt, as well as, you know, forest rich and mineral rich, resource rich Congo. Nigeria, oil producing countries, says they should be able to use these resources for economic growth and all the energy access. So, if these important powerhouses, which they are in Africa, didn't show up, what does that say about Africa's commitment to be part of the solution not just endlessly a victim, as you put it?",

So, one of the things the world recognize here is that, again, it's a development issue. Apart from transitioning, it's very important that there's still 600 million people on this continent that have no access to electricity at all and over 900 million people that have no access to clean cooking.

I think we all know we have a 1.5-degree target. We all know we have a net zero target, but if you continuously pollute, I think the G20 countries should be held to account.

And this is why President Ruto and the presidents that were here today were like, we have to do something about the debt crisis. And we really have to treat this as a crisis. If it's a crisis and leaving no one behind and connecting people to energy to live a dignified life is truly a crisis in the world, and you have to recognize access to energy has to be by 2030, we have to treat it and the financing has to be affordable, has to be accessible and we have to find a solution to the current debt crisis that a lot of these countries are suffering from.",

That's roughly an investment of about 4.5 billion. But I want to like to put it in context. Today, all the latest figures show in Sub-Saharan Africa, and we only have an installed capacity of 81 gigawatts of energy. So, you can imagine if 15 gigawatts of clean energy comes into the system, how it would transform the system and how it would like let Africa be a forward thinking voice. I mean, we've already seen leadership in this country, Kenya, with having over 90 percent of its grid already being supplied by renewal energy.

The entrepreneurial spirit that's going on here, the different kind of innovations that people are coming up with for energy access, for power supply, for growth, for tech businesses, for climate friendly solutions that's just happening organically because of the environment that they're in without a lot of funding. You can imagine if we created force of funding to really, really grow this invocation at scale, we would be able to solve our issues. So, that is the hope that I see from this summit. The youth have had a very, very big voice. The other hope that I see is just a penetration of renewal energy, really exciting technologies, green manufacturing. You know, here we have, you know, an electric vehicle bus manufacturing hub. I went to see some e-bikes hubs, you know, in Ghana, we're seeing it in Nigeria, we're seeing it.

What do you make of what's been causing a little bit of a bruhaha, because it's sort of exemplary of a certain tendency that the government's invitation to the dinner for the summit was identified not as India but as Bharat, which is an alternative name for India, recognized in the constitution but it's quite unusual to use it like that? Is it a deliberate signal? BOBBY GHOSH, COLUMNIST, BLOOMBERG AND HINDUSTAN TIMES FORMER EDITOR-IN- EDITOR:  Well, yes, it is part of Prime Minister Modi and his party's nationalist -- Hindu nationalist agenda. It's a little bit off a distraction from other problems that the country is facing, including quite serious levels of poverty despite the wealth that is on show during this conference, and also a sort of programs against minorities within India. So, using the Bharat name is a way to distract attention. It is associated with the ruling party, of course, which is the Bharatiya Janata Party. There's an echo in the name. It's an historical name but it's not in common use international and frankly, even within India. So, this is a little bit of smoke and mirrors, look here, not there. That's what is being attempted.",

India is quite protectionist in many ways. I think he would love to see India distance itself from Russia. Unfortunately, India spent a large purchase of Russian energy. I don't see that ending. I think the president wants to signal something to China by being close to Mr. Modi. But, Christiane, I think your larger point is what I think we're seeing is real polity, the idea of a democracy first, American foreign policy has gone by the way side, whether you're talking about India, whether you're talking about Saudi Arabia, we can go around the world.

Speculation has emerged of a degree of unhappiness with both the concentration of power in the hands of Xi Jinping. There's been a major move away from what people thought was the established or tradition of collective leadership in China. Plus, as you see every day, there's article after article after article about China's economic roads. China faces real domestic challenges, far greater than any challenges coming from us or challenges there they're creating for themselves by their -- allowing politics to dominate economic policy.

So, I think the temptation for Xi Jinping to go out into Delhi for a day or two would have been quite great. And the rewards for doing that would have been quite great. I'm not entirely convinced that he skipped that chance, that opportunity for the sort of favorable photo opt because of domestic politics.

And then, when news broke, you got -- you know, you got a little bit of a bollocking (ph). In response, you made it clear that you oppose what you call Russia's unjustified war of choice. But you also said, and this is crucial, I'm skeptical that Ukraine will be able to liberate all of its territory any time soon using military force, and worry that an open-ended war will leave the country and its people in ruins. Do you still maintain that position? And are you worried that that sort of undercuts what your own government is basically saying publicly?",

I'm skeptical it will be able to, simply because of the balance of forces, the nature of Russian defensive positions. But again, I think we're going to find out how this plays out. And if that -- if I'm right, and if it turns out Ukraine cannot libertate its land militarily, then I think we need to think about an alternative foreign policy, not where it gives up its claims. Let me be clear. I don't think it should. But where it perhaps turns to other instruments, politically, diplomatically, economically. And it settles for something as an interim arrangement, which stops the war where Ukraine can rebuild its economy and its society without giving up its long-term goals. I don't think we're at that point. Ukraine is not yet there. Is not willing to make such a compromise. Russia is not there. Putin has persuaded that time is his friend. But my prediction is the day is likely to come, not definitely, but likely to come when both sides, for various reasons, have to look closely at a second-best outcome for this without sacrificing their long-term goals. And I think that's -- I think it's quite possible we'll will get to that point, if not at the end of this fighting season, perhaps when -- just over a year from now.",

I mean, I grew up in the '80s in Washington, D.C., when it wasn't just the nation's capital, it was the nation's murder capital. My father was a victim of one of those gun murders. And so, I don't have a lot of love intrinsically for firearms. I wouldn't say a deep hate, but I would say I'm very distant from it. Because I live in the same country as you, and so we see the headlines and a lot of us live the reality of various forms of gun violence. So, it's been largely a negative idea outside of some fun with some action movies. Watching, not starring in. And so, to be in Arkansas, to be with an Olympian who -- for whom this is a sport, to be with hunters for whom this is a source of food and there are conservationist and it's a family ritual and tradition, we got to spend time. This is the heart of the show, moments like this, where people who clearly come from different political, social, ideological perspectives can share common ground, who are standing on the same earth, we're on the same plot the land and we're in a relationship with each other because we're also in a relationship with nature. And in that environment, that's like a safe container to have some really thoughtful exchanges. And ones that get well beyond the talking point. So, I learned something in that exchange. The people I was shooting with learned something in that exchange. And I think we were, both sides, not on a separate side necessarily. We were human together. We were Americans together.
