Jessica Dean has the weekend off.We begin with a flurry of new cabinet picks as President-elect Trump quickly builds a team of tight loyalists to carry out an ambitious, quite conservative agenda. The new picks include billionaire hedge fund manager Scott Bessent to lead Treasury, Russell Vought, an author of the controversial policy blueprint Project 2025, which Trump repeatedly denying any knowledge of, to lead the White House Budget Office, and two new health picks that sources say Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. had a hand in choosing. There are now just a few cabinet posts left to fill, including secretary of Agriculture. Sources tell CNN the job is now expected to go to Brooke Rollins, a Trump policy adviser passing over Kelly Loeffler, a Trump campaign fundraiser whose name had been floated earlier. CNN's Alayna Treene covers Trump. She's outside of Mar-a-Lago in West Palm Beach. Alayna, so tell us where we're going to go from here particularly with those remaining picks.",

      "sentences": "Right. Well, I think the main one is looking out now for Brooke Rollins to be named as the secretary of Agriculture. We broke some news earlier today about how she is now the top candidate for that role, and that Donald Trump is expected to announce her at some time in the near future.Now, a key thing to keep in mind about Rollins, one is that she has very close ties to Donald Trump. She has been loyal to him for several years. During his first term, she was the director of the Domestic Policy Council, and then in the years after, she is the president of America First Policy Institute, a name I mentioned because many people in Donald Trump's orbit have been connected to that. It also was kind of viewed as one of the top policy shops in D.C. that has been working to kind of frame a potential agenda should Donald Trump win again. And of course, he did win the 2024 election. Now one thing to keep in mind about Brooke Rollins is, one, I was told that her and Donald Trump spoke this week and he is expected or he has already offered her the job, but also what she will be doing as the secretary of Agriculture. One is that, you know, Donald Trump has promised throughout his campaign trail that he would or throughout his campaign that he would impose sweeping tariffs on U.S. imports. That is expected to hit the agriculture industry pretty hard, and particularly farmers. We know a lot of economists have warned of that, and this is something that Brooke Rollins would be overseeing. Now, another thing to keep in mind about her is that she was actually one of the candidates, one of the names that Donald Trump had been considering initially for his White House chief of staff role. We were later told that she had withdrew her name from consideration once it was clear that Susie Wiles, Donald Trump's 2024 campaign manager, had really been pushing for that role and was likely to get it. So she is no -- you know, she's quite a close friend of many people working on the transition. She's very well known in Donald Trump's orbit and now she's expected to be his secretary of Agriculture.",

Sources say that Tulsi Gabbard briefly was put on a government watch list prompting extra TSA screenings before she could fly. This after her overseas travel earlier this year. She was then quickly removed from the list. It's called \"Quiet Skies.\" It's not a terrorism watch list we should be clear. Gabbard called it a secret terror watch list anyway and claimed she was targeted because she criticized then presidential candidate Kamala Harris. Federal officials flatly deny that. Gabbard has been known to spread and repeat Russian propaganda and talking points including on the war in Ukraine and has often cozied up to some of America's adversaries, including Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, whom she met face to face during the midst of a deadly civil war there in which Assad was killing many of his own citizens.

I think, you know, I'm going to give her -- I'm going to cut her some slack.Again, it's up to what conversations did she have with President Trump?

Listen, Russia, of course, a very active, active participant in that field as well.Given that, I want to talk about just some of the domestic moves the president-elect is considering because Christopher Wray, FBI director who Trump, of course, appointed in his first term, has been very much at the forefront of the FBI's efforts to root out Chinese spies in this country, other Chinese penetrations, including in intelligence, telecommunications systems. Given he has done a lot of work in that space, but we're hearing that the president wants to fire him, is that the right move at this time, given the state of relations between the U.S. and China and the state of the threat from China? Should he go? GIMENEZ: I think that the FBI director has to have the full and complete confidence of the president of the United States. And I'm sorry, but Christopher Wray doesn't have the full and complete confidence of the president of the United States. And so the president of United States needs to put somebody in there who can thwart China, thwart Russia, but also has the confidence that he's playing -- he's not playing politics. And there has been a lot of accusations leveled against Christopher Wray that his agency was involved in partisan politics. That's the last thing that we need out of the FBI. And justice needs to be blind. And there are allegations, too, against DOJ that it hasn't been blind, that justice has been dished out on a partisan level. And again, that's not the America I grew up in. So we have to put people in there that all Americans say, yes, that person is going to dish out justice blindly. It doesn't matter who you are. It matters what you did, and so, again, like I said, I don't believe that Christopher Wray has the president's confidence.",

No notice, according to eyewitnesses, several bunker busting bombs dropped the size of the crater. All of that point to that this looks like it was an effort at taking out a senior Hezbollah commander. The IDF not commenting on that, but as we heard from Lebanese official, as you mentioned it there, there was no senior Hezbollah figure there.

That's not the same as I say for the nightly onslaught we see in other areas around the country.But we've had no indication of a repeat of the use of that experimental ballistic missile that hit I think it's fair to say a relatively well-known industrial site in the Dnipro a few nights ago. Increasing details about what that missile was. I think consensus really for most points of view, it was hypersonic, that it clearly had multiple warheads from one singular device but was non-nuclear. And I think the Kremlin's way of trying to say they have some kind of technological prowess that they haven't indeed reached for, and ultimately the Kremlin saying, look, you know after the U.S. escalation of allowing ATACMS to be fired by Ukraine, that's longer range missiles, into Russia, that is them finally trying to suggest that a red line has been crossed and they took an escalatory measure back. Not potent in terms of what it's done on the battlefield, but a potent signal, they think -- I think it's fair to say Russia thinks of what it's capable of doing going forwards. But Zelenskyy today, interestingly enough, suggesting there could be an end to the war, also that he wants to go and see Donald Trump in January and discuss how there might be some sort of peace settlement here, maybe even hear the president-elect's plans. And we also learned, too, that Donald Trump has met the NATO chief in Florida recently. So clearly the effort is building around the president-elect to work out what direction he wishes to take U.S. support here. There's a multiplicity of different ideas as to exactly whether he's going to maintain aid, cut it drastically, suit a middle path to try and push everyone towards some kind of negotiated settlement. But put all that aside, Jim. The frontline is a dire situation now for Ukraine on multiple different points of the compass. It's clear that they are losing, losing at times slowly, at times quicker. Pressure on them in the Kursk region that they've occupied and the border areas of Russia. And so with all this backdrop of talks of negotiation, clearly the Kremlin feels that it's winning when it comes to the frontline and that will clearly dictate how negotiations move forwards -- Jim.",
