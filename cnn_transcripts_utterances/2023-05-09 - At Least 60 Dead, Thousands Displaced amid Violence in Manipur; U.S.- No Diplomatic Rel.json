GOV. GREG ABBOTT, (R-TX):  What I could tell from talking to the investigators yesterday, and that is people should not jump to conclusions because there's a lot of conflicting information about him. CAMPBELL (voiceover):  A law enforcement source familiar with the investigation tells CNN that the suspect served for a brief period in the U.S. military, but was removed due to concerns about his mental health. In addition to an AR-15 style fire arm and another weapon found with the gunman, the source tells CNN, police found several more weapons in his car. And he was wearing tactical gear with RWDS insignia, which authorities believe stands for Right Wing Death Squad. The source also says the suspect had been living in some type of temporary lodging in the Dallas area, and at one-time worked as a security guard and underwent firearms training according to public records. CAMPBELL (on camera):  Now, we're learning new information about the weapon that was used in this attack, that AR-15 style rifle. Law enforcement source familiar with the investigation tells me that that weapon, as well as others that the suspect had collected were purchased legally, most of them from a private seller. The reason why that is so important as we continue to hear from gun safety advocates about this so-called private seller loophole, because here in the state of Texas and other states here in the United States, if you by a weapon from a private seller, it doesn't require a federal background check.
