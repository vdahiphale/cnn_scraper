But the American people deserve to know that on that day President Trump also demanded that I choose between him and the Constitution. Now voters will be faced with the same choice.

This is a pro-Pence crowd. This is generally supportive. So, not the biggest applause, but certainly no booing at all as he continued on. But it is the sharpest and the strongest and the most forceful we've seen Pence come out against Trump, especially on January 6th. You played some of that sound.

You know, the delays are bad because the visibility is so bad at so many airports up and down the East Coast, from here at Reagan National Airport all the way up to Boston, the FAA warns. No major delays here at Reagan National just yet, although the FAA says it could be added to the list as the day goes on.Just added to the list, Philadelphia International Airport. Flights bound to Philadelphia being delayed at their departing airport 29 minutes according to the FAA. It's especially bad in New York. Just talked to a passenger on a flight from New Orleans into Newark. He said you could smell the smoke in the plane as the flight descended into Newark. You could see that thick red smoke, he said it was almost apocalyptic. The ground stop at Newark and the ground stop at LaGuardia, both of them have been lift. At Newark, there was a ground delay -- meaning flights held at their departing airport up to two hours right now. At LaGuardia, it's about 45 minutes. So things are improving a little bit, although we are not out of the woods just yet. We see during days when there are major delays like this a bit of a domino effect, and so this could mean that this wildfire smoke having an impact on the East Coast could have a nationwide impact on commercial air travel. Just checked Flight Aware, we just crossed 2,000 delays nationwide. The good news right now, though, Jim, only about 125 cancelations. Doesn't pose much of a safety risk to airplanes, although that's mostly because the FAA's putting in place these delay programs trying to keep the space and the conga line long as airplanes come into these really busy airports when they can't see each other eye to eye.",
