And having been to events there before, it's scorching hot. So, they've been photographed underneath this kind of VIP shaded erection there.They have a full day of events that they'll be attending. It was noteworthy that the North Korean leader was there at the airport in the pre-dawn hours to meet Vladimir Putin, that they then got into Putin's limousine for the ride into the city. And North Korean state media said \"passing through charmingly lit streets of Pyongyang at night, the top leaders exchange their pent-up innermost thoughts and open their minds.\" So, this is -- in some senses, it is a love's fest. It is a symbolic show of friendship between these two leaders. And ahead of this visit, the Kremlin was making it very clear that the Russian government and Vladimir Putin are aligned with Kim Jong Un when it comes to their shared opposition to the U.S. and its western allies. And that's a dramatic shift from the last time that Vladimir Putin was in Pyongyang 24 years ago when he had just been appointed to the position of president. At that time Moscow, had much warmer ties with the west. It was actually still part of what, at that point, was called the G8, the group of eight nations. The G7 nations just met recently and Russia, of course, was not invited to that gathering. Rosemary.",

The fact that there's a war going on and we're seeing two countries that are relatively isolated, thinking the partnership of each other to get what each country needs, it's not entirely surprising, but at the same time, the ramifications of greater proliferation, looking at North Korea receiving sensitive military technology potentially from Russia spells implications beyond just the war in Ukraine. So, it's not like what happens in Eastern Europe is actually going to be staying confined within the region, it's going to -- we're going to see the impact unravel in ways that are going to be threatening to the international order, as well as to the United States, South Korea, and Japan.",

I would not say that that is going to be undermined by the growing North Korea, Russia cooperation. I don't think it's going to make Xi Jinping happy that the two countries are cooperating. But at the same time, this is also going to be undermining U.S. international interests that are probably going to be benefiting China's long game as well.

The Post Fire on the north side is pretty well secure at this point. But on the south side, there is a lot of work to be done, especially along the southeastern perimeter where there is very rough and rugged steep terrain. The Los Angeles County Fire Department says they are, for the first time, employing the sheriff's department boats to take fire crews across the lake to get to that southern perimeter. We watched as several hotshot crews were brought to that perimeter, taking everything they can with them. They have all of that medical equipment, basic life support so that if something should happen, they can take care of themselves and basically do the best they can in the middle of nowhere. Now, this fire caused evacuations for more than a thousand people from a state park over the weekend. It grew very quickly. The difficult conditions include high wind gusts and high heat. There should be a little bit better when wind and weather conditions as the day progresses. However, there is expected to be more heat coming by the next weekend. And so, the work that needs to be done now is really containing what they can.
