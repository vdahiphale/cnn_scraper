I know I can't. But my grandfather certainly can. From the moment that he woke up until he laid his head, his life was a testament to the goodness of God. And I thank all of you for being here to celebrate this life. To the presidents and first ladies, it is a great honor to have you here. You know the human side of the American presidency like no others, and we appreciate you. To the vice presidents, other distinguished guests and friends of all kinds, thank you for being here. To those of you who came from all across the world, thank you for being here to celebrate and pay tribute to my grandfather. I say grandfather, but we call him Paw-Paw, as many of you know. We called my grandmother Mom Carter. So we spend our time talking about mom and Paw-Paw and, mostly, speaking of the human side of the presidency, just letting people know that they were regular folks.
