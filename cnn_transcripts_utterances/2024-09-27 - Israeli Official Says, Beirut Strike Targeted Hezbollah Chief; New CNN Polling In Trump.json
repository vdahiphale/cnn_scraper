I spoke to the U.S. defense secretary, Lloyd Austin. Stand by for that exclusive interview this hour.Also tonight, rushing floodwaters and a rising death toll as a Helene batters the southeast after slamming into Florida with hurricane force more powerful than the region has ever seen. We're tracking the storm and the danger. Plus, as Donald Trump and Kamala Harris hold dueling battleground state events tonight, CNN has exclusive new polling on the presidential race in two pivotal locations that could be the deciders on Election Day. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. All right, let's get right to the breaking news in the Middle East. A senior Israeli official says it's too early to say if Hezbollah Leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed in the strike on the group's central headquarters. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh is joining us live from Beirut right now. Jomana, what do we know about that strike and the ongoing Israeli attacks on Beirut?",

ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Well, Wolf, top Biden administration officials are really trying to distance themselves from this strike, saying that they had no advanced knowledge, no participation in this. In fact, the secretary of defense, Lloyd Austin, said that he learned about this from his counterpart, Yoav Gallant, as the operation was taking place. And tonight, Wolf, we are hearing more warnings about what this could mean for the region from those U.S. officials. Here's what Secretary of State Antony Blinken had to say earlier today.

What they've seen in polling is that the former president's lead on the issue is eroding since the vice president became the lead of the party's ticket, And so they want to close that further.Now, the way they're going to do that, though, is notable. I'm told by a senior campaign official that the vice president is not only going to embrace President Joe Biden's asylum crackdown, something we saw over the summer, but go further, by trying to make it harder to lift those border restrictions, restrictions, Wolf, that largely barred migrants from seeking asylum at the U.S. southern border if they crossed unlawfully. This is significant because what it tells us is the vice president and her campaign's messaging moving forward is going to be that they want a tougher stance on the U.S.-Mexico border and on border security specifically. Now, the vice president has been needling former President Donald Trump on that bipartisan border measure that he and Republicans tanked earlier this year, and we anticipate that she will say, quote, the American people deserve a president who cares more about border security than playing political games. That's an excerpt from what we expect to hear from her later this afternoon. And that's going to be the through line in addition to her walking through some of her border plans like getting more resources to border agents and more technology to detect fentanyl. But, of course, Wolf, she's doing this in Arizona. Arizona is a battleground state, one where former president Donald Trump has a lead. And they are trying to not only close the gap on the issue, but also close the gap with the former president. They are also releasing a new ad today on border security, also citing her work as California attorney general, a border state, which is going to air here as well as in other battleground states. So, taken together, Wolf, you can see a strategy coming together with the vice president trying to go on the offensive and turn what has been a political vulnerability for Democrats on its head.

The campaign was attacking Zelenskyy for comments that he made in Pennsylvania, saying that J.D. Vance was too radical. But after Zelenskyy reached out through intermediaries, they turned the page, they had this meeting. And I was told by sources that this was really a meeting for Zelenskyy to lay out his case and that he also reminded Donald Trump that they got along when both of them were in office when Donald Trump was in office.But I will say it is still very unclear what Donald Trump would do to end the war in Ukraine, or even with aid to Ukraine if he were to be re-elected. Here's what he said after that meeting with Zelenskyy. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: We have a very good relationship.

I'm going to pass the materials along to you that would be useful to defeat him. Below is the final prep for the first debate tonight. Read and be strong and ready for tonight. Now, Wolf, according to prosecutors, there's no indication that anyone who received this actually open this emails, but it gives you a sense of what the Iranians were up to.

And that's why I brought together some 50 countries, some -- two -- two-and-a-half years ago to meet in discuss how we're going to continue to provide security assistance that we've done that consistently every -- every month. We meet every month, either in person or virtually, and our support to Ukraine has been unwavering. We're going to continue to focus on giving them what they need to be successful on the battlefield. And again, one -- one specific weapon wont be the answer, to every problem on the battlefield. And I think, you know, what we've seen recently is that Ukraine has the ability to now produce its own weaponry in terms of UAVs that are proven to be very, very effective in that fight. And some of these UAVs can range out beyond 400 kilometers, which is beyond the range of ATACMS or Storm Shadow or anything else that we would be able to provide. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, we only -- we understand from the ministry of health that there are preliminary death toll for that strike is six, with 91 injured. But given that six buildings were totally flattened in that strike, which we understand several 2,000-pound bombs were used, basically bunker busters that it's very likely that the death toll will rise dramatically in the coming hours.
