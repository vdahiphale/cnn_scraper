He's also really brutally indicted his own party, arguing that far to much time has been spent on these cultural battles and not enough time on these generational challenges. So, you heard a little bit of that there, talking about the threat of China and Russia and how America is going to adequately respond to AI replacing American jobs.He has long championed moderation, castigating the far right and the far left, saying it's the moderates that actually get stuff done on The Hill. And he was an effective lawmaker during his time in Washington, getting many bills passed. Now, historically, he's been a strong fundraiser and an aggressive campaigner, but it's not clear the Republican Party has an appetite for what he's offering at this time. I was in Iowa just a few months ago and he was there. And you can see he was testing the waters. We'll have to see if people are receptive to this message. But he is unique in that it is just sort of him and Chris Christie, really, that are so directly confronting the former president.",

And that speaks, frankly, not just to the fact that Trump is continuing to dominate in this field, which he is, but also the fact that Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida, who had been seen as the likeliest, you know, possibility to topple Trump has gone down. He has not, you know, sustained what had been a decent polling number.And so I think that you're seeing a lot of people who want to get in. That thins out the opposition to Donald Trump. So it is not just, is there an appetite for, you know, a candidacy like Will Hurd's on its own, but it's that when you're actually looking at a field in which clearly there isn't a huge appetite for that just based on how well Trump is doing and then DeSantis behind him, you're then splitting a smaller segment of the party up. So, you know, I think that, listen, I think Hurd, I think Chris Christie, think that they are making important cases. I think they are making cases about the soul of the Republican Party, which has changed tremendously under Donald Trump, and what they would like to see go back to, you know, if not, you know, I don't think the Republican Party was ever, you know, purely of Will Hurd and Chris Christie. I think they're more moderates. But I do think that there was room for them in the Republican Party. Now there's much less of that. I don't know how much attention anyone can get right now just challenging Trump when Trump is sucking all the oxygen out of the room, both on his own and also because of his legal problems.",

He said in order to achieve what they were trying to do, which is to create a lightweight submersible that could fit a lot of people, in this case five, they made decisions like not having a conning (ph) tower, which would allowed people to get in and out of the submersible and open the hatch to allow oxygen in if it made it to the surface, which is obviously a problem.

You pay a small deposit. Then you pay a little bit more when they reach the first milestone. And a bit more when they reach a second milestone. Those milestones are based on depth achievement. And they - they were constantly missing them.And we're not talking massive depths. So, when I eventually pulled out at the end of '18, they hadn't got below 300 meters. Bear in mind that the wreck's at 3,800 meters. There was -- I also had some reservations about the way it was being constructed using - using construction piping for ballast. That's the kind of thing you do when you're trying to put something together between, you know, let's get some rope and try and get across this river. It didn't seem the sort of thing that you'd would be doing for a commercial craft repeatedly to go down to great depths. They had a bit of an instance when they were testing off of the Bahamas when there was a lightning strike and it blew all electronics. That's one thing. But my question was, where's the backup? Where's the redundancy? Because if that happens, you're (INAUDIBLE) to sink. You know, you're a bit - bit of a mess. But the final tipping thing was that it became evident that they would going to seek certification for the vessel to dive once, let alone to do repeated dives, like your previous correspondent intimated. It's - it's a different beast going down once to going down several times. And when - when they weren't even intending to get certification by calling it an experiment, that's when I thought there's just too many red flags here, so I pulled out.",

Upon arriving at Newark International Airport, he was swarmed by fans, barely clearing the signs above him in the terminal. And, as you can imagine, riding the subway, that proved a little tough. On Tuesday he caught a Bronx bound d-train to throw out the first pitch at Yankee Stadium. Look at that, he barely fits in the station let alone inside the subway car.And that was - that first pitch not exactly a strike, but certainly better than mine would be. Most of us don't have hands, though, the size of dinner plates, which is - which was very evident when he posted this. That is, just to be clear, a regulation-size baseball, is it not, Phil? MATTINGLY: No, that - that is. And literally throwing a better first pitch, that is all I have over this individual. He's tall. He has huge hands. But what about the swing span? Now, from one hand to the other, Wembanyama measures a whopping 8 feet. That's a longer wingspan than a bald eagle. His standing reach is almost 10 feet. Which means he can almost touch a regulation basketball rim without jumping. Still, how tall is 7'5\" really? Let's take a look at some NBA greats for comparison. Muggsy Bogues was the shortest player in NBA history at 5'3\". His \"Space Jam\" co-star, and the most important part of his career, Hall of Famer Michael Jordan was listed at 6'6\" when he played for the Bulls. And how about LeBron? LeBron James, the four-time NBA champ, is 6'9\". And at 7'1\", the Diesel and good friend of CNN THIS MORNING and one Poppy Harlow, Shaquille O'Neal is still four inches shorter than Wembanyama. But what if Poppy and I were standing back to back-to-back starting in the back court for the Spurs next season, how would that actually look?",
