But many Democrats are in panic mode right now suggesting at least privately, he should consider stepping aside I get reaction from a key House Democrat this hour.Also tonight Donald Trump is seizing on President Biden's performance and slamming in as incompetent. The Trump team celebrating as their candidates and many debate lies were overshadowed by President Biden's troubles. This hour, we're getting a new read on how CNN's historic presidential debate played in key battleground states that could decide the election talking to voters in the pivotal swing state of Pennsylvania. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in the Situation Room. We begin with a seismic reaction to CNN's historic presidential debate. President Biden and former President Donald Trump both on the campaign trail today, one on a desperate damage control mission, the other taking something of a victory lap. Our correspondents are covering the candidates and their post-debate spin. First, let's go to CNN's Arlette Saenz. She's with President Biden in New York right now. Arlette, how is the President attempting to clean up his widely panned debate performance?",

He actually specifically said that it wasn't about age likely because as we know, Donald Trump is very sensitive to conversations around age given that he is just a bit younger than President Joe Biden.The other thing that he said is that he had heard that Donald -- that rumors that Biden might drop out of the race, but he didn't think that was true because he believes Biden polls higher than any of the other Democrats names that will be floating around to be the potential nominee. I will say one thing I want to point out here, this was not an entire hour and a half of personal attacks on Joe Biden. I had spoken to a number of Donald Trump's allies who said that they had hoped he would take this victory lap and stay on message like we saw last night. And for the most part, despite this cheering crowd, Donald Trump has done so. Wolf. BLITZER: Kristen Holmes and Arlette Saenz, to both of you, thank you very much. Joining us now, Representative Debbie Dingell, a key Democrat from the Presidential battleground state of Michigan. Representative Dingell, thanks so much for joining us. CNN has learned that even among some White House officials, some group text chats about the debate are quote, and I'm quoting now from these text chats, \"abysmal, everyone is deflated,\" end quote. Do you agree with that assessment? REP. DEBBIE DINGELL (D-MI): Look, I'm not going to sugarcoat it, President had a bad night. That debate was not a good debate. But he acknowledged that today. But I, by the way, don't think it was a good debate for Donald Trump. In that one -- I want to be very clear, a campaign should have told us that he had a cold, should have prepared us for that raspy voice. So from the very beginning, you're like, what's with the voice? But Donald Trump doubled down and everything that so many of us were concerned about, starting with he's proud of overturning of Roe vs. Wade, meaning he doesn't think women should be able to make their own decisions about their bodies. He -- what he said about January 6, he continues to say he's going to release people that have been found guilty, that he doesn't see anything wrong with it. He even attacking policemen or people wanting to hang his own vice president, he's continuing to call for tax cuts for his billionaire friends and corporations. But what's he doing for the middle class? He has no specifics. We all have to talk about the economy, every last one of us from now until November. He took shots at seniors, took shots at Veterans. This is a man who's got a record that's nothing to be proud of. And he double down on many things that we have a responsibility. And Joe Biden's got a responsibility to remind people up between now and November.",

And you know that, Kristen, come on.Again, the guy's allowed to have a bad night. Let's remember a couple of things. This is a pattern we have seen over and over again, the first debate of an incumbent president they have a bad night, they tend to come back strong in a second debate. And, you know, look, I think the -- again, it does not change the fact that you had Donald Trump's and this is the things that voters are going to ask themselves, Donald Trump was gleeful about killing Roe v. Wade, Donald Trump doubled down on economic policies that our own reporting has said, will raise prices for middle class Americans. I don't think people knew those facts of the case when they actually nominated him for the Republican nomination. So I think it's a little absurd to suggest that somehow, you know, yes, Joe Biden's old. We knew that. But as Ana said, we also know he's a good decent man who has been trying his hardest to lead us out of a COVID epidemic, to help get this country back on track, to help strengthen our economy. And I'd say also as a black voter, what's a black job? I guess I'm doing the black job right now. I would love for Donald Trump to explain that as well. And I want to remind us that a lot of the content that we saw last night is playing very differently online than in the conversations we're having right now.",

Andrew, do you agree with this ruling from the Supreme Court? And what will it mean for the January 6th rioters who are already convicted? ANDREW MCCABE, CNN SENIOR LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST: Well, Wolf, it's a reasonable ruling. I think people can still disagree about the interpretation of the statute. I'm surprised that the court went in the direction they did, because this court tends to take a very traditional textual approach to their interpretations. And just on the text of the statute, I think things would have gone the other way for the Justice Department. Nevertheless, this is the decision we have, it will have a big impact on any January 6th defendant who's already been convicted of an offense under the statute, 1512(c)(2). I suspect that the Justice Department will go back in each of those cases in which the defendants challenged their convictions, and then certainly they all will, and will make a case by case determination as to whether or not they should just agree that those convictions should be vacated, or they'll actually fight to keep those convictions on the books. If the defendants have had any involvement or if there are facts or allegations in their cases that they were involved in fraudulent elector schemes, for instance, it's possible the Justice Department will try to fight to maintain those convictions. But we'll have to see it's going to be a long process and a lot of work.",

There are two other charges still in the case.However, Jack Smith, I think is going to have a powerful response to that, which is the Supreme Court also said that this obstruction law does apply where somebody tries to submit forged or false documents. And as Andy mentioned, I think Jack Smith's response there could be, well, part of this scheme here was submitting false slates of electors, therefore, were OK within the statute. So the first decision point here is going to be Jack Smith's. Does he agree to dismiss the two obstruction charges and not have to deal with this? Or does he try to fight to save them? If he tries to fight to save them, then it's going to go to the trial judge, Judge Chutkan in here. I think overall, though, Jack Smith probably has the better of the arguments.",

I highly doubt that.
