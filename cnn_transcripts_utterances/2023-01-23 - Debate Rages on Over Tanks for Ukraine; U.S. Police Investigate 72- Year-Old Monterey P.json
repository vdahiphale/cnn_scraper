The latest on the tank debate as Ukraine braces for Russia's next offensive. Then, another U.S. community is in shock after a mass shooting. What we know about the 72-year-old gunman who killed ten in California. And then later, the document debacle. More classified documents found outside the White House. How President Biden's classified crisis stacks up against the Trump investigation. But first, this evening, Ukraine is preparing for what officials expect will be a new Russian offensive in the Spring. And as Western allies are debating about sending tanks to Kyiv. Poland's foreign minister says his country is determined to send tanks whether other countries decide to or not. On Sunday, the Polish Prime Minister accused Berlin of, quote, \"wasting time by not approving the export of German-made Leopard 2 tanks, those on your screen there. German officials say they have not yet received an official request to do so, and insist they will not block the transfers. Germany's defense minister says his country will decide soon about whether to send tanks themselves. Meanwhile, Ukraine's foreign minister says he is also -- has no doubt that the Leopards will reach Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says the need is dire. He spoke with CNN's affiliate \"ARD's\" correspondent Visalli Goblet(ph). (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT, UKRAINE (through translator):  This is no time for bargaining.

The FBI, for instance, didn't need to have a search warrant to get into the president's residence in Wilmington, Delaware, on Friday. They had to have that kind of thing after Trump didn't allow them access to his residence in Florida last year. The scale of this also appears to be different. We could be talking about so far around two dozen documents in the case of President Biden. Donald Trump had at various times hundreds of documents, more than a 100 classified documents were taken away from his residence by the FBI. So, there are clear differences in this case. The problem is that politically, and to many voters, this is going to look like Donald Trump had classified documents and President Biden has classified documents. And that is something that Republicans have been able to exploit, to blur the cases, to harm the White House, and to give some cover to Donald Trump as he faces the possibility of indictment by the Justice Department in this matter.",

In the case of Trump's removal of documentsand retention in the Mar-a-Lago, the former president has made several statements that indicate that he thought those materials were his. He's also made claims to have declassified many of those documents, although he's proved no evidence of that whatsoever. And so, he's kind of backed himself into a corner where he can't now claim that it was a mistake. In the Biden situation, you have the exact opposite claims. The president's team has indicated that the president didn't have any idea that these documents have been mistakenly sent with his -- both to the Penn Biden office, where they were initially found, and also to his residence. So you're in very different footing in both of these investigations. One of them appears to be intentional and obstructive, and the other appears to be inadvertent.

Only for them to be later undermined by the discovery of more documents, given the impression that the White House isn't being forthcoming. The kind of drip of a classic Washington scandal. I think the other political problems is that we were already facing the unprecedented and explosive possibility that a former president, a current 2024 presidential candidate, Donald Trump could be indicted over the classified documents issue. If there's any suggestion whatsoever politically, that the president whose Justice Department is investigating Donald Trump is being treated differently than the former president, that's going to cause a massive political kerfuffle. That's something that somebody like Trump, who has a long record of exploiting these kind of things, and also a record of inciting violence, could use to his advantage in the 2024 campaign. And I think it does raise questions, although these cases are distinct and you could make, I think a clear potential case for obstruction on the part of former President Trump, whether that is something that is politically sustainable in this political atmosphere is I think a big question now.",

The problem is, is that politically, it's very easy for Republicans to blur those differences.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MICHAEL HOLMES, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): It's been called black gold. Large sacks of charcoal illegally hauled out of Virunga National Park, as opposed to Sanctuary in the Democratic Republic of Congo, known for its endangered mountain gorillas and the dense forests they live in. But it's the trees that are drawing these desperate people to Virunga. The timber can be cut and burned to make charcoal. The lumber used for firewood, the sale of either could determine if a family eats or not. It's a way of survival for many of the tens of thousands of refugees who have taken shelter near Virunga after the M23 militia renewed fighting against government forces just over a year ago after nearly a decade of relative inactivity, and took control of key cities in the eastern part of the country. In the past two months, more than 200 hectares, about 500 acres of parkland had been reduced to stumps because of illegal logging. Some of the refugees say they have little choice. JEAN-BOSCO BITEGANE, DISPLACED BY M23 INSURGENCY (through translator): Since we have been in a refugee camp, humanitarian aid has not arrived. It's been three months since we received any help.

There have been efforts to mediate the conflict with M23 a ceasefire last year raised hopes that eventually some displaced people could return home. But the government says M23 has not fully complied with the agreement by withdrawing from some areas, only to regroup in others. And there are growing regional tensions. M 23 is a mainly Tutsi group that captured territory near the border with Rwanda. The DRC, along with the United States, has accused Rwanda of supporting the rebels, which Kigali denies. All the instability could add to the number of displaced people near Virunga, which means more pilfering of the land. That's bad for the park and bad for the people taking refuge near there.
