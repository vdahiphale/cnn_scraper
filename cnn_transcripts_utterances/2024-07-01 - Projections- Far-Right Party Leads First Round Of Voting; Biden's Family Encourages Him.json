Once seen as a fringe movement, the National Rally could be positioned to assume power and become the first far right party to enter French government since the Second World War.

It's kind of shocking and a big thing that they are now in power, or next week, at least they will have a workable majority that will enable them to govern France.The big question is now what does President Macron going to do. He has another three years on his term. He obviously cannot function with Madame La Pen or Mr. Bardella for a very long time. So what is he going to do? Is he going to accept the fact that France will be kind of paralyzed as the government for the next three years, or is he going to do what he loves best, which is surprise everybody and play poker and asked for even more clarification, which is why he called this election. His problem is that this clarification process kind of clarified him, you know, he's become transparent. And it's going to be interesting to see what the majority of the Ensemble National we'd be after the second round, will be an absolute majority, in which case, Macron can maybe maneuver around. But, you know, there are big issues facing them. I mean, Macron is a great participant of Ukraine and a lot of aid to Ukraine. Madame Le Pen and Mr. Bardella, and, you know, most of their voters are kind of useful idiots of Mr. Putin. So what is going to happen as far as that? And also, Macron is a great proponent of more even more Europe, even more European unity. Madame Le Pen had, you know, a few months ago, still, she was planning a Frexit.

A sobering weekend for so many year. Biden seems to be staying put for now. Is his campaign salvageable, though, do you think. And if it is, what can the President do this coming week to help put that debate performance behind him?NATASHA LINDSTAEDT, PROF. OF GOVERNMENT, UNIVERSITY OF ESSEX: Yes, that's a really good question. I think that's been the question that Democrats have been asking themselves if they've been in crisis mode since that debate performance that took many, as the report indicated off guard that he just appeared to be incoherent. It wasn't just that he performed so-so, that he had a few moments, particularly the moment where he fumbled on talking about Medicare, and instead of Big Pharma that were really causing some alarm. And so you had donors sort of really questioning, is this the right candidate? But I think the biggest problem for the Democrats is they don't have a clear alternative, it would be Kamala Harris, that would be the natural choice. But her approval rating is worse than Biden's. And the administration didn't do a particularly good job at making sure she was front and center in the last, you know, four years, or three and a half years or so. And making sure she was in charge of portfolios that would make her more popular. And then the other choices that you kind of hear in the media or maybe, Gavin Newsom. But then again, he's not that popular in California. He does a 52 percent popularity, approval rating there. But he has a lot of liabilities that could come out during the campaign that the Republicans would pick apart. So I think the issue for the Democrats is if there wasn't really clear alternative to Biden, then I think they could really pressure to go for it. But that doesn't exist at the moment. They appear to be in disarray, which is something that the Republicans, of course, are capitalizing on in the bigger issue is it's really up to Biden himself. He has to say, I want to step down, I'm going to do it for the best, you know, the betterment of the country. I've served my country. He'd have to find something to do it in a way where he maintains his dignity.

Now, in the coming hours, the U.S. Supreme Court is set to decide whether former U.S. President Donald Trump has presidential immunity.

      "sentences": "The justices are set to issue their ruling on Trump's claims of absolute immunity from prosecution. A decision that Trump is not fully immune from prosecution could clear the way for the former president to stand trial this fall.But the decision could also lead to another round of litigation and appeals that would push any trial beyond the 2024 election. The case stems from special counsel Jack Smith's indictment of Trump last August over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Trump responded by claiming he was immune from prosecution because he was president. The trial judge in this case, Tanya Chutkan and the Circuit Court of appeals, both rejected Trumps claims of immunity, but the Supreme Court chose to take up this case and they heard oral arguments in April. Several of the justices, including Chief Justice John Roberts were skeptical of the Circuit Court decision that fully rejected Trumps immunity clans. They focus on whether there should be some immunity for a president's official duties compared to his private actions. This suggests that the justices could grant Trump some degree of immunity for his official actions. But not for those actions he took that went beyond his role as president. That could pave the way for the election subversion case against Trump to move forward. But how quickly any case actually goes to trial depends on whether the justices address Trump's conduct specifically in their ruling or if they only set a standard for prosecution that the lower court would then have to apply to this case. If that happens, Trump could potentially start a whole new round of appeals, likely pushing any trial beyond the 2024 election in November. The special counsel asked the Supreme Court in December to take up this case and this appeal immediately. But the justices declined to do that. Instead, letting the case work its way through the appeals process. That's what led to April's hearing and the wait now for Monday's consequential Supreme Court decision, which is coming a little over four months before the 2024 election.

Video also showed that there were some scuffles that broke out and some fires as well. Police made several arrests and ultimately used water cannons to try to disperse the crowd. At one point, protesters actually surrounded the car of a government minister banging on the windows, throwing things at it. The minister was not hurt though. Now since the founding of Israel Ultra-Orthodox Jews have been exempt from military service as long as they were studying in a religious school called the Yeshiva. But more than 25 years ago, a court overturned that and successive governments have tried and failed to find a lasting solution to this issue. Tuesday's Supreme Court ruling reaffirmed that the law does not allow the Ultra-Orthodox to be exempt for military service. And even bars the government from funding yeshivas whose students refuse the draft. Now there are politicians who say that there is no shortage of troops. But the IDF says that they could use the extra manpower. This issue is also exacerbating the secular religious divide in the country. Now integrating the Ultra-Orthodox into the military will be slow since they have to serve in special units. But in the meantime, this ruling could have major political implications. The prime minister's coalition government is reliant on the support of two Ultra-Orthodox parties and losing even one of them could cause the government to fall though so far neither has indicated that they plan to topple the government.

But another lethargic performance was of great concern to the England fans who witnessed Slovakia taking a first half lead through Ivan Schranz.

They were just seconds away from crashing out of the tournament when their young star, Jude Bellingham produced a sensational equalizer. What a way to save your team. What a way to salvage their hopes for this tournament when all had seemed lost. He somehow conjured up an acrobatic volley, an overhead kick to keep England in the tournament. This young man has only just turned 21 years of age. He's mature way beyond his years. He's just enjoyed a double winning season with Real Madrid and now he is officially a national hero too. And to give you a sense of how desperate the England fans were feeling, this is how they look just before that goal and then somehow everything changed, from utter despair to unbelievable delight. Suddenly the three lines could believe again. From an equalizer in the dying seconds to a decisive goal just seconds into the extra time period.
