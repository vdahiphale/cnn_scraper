Explosions were reported at a major Iranian air base just south of Tehran. These satellite images, obtained exclusively by CNN show no extensive damage at the site. An American official says the US wasn't involved in the attack and the White House says that de-escalation is now the focus so that a broader war in the region could be avoided.Let's get some perspective on this latest back and forth between the adversaries. We're joined now by retired Navy officer Kirk Lippold. He's the former commander for the USS Cole. Sir, thank you so much for being with us. Your reaction to this apparent Israeli strike? No noticeable major damage at this site. Did Israel, would you say, achieve its objective?",

But I am curious about your perspective on how this changes the brewing conflict between Israel and Iran, because for years they've gone after each other, but typically through proxies. Now this is a direct attack, and it seems that it's shaping a precedent for the future.",

      "sentences": "Boris, that's a great point. Because what has happened is the veneer of a conflict between Israel and Iran has now been peeled away. And the blunt reality is, while proxies were used in the past, as many people have noted, now what you're seeing is direct conflict and essentially a state of war now exists, albeit undeclared, between Israel and Iran. And what it may end up signifying in the long run is Israel may make the policy decision that we don't care anymore if it's a proxy.If these proxies, be it Hezbollah, Hamas, Palestinian Islamic jihad, attack Israel in any form or fashion, Israel now is going to green light attacks directly into Iran to hold them accountable, whether it is the facilities that have allowed these groups to be man trained and equipped, or whether it is after the government itself.",

      "sentences": "I think one of the key points that US policy now has to consider is the larger context strategically that we're looking at. Iran has continued to move forward with their nuclear weapons program despite the veneer that we might have for the joint comprehensive plan of action or the Iran nuclear agreement. At the end of the day, the bottom line for the United States and the world is Iran cannot be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons.The last thing we want to have is a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. Plus, Iran has shown that they still desire to destroy Israel. If they get a nuclear weapon that puts Israel in the awkward position where they now have an enemy sworn to their destruction, that has a unique capability that they've already demonstrated, they really don't care what the rest of the world thinks. They're going to continue to go after Israel and the United States. And consequently, you may in fact be igniting a larger war should nuclear weapons allowed to come to fruition with the Iranians.",

Opening statements could begin Monday. At the same time, a hearing is also underway now on Donald Trump's request for a change of venue in the trial. We'll continue to monitor that as well. Boris?",

I don't have those type of numbers on this one.As a matter of fact, as you know, we have several members that, some out of New York, and they're in districts where Biden won by 15, I think one maybe even 16 points, so I'm pretty sure that we could lose a couple of votes there. And, of course, we're down to one person. We have a day that there's people that are out, that are sick. Life happens as you know, weddings, things like that, deaths and families, illnesses, and we're out. And then we will actually hand the gavel over to Hakeem Jeffries. And when we do that, I feel like this administration has gone so far hard to the left that is where their base is. Every other demographic, they're -- you've seen the polling numbers, they're actually diminishing. And I'm afraid that they will try to appease their hard left, and they will go through our constitution like grant through Richmond.",

He was against funding Ukraine. He was for Israel. But all those except Israel, he seems to have changed his position on. So -- but I still, I don't know that's a, that's a cause for ouster.I think that we're going to have to -- we need to just -- we need to go out with him through the rest of this year, end of election cycle, and let's just see what happens.",

But I wanted to sort of paint an overarching picture of what this money looks like, because I've heard some folks say that they're opposed to just writing a blank check to Ukraine, and that's not exactly what's happening.There's $20 billion for the US to replenish its own stockpile of weapons. There's 11 billion that would help American operations in the region, some 14 billion that would buy weapons for Ukraine, most of which are made here in the US so the money would be spent here. And then that loan that you mentioned is roughly $10 billion. You were obviously upset that there's a provision in there that you wanted to make it so that the President wouldn't be able to just make that -- cancel the debt, essentially. But there is $26 million that goes to oversight, to accounting for all the money that's being spent in Ukraine, which is something that folks that have opposed this aid before might want to see. Is that not worth it, in your eyes, to keep Vladimir Putin in check without actually putting American troops at risk?",

We do have to go but I think generally some of the concern is that this money, even though it is borrowing against our future and adding to the debt, as you point out, actually saves money in the long term.

      "sentences": "So a Sandoval hearing is essentially an opportunity to give a defense witness or the defendant himself the opportunity to know what might be coming if he were to take the stand. Now, every judge is going to weigh two different things. One is called probative evidence against prejudicial evidence. Probative meaning is it informative for the jury to make a decision. You weigh that against prejudicial decisions, essentially is it going to make me think that this person's probably prior bad conduct means that if they did it, then they did it now.The judge wants to know in advance what will be presented before this jury. Now they're hashing it out right now for a number of things. The prosecution wants to bring up things like the prior civil fraud trial and conviction. They want to bring up the E. Jean Carroll defamation and sexual abuse case. They want to bring up any other instances of fraud as well. Why, to show some pattern or practice of behavior. Not to show they committed this crime, but that there's informative for the jury and the probative value outweighs. But what's happening in the courtroom right now is the judge is saying, look, I'm not going to have a trial within a trial. They're meanwhile saying, if you want to bring up any of those civil things, just know the jury might be confused between a preponderance of evidence besides a beyond a reasonable doubt standard. And interestingly enough, they brought up Michael Cohen and said, all right, if Trump's prior bad acts are fair game, why not Michael Cohen's? The judge shut that down and said, I'm not going to compare oranges to apples. It's well underway. It's getting heated.",
