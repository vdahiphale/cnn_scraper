Her report contains some images that may be distressing to viewers. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NADA BASHIR, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A flash of light over the chilling, imposed darkness that engulf Gaza every night. A glaring promise of more death and destruction. The ongoing siege and a communications blackout, plunging Gaza into eerie silence. What little video has emerged so far paints a picture of the devastation brought by Israel's relentless bombardment. Scenes of incomprehensible lost, shrouded bodies, the latest amongst thousands of victims. Israel says it is targeting Hamas. Now also expanding its ground operations. A retaliation, they say, to the Hamas terror attacks of October 7th, which left at least 1,400 dead and more than 200 others held hostage inside Gaza. But in the besieged strip of land, the number of Palestinians killed also rises with each and every airstrike. \"The situation here is dire. Our homes were destroyed in the airstrikes. Six of our family members were killed. What can we do? We are all living through this.\" This was the scene on Friday, at the Al-Shifa Hospital, the largest in Gaza. Now, not only a lifeline to thousands of patients, but a sanctuary to tens of thousands, including children, displaced by the war. \"We are not even asking for food, we are not asking for water. We are asking for safety and security. Our men, women, our children, they've all been killed.\" Many have come in the hope that hospitals will remain a safe haven. But this safe haven is now being characterized by Israel, with no verifiable evidence, as a potential target.",

But nonetheless, this expanded ground operation, and the statements that we heard today by the Israeli prime minister and the other members of his war cabinet, all very much intended to show that this is a very significant new phase of Israel's war against Hamas, a phase that will see Israeli troops, tanks, and armor inside the Gaza Strip for some time.Already it has been more than 24 hours since those expanded ground operations began. And in those 24 hours, what we have witnessed and what we have heard are the sights and sounds of a stepped-up military campaign. Heavy bombardments of northern Gaza, artillery fire directed at the Gaza Strip, and a continuation of these barrages by Hamas towards Israeli towns and cities. All of this, as we were standing on the border with Gaza, we could also hear small arms fire, machine gunfire. Clearly the fighting ongoing between Israeli troops inside northern Gaza and Hamas militants. We also know that the Israeli military has been increasingly targeting Hamas's tunnels underground. 150 underground sites were struck in last night's heavy bombardment by Israeli forces. Now the question is, what will happen going forward? Clearly, the Israeli prime minister and his war cabinet, framing this new phase of the campaign, framing this war against Hamas in existential terms, calling it a second war of independence, and saying that it is a matter of Israel's future existence in this world. And also making clear that this will be a very long war and perhaps a very costly one as well -- Becky.",

Similar to how your colleague, as you just described, can't get in touch with his family to know how they are doing, we are facing the same thing with our 54 staff members in Gaza. But what I can tell you is what I was hearing from as recently as yesterday, which is that each day is getting worse and worse for Palestinians in Gaza.Every day, my staff was telling me that the night before had been the worst night of their lives. And this was a recurrent day after day, as the situation continues to deteriorate. Ongoing aerial bombardments, not only contained in northern Gaza and Gaza City, but also south of the Wadi Gaza line where Palestinians have been told by Israeli army to flee two weeks ago. Dwindling supplies, including fresh water, clean water, fresh bread, and of course medical supplies and hospitals quickly running out of fuel. The fuel has become one of the major issues in Gaza because without fuel hospitals can't operate, bakeries cannot bake their breads, water cannot be desalinated and pumped into homes.

Certainly, the Red Cross or the Red Crescent, describing to us the problem with that is getting equipment in through Rafah crossing in order to be able to facilitate any services that might be offered by Starlink. How important would something like that be at this stage? LOWcommunicate with our staff and for them to be able to do their work. And so, for us, Starlink is definitely something that we have been discussing since Elon Musk made that announcement. We are also looking at alternatives. One of the things to keep in mind, as we face this communications blackout, is that one of the core ways that we have been able to respond while our staff in Gaza has basically been hibernating and focused on keeping themselves and their families safe is that we've been able to provide cash grants to some of Gaza's most vulnerable families. But in order for them to access that money there needs to be telecommunications -- there needs to be the ability to communicate with them. There needs to be the ability for the cards that they receive those money on to work.

So when you are starting to hit those kind of targets that are part of these target packages, they're all within the population. That's the problem with fighting inside an urban environment where the civilians are just omnipresent.
