For the first time, the defense expected to hammer away at Cohen's credibility and challenge -- this is the new part -- what they say were lies in testimony directly implicating Donald Trump.Remember, this is all about Trump's alleged falsification of business records to hide a hush money payment and hide it from the voting public. With me now is CNN's legal analyst and criminal defense attorney, Joey Jackson. Also, CNN political commentator and former Trump White House communications director, Alyssa Farah Griffin. Thank you both for being here this morning. Joey, the defense spent a lot of its time on Tuesday trying to ruin Cohen's credibility, talking about past lies throughout his life even. What do they have to do today to try and get the jury to have some reasonable doubt about these very charges?",

You want to get revenge against the former president. Isn't that right? You have personal animus against him. Isn't that fair to say? This is about payback and retribution, OK? And so, I think they'll go into that. The other issue will, of course, be the issue of prior inconsistent statements. What is that?

I think they're going to try to get him to show that side of himself -- the reactive side. His job is to not -- it's to stick to the facts. It's to remain calm, cool, and collected, but also just chipping away at the credibility. This is a person who is a known liar. This is somebody who has perjured himself before. And the more times they can repeat that, the more it can just give that bit of reasonable doubt to just one juror. So we'll see how he does today. I honestly don't know.

Menendez was a man who put greed first. A man who \"put power up for sale,\" saying that this wasn't politics as usual -- that this was politics for profit and that he used his wife, Nadine Menendez, as a go-between to accept bribes.Prosecutor Lara Pomerantz summarizing it this way to jurors, saying the following. \"He was powerful. He was also corrupt. For years, Robert Menendez betrayed the people he was supposed to serve by taking bribes. And what was his price? Gold bars, cash for his wife, and a job for his wife.\" Of course, talking about the gold bars and the hundreds of thousands of dollars of cash that was confiscated at their home in New Jersey. The defense, for its part, really had to get right to it with jurors, describing what he called and addressing the green and gold elephant in the room. Saying that he knows it looks fishy. This is defense attorney Avi Weitzman saying that he knows it looks fishy. He put up a screen showing a locked closet, saying it belonged to Nadine and saying that Robert Menendez didn't even have access to the closet. And that's the closet where the gold bars were found. He also said that those gold bars belonged to Nadine Menendez's family. He also went on to say this. Listen to this, Kate. He said, \"She wasn't going to let Bob know she had financial problems so she tried to get cash and assets any way she could. But she kept Bob sidelined. Nadine made sure Bob was kept out of the conversations involving money. In this case, we need to -- we need to figure out: Where's Bob?\" Of course, making a reference to \"Where's Waldo,\" which made the court -- some in the court laugh at that moment. That was the only moment of levity, if you will, during that proceeding during openings. He went on to tell jurors that there are no emails, no phone calls, no text messages directly linking him between these two co-defendants and any bribes. So it's very clear at this point they're going to be laying part of the blame -- the defense is going to be laying part of the blame on Nadine Menendez who, as you know, is being tried separately.

We're really expecting this to ramp up through the day and into the overnight.Here's that new high risk that was just issued this morning for parts of eastern Texas and western Louisiana. This high risk is exceptionally rare. It's only issued four percent of the time, but it's responsible for 80 percent of our flood damages nationwide and more than a third of our flood fatalities. So this -- again, we need to take this very seriously. Even that moderate risk goes up to Dallas as we go through the day today. This is the flood watch, and we put the river levels on here to show you that the situation is already really aggravated. We already have rivers that are at that flood stage because of all the rain that we've gotten in the last couple of weeks. I mean, look at this. We're looking at upwards of 20 inches of rain that has fallen in the last 30 days there just north of Houston. And that is about 600 percent of their normal. Six times the normal amount of rain that they would get. So again, the soils cannot take any more rain at all and that will cause the flooding to happen even more quickly. And we do know that our rain is getting heavier. As our atmosphere is warmer, it holds more moisture. In Texas, they're looking at that rain being 21 percent heavier since the 1950s. Across much of the Southeast, it's almost 40 percent heavier. Here is a look at how this is setting up. We've got the showers and storms from Oklahoma City stretching into Texas. As we go through the day today you can see them really blow up. Look at all the reds and the oranges -- all that heavy rain. And look at the timeframe. As the sun is setting is when we could really see some of this heaviest rain. Flooding at night incredibly dangerous because it is hard to see when those floodwaters rise so rapidly.

A lot of them take place in October.So take a look here. This is Americans voting before Election Day. Back in 1984, it was just five percent. You jump forward to 2004. There was some real movement towards early voting after the 2000 election. It jumped to 21 percent. This year, 57 percent of Americans say they plan to vote early either by mail or in person before Election Day. So the fact is, yes, it does make some sense to have these debates early when folks are actually making up their mind and haven't already cast a ballot.",

You know, when it looked -- when it comes down to the issues, the American people don't like what we currently have. They remember they were better off under Donald Trump. The border was more secure under Donald Trump. So he wants to go and show that head-to-head comparison between the two policies -- the two results. And so in his view, this seals the deal.

I think this shows a degree of confidence and not desperate -- desperation in the way it's being cast. I think people thought he wasn't going to debate. He is.
