And remember, in the run up to the 2022 midterm elections where a lot of pundits over confidently predicting a red wave, President Biden decided to double down on his message about defending democracy. A lot of people said he shouldn't do that. He should focus on economic issues, kitchen table issues, so-called. And He was rewarded the exit poll show. Democrats did much better than expected. And you've had elections where people are voting in reaction to the overturning of Roe v. Wade here in the United States. Economic issues are important to people. But at the end of the day, democracy is the foundation for it all. And I think, unfortunately, what you're seeing is that there's good reason to campaign on defending democracy given Donald Trump's rhetoric, given his increasingly autocratic policy menu. And I think one thing you've got to give President Biden credit for is from the very beginning of his campaign, he has said that we are living in a time of a contest between democracy and autocracy. I think that's right. I think geopolitics and domestic politics show that to be true. And so going to the iconography location of Valley Forge as a sometime Washington biographer, I think is resonant because it's where, you know, we've faced difficult times in our past, times when it looked like America's back was to a wall.

Before a singleperson has actually voted, I think it's cowardly that, for example, the Republican leadership has all coalesced around him in even before a single person has voted in the first caucus state, Iowa. And \"The New York Times\" reported the other day that when Tom Emmer, Republican whip, endorsed Trump after being viciously criticized by Trump just a few weeks ago, scuttling his attempt to become Speaker of the House, Trump sort of marveled, they all take the knee. They all take the knee eventually. Well, you know, polls don't vote. People do. And I'm a big believer in letting people vote. I think polls can often overstate support. There's a lot of noise in the polls, particularly in caucus when citizens reason with each other. I think there are a lot of people persuadable within the Republican Party looking for an alternative to Donald Trump. And I think DeSantis and Nikki Haley both did themselves a great service last night. They were polished. They were clear. They were hitting their stride. Is it -- is it -- should they have drawn the contrast with Donald Trump more clearly three months ago rather than 10 days out? Yes, Chris Christie was the only one doing that at that time. But Nikki Haley in particular has an electability argument that's profound if you look at the polls, would be a historic candidacy. And so, nothing is over until people vote. There are issues with winner take all election rules that will give Trump an advantage down the line. But momentum can shift decisively, particularly when you're dealing with these early states of Iowa and New Hampshire, known for their independence. So, don't count anything out.

At Al-Nasr Hospital, the dead lay waiting. After an Israeli airstrike killed 14 people, including nine children, according to the Hamas- controlled Ministry of Health. MAHMOUD SALEH, GRIEVING UNCLE (through translator):  Where is international law? There is no law. They kill children. Children -- they are getting shelled as they are sleeping. They are bombing them, killing them with what blood? What blood? DIAMOND (voice-over):  Even the emblem of the Palestine Red Crescent Society is no shield. The group's headquarters in Khan Hounis struck for the second time just this week, killing one and wounding six. The IDF told CNN it was reviewing the previous strike and held a, quote, \"operational debrief to draw immediate lessons\". Amid the strikes, some are once again on the move.

Now overnight, the Israeli military says that they struck over a hundred targets in the Gaza Strip, a lot of activity concentrated not only in Southern Gaza but also in Central Gaza, including as you saw at the top of the piece there in Deir el-Balah, which previously thousands of people had been told to evacuate to.",

There are clear priorities for this whirlwind trip. It's really extraordinary -- nine different stops all across the region. Israel, I think, will be the focal point, really the centerpiece of it, those meetings with Israeli leadership. And it's clear that, as the State Department has said, more progress needs to be made, the U.S. thinks, when it comes to what Israel is doing in Gaza. The U.S. has repeatedly said that they want civilian casualties to go down, civilian deaths to go down, that more humanitarian aid needs to get into Gaza. And that is so difficult because of the ongoing fighting. The U.S. does not want to be seen as telling Israel what to do, dictating terms, but it's clear that the Biden administration wants that transition from what's been called a higher intensity phase of the fighting, which we've seen for the past three months, to a much lower intensity phase. When that's going to happen is unclear. It's expected to happen in the coming days and weeks, but gradually. We're already beginning to see signs of that. But Bianna, beyond Israel, lots of stops and regional aero capitals , as well, we're --they will talk about those crises around the region, which of course there are major fears that those could spread. You mentioned some that we've seen attacks --repeated attacks, more than 20 by Houthi rebels from Yemen against commercial shipping. We have seen more than 115 attacks by Iranian-backed groups against U.S. and coalition forces in Iraq and Syria. Just yesterday, the U.S. responded. Targetting a leader -- a militant leader in Baghdad, in the Iraqi capital, which is quite extraordinary. But I'm told, Bianna, that the biggest concern, the one that U.S. officials are losing sleepover, comes from Hezbollah and the prospect of a second front being opened up with Israel in Israel's north. Of course, we saw the assassination of a Hamas leader in Beirut, and that raised fears that Hezbollah could take the fight in an even harsher way to Israel. So it certainly concerns about this fight broadening out from just Israel and Gaza to the greater region because of the spate of incidents we've seen in the past week. Bianna.",

Once the Red Cross vehicles had arrived, thousands of Gazans -- thousands - - children, elderly, everyone came in and started to climb on the cars and bang on the cars. I was holding my girls and I was scared of a lynch mob. And this was the first time that Raz had said to me after a month and a half of me protecting her, mommy, I'm scared.

There's barely any food. Taking a shower is not something that's happening. We came back sick because of the poor hygiene. I don't want to think about how they're treating men there.
