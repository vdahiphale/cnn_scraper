      "sentences": "Good evening. I'm Erica Hill, in for Erin Burnett.OUTFRONT tonight, bracing for impact. Parts of Florida, which have never been hit by a major hurricane, in the crosshairs tonight as Hurricane Idalia now a category 2 storm continues to pick up speed. Forty-nine counties are under a state of emergency at this hour. I want to show you some live images here. This is actually Key West. Conditions there quickly deteriorating. Folks are dealing with those tropical storm winds and also a damaging storm surge. Let's take a look now at Fort Myers Beach that. Keep in mind, that area too is still recovering from Hurricane Ian, which hit last year. These record warm waters in the Gulf and even in the southern Atlantic have really helped to fuel the storm's intensity. It is projected to be a category 3 hurricane by the time it makes landfall. Remember, a category 3 is winds of at least 120 miles per hour. And this current track here has the storm striking Florida's vulnerable Big Bend area. The National Weather Service is warning that you really can't compare this storm to anything because, quote, no one has seen this. A particular concern is Cedar Key. It's now at the center of this storm's track, about a hundred people in that island area are still refusing to leave even though officials fear that the town itself could be completely cut off from the mainland by a storm surge of some 8 to 12 feet. Tampa Bay also bracing as much as 4 to 6 feet of storm surge, anticipated there. And it isn't only Florida. Georgia and the Carolinas also under a state of emergency amid fears that that could trigger flash floods and tornados. Our team of reporters is out across Florida. Let's begin this hour with Chad Myers who's in the CNN Weather Center. So, Chad, as we look at this swiftly intensifying storm, what is the latest here?",

      "sentences": "Well, the hurricane hunter aircraft are flying through the storm right now, and they found an alarming number to me, 966 millibars, that's down significantly from the last time they flew through the storm, which means the storm is intensifying.The lower the pressure, the higher the wind speeds. Sometimes it takes a while for the wind speeds to catch up. But when you start to lower the pressure, you intensify the storm, 100 miles per hour right now. I suspect that number is going to keep rolling up all night long. You can see the eye on the latest satellite picture. We can easily see it on the radar from Tampa and also from Key West. But 115 miles per hour offshore, still strengthening, because it has some more time in the water, and then landfall somewhere maybe around sunrise tomorrow. That's the good news. I mean, sunrise is, you know, what, another 12 hours away. So it doesn't have a lot of time still in the water to gain a lot of strength. Not like we're looking at 35 more hours in the water where this thing could really get going. Now, it is going because we have lightning now around the center. When that happens, we know that the storm is strengthening itself. There is the wind speed there. St. Petersburg just had a wind gust of 35 miles per hour. So, you talk about this, here comes the storm. It's in the middle of the Atlantic -- in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico. It won't move. Sailors should go ahead and get this a little kick start so that we can move this on up, as we're going to see the landfall right through there. And as it moves, continues up, we're going to see six inches of rainfall, significant flooding, flash flooding rainfall flooding for the people that are trying to get out of the way, they have to watch to see which way they should go because you don't want to be in the middle of that when you're trying to get out of something else, the saltwater flood. You don't want to be in a rainwater flood. That's for sure.",

They come in from all around the country. I mean, this is their job, this is their profession. So they're ready.

Floridians, some of them are just -- they think they can withstand everything. Seeing these surges in these small towns, a lot of us drove on our whole lives.
