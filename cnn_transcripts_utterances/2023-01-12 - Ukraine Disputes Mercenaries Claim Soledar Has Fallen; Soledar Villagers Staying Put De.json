General Valery Gerasimov, the head of the Russian general staff will take over the campaign.He replaces Sergey Surovikin, who was only appointed in October. And CNN's Clare Sebastian joins us now live from London. So, Clare, what more do we know about the man now tasked to lead Russia's war in Ukraine? CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Yes, Rosemary. Valery Gerasimov is the head of the armed forces. He is essentially Russia's chairman of the Joint Chiefs. He's been in that job for more than a decade, overseeing Crimea, Syria, all those campaigns. So, this is not -- this is the fourth general that will be in charge of Russia's war in Ukraine. But this is no mid-level general. This is essentially the top soldier in the country. It's not a demotion for him, he retains his current title, it seems and it's not clear whether this is about strategy or personality. It's not clear whether this makes it more likely that Russia will now launch an offensive in Ukraine and new offensive in the coming months. The ministry of defense statement was pretty vague. But it did say the increase in the level of leadership of the special military operation was a reflection of the amplified range of tasks, the necessity of closer cooperation between services and branches of the armed forces. So, read into that what you will, but what is clear is that you don't tend to switch up the leadership if things are going really well. Sergey Surovikin, who is now there's going to be the deputy Gerasimov, when it comes to running this operation as Russia calls it in Ukraine. He has been in that job -- he was in the job for since the beginning of October, has overseen Russia's retreat from Kherson, the only original capital that it managed to take a brutal but not decisive bombardment of Ukraine's energy grid blunders, like for example, having all those troops, those conscripts in one place when Ukraine launch that rocket attack on New Year's Day, killing what Russia says is 89 of its conscripts. So, it's clear that there have been issues in the past few months, but as to what this means, going forward and what Gerasimov will bring to the job, I think, there is mostly speculation out there about what it could mean.",

SEBASTIAN (on camera): Now, this was the official estimate for last year. Defense spending was expected to have grown by about 30 percent compared to 2021. National security spending, meanwhile, by about 20 percent. But oil and gas revenues were expected to grow by about a third. They ended up coming in higher than expected according to the finance ministry, but so did spending, tipping the budget into a bigger than expected deficit. Now, this year, we're looking at more defense spending a rise of about six percent. That's roughly in line with inflation. But add to that, a 58 percent planned increase in national security spending and a complete reversal of last year's oil and gas windfall, and this means budget cuts.

Also, because they knew by bivalent vaccine, we have in the United States and most of the good vaccines around the world will cover it.

So, when they do, and then they have one of these errant systems go bad, right now, they're trying to tighten up all that security. So, they say, well, we have this bad piece of information.
