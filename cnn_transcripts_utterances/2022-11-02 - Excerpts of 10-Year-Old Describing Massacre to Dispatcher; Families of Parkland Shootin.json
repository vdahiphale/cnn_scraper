CNN has obtained new audio from the Uvalde elementary school shooting in May that killed 21 people, 19 of them children. What you're about to hear is the voice of a then 10-year-old girl who was trapped inside the school with the gunman speaking to a dispatcher. Little Khloe Torres is among the lucky ones who survived. And now for the first time since that dreadful day and with the permission of her parents, they're hearing recordings of her repeated pleas for help as well as law enforcement's response.

At 12:10 p.m. on May 24th, fourth grader Khloe Torres, who survived the shooting was inside room 112 at Robb Elementary and spoke to 911. Police just a few feet away in the hallway were just minutes later made aware of the worst-case scenario was unfolding. Khloe along with her classmates and teachers some dead or dying were alone trapped with an active shooter. It's the phone call that should have made the difference. Instead, it would be another 40 minutes until police finally enter the room and kill the gunman. CNN has obtained the call never made public until now. A warning to our viewers. It's painful to hear. We're choosing to play portions of the audio with the approval of Khloe's parents. And because it is crucial to understanding the full scope of the law enforcement failure that day.",

Things like surface ballistic missiles. Extremely concerning to Ukraine because they say that we have air defense. We don't have missile defense. They're actually saying that basically wouldn't really be able to shoot down these missiles. So, that's concerning. And separately, Ukrainian military intelligence says they expect that Iran is going to deliver another 200 attack drones to Ukraine earlier this month. So, it could be around now -- sorry, to Russia, rather, to use in Ukraine.

The numbers we're talking about, 1,000 weapons coming, 200 of them may be drones, don't sound like a huge number in the ark of the war gear, but the way Russia has been using them to target specifically the energy infrastructure is a worry. And the fact that Arash-2 can go further. It's more intelligent, more sophisticated. It can change its target while it's in the air. The current set of drones can't do that. You fire them and they go where they're told to go. And the fact that it's payload of explosives could be five times as big as the current drones being used. All of these raise concerns, particularly in light of the way that Russia's using them, specific targeting to pressure the government, to bring down the power grid.
