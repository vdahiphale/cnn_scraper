And I'm Rosemary Church.Just ahead, voters will have to brave historic cold weather to take part in the Iowa caucuses later today. We're in the final hours before Republicans in that state begin making their choice for a presidential nominee. An unofficial U.S. delegation visits Taiwan after a momentous election. We will have a live report from the region. And lava is pouring into a town in Iceland after a nearby volcano erupts, prompting evacuations. Well, with 10 months to go until the U.S. presidential election, Republican voters in the state of Iowa are just hours away from officially kicking off the 2024 race for the White House. Iowa is home to the first in the nation presidential caucuses, which begin Monday afternoon. Republicans across the state will have to brave some brutal weather to make their voices heard, with snow falling and wind chills as low as 45 degrees below zero expected throughout Iowa. The latest polling shows former President Donald Trump with a very comfortable lead over his two closest competitors Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis. And all of the presidential hopefuls spent Sunday crisscrossing the state looking to drum up last-minute support from undecided voters. And while Iowa is getting the race started, candidates are also looking ahead to the next contest hoping to head into the New Hampshire primary with as much support as possible. Our Jeff Zeleny looks at what's at stake Monday in Iowa.

JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): Donald Trump is eyeing a knockout victory in Iowa, hoping the first contest sets him on a rocket ride to the Republican nomination.

One, DeSantis does have a stronger organization. And second, Haley is relying on the parts of the Republican coalition that feels the least attached to the modern Republican Party. And whether they will feel sufficiently motivated to come out on a night when it's going to be below zero, black ice and horrific wind chills remains to be seen.

Either way it is kind of a dead end for the Florida governor.As I said, he has staked essentially his whole campaign here. He's followed the playbook that the last three Iowa winners use. Mike Huckabee in '08, Rick Santorum in '12, Ted Cruz in '16. He's borrowed in, he's visited all 99 counties. He's invested heavily in an organization. He's steered his message to the right. He's attracted tremendous support from the state political leadership, from the governor to the Republican leaders in the House, the State House and Senate, to most of the key evangelical leaders in the state. It's kind of reverse New York, New York. If he can't make it here, can he make it anywhere? He is, you know, polling very poorly in New Hampshire. I think if he does not surprise with an unexpectedly close finish to Trump that gives him some momentum, his race, I think, is effectively over, whether he wants to acknowledge it right away or not.

Two or three of the homes have burned so far, we've seen the images of that. But what's really interesting is in December when this last erupted in the last major eruption, they built these lava walls. These are walls that are meant to divert the lava and sort of save the town. And they've so far been very effective. That's sort of an innovative approach. Obviously, you have to have very, very strong material to try to stop this lava. It's very, very hot, obviously, very, very dangerous, but it is slow moving so people can get out of the way. Of course, there's a threat to agricultural areas and livestock and things like that. And you know, they just don't know how long it's going to last. The longer that this lava flows from these fissures that have developed, you know, the more danger it's going to become for the people around. But there haven't predicted any sort of stoppage to the air traffic or anything like that. Because this particular eruption isn't one that sent a plume of ash up into the sky, like we've seen in previous years. This is really just the danger of the lava flow for now, Rosemary,",
