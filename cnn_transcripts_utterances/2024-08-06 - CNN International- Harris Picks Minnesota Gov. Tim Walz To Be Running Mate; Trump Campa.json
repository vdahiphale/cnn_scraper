Let's get straight to our breaking news this hour, and we begin with breaking news on the brand new Democratic presidential ticket. Vice President Kamala Harris has chosen Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate. A source tells CNN, Walz was a staff favorite of the Harris campaign, and people familiar with the search process say Harris became increasingly comfortable with Walz over the last few days. Walz is a former congressman, teacher and commander in the Army National Guard. He is expected to make his debut as Harris' running mate alongside her at a rally in Philadelphia in just a few hours from now. Let's turn to Senior White House Reporter Kevin Liptak in Washington. Tell us the why behind this pick?",

      "sentences": "Yeah. Well, I think officially what you're seeing, the Harris campaign is really pointing to Walz's biography as an example of his appeal to white working class voters who have been increasingly turning to Donald Trump over the last several elections, really trying to put him in that place. And it's clear that they do hope that he can help peel those voters back for Kamala Harris in November, and I think when you talk to advisors, that is one of the top reasons that he was her ultimate selection.Minnesota doesn't necessarily present a huge win for them electorally. Democrats have won there dating back decades. Instead, I think the hope is that the type of voter that he can appeal to, it stretches across states, from Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, really trying to bolster the electoral map in a way that can help them win. The other big factor when you're talking to Harris advisors is this idea of chemistry, and they were able to meet in person on Sunday here in Washington at her home. They went and talked for an interview, and what you hear is that they really were able to click. There was a vibe that was just good in that meeting. They didn't necessarily know each other all that well heading into it. But, Kamala Harris was able to determine just from those talks that she was going to find someone who she could serve with, who she, for example, would want to have lunch with once a week if she wins office, that this is someone who she can serve alongside effectively for four, potentially eight years as Vice President, and that was an incredibly important thing as she was making her decision. Now, the task for the Harris campaign will be introducing him to the American people. He does not have a huge national profile heading into this campaign. That will start tonight in Philadelphia during this joint campaign appearance. We have seen them already put out a TikTok video trying to underscore some of these biographical aspects of Tim Walz's background. For example, he was a teacher. He taught high school social studies and geography. He was the high school football coach. He was also the advisor to the high school Gay Straight Alliance. These are all aspects that I think the Harris campaign wants to emphasize to demonstrate that this is not a career politician by any means, and that he has this appeal that makes him sort of in every man. There is a certain salt of the earth aspects to him that they really do hope can contrast, for example, with J.D. Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee, but also appeal to a much broader range of Americans than Harris would be able to appeal to on her own. And so, what you'll see over the next several days is Harris and Walz hitting battleground states on this barnstorming tour. They'll be in the Upper Midwest, where he is from, in Wisconsin and Michigan. They'll hit the Sun Belt, Phoenix, Arizona, and Las Vegas, Nevada, all trying to sort of ramp up excitement and continue this streak of momentum that she has been enjoying since she became the Democratic standard bearer about two weeks ago.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. I think it has been somewhat of a surprise to many Democrats, just given how essential Pennsylvania is to any electoral strategy. It is a real linchpin for Democrats. Kamala Harris, if she is to win November, will really need to win Pennsylvania. I think the hope and the expectation is that Tim Walz will help her do that. Certainly, Josh Shapiro would have been helpful on that front. But, I think this idea of chemistry was more readily apparent to Harris' advisors when it came to Tim Walz than it was with Josh Shapiro.Now, Shapiro has been conciliatory, certainly. He says he will continue to try and elect Harris to become President. He will be at that rally this evening in Philadelphia. So, certainly, no sore feelings publicly. But, I think it will be an open question and something that we'll try and report out over the next hours and days, is why exactly Shapiro didn't make the cut. There have been some Democrats, for example, the fellow Pennsylvanian, John Fetterman, who were trying to make the point to the Harris campaign that Josh Shapiro was a very ambitious politician, and he had questioned whether Shapiro would be willing and able to serve in a role that is secondary by its nature. I think if you talk to Shapiro and his supporters, certainly he would have been able to do that. But, that was a question that some Democrats had heading into this contest. I think with Walz, she found someone who very clearly be able to act in her shadow. That is the nature of the Vice President, the nature of the running mate, and I don't think that there are any questions in the Harris campaign today that he will be able to effectively promote her and boost her in that vice presidential role.",

Maria Cardona is a Democratic Strategist and CNN Political Commentator. Meghan Hays is a DNC Convention Consultant and a former Special Assistant to President Joe Biden. Ladies, welcome to you both. Maria, let's start with you. What do you think of Minnesota Governor Tim Walz being on the ticket? MARIA CARDONA, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, &amp; DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: I love it. I just got to know Governor Walz, because we both serve on the Democratic National Convention Rules and Bylaws Committee. He is one of the co-chairs. And when we had our very first meeting, Amara, I looked at the Zoom looking for a governor. I didn't see anyone who looked like a governor. I'm like, well, where is he? And he started talking. And there was this guy in a car, and he had a baseball hat on and a t-shirt, and he is like, Hey, Maria, and it was like I was talking to my next door neighbor that I've known all my life. It was really that connection. I could feel it even over Zoom. So, I totally understand what the Vice President means when you hear that she made this choice based -- obviously based on biography and accomplishment. No question. All of the candidates had that, but that at the end of the day, it comes down to that chemistry, that connection, that gut feeling at her core, with her intuition, if you will, in terms of who is going to be the best governing partner and who is going to have her back every step of the way, no matter what. And I think that Governor Walz checked all those boxes, plus he is a fierce warrior. He is a happy warrior. He can speak to all of those voters across the Midwest that Vice President Kamala Harris knows she needs to appeal to.",

As you say, he has a compelling biography, and that's why he was chosen, along with the chemistry that he has with the Vice President. But, the bottom line is, Meghan, Minnesota is not a swing state. It's been reliably Democratic. It's voted in presidential elections democratically for the Democrats for the last 50 years or so. Is this a risky choice? MEGHAN HAYS, FORMER SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO PRESIDENT BIDENthink so. Look, when Barack Obama picked Joe Biden, Delaware wasn't a swing state either, right? This is about the character of the person and the character in his biography, and what he brings to the table. He is able to talk to Midwesterners. He is able to talk to folks in those blue states. He is able to talk to folks and working families. He was a schoolteacher for two decades. He was a member of Congress. He was enlisted in the military. Like, he has a record and a biography, and is the type of person and the character that resonates with the American people, and will be able to understand what they're going through, understand their issues, understand their economic issues, and be able to resonate -- will resonate with folks like that. He is down to earth. We saw that in the last couple of weeks with the weird comment and in the way he has done his TikTok, and he is on TV right now with his t-shirt and a hat on, and he is just -- he is an everyday American that will really resonate with everyday people who are just out there trying to feed their families and get their kids to school and live a great life.",

That's to you, Maria. CARDONAbecause one of the other things that he talks about when he addresses somebody like J.D. Vance is how false he is, is what a phony he is, because J.D. Vance also likes to talk about how he is from a small town in Ohio, etcetera, etcetera, but he is a venture capitalist. And so, he along with Donald Trump, who, as Governor Walz puts it very well, a robber baron, how can those two together ever really understand what working families go through? How can they two together, what they're about -- what they're doing now? They have never been about public service. They have never been about trying to make other people's lives better. They are in it for themselves, both of them. And I think that that is an argument that Governor Walz can make. He talks about how he grew up in a town of 400 people, how his graduating class in high school was 24 people, 12 of whom were his cousins. And so, as somebody who is a veteran, he is a gun owner, but he fights for middle class families, working class families. He fights for paid leave. He fights for $35 insulin. He fights for the $2,000 prescription cap for seniors. Every single policy that Kamala Harris and the Biden administration have fought for is something that Governor Walz has been able to deliver to Minnesotans. And so, that is something I think he will be able to make a sharp contrast on, and at the end of the day, I think the vast majority of American people are going to agree, this is a team, Kamala Harris and Governor Walz, is a team that's going to fight for me and my families.",

But, he brings a lot of qualities to the ticket that make it easier for Kamala Harris to sell her brand of the Democratic Party.And by the way, Walz is not an extreme liberal.

VANCE (R-OH), 2024 VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: -- day one, suspended deportations, proposed mass amnesty for millions of illegal aliens. She stopped construction of the border wall and she stopped the Remain in Mexico policy that kept a lot of Americans safe. Now, today, we're going to talk to a lot of Americans who have suffered and had children and loved ones who have died because of these border policies. It has led to record fentanyl overdoses in our country. It's led to a lot of migrant crime from people who shouldn't even be here. And it's, of course, driven up the price of housing for a lot of Americans who shouldn't have to compete with 20 million illegal aliens for scarce homes. Obviously, the big news of the day is that Tim Walz has been nominated as the VP, or is now the presumptive nominee, I should say, for Kamala Harris. My view on it is it just highlights how radical Kamala Harris is. This is a person who listened to the Hamas wing of her own party and selecting a nominee. This is a guy who has proposed shipping more manufacturing jobs to China, who wants to make the American people more reliant on garbage energy instead of good American energy, and has proposed defunding the police, just as Kamala Harris does. I think it's interesting. Actually, they make an interesting tag team, because of course, Tim Walz allowed rioters to burn down Minneapolis in the summer of 2020, and then the few who got caught, Kamala Harris helped bail them out of jail. So, it is more instructive for what it says about Kamala Harris, that she doesn't care about the border. She doesn't care about crime. She doesn't care about American energy. And most importantly, she doesn't care about the Americans who have been made to suffer under those policies. I'll take a couple questions. I want to hit the road and go to this press conference.

And I think it's shameful for Kamala Harris but increasingly for the media that she is taking a basement strategy of running from reporters, instead of getting in front of them, answering tough questions about her record and letting the American people know who she is. President Trump and I take hostile questions. We take non-hostile questions. We get out there and talk to people because we respect the American people enough to want to persuade them and not to try to run for them. So, I think you guys got to do a better job. That's my humble opinion.",

I saw him pretty excited and animated to take on Walz. And look, that's a good thing, because Trump needed the energy infected into the -- injected into this race. And what J.D. Vance has been unable to do is get people to turn their heads and say, wow, this is a really interesting pick.Now, today, on the day that we have now learned Kamala Harris' pick, it's a moment in which we have to wonder, how much does this energize the entire Democratic base? Is this going to make sure that people want to turn out? And I say to that, the answer is yes. Walz has been for a couple weeks now seeming to be the darling of the progressive left and that youth vote, that Gen Z vote that put Biden-Harris in the White House in 2020 is energized by Walz. So, I think this was not only a good strategic pick on Harris' part, but I do think this is the one that is most principled for her. She had to go with the person she feels most comfortable with, because presumably, this is going to be the person she trusts the most and is going to be by her side for the next four years.",

No. It was Trump who didn't finish the border wall when he had a chance to do that while he was in office. So, that's one ding (ph) there at this campaign, the Trump-Vance campaign. Another is by labeling the progressive left Gen Z, those who are a little bit more left again in the Democrat Party, as the Hamas wing. All I've heard is people saying, hey, we ought to reexamine our relationship with Israel. We ought to be careful where our dollars are going, when we're getting streaming images daily, sometimes hourly, out of Gaza. We are hearing this kind of rhetoric from the Trump-Vance campaign because they're scared.And the final thing I heard Vance use was the word prosecute the case. That's interesting, because neither he or Trump or attorneys, last I checked, not practicing ones, at least, but Kamala Harris was a prosecutor. So, I thought it was very interesting of Vance to say that he and Trump are going to be out there prosecuting the case. What case are they going to prosecute? I think they're still scared, because they understand Walz has the ability to get to Midwestern voters, centrist voters, and those who are even right of center, because he seems quite pragmatic in some of his policy stances.",

Harris and Walz will now face off against former President Donald Trump and his running mate J.D. Vance. The 60-year-old Walz is currently in a second term as Minnesota Governor. He chairs the Democratic Governors Association. And previously, Walz served in Congress for 12 years. A shifting narrative around the U.S. economy could complicate Kamala Harris' bid for the Oval Office.CNN's Julia Chatterley joining us now from New York with a closer look at Harris and the world's biggest economy, one day after Monday's massive stock sell-off.

She'll see higher earners seeing higher tax rates as well. But, beyond that, the expectation is it's going to be a continuation of Biden policy, which is why adding Walz is such an interesting one. He has openly said that this administration has been slow or too quiet to promote its own economic successes, something that he has seen firsthand at the state level. Infrastructure is a great example.So, at this moment in time, perhaps he is an interesting one to add to the campaign trail. He can get out there, talk to the white working class voters, something that Biden struggled with, and say, look, I understand the situation. We need to put in protections. And he has that history. If we look at what he has done in Minnesota, protections for workers. He was a union man himself, a former teacher. He has helped provide protection for Amazon warehouse workers, for gig economy drivers, Uber, Lyft drivers, for example. His policies have worked on supporting working class families. You were talking before the break, free lunches for school children, tax credits, child tax credits. This is what his profile suggests. So, at a time when we're talking about the possibility of a slowing U.S. economy, perhaps not continuing to add jobs, perhaps losing jobs, again, this is the guy that you get on the campaign trail and say, look, I believe in greater protections, and this is the way we tackle it. I've got a proven track record. It's an interesting one for me, perhaps not the most obvious, but an interesting one.",

And I think what we've gone for over in the last couple of months is the belief that a Trump versus Biden situation would probably see Trump win to it being absolutely neck and neck. I think probably investors that want to see a Harris win here would have preferred a Josh Shapiro. They'd like to have seen a swing state lockdown like Pennsylvania. So, the margin perhaps, and you can argue that really people vote only for the President and not the Vice President, this is sort of a pick that would bring disquiet, rather than optimism, that she has perhaps strengthened her case at the November election.

There is certainly a flurry of diplomatic activity in this region, as we speak, to try and de-escalate tensions, to try and make Iran recalculate, rethink what it is preparing to carry out against Israel, as it is very clear that there is an incredibly slippery slope that could lead this entire region into a very significant war. The Israeli government and its military for now trying to telegraph -- trying to project strength, telegraphing that Iran will pay a quote \"very heavy price\", should it choose to carry out an attack against Israel directly. And we know that the Israeli military is readying, not only to carry out an enormous air defense operation, should it come to that, similar to what we saw back in April when Iran launched 300 drones and missiles at Israel, but also that the Israeli military is now preparing for retaliatory strike scenarios, preparing a series of military options, should a response be required. And so, we are right now just waiting to see how this situation will develop any further, as we have yet to get any clear indication from Hassan Nasrallah's speech today, or from the Iranian government in terms of the scope and timing of their actions against Israel.",
