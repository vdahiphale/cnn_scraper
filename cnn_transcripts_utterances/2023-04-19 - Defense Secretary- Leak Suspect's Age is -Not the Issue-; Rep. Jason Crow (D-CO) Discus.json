And as you noted, this is an assessment that comes from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. It was a document that was obtained by The Washington Post, which we ourselves have not seen nor verified.But what it does indicate is that they have made significant leaps to this drone, which is called the WZ-8. It was seen in a Chinese parade a couple of years ago, but intelligence officials did not believe at the time that it was operational. It - this is a rocket-propelled supersonic drone. So rocket-propelled indicating that it uses rocket fuel to fly.   Look at this, look how fast this is, three times the speed of sound. It can fly at Mach 3. And not just fast, but it can fly extremely high, 100,000 feet. Brianna, that is significantly higher than commercial airplane traffic, that is much higher than the Chinese spy balloon which is around 65,000 feet. This is 100,000 feet. So together that makes this drone extremely difficult to detect and to intercept. Now, it is believed that this drone base is in an area of China called Lu'An. And from there, this drone could fly out once it's deployed and collect mapping data in real time. It could target American ships and bases. In the region, of course, we have lots of military assets in Japan, significant targets for the Chinese, could be Taiwan, of course. The drone could fly over Taiwan and South Korea. So this is a remarkable advance in this drone that we are really only learning about because of this massive leak of classified documents.",

So if we put them side by side, you have the U.S. drone which flies at about 300 miles per hour, that is less than half the speed of sound, while you have the WZ-8 that flies at three times the speed of sound.This is an armed drone while for now it is believed that the WZ-8 is mainly going to be used for reconnaissance purposes, but experts believe that it eventually could be armed. The MQ-9 is - has laser guided missiles. it has Hellfire missiles. So these are the main differences. It's kind of apples and oranges for right now. But the big thing that really sticks out is the speed at which the WZ-8 flies. Our viewers, Brianna, might remember this incident when a U.S. drone, the MQ-9 was attacked by this Russian jet over the Black Sea just last month dumping this fuel and damaging the U.S. drone and eventually a drone went down into the Black Sea. These jets were flying over international waters. So this is something obviously that has been known to the U.S. Intelligence Committee for quite some time. This assessment was from last year. But this is giving us the general public a much deeper insight into what China is working on and what they assumed to be may be capable of.",

The changes in battlefield, the changes in evolution of that information had been significant in that time is my understanding. Number two, a lot of this information was doctored, was changed.

Number three, this is not endemic and this is not undermine the integrity of our intelligence services writ large.

Just because you have a top secret clearance doesn't mean you should have access to all of the top secret information. It has to be further compartmented, but based on need to know. Number three is what types of electronic or automated checks we had to put in place that will check printing of information, viewing of information and bringing any red flags to our internal security personnel's ability to research that. So it's really the latter categories. It's the need to know and automating some red flags and preventing printing and other basic things that we really have to dig into and we're going to have to make some investments, frankly, of money and time to fix it.",

So yes, we have to conduct oversight. We have to make sure it doesn't make it into the hands of extremists with the Taliban. And there's a way of doing that. We actually do that with North Korea.

Any moment, the court could rule whether to let a lower court's ruling go into effect that would restrict full access to Mifepristone. The most commonly used abortion drug. A hold on that ruling is set to expire at 11CNN's Jessica Schneider joins us now live. Jessica, what more are you learning about the Supreme Court's moves here?",

      "sentences": "Well, Boris, all eyes are on the Supreme Court as we tick down toward midnight. The Supreme Court really could rule at any point here. And there's a number of ways that they can rule, but there are really two ways that are most likely here.Now first, they could extend the hold on this lower court ruling, which is something that the Justice Department, the FDA is pushing for. Because if they did that, it would keep the status quo when it comes to the abortion pill. It would be completely available as it is now. The second option is that you really could allow the restrictions to take effect by not extending that stay. And what does that mean? If restrictions took effect, it would mean a number of different things in the way that Mifepristone is administered. First of all, it would only be allowed for women up to seven weeks pregnant. Currently, women up to 10 weeks pregnant are allowed to get this pill. Secondly, women would have to go in person multiple times to their doctor. They'd also have to get this abortion pill in-person as opposed to via the mail. So there's a lot that could change, actually, and we're just getting right now - we're getting word that the Supreme Court did just make another decision here. They have extended the stay here, Boris. So this is saying that they're putting for awhile here, I'm not sure exactly how long. It could be days or weeks. They are extending the stay, so they are putting those - all of those restrictions that could have possibly taken effect. They're putting all have those on hold.   So once again, the FDA and the Justice Department have one here, though, incrementally at this point, because this case is still playing out at the lower courts. But for now, Boris, it does remain status quo for the abortion pill, nothing will change. It will remain available as it did in the previous weeks and months. And I'm waiting to see right now if the Supreme Court is going to take this case up. Because remember the lower court here, the Fifth Circuit, they're still really dealing with the merits of this case. They've set up a really fast tracked briefing schedule on this and they're scheduled to hear arguments in this case in just about one month. So the takeaway that I'm just getting now via paper that I've just been handed is that the Supreme Court has in fact extended this stay. Meaning, they are extending, putting the lower court ruling on hold. Meaning, everything remains status quo. There will be no changes to the way that the abortion pill is administered. Good news for a lot of doctors and patients who are bracing for any changes. Good news for the FDA and the Justice Department, Boris. So I can come back with you as I know a little bit more detail. But that's the big takeaway here is that the Supreme Court is really keeping things as they are. While all of these legal wranglings play out below, Boris?",

So it would mean a big difference and not through the mail, so it made a big difference in the way that patients are obtaining this drug, big problems with the FDA and a conflict with the order out of Washington by Judge Rice, which orders the FDA to do what it needs to do to make Mifepristone still available as it's been available in the 17 states and the District of Columbia, the jurisdictions that brought that lawsuit.

And so you do have a conflict, which is why the Supreme Courtdefinitely needs to do something about it.

I actually think - when I thought about how crunched they were with time and I'd been up at the court every day this week seeing them doing other business thinking how are they going to address this if they are not - if they don't have a majority to act in a clear cut way and they obviously didn't.   Because, frankly, I think the easy thing to do would have been just tofurther stay all of the litigation for a longer period just because this has come upon the nation. So quickly, just put those lower court orders on hold. But obviously, they're not convinced that that's the best route as immediately. They might on Friday then give us an order that says: Yes, the lower court orders are unheld (ph). The FDA authorization stands. There are no more - there are - the restrictions and regulation of the pill stand for now and we'll let the merits of the controversy play out. But clearly they weren't ready to say that today, just as much as they weren't ready to say we're denying the administration's request.",

But they must be aware of what's happened since June.There have been serious legal and political ramifications from that and one of the key legal ramifications is that a district court judge in Texas has tried to just end access to the main way that women have abortions these days, even in the states that allow it to be legal. And as Boris said earlier, when he was talking to Jennifer, the Supreme Court when it ruled in the Dobbs case said we are getting rid of the constitutional right to abortion. But we are not tampering with what happens in the states. States can still make it legal. Brett Kavanaugh who concurred in that said specifically we are not outlawing abortion. If they make this pill and change its accessibility as it is now, they are - they will be making much harder to access abortion rights and undercutting what they said in the Dobbs opinion.",

And I know that because a lot of the parties here, the FDA, the Justice Department, even the drug manufacturers have repeatedly told not only the Supreme Court but other courts Jim, just about how much chaos and confusion this is causing. And I'll note that the manufacturer of the generic version of this drug, GenBioPro, they actually just filed a lawsuit in the Maryland federal court here. And they were asking this court to really help them clarify exactly how they're supposed to proceed, asking the court to put in a court order against the FDA. I mean, there's just a lot of chaos, confusion and unsettled view from doctors, patients, the drug manufacturers here. So that uncertainty is not going away.

It's genuine concern, because if the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling goes into effect, if those restrictions or some of those restrictions stand, they're not insignificant. I mean, you mentioned the generic manufacturer of this, this would no longer be approved under this ruling and that accounts for two thirds of the market, right?And I imagine there's a financial aspect to that, because the generic versions are typically less expensive, perhaps much less expensive, but other things as well, window to obtain Mifepristone narrows to seven weeks from 10.

One thing we do know is that there has been an extensive amount ofpreparation behind the scenes, not expecting this. necessarily, but in terms of whatever happens next. I think that's something officials have made very clear between the Counsel's Office, the Justice Department and the White House health team, the President's senior advisors, all kind of working through all different possibilities here, very cognizant of the fact that they can't predict how this is all going to land. They've made very clear they believe they're on the right side of this case. Legally, they believe the FDA has authority is very clear in this case and everything that's been put into place up to this point, doesn't have legal merit, but they are also cognizant of the fact that that doesn't mean it's necessarily going to go their way.
