And they've had years and years of preparation to be able to fight off an Israeli ground offensive inside Gaza. They'll have improvised explosive devices. They'll have ambush sites. They'll have tunnel inferences and exits. They'll come up behind the force. So, it'll be a very difficult battle when Israel goes in, and they want them to do it. And, Zain, you have to look at the big picture on this, as well. There's fighting in the West Bank. There's Israeli concern about Syrian activity, so they've struck Syrian airfields. There's action going on on the north with the Lebanese and Hezbollah. You had the meeting today between -- that's been announced yesterday between the Iranians, Hezballah and so forth.

Occasionally, there would be trouble, some infiltration, some rockets, but they could handle it. And basically, Hamas was going to be worried about the Palestinian people. But that's all a lie. And now Bibi has to face the consequences of all the distraction of trying to change the Supreme Court, of what's going on with the settlers in the West Bank and the resistance by the Palestinians and the Palestinian Authority there, and how the Palestinian Authority's credibility has been destroyed by somewhat by the Israeli actions. So, all of that is coming down on Mr. Netanyahu's head and there's no question about it. But the political reckoning has to await the outcome of making Israel safe and secure.

There's no telling where they're getting the target sets, but from having run an air campaign, I can tell you it's very difficult to generate 400 targets a day. And from the sense of the non-kinetic battlefield that they're in, what we're hearing is all about refugees. And what a tragedy it is. And it is a tragedy for the people in Gaza to have to live under the control of Hamas, which wants to use them as hostages and only aims at the destruction of Israel. But the information -- the other side of the information is not coming out from Israel yet in a way that's effective to offset these horrible pictures of suffering and bombing and so forth in Gaza. And all that has to be understood. You know, the Israelis telling us about who is Hamas, how do they get in charge, what are they doing? And that's not happening. So, Prime Minister Netanyahu's got a lot of work to do with his own government to sort of set this straight. And he will be held responsible. My concern is, in his anger and desire to please politically, he blurted out instructions about eliminating Hamas. I'm not sure that's possible.

And he is very confident that he can win the votes and secure the Speaker's gavel today, something that Republicans have been unable to do for, now, 22 days. He told me he's even done a whip count of the conference and feels confident that he has the votes necessary to become Speaker. But as you mentioned, there's a large part of Mike Johnson's background that's kind of an unknown entity here. He is pretty much untested when it comes to leading the Republican conference. He's had kind of a junior position in leadership up until this point. His fundraising is not what normal previous speakers have had in the past. And as you mentioned, he has very strong positions on the 2020 presidential election. He actually was the member who was asking Republicans individually to sign on to a brief trying to overturn election results in specific states. He voted against certifying the 2020 presidential election. So, if Johnson is able to pull off winning the gavel today, and again, that is a big, if still, he has a number of challenges in front of him, like keeping the government open past November 17th dealing with the wars that are breaking out in Israel and Ukraine.
