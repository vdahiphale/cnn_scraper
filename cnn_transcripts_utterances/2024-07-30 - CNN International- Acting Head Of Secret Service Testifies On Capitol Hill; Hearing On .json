Meanwhile, Donald Trump has agreed to be interviewed by the FBI, a routine situation here, to offer his view of the failed assassination attempt.Katelyn Polantz is tracking this hearing, and she joins us live from our Washington, D.C. bureau. Katelyn, obviously, the tone of this obviously very different than when we heard from Kimberly Cheatle last week. What is the latest so far from the hearing? What has the Secret Service changed about the way it protects people and events, if anything at this point?",

These would be comments online that that he may have been making in 2019-2020. The FBI is still looking at that and pursuing answers there. They are searching for a motive for this shooting. And so, it does appear now, just as we were learning this morning, that they may have a lead on that.",

The acting Secret Service Director is among those testifying. This is Ronald Rowe's first testimony, who you're seeing on the screen right there, is an FBI Deputy Director who has been testifying alongside acting Director Rowe. But, let's listen in to a little bit of this hearing. SEN. TOM CARPER (D-DE): Thanks very much, both of you. SEN. GARY PETERS (D-MI): Next on the Senate Judiciary Committee is Senator Grassley. SEN. CHUCK GRASSLEY (R-IA): Mr. Chairman, I'd like to introduce my oversight letters and investigating documents into the record. This is the information I've already made public.",

It would require Senate confirmation of the Director of the Secret Service. I think this is very important because no other agency has a no-fail mission.Mr. Rowe, in your written testimony, you stated that you -- to prevent similar lapses like the one on July 13th from happening again, you will ensure every event site security plan is certainly vetted by multiple experienced supervisors before it's implemented. Based on your testimony, the security plan for the Butler event deviated from the Social Security standards. How would vetting by multiple experienced supervisors fix that? ROWE, JR.: So, Senator, I think having many eyes on a particular problem set helps. That way, you're not -- you don't have tunnel vision. You just focus in on one thing. And so, that's why I think it's important not only at the field office level, but also at the detail level. And part of what we had started doing with the former President's detail is having them send outside agents, having them send out supervisors. And I think having that collaboration and having additional eyes to examine the problem, we'll make sure that we're not missing anything. And I think I want that surety for myself. And I think --",

And we go out and we talk to them, and we ascertain what their intentions are. On this day, in particular, because of the connectivity challenge, as you noted, there was a delay, and he flew his drone at 3:51 approximately. So, moving forward, we are leveraging resources from the Department of Homeland Security and others to make sure that we have dedicated connectivity so that we're not reliant on public domain so that we can ensure that whatever assets we have in place, those assets are operational.

It was an attempted assassination of not just a former President, but the Republican nominee going forward. So, it's an important issue. This is not going to change the answers that we're getting. It's not going to make them any better coming from the Secret Service.This was a catastrophic security failure in Butler, Pennsylvania, and it needs to be fixed. It's not going to be a problem that solved throwing more money at it. It's a problem that needs to be managed, as you heard the acting director talk about, and it needs to be fixed. [11:15:00] And I think in the interim, the American public need to know that going forward those protect by the Secret Service are going to be kept safe and that the necessary resources are going to match the threat level, not just the threat level in the United States, which is off the charts, but also the specific threat level per the person they're protecting, and that's not something that happened in Butler, Pennsylvania.",

But, you worked with local law enforcement. You worked with others, sort of within this team here. And one of the things that the acting Secret Service Director talked about was that the -- that critical information about the shooter and being seen before the shooting actually happened was, quote, \"stuck in a local law enforcement channel, a local law enforcement loop of conversation\", essentially, and didn't make it, I guess, as directly as that should have been to the main channels of the Secret Service here.And from your perspective, how much of an issue has that been in coordinating events like this, just trying to maintain communication among agencies over what one person is seeing here versus what one person is seeing on another side of the security setup?",

So, the command post is staffed by Secret Service and state and local law enforcement that are participating in the overall security plan.So, to see that this information was especially siloed tells me that there were big problems, not just on the communication side of getting the information to the right people at the right time, but giving the communication, the effective communication needed to let everybody know what their roles were and what they were supposed to do in the event that something like this was discovered, a suspicious person in this case, how -- what process should have been filed and followed to be reported to the Secret Service, and that it shouldn't have stayed within just that local police group.

Remember, President Biden only narrowly won that state in 2020. And when he did, it marked the first time that a Democratic presidential candidate had won in nearly 30 years. So, that is why it is being paid much attention right now, as Democrats see an opportunity here to put it in play again.Now, the reason for that is because not that long ago, President Biden himself visited the state, and when I was talking to Democratic strategists then, they said there was quite a bit of apathy among voters. It was two unpopular candidates, former President Donald Trump and President Biden, and there just wasn't a whole lot of energy to go out to the polls later this year. Well, now, those same strategists say that they are observing that enthusiasm on the ground as well. And people who perhaps are more -- less interested in voting are now open to it and are looking at the Vice President as someone who may earn their vote. So, that is something that they hope the Vice President and the campaign capitalize on in their rally in Atlanta tonight. Now, of course, the campaign is also engaged in a massive media buy, $50 million paid media campaign that they announced today, and that includes an ad that sort of gives us a glimpse of what our argument is going to be in the next few weeks.

I mean, look, this was supposed to be J.D. Vance's first week on the trail as Donald Trump's running mate. And instead of all of this great coverage, kind of the coverage that we actually saw Kamala Harris get, Vance, instead, was very much plagued by these past comments, by other memes, everyone seen the couch memes, things like that. And of course, the campaign does not like it. They do not want that to be the narrative right now.Now, when I talked to Donald Trump's team as well as Vance's team, they say they are very happy with the way that Vance has been in his public speeches last week and the amount he has been fundraising. But, they do want to move away from these comments, which is difficult to do, when not only he keeps getting asked about it, but also more and more reporting, like K-File's reporting is coming out about it. Now, I do want you to just take a listen to what exactly Donald Trump said as he was defending Vance against this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He made a statement having to do with families. That doesn't mean that people that aren't a member of a big and beautiful family with 400 children around and everything else, it doesn't mean that a person doesn't have -- he is not against anything. But, he loves family. It's very important to him. All he said is, he does like -- I mean, for him, he likes family. (END VIDEO CLIP) TREENE: Well, Omar, it's not all he said. But, to that point, I do think, when I've talked to Trump's team about this, they say that Trump honestly isn't that worried about this or even angry at J.D. Vance or having said these comments in the past. Instead, he believes that this is the media kind of blowing it out of proportion. But, again, you never want this bad coverage coming out, especially right after you announced your running mate. And so, that's where some of this is coming from. I will argue as well, though, that there has been some speculation and rumors going around that perhaps Trump has been reconsidering Vance as his running mate. I can tell you that those aren't true. Like I said, they are unhappy with this coming to light. But, at the same time, they are not completely unhappy with Vance, and I know that Donald Trump is not reconsidering him, at least at this time. Omar.",

Meghan, I want to start with you, because it seems like from Democrats' perspective that everything is back in play. Kamala Harris is in Atlanta tonight. And prior to her entering the race, I think there was some thinking that maybe Georgia wasn't as much in play as Democrats might have hoped. Does that change now with her? And I guess more broadly, how does the Kamala Harris map look different than the Joe Biden map? MEGHAN HAYS, DNC CONVENTION CONSULTANT, &amp; FORMER WHITE HOUSE DIRECTOR OF MESSAGING PLANNING: Look, I think the whole map is back in play now in all the battleground states. I think that she is able to shore up the coalition and some of these constituency groups that the President was losing to Donald Trump and to the Republicans. And I think that that's -- it's the enthusiasm and the money that's being raised and all the volunteers that are signing up, and the organizing abilities have really changed now with the change at the top of the ticket. So, it does make the whole map back in play and makes Georgia back in play. Arizona is much more gettable now.

And everybody has just sort of gotten numb to it. Weird and just strange is a new line. And people for the last 10 days have been talking about, well, what ways is Donald Trump weird? And that might actually pierce through because it is new and it is fresh.At the same time, I think that it was interesting that Republicans are responding by saying Democrats by having white men for Trump or having segregated calls and -- or pro-segregation in the party, I don't think that really lands. I think they need to find a new tone in trying to blunt the coalitions that are being formed here. But, at the same time, we've seen the Trump campaign has been on it.

It is going to be a hard fall.So, it's great that we're building the momentum. We're raising a lot of money. So, we will continue to be able to organize. We will continue to be able to go up on air in the fall. But, I don't think that Democrats should be anywhere measuring the drapes by any stretch of the imagination. This is going to be down to the last possible day in all these battleground states, and they are going to have to work very hard in their organizing to get these people to vote and to get people out to vote.

This is a pattern of some -- in some cases, the repression of the Maduro government. We don't know any information, any further information about it. We have verified at CNN, thanks to our fact-checking team, we have verified the video and we can confirm that the video is authentic. And we have asked for a reaction to the Venezuelan Attorney General.But, you can tell, Omar, that there is more alarm and more urgency from the opposition's rank. The candidate, Edmundo Gonzalez, was meant to come here today to speak to these supporters, has also denounced several deaths that have occurred in the last few hours in the protests. So, the protests have, in some cases, spiraled into violence, and deaths and casualties have occurred. Talking about where I am right now, I'm in one of the main avenues of Caracas. I am surrounded by, I think it's fair to say, hundreds of opposition supporters. I've spoken with several of them, and most of them had been telling me that they feel cheated on. They feel that the electoral results that the National Electoral Council has given out are fraudulent and that they want a full audit and a full accountability. One more thing, Omar, the opposition has deployed in the election on Sunday, has deployed a network of tens of thousands of volunteers to monitor the vote counting operations and take force (ph) of the ballot paper that people -- that they received from the electronic voting machines. It's the same machine or very similar machines to the Smartmatic ones that you in the United States are so familiar with (TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY) last news about the election in 2020. Well, here the machine printouts, a ballot paper. The opposition is uploading all of the ballot papers they had on a website that they say gave them an advantage of about 70 percent of the vote to their candidate Edmundo Gonzalez. So, many people here have been able to verify what they say is the ballot paper in the voting center where they voted and to realize whether (inaudible) Edmundo Gonzalez or Maduro won.",
