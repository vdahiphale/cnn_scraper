President Biden says Tuesday ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah is a crucial step to ending war in the Middle East. Trade turmoil. Mexico's president says tariffs won't solve the issue of migration, while the Chinese say no one wins in a trade war. Talking Turkey. The CEO of retailer Butterball talks price pressures and cooking tips ahead of Thanksgiving. And Swift success. We speak to the author of a new book comparing Taylor's impact and innovation to pop legends like David Bowie and The Beatles. That conversation and plenty more coming up. But first, Israel's security cabinet approving a ceasefire deal in Lebanon. President Joe Biden confirming it will begin just hours from now at 9:00 p.m. Eastern time, that's 4:00 a.m. local time. It follows more than a year of hostilities between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. According to President Biden, Israel will gradually \"withdraw,\" quote, its forces and civilians from Southern Lebanon. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  Over the next 60 days, the Lebanese army and state security forces will deploy and take control of their own territory once again. Hezbollah terrorist infrastructure in Southern Lebanon will not be allowed to be rebuilt. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He's also the author of \"The Power of CrisisThreats and Our Response Will Change the World.\" Ian, great to have you on the show. This ceasefire has been months in the making, and as Netanyahu pointed out, there's some part of it was delinking a ceasefire in Lebanon from a de- ceasefire in Gaza. What do you make of his reasoning for why this happened and why now? IAN BREMMER, PRESIDENT, EURASIA GROUP AND GZERO MEDIA AND AUTHOR, \"THE POWER OF CRISIS\":  The delinking was with the U.S. election. It had to happen after the election because he didn't want to give a win to Biden- Harris, and he hasn't. But beyond that, it is a very positive development in a war that has not had that many positive developments over the last year. This is an end to the war and it allows Israeli citizens over 60,000 to return to their homes and schools, allows over a million Lebanese that have been displaced by the war and over 100,000 that have been evacuated from the south of the country to go back to their homes. And the Israelis are not going to be interested in restarting the war if that means that they're going to have to evacuate those citizens again. So, there's stickiness to this, Julia. It is actually reasonably likely that now that a ceasefire has been agreed, that we're not going to see a continued war in Lebanon against Hezbollah. And the biggest give here, it's a big win for the Israelis militarily, and it's a win for Prime Minister Netanyahu. But it does show that he is willing, having decapitated Hezbollah's leadership, having significantly degraded their military and communications capabilities, that he is not trying to destroy Hezbollah the way he has tried to destroy Hamas militarily, and that is something that had not been a presumption. A lot of Israeli generals wanted to keep going. And so, this is going to end up -- you know, it will be -- it'll be a useful thing in stopping all the bloodshed for, you know, sort of hundreds and hundreds of thousands of innocents that have been caught up in all of this.",

They could have continued to push on and try and destroy them further. Tie this to the next administration as well, because for now, at least, and the hope is that this will continue, the ceasefire lasts for 90 days. It takes us into the second iteration of President Trump. Clearly, Netanyahu also believes there's an advantage here in some way for clearing the air for Trump. He didn't want to give advantage to Biden. But what does this now mean for the situation in Gaza and for the fight against Hamas, and as Netanyahu pointed out, Iran too, and the focus there?",

We're clearly seeing movement with the Israeli-Lebanese situation or Hezbollah, the Ukrainians are making noises that they're perhaps hopeful that the war ends in 2025. We've seen Trump in the last 24 hours suggest that he's going to enact on day one tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China. I think China obviously expected, the other two, perhaps a little bit unsure. He's certainly throwing his weight around and having an impact. Do you expect leadership in these nations to react differently or differently from the way that they reacted first time around?",

Theyhad the little green men, but that was an ongoing low-level fighting. This is a very different story. And Zelenskyy has made clear he believes that the war is more likely to end more quickly, both because Trump is coming in, also because they're losing territory and the Ukrainians are having a harder time fighting. Now, I mean, the big question is going to be, what is Trump prepared to give Putin? Because Putin really wants the economic sanctions to be ended. Is the United States prepared to do that and -- in return for a ceasefire? And will the Europeans go along? That's an open question. Putin certainly is going to want to have that normalization economically to show that he's not a pariah for the west. That's how he wins, if he's going to give a ceasefire to the Americans and the Ukrainians, it'll be very interesting to watch that. The night falls on Eurasia Group here in New York. What do you do? Beyond that beyond that, of course, you do have these tariffs that have just come announced by Trump -- by President-Elect Trump. You're right there against the Canadians and Mexicans. I will tell you privately, the Canadians or Mexicans are already trying to figure out what they can give an incoming Trump administration that will stop those tariffs from being enacted. These are the two countries that are most dependent on their trade relationship with the United States. They have literally nowhere else to go. No hedging they can possibly do. So, they don't want this fight. Those are relatively easy wins for the Trump administration to get. China is going to be much more challenging, and we'll see where a Trump- China relationship goes. I will tell you, it's interesting that he's linking all of them in his Truth posts on fentanyl. And on the one hand, fentanyl is a big issue for a lot of people that voted for Trump. It's something that -- you know, a red meat to the base. He wants to give them something, show he's doing something on fentanyl. But the numbers on fentanyl addictions are already coming down. So, in that regard, it is possible that Trump is making this a headline so that when he becomes president, he has something he thinks that he can announce as a win, even if not that much additional is accomplished. It wouldn't surprise me if he's thinking about that.",

So, the president's announcement last night over Truth Social, the president-elect's announcement was not a surprise. We've heard all the things, all the clips that you played. We've seen those before. We've been preparing our members for well over a year for this potential, but we didn't know how he would go about accomplishing it. And so, this announcement with the 10 percent on China and the 20 percent - - or 25 percent on Mexico in particular, one of our top sourcing countries, was a wakeup call for those of us who are trying to figure out costing and how this will impact both the brands and the importers as well as the retailers that buy our product.

We've been diversifying now for 15 years, but those costs will be passed on to the American consumer. We've seen this time and time again, particularly in the family retail channels and the mass retail channels. And we even did a survey last week, asking over 2,000 voters here in the U.S. about how they feel about tariffs, even asking Trump supporters themselves, how they feel about tariffs and while there's broad support for tariffs in particular, for national security items and other goods, when you start to like, hone down and ask about footwear specifically, nearly 70 percent of the president's own supporters do not support tariffs on footwear, particularly kids' shoes that have upwards of 70 percent tariffs already. And so, we are trying to work with the administration that's coming in to let them know, hey, look, we support your desire to fix inflation as a president-elect promised and we have some ideas on how to do that, but raising prices on items like footwear will not do the trick.",

And right now, we had tariffs that were upwards of, you know, 60, 70 percent in place since 1930, and that did not keep domestic production jobs here. And for most of our athletic companies, they started producing overseas at the outset of the launch of their brands many years ago. And so, we are an example -- not every industry, not every product, not every segment of our society or our economy should have robust domestic production. There are needs for it, absolutely. U.S. military needs. There are other applications that are needed here in the U.S. as far as footwear, but if you were to move all that back to try to meet the needs of our consumers, prices would be too high and then we'd be kind of unreachable for the average American. So, that's what we're concerned about and that's why we want to continue to work with the incoming administration to find alternatives, because we can tell you, production is not going to come back here to the U.S. in any big scale or form.",

I mean, I, of course, believe the birds are real, but it doesmake you feel sort of OK about the fact that you think these things. And then, it presents all this evidence. And in this case, it said, think about how many types of birds there are and how hard they would be to replicate with drones. And how would you charge all of those bird drones? And it's kind of a silly example, but these researchers said that this A.I. chatbot debunk bot really was successful at changing people's minds about even more dangerous conspiracy theories, like the false claim that the 2020 election was stolen. And I think you see from that example why this thing really works. And one of the reasons is because it is nonjudgmental. It makes you think. doesn't make you feel like a fool for believing these things. There isn't going to be that ego driven need to win an argument when you're talking to an A.I. chatbot. The other is that these A.I. tools have access to so much more information and evidence than you or I might have offhand if we're having a conversation with somebody who has gone really deep down a rabbit hole of a certain conspiracy theory. And the other thing I thought was really interesting is these researchers said that if people anticipate that they're going to be having conversations with conspiracy believing relatives ahead of the holidays, they can actually use this tool as an argument coach to arm themselves with some of the evidence they might need going into that conversation.",

I think that is the sort of area where they're going to have a hard time maybe commercializing a product like this. But I do think it's really interesting.

Taylor Swift thanking her fans on Instagram after a run of six shows in Toronto with her Eras Tour about to draw to a close in Vancouver. My next guest has penned what he calls an intimate look at the life and music of one of pop's most legendary figures. Leading music journalist Rob Sheffield claims Taylor Swift is on a par with The Beatles and David Bowie. And Rob joins us now. Rob, fantastic to have you with us. I want to talk about the book because it's fantastic, but lots of people love her, very few people have met her. I know you haven't interviewed her, but at least you've interacted. What is she like? ROB SHEFFIELD, AUTHOR, \"HEARTBREAK IS THE NATIONAL ANTHEM\" AND CONTRIBUTING EDITOR AT ROLLING STONE:  Well, she's just as she is in her music as everybody knows. She's very much engaged with people. She always had this really strange ability to listen to people even when she was young. I mean, I think about when I was 16 and how hopelessly self-absorbed most of us are at that age. And she always had that outward drive to connect to people and that really shows in her music for sure.",

But you've talked about the fact that she was giving interviews at 16 and explaining the secret messaging on some of the sort of CD covers that she was doing. And that's something that very much resonates with what The Beatles were doing back in their time too. She's sort of smart and calculated in a good way.",

Of course, I didn't think that she'd go through with it for a minute, but she not only went through with it, but she made each one of those recordings an event in itself, and it's just a tribute to her fanatical vibe.
