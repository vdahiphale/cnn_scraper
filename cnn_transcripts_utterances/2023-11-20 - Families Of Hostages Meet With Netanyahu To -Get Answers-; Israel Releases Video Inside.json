His wife and two young daughters are among the hostages, his entire family, his entire life hostage now for 45 days.I'm going to speak to him in just a few minutes about that meeting, because it comes as President Biden tonight says he does believe a deal to release some hostages is near, a deal that CNN reports could include a 45-day pause fighting for the release of dozens of hostages. But even if there is a deal, Israel faces mounting questions about its focus on the Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza, and strikes there, a hospital that Israel says doubles as a command center for Hamas, Hamas, of course, denies these allegations. So to backup the claims, Israel has been releasing videos and inviting CNN to tour what it claims is an underground tunnel shaft used by Hamas in the Al-Shifa hospital compound. Israel is also releasing CCTV video. You're looking at it here. They say this shows Hamas fighters bringing Nepalese and Thai hostages into the hospital, on the same day of the Hamas terror attack, to bolster their claims that the hospital was used for hostages themselves. Israel has not, though, yet shown evidence of the extensive multi- level, well lit, and an extremely comfortable network, it says that Hamas uses under the hospital, even as a former Israeli prime minister today tells CNN that the bunkers Hamas is now accused of using underneath the hospital were initially built by Israel itself.

So far, Mark, it does not match the actual videos that Israel has, released which look like this one, it's a video of what Israel has put out, you say this is an underground Hamas tunnel shaft at the hospital, deep below ground, the video goes on to show the inside of the tunnel until it reaches a closed door.

And then they built, it wasn't there before, they dug out these tunnels, these special fortifications under the ground, what we showed already.
