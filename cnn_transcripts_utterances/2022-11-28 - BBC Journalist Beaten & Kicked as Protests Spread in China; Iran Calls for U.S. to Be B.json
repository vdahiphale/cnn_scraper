We want to be unsealed.\" Many people there also holding white papers in their hands. That is a sign of solidarity against censorship. They sang and cheered. Lots of cars were driving by honking in support. I spoke to a few protesters, including one, and I asked him how he was feeling. This is what he told me.

But then they went into defensive mode. We took our foot off the gas, and we allowed Wales to build that confidence and start to attack us. Because we were just focused on protecting the lead, instead of extending the lead. So against Iran, similar to how England came out and whooped them, 6- 2, we have to do the same thing.

They're saying that he failed to comply with safety protocols.So as you mentioned, very different takes on what happened. Let's go ahead and read together the statement from Miami-Dade Police as to what they saw happened. They say, \"The flight crew was concerned for a passenger (Mr. Odell Beckham Jr.), as they tried to wake him to fasten his seat belt. He appeared to be coming in and out of consciousness prior to their departure. Upon the officers' arrival, the flight crew asked Mr. Beckham several times to exit the aircraft, which he refused. The aircraft was deplaned at which time Mr. Beckham was asked to exit the plane, and did so without incident.\" We should mention, at this point, no indication of any sort of charges or investigation.
