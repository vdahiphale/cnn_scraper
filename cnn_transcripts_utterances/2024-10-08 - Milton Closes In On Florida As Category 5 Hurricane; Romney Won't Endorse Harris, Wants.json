      "sentences": "Straight from THE SOURCE tonight.A monster storm is closing in on Florida. Hurricane Milton back to a Category 5 now, as we've got the latest track, and we'll take you inside this storm with a Hurricane Hunter. Also, secret calls and special deliveries. What Donald Trump was reportedly sneaking to Vladimir Putin as a pandemic was ravaging the United States, and how many calls they've had since Trump left office. CNN has the new details from Bob Woodward's new book. And Vice President Harris, tonight, initially drawing a blank when she was asked what she would do differently than President Biden. And then, one notable change came to mind. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Florida is about to get battered for the second time in about as many weeks. That much we know for sure, tonight, as forecasters saying that this storm could weaken, but it is expected to double in size. What we don't know for sure, tonight, is exactly where this monster storm is going to make a direct hit. That's why tonight, more than a million people have been ordered to evacuate. Forecasters, Florida's governor, mayors, up and down that state, are pleading with people not to mess around with this one. The storm is now expected to hit as early as tomorrow night, but Floridians are going to start to feel it way before then. And tonight, you're seeing roads and highways jammed. About a fifth of Florida's gas stations are now without gas. In Fort Myers, up to 70 percent of the stations there have run out of fuel altogether. That's before the storm has even hit. So, if you're watching, right now, and you're in an area that has been ordered to evacuate. Officials say that now is the time. That if you try and wait until tomorrow, you may end up trapped with no power for days or longer, or your home or your car swept away by a storm surge. CNN's Isabel Rosales joins me now from Tampa, Florida, which obviously is what we have been talking about, Isabel, that it is expected to be one of the hardest-hit ones. We heard from the Mayor, last night. People are still cleaning up from Helene there. How concerned are they about another bigger storm hitting, this close, behind that one?",

      "sentences": "Yes, it's a major concern and a race against time to evacuate. That window is narrowing, Kaitlan.Listen, this is a one-two punch for the Tampa Bay area. Sure, Helene went forward up until the Big Bend area, up north. And that was a wake-up call for just how devastating that could be with landfall nowhere near this area. Now, with this storm, with Milton, some here in the Tampa Bay area are wondering, is this the storm that they have been dreading for decades that could come right here to the Tampa Bay area? We'll know soon enough, as those tracks continue to shift. And that's normal as we get closer to this thing. But what we have seen is major concern about the figures of storm surge, right? Because with Helene, that was five- to eight-feet of storm surge around the Tampa Bay. Well, with Milton, we're looking at double that, potentially. We're looking at 10 to 15 feet, that it is unsurvivable conditions. This is why people have been so concerned. Let me also show you a hidden danger here. This house that looks totally charred, burned down. Well, neighbors pointed me to this house. They told me that an EV caught fire here, and burned this to a crisp. We confirmed with the Tampa Fire Rescue, who told us, here in Davis Islands, a home did go down, they couldn't confirm the exact address, because of an electric vehicle. So, as people are evacuating, if they're leaving behind electric vehicles, or they're hunkering down, this is a big concern, because salt water and EV batteries do not mix. This can cause very dangerous and sudden battery fires. And we're seeing right here the impact. Somebody lost their home, Kaitlan.",

And like we've discussed, if there's an electric vehicle or any sort of fire hazard in the home, it's really extremely unsafe conditions. And if we're talking 10- to 15-foot storm surge, the entire home would be underwater, there's nowhere safe to go.",

And like you said, those are going to become extremely dangerous, and if we're seeing 100 mile an hour winds.

And what Woodward has in his book is a verbatim phone call, between Trump and Putin at the time, in which they discuss it. So, Putin says to Trump, Please don't tell anybody you sent these to me. Trump: I don't care. Fine. Putin: No, no. I don't want you to tell anybody because people will get mad at you, not me. They don't care about me.

But so far, we haven't been able to find any record of Trump ever doing so, not as President of the United States, not in his previous life as a business mogul. But when we asked his campaign if he simply misspoke, they insisted he did not. Instead, a campaign spokesperson told CNN this. Quote, \"President Trump has been to Gaza previously and has always worked to ensure peace in the Middle East.\" But we asked follow-up questions, including whether there was any proof about Trump's alleged trip, including who he went with, which year and why. A trip like this obviously would have been extraordinary, given it's very difficult for anyone to visit Gaza, much less a president. And of course, Hamas has been in power since 2007. The campaign declined to provide any evidence that Trump has ever been to Gaza. My source tonight is CNN's Chris Wallace, whose new book \"Countdown 1960\" is on the lead up to the 1960 election, and is out now, and is really interesting. And I want to talk about that in a moment. But Chris, on this story, and just the idea that at one point the campaign was saying, to The New York Times, that Gaza was in Israel, which obviously it's not. Then they're just saying, Yes, he was there. But they're not providing any evidence of that. Just, what do you make of that, this entire saga? CHRIS WALLACE, CNN ANCHOR, HOST, \"WHO'S TALKING TO CHRIS WALLACE?\" ON MAX, CNN HOST, \"THE CHRIS WALLACE SHOW,\" AUTHOR, \"COUNTDOWN 1960\": I think it was a good story. Got caught up in it. We've seen other candidates, like Tim Walz get caught up. And suddenly, he was there. And there are two things that I find kind of extraordinary about it. One was the original response from the campaign, which was, Well, he's been in Israel, and Gaza is in Israel, which shows a complete misunderstanding of the fact that Gaza has always been a separate territory. And secondly, the whole premise of the question, which was, Could you turn Gaza, because it's right there in the Mediterranean, into another Monaco, another Monte Carlo? And he says, Oh, yes, it's got everything. I mean, Gaza is one of the most densely populated territories on Earth. The unemployment rate for young people is 70 percent. It's a place wrapped with poverty, wrapped with -- overcrowded, not the fact that it's got Hamas, a terrorist organization controlling it. Other than that, it's a real garden spot.",

But as you're reading through this, and looking at this, it has so many striking parallels to what we're about to experience the next 28 days. Also, it reminded me a lot of 2020, obviously, and the election there. Because essentially, what you're writing is that the 1960 election may very well have been stolen.

Fidel Castro's in the story. But in addition, it struck me that there is tremendous relevance to 2020, and what we're going through right now, because it really turns 2020 on its head. That was an election that really may, I'm not going to say it was, but may have been stolen.
