      "sentences": "Brianna, the search had been centered around a very remote, snow-covered area of Cleveland National Forest, which is outside of San Diego.And according to the Marines now, they have located that helicopter really in the vicinity of that area in Pine Valley, California. But the question now is, what is the fate of the five Marines who were onboard? The Marine Corps has not said yet. They said search-and- rescue operations are still underway to find those Marines. And the condition of the helicopter was also not immediately disclosed here. But the bottom line is that this helicopter apparently was flying from Nevada to California and it was on a training mission when it disappeared late last night. Apparently, the last ping from the helicopter came in around 11:30 p.m. And then the California Fire Department was notified of this around 2:30 a.m. They tried to go out to the scene, to try to figure out where the helicopter had potentially landed, but the conditions -- the weather conditions were simply too bad so they had to call off the search late last night. They resumed that search early this morning. But it now appears that they have been able to locate that helicopter. It's important to note this particular model of helicopter has been involved in about three different incidents over the last decade or so, including one in 2018 where it crashed again in California and killed all four Marines onboard at the time. So right now, we still don't know what the fate of those five Marines are. They are continuing search-and-rescue operations. And the Marine Corps said they will continue to update us as information becomes available.",

Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [13:41:01] DEAN: The NTSB says it's still not clear why four critical bolts were missing from the Boeing 737 Max-9 that lost its door plug midflight. The Alaska Airlines jet was at 16,000 feet when the blowout happened. And now a preliminary report says it appears the bolts that hold the door plug in place were originally installed but then removed.",

      "sentences": "Yes, and this is a bombshell really from the NTSB. Essentially, this investigation has focused on the door plug bolts from the start.There were four bolts, like this one here, that are in the side of the fuselage of the Max-9. They hold the door plug into the airplane. There are two at the top of the door plug and two at the bottom. Both Alaska and United Airlines said they found planes in their fleets with loose bolts. But now the NTSB says Alaska flight 1282 was missing all four bolts. How were they able to tell? Investigators recovered the door from a backyard in Portland and brought it to a lab in D.C. for inspection. The NTSB saw damage patterns that show the door plug move up and out. They also noticed a lack of damage around the bolt holes, meaning that the bolts were not there. Here is the smoking gun from the NTSB report. It says, \"The four bolts that prevent upward movement of the door plug were missing before the door plug moved.\" One more amazing detail here. The NTSB says the plane flew for two months without the door plug bolts. Meaning it was essentially a ticking time bomb with a fuse set last September at Boeing's factory when the plane was still being built. Boeing removed the door plug to do repair work on some nearby rivets. This was the photo taken when the work was completed. And the NTSB says it shows the door was put back but the bolts were not. Here is what NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said on CNN this morning. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
