And that's concerning to some of them for reasons like this. O'SULLIVAN:  Exactly. And, look, I mean, transparency is one thing, but, obviously, in this environment, particularly in the world we live in today, of kind of really charged political violent rhetoric online, I mean, this is a very scary situation. I've seen some of these posts, essentially what you have, and in very dark corners of the internet, again, kind of on forums where, you know, mass shooters, people who have gone on to take part in violent attacks. There are pictures, screenshots of Facebook pages all purporting to belong to members of this grand jury.

That is a day before Super Tuesday when Trump will be competing in more than a dozen presidential primaries. And, remember, for criminal cases, he's got to be in the courtroom.

Will any of them choose to serve their best interests financially and perhaps in the legal system by flipping against Donald Trump? We've not seen any indication that any of these folks have flipped.But let's also remember, in the other case, in the other 2020 election case, the federal case, these six people, including Rudy again, are co-conspirators. They're not charged, but they could find themselves-- all of them have been indicted in the Georgia case, they all could find themselves with a second indictment.

All indications that I'm getting from Donald Trump's team is that he is not going to participate in that debate next week. Of course, with the hedge, which I included in the story, is that this is Donald Trump we're talking about. I've covered him from years, and his team tells me that.There's always a small chance that he may decide in the 11th hour that he ultimately wants to go. Of course, there's logistical questions to whether he would even be able to do that, but most likely, he will not be on that debate stage next week. And instead, Donald Trump himself has been personally throwing out ideas for counter-programming. There have been discussions between Donald Trump's team and Tucker Carlson about an interview around the same time on Wednesday. Of course, this all comes as Donald Trump is feuding openly with Fox News and Rupert Murdoch, and Tucker Carlson clearly has left Fox News. And so some motivations there, I think, behind the scenes. I'm also told that Donald Trump's team wants some of his surrogates to represent him at the debate, especially if he is not there, people like Byron Donalds, a congressman from Florida, as well as Matt Gaetz, another congressman from Florida, and Kari Lake, the gubernatorial candidate in Arizona, all of these people potentially there to represent him in his absence. And one more thing, Poppy, that I find really interesting that I've been picking up in my conversations is that Donald Trump has been telling people this week even that there was a dinner last month where Fox News executives, the president, Jay Wallace, as well as their chief executive, Suzanne Scott, they traveled to Bedminster and encouraged Donald Trump to participate in the debate. And Trump personally is telling people he thinks that shows that Fox is worried about ratings without him. And so he's feeling like he's in a strong position not to attend next week.",

What are we seeing? Are we seeing more of these cases being diagnosed in younger people? And the answer, just like you said, is yes. It's primarily people in their 30s that are driving that increase, and primarily women. Let me just show you per 100,000 back in 2010, had about 100 cases diagnosed in that age group. Go fast forward ten years roughly, and it's closer to 103. So, it's about a 3 percent increase over that ten years. It doesn't sound like a lot, but if you start to extrapolate and fast forward even further into the future, the concern is that those numbers will continue to balloon.

First of all, we do know what the types of cancers are that were sort of driving the increase, breast cancer, for example, thyroid cancer and colon cancer. Those are the three that were sort of driving it. There are some others on the list as well, but those are the primary three.It could be a combination of a couple of things, really. One is that we are better at screening for these cancers than we were even 10, 20 years ago. So, we may be simply catching more cancers. That could be part of it. But talking to oncologists, they don't think that accounts for everything. The other thing is that probably at the age now where people are in their 30s, there is a significant higher percentage of people who are obese than there were 20, 30, 40 years ago. We know when people are taking in lots of glucose, developing lots of insulin as a result, in addition to creating fat in the bodies, that can also fuel cancers. So, that could also be part of it, just the general on health. But those are sort of the top sort of two ideas. Again, it's a subject of debate.

It was about a month ago that we did a report talking about colon cancer rates going up among young people, specifically. Screening can help.Obviously, not talking about people in their 30s, but once you get into your 40s, if you're talking about mammography or colon cancer screening, there are specific recommendations there in terms of when to get those screenings. Mammography really starting at age 45 unless you have a family history, and then 55 years getting it yearly or every other year, and for colon cancer screenings, beginning those screenings again at 45 as well. I think that the larger issue here, though, again, is looking at the general health. If it is true, and it seems to be that the same things that are driving obesity could also be driving cancer rates, fueling the body, fueling these cancers at the same time, we have to address that. There's just a higher percentage of people who are obese now than there were when I was in that age. I'm over 50 now, and I don't think you guys are. But we do find that people over the age of 50, their cancer rates have stayed relatively flat. So, there might be some information in there as well as to what to do in the future.",
