But, ultimately, I think that Quinnipiac poll is correct. Very few people are going to make a decision on who the next president is going to be on a case like this. It's unfortunate, Wolf, that those other two cases have been delayed, because those cases were more meaningful.

Those are the people that know the danger.You know, I'm disappointed in Governor Haley. She knows the danger. She's smarter than what she's doing right now. But there's no backbone in her decision. She's obviously been influenced by these campaign apparatchiks and these campaign consultants that tell her, hey, you better support Donald Trump. You have no future in that party. A wiser Churchillian version of Nikki Haley would have held her ground. She had 20 percent of that party. And she could have spoke to a vision for a new center right party that dropped the hatred, dropped the threat of violence, dropped the threat of persecution, all of the nonsense that Donald Trump represents. And she could have reached out to many non-voters and rebuilt that party. But she's not Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln, of course, left the Whig Party and formed became the first Republican nominee for president in 1860. We don't have that type of leadership right now. But if I were the Biden people, I'd say, hey, this is a binary election. It's democracy first. Are you a patriot first and a partisan last?
