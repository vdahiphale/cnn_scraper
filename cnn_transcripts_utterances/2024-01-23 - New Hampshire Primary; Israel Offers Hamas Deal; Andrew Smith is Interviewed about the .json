I think now that it's down to a two-person race, she's got every reason to stick it out. There will be a lol of, you know, conventional wisdom calls for her to get out if she doesn't exceed expectations. But this is about something bigger, right?

New this morning, for example, under increasing pressure to bring hostages home, we're now learning that Israel is offering what an Israeli official is calling an initiative to Hamas.

And two months is the longest pause in fighting that Israel has put on the table as far as we understand in the course of these negotiations. The last time there was a hostage deal, that was a week-long pause in the fighting. But now Israel is talking about up to two months. The phased release would first see women, 60 plus-year-old men, as well as those needing critical medical care released first before getting to the remainder of the hostages. It would also involve securing the release of the bodies of those 28 Israeli hostages who are believed to be dead and still be held by Hamas. It would involve a movement of Israeli troops during that period, moving out of major population centers inside the Gaza Strip.Now, an Israeli official told us that there is still a lot more to go here, that this is effectively an Israeli initiative to try and build out a framework for negotiations and that many steps still need to be taken. But it is clear that there are some very intense, very serious negotiations at this hour between Israel and Hamas mediated by the Qatari government, the Egyptian government, with the assistance of the United States. A spokesman for the Qatari government saying that there are serious discussions and that they are receiving constant replies from both Hamas, as well as Israel, indicating that these talks are very much back on after a long period of time where there really wasn't much seriousness to these negotiations, much activity, much back and forth in these talks. And it comes, of course, as there is significant pressure here internally on the Israeli prime minister from the families of those hostages, demanding action, demanding another deal. And all of that, of course, is certainly playing into this as the Israeli military continues its ground offensive in Gaza with a major offensive now underway in the southern city of Khan Yunis.

U.S. Border Patrol is awaiting an all clear to cut it down after the U.S. Supreme Court gave the go ahead to remove it in a 5-4 vote. Overnight, the Texas governor vowed, and I'm quoting him now, \"this fight is not over.\"CNN's Rosa Flores is in Eagle Pass, Texas, right near the border. She's joining us live right now. Rosa, when can we expect the removal process to actually begin?",

This is what all of this is about. What will happen to this razor wire.I can tell you that we have not seen a change in posture on behalf of the Texas authorities here. And we have not seen the presence of U.S. Border Patrol in this area either. According to a law enforcement source, U.S. Border Patrol, they are reviewing that order issued by the U.S. Supreme Court, trying to figure out exactly what that means. We're hoping to learn more later today. The U.S. DOJ has not commented as of yet. But this is what's at question. Will it be removed. Those are the questions that we're asking. And we really have to speak about the case that started all of this to give you the background. This legal fight started last year. That's when the state of Texas sued the Biden administration over this. But this case gained more prominence in the last two weeks after the state of Texas decided to take command and control of a public park and miles of the Rio Grande where this razor wire is deployed. That's when the U.S. Department of Justice went to the U.S. Supreme Court asking for the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene, in essence arguing that U.S. Border Patrol cannot enforce federal law given all of this razor wire because they don't have access to the areas where they normally enforce federal law under their jurisdiction. Well now that the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled in favor of the Biden administration, as you said, Wolf, the state of Texas saying that they're not backing down and that they're not changing their posture here. Wolf, back to you.",
