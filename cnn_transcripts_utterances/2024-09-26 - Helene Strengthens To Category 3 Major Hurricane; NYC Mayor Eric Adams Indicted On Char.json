For all the storms that have passed over Tallahassee the last, even 14 months, two of them, this would be the first at crossed with hurricane force strength winds. And that's a real problem.South of here is where it will make landfall about 20 miles. That's where you'll see the dangerous storm surge as much as 20 feet. If it crosses with wind speeds, a hurricane category three, category four of 120 miles per hour winds there, it could pass over Tallahassee with 100, 110 mile per hour winds. And that is just treacherous. The county commissioner told me a short time ago, they expect thousands of trees to come down. They have all kinds of beautiful big trees here, including those huge live oaks, thousands of trees could come down. That's a serious threat to homes, cars, anything on the roads. And of course, power as well, they expect hundreds of road closures, which could mean the Tallahassee suffering for days and days. You see people out walking now, they're looking around like when is it coming? When is it coming? Over the next several hours, that conditions will progressively get worse with those winds picking up, the rain is beginning to fall. A total of ten inches of rain could fall here in Tallahassee, population some 200,000, the public transportation shutdown a 2:00 p.m. so the only way to get around is by walking or by car and they don't want people driving right now. \"The Tallahassee Democrat\" reporting that even Waffle House has shut all its locations in Tallahassee, which is assigned because anyone who's been in a hurricane knows the Waffle House tries to stay they opened no matter what is the last thing to close, the first thing to open unless conditions are really bad, those really bad conditions or what they're expecting here, Jake. And one more thing, I'll add, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and the disaster management from Florida, they run their operations at a Tallahassee because normally Tallahassee is safe place for the hurricanes that hit further south and peninsula, not this time. Tallahassee right in the direct path in could feel it starting around 8:00 tonight, Jake.",

You can see the storm surge already starting to cover parts of that span as Hurricane Helene gets closer to landfall.CNN meteorologist Derek Van Dam is in Apalachicola in the Big Bend. That's where the panhandle meets the peninsula. Derek, as these outer bands move in, this area could see some significant storm surge tonight. DEREK VAN DAM, AMS METEOROLOGIST:  Yeah, and this area is bracing for what could be a generational event as well. The National Weather Service coming out of Tallahassee using very strong wording, talking about this increasing likelihood of catastrophic, if not unsurvivable storm surge of 10 to even upwards of 20 feet right around the Apalachee Bay region, just to my east, where we're standing roughly 10 to 15 foot storm surge is predicted at the height of the storm as major Hurricane Helene moves in. Now, we have an opportunity to speak to one of the sheriff's deputy of Franklin County where we're located which is under a mandatory evacuation. And they talked about how the bridge behind me which connects Apalachicola to the eastern side of this Apalachicola River, this has not closed down just yet, we actually need these sustained tropical storm force winds. And why I mentioned this is because Tallahassee is just to my east and this bridge really connects us that lifeline of Tallahassee. We want to talk about the threats that are posed to this area, not just the storm surge, but it is the potential for catastrophic winds. Right among that immediate the coastline, a major hurricane approaching. We know that this can cause so much damage, especially considering the tree coverage that's in this area and the already saturated environment, just looking at this radar and satellite it is just pushed up so much water in terms of rainfall, just here alone in Apalachicola, we've had over seven inches of rain since yesterday. So, the ground is pretty saturated and the main event hasn't even begun yet. So we anticipate the worst of this system finally move in with that heavy rainfall. So, flash flooding, the threat of tornadoes, the storm surge and catastrophic winds that are all typical with a landfall in hurricane of this magnitude. But I'm going to highlight this because this is so important. This, catastrophic, and they're using words like unprecedented coming out of western North Carolina. This rainfall event that is going to shape up as this storm system slides with a cold front that's moving through the area its going to allow this over spreading of extremely heavy rainfall that has allowed the national weather service issued this high risk of extreme rain that could lead to flash flooding. And they don't take that lightly. That only occurs for 4 percent of those instances, Jake. And that's when we have actually 40 percent of fatalities and 80 percent of damage within those high-risk areas. So we need to watch -- Jake.",

So, hurricane in the northern hemisphere, kind of spins itself counter-clockwise, plus, it's got this forward speed that's going north, right? So with the forwards be coming this way and the winds also coming this way, you get some of the fastest winds, right here on the northeast side of the storm. And you can see that in the colors, how destructive these winds are right offshore here of Tampa. Fort Myers, gusts up to 44 miles per hour right now in Tampa.So as this center continues its trek towards the Big Bend, where you get this cluster of it strongest winds again, sits on the east side. So when you look at the maximum wind threat, if we get this landfall somewhere along the big bend here of Florida, that's going to take the most destructive winds up to Tallahassee, possibly, Albany, Georgia, and then even up towards Atlanta. We've been watching this very closely to see where the strongest winds, if they come straight through Atlanta or if they go just to the east or to the west, something to watch very closely what those wins will do is close widespread power outages.

I don't think it's a slam dunk, but I do think the prosecution is proceeding from a solid foundation of evidence. Now, two things jumped out at me. First of all, it's clear that prosecutors have someone or more than one people cooperating from the inside. There's conversations that are relayed in this indictment that are clearly inside conversations. So they do seem to have key cooperation. And second of all, the text messages are really valuable. You saw some of them in Gloria's piece right there. One that jumped out at me, there's an incident where Adams learns about a foreign businessman who wants to donate to his campaign, but that's illegal. You cannot accept campaign contributions from a foreign national. And so, Adams texts one of his campaign staffers: essentially, find a way to make this happen. We don't want to waste this guy's potential donation. So, to me, it's a pretty incriminating text, so I think the evidence is good, but I wouldn't declare this over and done just yet.",

MAYA WILEY, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, THE LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE ON CIVIL &amp; HUMAN RIGHTS:  Yeah, no, the -- his approval ratings at the end of '23 were the lowest of any mayor since 1996, and I think part of what Elie may be referring to is that certainly he had not lost full support from the Black community. I think at that time, he was still polling at about 48 percent but less than half.

And when we look at those allegations and it's not -- it's both the significant allegations I that I see in terms of Eric Adams being directly engaged in approving or agreeing to the plan that is for unlawful campaign contributions, and then his direct engagement in exactly the kind of thing that his donors wanted from Turkey, for example, in terms of a building, there's another one over -- New York City real estate developer, who's permits were not being approved by the buildings department. And the suggestion and him personally thinking Eric Adams, after an asked for him to get directly involved. In other words, these aren't the kind of things where we don't see a quid pro quo or that we don't see -- these are also season prosecutors in the U.S. attorney's office for the Southern District, who understand what legally they have to demonstrate. And it looks like they may have some very knowledgeable collaborators who are also working and speaking directly to U.S. attorney's office.",

That's because eight inches of rain painful a separate system have already fallen in the last 24 hours and Helene is expected to tip that way over the edge, making it up to 20 inches of rain, which would be historic, but not in a good way.Right now, Hurricane Helene is barreling toward the U.S. with 60 million people across 12 states in the United States bracing for some sort of impact. And joining us now from Atlanta is Georgia Governor Brian Kemp. Governor Kemp, Helene is threatening your entire state. CNN extreme weather center will be monitoring intense winds in the southern part of Georgia, while to the north, officials worry about the mountainous areas already prone to flooding. And of course, there's the Metro Atlanta area, home to millions of people in the path of all of it how worried are you about Helene's impact in Georgia, and what are you most worried about? GOV. BRIAN KEMP (R),GEORGIA:  Well, a couple of things, Jake, is it's a big storm that's really even though its a category three, it's -- it's so wide, it's 400 to 500 miles wide, which is one of the biggest hurricanes ever in the Atlantic. It certainly has this concerned. Most of the state of Georgia is going to be on the, quote, dirty side of the storm, which is going to have hurricane force winds going all the way up to middle Georgia, places like Macon and then still having tropical storm type weapons up in northeast Georgia in places like Athens and up into the mountains. And, of course, you got a lot of rain that's already fallen up. There has fallen right now is going to continue falling when the hurricane comes through. So we're looking up to a foot of rain in some places. So we're worried about flash flooding obviously saturating ground trees falling power outages and the thing is this is going to be happening all over the state. Its not just, you know, in one area of the state like Debbie was just a few weeks ago. It's going to be a statewide event. So we are deploying resources literally statewide as we speak.",

We've got -- Georgia Power has literally 10,000 linemen stationed and ready to go, the AMCs have 8,000.And so, we've done -- you know, we're throwing everything we got this thing because we know its going to be a big event and we know its going to be statewide. But we'll have other available resources. I've had a lot of texts from fellow governors offered assistance from other states and certainly appreciate that. And then the locals are doing a lot as well. So we'll be ready. It's just going to be -- you know, it may take us a few days after this one hits.",

The event in South Georgia is going to happen about dusk or is as the sun's going down, it's going to continue until the sun comes up and then move throughout the night the state of Georgia.So, people are going to happy weather alert really all night in the state of Georgia. As you said, for spin up tornadoes especially on the east side of the storm or the dirty side of the storm, which most of the state will be. The other thing is fallen trees. If you're out driving, there's a potential for having a tree fall on you. We had a fatality in our last norm, unfortunately in a tragic incident with that happening. And then you also have the potential for fallen on houses. So people need to be prepared for that. Move to the center of the house if the winds start getting bad throughout the night, just like you would for a tornado.

But, you know, Georgians know how to deal with this and even when you order evacuations, sometimes people don't leave. So we're expecting people to be weather aware, weather smart and, you know, hunker down, let this thing pass and just asking people to try to stay now off the roads once it does so we can get the roads clear, get power trucks, and get power back on as quickly as we can after the storm. And then also be able to do rescues if we do have injured people you know, swift water rescues if we got a lot of flash flooding and other things. So, we're prepared for all of those.
