The five initial officers all of whom are black were ultimately fired on January 20th after being placed on leave and then indicted last week on second-degree murder and other charges. In a release, the Memphis Fire Department said the two EMTs and a fire lieutenant failed to conduct an adequate patient assessment of Nichols after he was pepper-sprayed. One of the latest police officers to be fired is wearing this body camera. He's identified by Memphis Police as officer Preston Hemphill. Hemphill, who is white, can be seeing firing his taser at Nichols, following the initial traffic stop January 7.

It's the fourth time this month that the zoo's animals and enclosures may have been tampered with. Earlier this month, a Clouded Leopard escaped after the fence was intentionally cut. She was found unharmed hours later. The zoo also found an intentional cut in the Langur Monkey habitat, and last week an endangered vulture was found dead under suspicious circumstances. The zoo has added more cameras, security patrols, and overnight staff. Also offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of anyone responsible for those incidents. Wow.",
