      "sentences": "All right. Just minutes from now, Former President Jimmy Carter will begin his final journey to Washington and Georgia mourners have paid their respects filing past his casket at the Presidential Library for Jimmy Carter in Atlanta.At the top of the hour, the departure ceremony gets underway at the Carter Center. His family will accompany the 39th president to Washington where he will lie in state at the Capitol Rotunda before his national funeral service on Thursday. Let's take a closer look at Jimmy Carter's life and legacy. Presidential historian Tim Naftali joins us now along with Kate Andersen Brower. She's a journalist and the author of several books including \"Team of Five: The President's Club and the Age of Trump\" and \"The Residents: Inside the Private World of the White House.\" Thank you both for joining us. Kate, you had the opportunity to interview both the former president and the former first lady in their home. That must have been a treat. What was that like? KATE ANDERSEN BROWER, AUTHOR, \"THE RESIDENCE\":  Well, you know, it was incredible. I went down to Plains in 2018 and interviewed them. I got to go listen to one of his Sunday sermons, his Sunday school services. And they were -- I was struck how absolutely normal they were. I mean, they -- a lot of people have said it, but it's absolutely true, they lived in this very, you know, relatively modest home, a ranch house that they had built together in the '60s. And, you know, I sat with them in their living room. They sat next to each other on the sofa and offered me water that they gave me themselves. And I think I was just struck by how close they were in that moment. You know, they would turn to each other. President Carter would ask Mrs. Carter, Rosalynn, what she thought when I asked a question. I think he was really interested in me talking to her because I had written about first ladies before. And he felt like she hadn't been given enough credit for all the work she did on mental health. And so, they kind of propped each other up during the interview.",

He didn't -- you know, he lost to Ronald Reagan. He didn't cry sour grapes and so on. He built this tremendous life where he built homes for people and so on. I think that is just going to be a massive part of his legacy.",

      "sentences": "It will be. But one thing is that today and on Thursday, we're going to be reminded about the various phases of his national and public service. His public service began before he ran for office in Georgia. It began when he joined the Navy as a midshipman. And his public service, of course, continued after he left the White House. His complex full life will be on display to be understood and to be celebrated this week.And so, we will be talking about his post-presidency. Indeed, President Carter wanted people to talk about his post-presidency, but we will also be returning to the time before he came to the White House. And we will see as we discuss this and think about it over the next few days, the richness of this man's life and what he did for this country.",

You know, there used to be thousands of cases. Now, there are less than two dozen. And this is a horrific disease.And so, their work with the Carter Center was the single most important thing. But as Tim said, you know, Jimmy Carter's was asked, you know, he said, if I had to choose four more years in the White House and the Carter Center, I would choose the Carter Center, but it could have been both. You know, he resented being a one term president. He thought he had much more work to do. And of course, Ronald Reagan came in and undid a lot of the work the Carters had done in the White House.",

And for that reason, to be complete and full as a historian, as someone looking back on a presidency, one needs to keep in mind the peaks and the valleys. So, yes, there was inflation, though not really of President Carter's creation. Yes, there was the failure of the hostage rescue mission. But there was also courage in deciding to go ahead with it.

British, French, German, and Norwegian leaders are all speaking out against his political influence. This is also raising concerns about the world's richest person's potential impact on U.S. foreign policy, given his relationship with the president-elect.CNN Chief Media Analyst Brian Stelter joins us now. Brian, we've come a long way from those days when Elon Musk, you know, took over Twitter and said, I'm going to make this a free speech marketplace. We're going to be completely neutral and so on. That's just completely out the window. But let's talk about some of these headlines we've been seeing where you have foreign leaders raising questions about the influence that he has.",

Some of these stories actually go back about 20 years. Musk has been bringing them up on X over and over again. In some cases, acting as if he's just discovered some of these stories. They are horrible stories.But oftentimes it seems like Musk is coming in like a brand-new college freshman, brand-new to a subject, as if he's found out about it for the first time. And because his voice is so loud on X, he causes a lot of reactions. That's what these European leaders are reacting to. Musk also is announcing algorithm changes to X. He wants more positive content and less negative content, even as he posts about gangs and about rape and other very negative subjects. It is notable that just as Trump is about to take office, Musk says he wants more positivity, Jim, and less negativity. Isn't that interesting timing?",

Elon Musk is -- this is the user saying, Elon Musk is rapidly becoming the largest spreader of disinformation in human history, hijacking political debates in the process. The U.S. -- E.U. I should say must take action. And Musk responds, F-U. And then, in our word, which -- I mean, I guess you could look through the way we've pixelated that.

It gets to this broader sense that when people like Zucker -- Elon Musk or Mark Zuckerberg talk about free speech, everybody wants free speech, but it oftentimes seems that these tech CEOs actually are favoring or preferring a certain kind of speech, right? They're favoring their own speech or their own political preferences and not the actual entire user or the community's speech.You know, the changes announced by Meta today are very much a MAGA makeover, a pro-Trump makeover, and that's going to win Meta some conservative users, but it may repel some liberals. That's the same thing we've seen happen on Elon Musk's X. He's turned into more of a right-wing platform where he's pro free speech when it's really pro- Musk or pro-Trump speech.",

I think a lot of this started after George Floyd and then accelerated, you know, maybe over the course of the Biden administration, but the administration has changed now.Companies don't like being in the spotlight under criticism. You know, they know what happened with Bud Light, the big, you know, controversy that happened there with Bud Light sponsored, a transgender influencer, and that blew up led to a huge boycott of Bud Light products.
