And we begin this hour in Doha, Qatar, where the latest round of Gaza ceasefire and hostage release negotiations will get underway in the coming hours.Diplomatic source tells CNN, Hamas will not be participating in the talks, but is willing to meet with mediators afterwards, if there are developments or a serious response from Israel. Negotiators are hoping to close any remaining gaps on a proposal to end the fighting and return all the hostages held in Gaza. And progress on the talks could potentially prevent Iran from attacking Israel. CNN's Jeremy Diamond has details. JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, the expectations are not particularly high for a deal to be reached during these negotiations on Thursday in Doha, Qatar. But there is certainly the potential for progress to be made, and with that comes the potential to lower the temperature in this very volatile region. That also, of course, means that there is the potential for a lack of progress. A lack of progress that could hasten that Iranian response that we've been waiting for over the course of the last two weeks. But this is the first time in several weeks now that you will see all the key players in Doha. And that is to say, the Mossad director, David Barnea, leading the Israeli delegation, sitting down with the head of the CIA, the Qatari prime minister, as well as the head of Egyptian intelligence. Hamas, for its part, says that it will not participate in these discussions, but there's a key caveat there, because they do say that they are willing to listen and to hear out the mediators after those negotiations happen. And frankly, that's different rhetoric, but it's not all that different from the way these negotiations have happened at key moments. They have been -- Hamas and Israel have never actually sat down together in the same room. It's the Egyptian and Qatari mediators who, after meeting with the Israeli officials, then go and pass along a message to Hamas. So, it appears that we may see something quite similar unfold after that initial meeting between the Israeli delegation and the other heads of intelligence. Now, the real question is, how much progress can actually be made here? The Israeli prime minister, as we understand it, has given an expanded mandate to his delegation, but my sources tell me that they are still uncertain that, that is going to be enough to bridge the gap with Hamas. What is clear, though, if progress can be made, there is real potential for lowering the temperature in this very volatile region. The U.S. special envoy Amos Hochstein, who is in Beirut on Wednesday, he made very clear that he sees an opportunity, not only to reach a cease fire in Gaza, but also saying that he believes that would then present a window of opportunity for a diplomatic solution between Israel and Hezbollah.

The Ukrainians say they want to create a buffer zone in this part of Russia to stop Moscow's army from attacking Ukrainian territory in the future. But the blitz offensive is also a major morale boost for Ukraine, commander fighting inside Russia tells CNN, catching the Russians off guard. They were shocked by such a rapid advance, he says. They were in tactical encounters and willingly surrender to the defense forces. And then, every warrior, every soldier who defend their homeland probably had a dream of stepping onto Russian soil and destroying the enemy there. These feelings are impossible to forget. While the Russians claim they are stopping Ukraine's assault, releasing this video of their jets dropping powerful glide bombs, Ukraine says it shot down a Russian warplane and a security source says it launched the biggest drone attack on Russian air bases since the war began.

We're starting to see more and more cases in the traditional age group, of children under the age of 15, who usually get it from contact with animals, seeing a lot more of those cases, potentially a lot more person to person transmission in households, as a result. And then, also we are starting to see this other kind of transmission, which is transmission by sexual routes. So, we're seeing it in in various communities, sexual and gender minorities. We're also seeing it in people who are sex workers. So, as a result, we're seeing this spread through sexual networks, potentially very, very extensive sexual networks, and starting to see those cases also spreading and community spread through the traditional way outside of the Democratic Republic of Congo's borders.

You know, I think what we were able to do at that point was to be able to deploy very important public health measures, including vaccines and therapeutics, to be able to get in front of it, and to have very strong messaging from all areas. And that was very, very effective to be able to stop the spread and really reduce the impact.You know, countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo and the other countries that are associated with this outbreak right now are low resource settings.

He also went after her running mate. Those attacks coming before Harris is set to roll out her own economic proposal later this week.CNN's Kristen Holmes was there for the speech and has more from Asheville. KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Former President Donald Trump set out to give a policy speech on the economy and for all intents and purposes, he did. It was certainly more off -message than what we had seen in the excerpts from the remarks, but he did talk a lot about the economy. And just before we get into what exactly he said, the note here is the reason that his team has been pushing this idea to Donald Trump, that he needs to focus on the economy. He needs to focus on immigration. He needs to focus on crime, is that if you look at the polling between Donald Trump and President Joe Biden, he out-polled Joe Biden on those three topics. Voters believed he did a better job on those three things. And the plan is for Donald Trump to link Kamala Harris to those same policies of President Joe Biden's, to say that they are the same administration. She is obviously the vice president. So any unpopular policies that Joe Biden had should also be that of Kamala Harris. Now, obviously, as we have seen, Donald Trump has had rather hard time staying on message or even defining his attacks against Kamala Harris, but he did seem to have some new lines this time around, essentially doing just that, linking Kamala Harris to Joe Biden and those same policies, particularly on the economy. Take a listen.

Why hasn't she done it? Kamala Harris won't end the economic crisis, she will only make it worse. And why hasn't she done it? She talks about it. She is doing a plan.

In her resignation letter, Shafik said it had become difficult to overcome divergent views, adding that the turmoil has taken a toll on her family and she has been distressed by threats and abuse. Back in April when talks between protesters and the university broke down, students and others, not associated with Columbia stormed a campus building. Shafik called in police who carried out arrests and made sure the encampments were not re-established. Some faculty members drafted a censure motions saying Shafik had violated students' rights to peacefully protest.
