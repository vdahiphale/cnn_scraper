It happened in Brovary, a suburb of Kyiv. Ukrainian officials now say at least 14 people are dead and more than 2 dozen are injured. This crash killed all nine people aboard the helicopter, including the interior minister, his first deputy and the ministry's secretary of state. One child is amongst those killed on the ground. This crash is the latest tragedy during Russia's nearly 11-month old war on Ukraine. Officials stress it is too early to determine a cause. CNN's chief international correspondent, Clarissa Ward, is there on the site. Clare Sebastian is in London. Clarissa, let's start with you. What more are we learning about this?",

Obviously, they are exploring every possible avenue. But we've been here for most of the day, talking to people who live around here. There was an extremely thick fog this morning. One man said he was out on his balcony, smoking, when the crash happened. He could hear it but couldn't see it right away because the fog was so thick. That's one theory, at least, that is being put forward as to how exactly this happened. But no matter what, it is an incredible tragedy. The kindergarten, you probably can't see now because it's so dark. But just behind me, literally the helicopter clipped the edge of the kindergarten and crashed directly behind it in the playground. So among the dead, we know, as you mentioned, at least one of them is a child. The others are believed to be people bringing their kids to school or locals who were around the area. So just a tragic day for a country that has already, as you know, Becky, experienced so much horror, so much pain. And it will be quite some time, probably, before we get any meaningful answers or the results of any investigation as to how this tragedy happened.",

There is also a grim realization that this is going to be a very tough winter. The fighting in Bakhmut and Soledar and Donbas area is incredibly tough, very brutal and protracted. It's almost like a grinding, endless stalemate. The situation across the country, whether it's Dnipro or other sort of more common attacks we're seeing on critical infrastructure, rolling blackouts, all of it sort of comes together to make for a very challenging and difficult time in this war for the Ukrainian people. But underneath that, there is this sort of strain of resilience and a steadfast commitment to seeing this through to the end. Now you're not going to see the  leadership take its foot off the gas, though, when it comes to making really maximalist demands for the type of weaponry, the type of hardware, the type of ammunition ad technology that they believe they need. So there will be just a continued drumbeat from the presidency, from the political leadership, trying to get those tanks, not just the German Leopard tanks, which Poland has agreed to supply, the Challenger 2s that the U.K. has agreed to supply and other countries who've also said they will put forward tanks and infantry fighting vehicles. Along with the weaponry and the air defense systems, because, again, this is the primary mechanism that Russia is able to inflict constant pain on Ukraine and its people, is through missiles and drones that can either evade air detection or make their lives incredibly difficult -- Becky.",

He even put up billboards in Israel during election cycles, showing him shaking hands with Vladimir Putin. Now when he's been asked about this, Benjamin Netanyahu has been a bit cagey, saying they will review the position once he comes into power.

That is why you can see that, right now, the situation in Lima, according to the people we have on the ground who have been speaking to us, especially colleagues from CNN Espanol, today, Lima is calm because the protesters from outside Lima, from the provinces, from the Andean regions, the mountains, are still making their way. Sometimes we are talking about day-long trips to try to get to the city of Lima and to reach the palace of powers and have their voices heard. What we're seeing today and what we're probably going to see even more tomorrow, the day we are going to see thousands of people likely onto the streets of Lima to protest. It's just the latest chapter of a political crisis that has gone on since at least 2016. Dina Boluarte is the sixth head of state in less than five years in Peru. If you speak with the people in the provinces, if you speak with the people who have been taking to the streets and have been manifesting, sometimes, in some cases, even violently, they say the system the, democratic system that has ruled Peru over the last 20 years, it's not delivering for them. So what we're seeing now is an example of a democracy that failed to deliver for the majority of the people. And it's in deep crisis, because, even if she were to resign tomorrow -- and she said time and again that she would not resign, she intends to fulfill her mandates and bring the country to elections next year. But even if she were to go tomorrow or the day after, the crisis is likely to stay, because the root causes -- I'm talking of inequality, poverty, access to food, medication -- they have not been addressed so far.
