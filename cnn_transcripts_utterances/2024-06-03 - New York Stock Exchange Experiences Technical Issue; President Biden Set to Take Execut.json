Hunter Biden has pleaded not guilty to three felony charges, accused of illegally purchasing and possessing a firearm while abusing or being addicted to drugs. If convicted on all three counts, the president's son could face up to 25 years in prison, though he doesn't have a prior criminal record and first-time offenders often get much lower sentences. The president and first lady both offering their support to Hunter today. Jill Biden is attending the trial's first day, and President Biden issued a statement this morning. It said in part: \"I am the president, but I am also a dad. Jill and I love our son and we are so proud of the man he is today. Hunter's resilience in the face of adversity and the strength that he has brought to his recovery are inspiring to us.\" Biden went on to say that since he's the president, he -- quote -- \"won't comment on pending federal cases\" -- Jessica.",

Hunter Biden had entered into a plea deal with the special counsel in this case.It would have been knocked down to misdemeanors. He would have never been in jeopardy of serving any jail time. And the judge, unusually, I think, rejected that plea deal and threw it out. And the reason it was sort of unusual is because usually -- usually, plea deals are accepted, first of all. Most cases in America plead. Most federal cases plead out. It's rare even for cases to go to trial. And when a judge does throw it out, usually, they do it because it's a circumstance when it is advantageous to the defendant. So, in other words, they think that the prosecutors are getting the better end of the deal. And this was the opposite of that.",

So it's really -- it's only a three-count indictment. And the fact that he had a weapon doesn't seem to be a disputed fact. So the questions here are really going to pertain to, did he know that he wasn't supposed to have it at the time?

So I think the fact that there was a special counsel obviously is a unique situation particular to an individual who has political relevance and the fact that this wasn't just a standard case handled by the U.S. attorney's office. And I do -- as I mentioned earlier, I think the fact that the judge threw out the plea agreement was unusual in this case.",

Now, Dr. Fauci has argued they were in a pandemic. They were in the midst of chaos. They were trying to understand and protect people in the American public the best that they could, while making sure that the -- that the vaccine was prepared and ready to go within a year's time. But that didn't not stop some Republicans for just attacking Dr. Fauci on every single thing that he had done. Here's one of those. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE (R-GA):  Is it right for scientists and doctors getting paid by the American people, government taxpayer paychecks, to get patents, where they're paid millions and hundreds of millions of dollars in royalty fees, especially when the NIH and these government agencies, most powerful agencies in our country, are recommending medical suggestions and advice and making up guidelines like six-feet distancing and masking of children? Do you think that's appropriate? Do the American people deserve to be abused like that, Mr. Fauci, because you're not doctor. You're Mr. Fauci in my few minutes. No, I don't need your answer. I want to talk about this right here. (END VIDEO CLIP) FOX:  And Democrats continued -- during this course of this hearing are arguing that Dr. Fauci was doing the best that he could, that he was instrumental in making sure that Americans were protected during the coronavirus pandemic and arguing that he's shown a lot of patience over the course of this testimony today and behind-closed-door testimony that he gave back in January as part of this committee's investigation -- Jessica.",

Ultimately, dozens of stocks were halted. And some of them had bizarre stock prices that really didn't make any sense, most notably, Berkshire Hathaway. That's the big holding company run by legendary investor Warren Buffett. Now, as of 9:44 here in New York, everything looked normal, right? This stock, Class A shares were trading above $600,000. That's where they actually normally trade. And then, suddenly, with no explanation, this stock was listed at just $185. And there were no trades in between to indicate why that stock had gone down. There was no news released. So, clearly, something was wrong here because that would amount to a 99 percent drop. Now, as you can see on your screen, this stock has reopened. It's trading back to where it should be above $600,000 a piece. And the New York Stock Exchange says that all of the impacted stocks have reopened. All systems are operating normally. Now, as far as what caused it, this appears to be related to something called limit up, limit down. This is basically a time-out or a cooling-off safeguard in the stock market where, when a stock trades too high or too low, there's a pause instituted. Now, New York Stock Exchange says that what happened was there was a glitch, a technical issue with the data that is published industry-wide and that impacts limit up, limit down. But I talked to market structure expert Joe Saluzzi, and he told me he's not buying that explanation because it doesn't really square with the trades that we saw that took place. Now, one thing though, Brianna, we don't think this is related to is cyber. A major bank executive that's been in touch with the New York Stock Exchange's parent company told our colleague,Sean Lyngaas that the New York Stock Exchange has not seen any indication at this point that this was related to a security incident.",
