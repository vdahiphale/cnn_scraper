US Democrats score a huge victory in Georgia in the most expensive US Senate race of the year. And MSC Cruises prepares to launch a brand new ship that is as Wall Street warns the industry is in uncharted territory. I will speak to the Executive Chairman. Live from New York, it is Wednesday, December 7th. I`m Rahel Solomon, in today for Richard Quest and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. Good evening. Tonight, China makes its most significant retreat yet from its Zero-COVID Policy. The central government easing several restrictions, and now allowing people with mild COVID cases to quarantine at home. People will also no longer have to show proof of negative test results before entering most public places and travel restrictions are being eased as well. All of this coming after unprecedented protests over the Zero-COVID Policy, which has wreaked havoc on China`s economy. Still though, experts warn COVID could damage China even after the policy is lifted. CNN`s Ivan Watson has the details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): China is the last country in the world still trying to completely eradicate COVID, but after months of harsh restrictions, some of the COVID lockdown barriers in China are starting to come down. This move by authorities comes just days after protests erupted across the country against Beijing`s Zero-COVID Policy. This breath of fresh air for some exhausted citizens carries a harsh reality. Experts predict a tough COVID winter is likely coming.",

WATSON (voice over): The highly contagious omicron variant is already spreading through the Chinese population. DR. LEANA WEN, CNN MEDICAL ANALYST: Unlike the rest of the world, very, very few people in China proportionally have had COVID and that is because of the strict lockdowns that the Chinese government has implemented, and so there is very low baseline immunity. The other issue is that China has been using its domestically produced vaccines, which are less effective than the mRNA vaccines. WATSON (voice over): China has one of the world`s highest COVID vaccination rates, but vaccination for the elderly in China lags far behind. Twenty- three percent of Chinese citizens over 80 are completely unvaccinated, that leaves roughly 8.4 million very vulnerable unvaccinated people.",

WATSON (on camera): At the peak of the outbreak, Hong Kong suffered more than 7,000 deaths in six weeks, most of them elderly. At the time, it was the highest COVID mortality rate in the world driven largely, experts say, by very low vaccination rates among people over 60. Per capita, Mainland China has almost half the number of critical care beds in hospital compared to Hong Kong.",

So those issues can still hamper growth in China, but assuming that there are no big new surprises that come up in 2023, I would say that with this loosening of policies, we should start to see, you know, momentum pick up in the spring. Certainly, the winter can still be challenging given that there might be a lot of illnesses that will force reintroduction of lockdowns, we don`t know. But we do know that the variants are a lot less lethal now, and therefore, I think that China will slowly approach normality. And given that there`s so much suppressed demand, that, you know, people want to socialize, to travel, to do all of these things, that it might be quite explosive come the spring. And so this could certainly lift China`s GDP, since China is largely focusing on increasing its internal consumption. And so with all of that, you know, suppressed demand coming onto the market, that could really drive a lot of growth in China, which can pull in imports from other neighboring countries, like in Southeast Asia and lift the economies in those places as well.",

Given that, you know, their tariffs that the US has imposed for anything coming fromChina, Europe has also joined the US in some of their tariffs and sanctions, and so it`s made doing business in China much more difficult. But many companies, despite these challenges have decided not to leave China for good because they cannot find a replacement elsewhere in the world. China has incredibly good infrastructure that they have built up over the decades, that is really unparalleled and given that they have a very large population that is also well-educated. They can work on a lot of different areas of the supply chain that are difficult to match in other parts of the world. So when countries tried to relocate it to places like Vietnam, like they just couldn`t find enough workers, they didn`t have the same supply chains available, the infrastructure wasn`t there. So when they faced these issues, then despite the fact that they may not like some of China`s policies, they don`t really have alternatives to turn to. Now, this may start to change with the US trying to, you know, build more of a presence in the US by, you know, having TSMC build its semiconductor plants in Arizona, and maybe slowly, the US will try to replicate what has happened in China, but this will take many years.

So on the one hand, China`s reopening, well that should ease supply chain pressures and that could help bring down inflation, which has already fallen for four straight months in the US. However, several major bank CEOs have also warned this week about the impact of a recession and continued uncertainty about the Fed, well, that has also hurt investor confidence.

I think it`s a laundry list of issues, but whether you`re an analyst or a trader, a lot of thiswobbliness, if you will, is centering on the upcoming Fed meeting next week with the Chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, when he will give his not only an indication as to where interest rates will go, will they raise three-quarters of a percent or 50 basis points. But I think there`s also a lot of trepidation, if you will, within the markets about what he will see the future as. In the past, in some very public forums, the Fed Chair has said that he thinks inflation will stick around for a while. I think, there is a lot of questions since his previous speaking engagements, will those same reservations be there? Will they perhaps be even stronger? And what type of data will he point to? So that`s a big thing on investors` minds. We also have this issue of data that is going to be released. We`re going to have some inflation data this week, as well as next week, most notably the Consumer Price Index, that will give us an indication about inflation, where things stand. We have seen some subtle signs that maybe we have seen a peak, but as we know, that data, we just need to look at it to have a better idea of where things are going are the essentials like food and fuel. Are they still elevated? Or is there perhaps some visible relief? So those are the big drivers right now, Rahel, and you know, you mentioned real briefly about China. I think that there were high hopes, but as you know, investors like certainty, they like concrete plans and maybe that`s why markets haven`t moved in such a favorable direction, at least overseas in Asia.",

This Georgia Senate race was the most expensive race of the 2022 Midterm season, and that is because as you saw, there was so much at stake here. So back to your question, Rahel. What does this mean for Senate Democrats and Democrats in general? It`s a significant victory because it will impact President Biden`s agenda. We`re talking about a 51 to 49 majority. It doesn`t sound like very much. But look, as it stands now, the Senate is evenly split, 50/50. That means that there is an evenly split -- that`s kind of a tongue twister for me -- evenly split power sharing agreement between the Democrats and the Republicans in the Committees. Now that the Democrats have the majority, that means the Committees will also have a Democratic majority, which means that the Democrats will be able to process legislation. They will be able to process judicial nominees as well much faster without having these procedural hurdles of the confirmation processes being slowed down by let`s say, a Republican vote. So, it`s quite significant. And now, a lot of people looking at Georgia as a Purple State on the heels of President Biden`s win in 2020, the first time that a Democratic presidential candidate won Georgia in almost 30 years.

Pierfrancesco Vago is the executive chairman MSC Cruises and he joins me from the MSC Seascape. Wonderful to have you. Walk me through some more of these attributes. I think I saw something about a roller coaster mentioned. I`m not sure if I have the stomach for it but walk me through some of the other features.",

Passengers appreciative it very. Much and especially in this economic, particular, peculiar moment where there is a lot of inflation, speculation, prices are increasing. Cruising, this platform holidays is still giving the best value for money there is. So there is a democratization over luxury where you have a five- star experience. But with the buying power capability that this cruise line has, we were very competitive to the consumer to actually have a five star holiday.",

And obviously there`s also the value proposition. Now we stand in the fact that this hardware is incredible. So not only environmental but especially for the offering that this platform offers to the final consumer. So the mix of everything obviously is driving tourism.

So the booking curves are coming much earlier in time. And now, we hear that somehow Asia will come back again.

The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has expressed concern that 5G technology could interfere with aircraft equipment; in particular, radio altimeters. Brian Fung is in Washington.

Moments ago, vice president Dina Boluarte e was sworn in as president. That`s after her predecessor Pedro Castillo was reportedly arrested. Castillo attempted to dissolve congress before it voted to impeach him. And they`re just moments left to trade on Wall Street, we will have the final numbers in the closing bell right after this.
