These images coming into CNN just moments ago. A handful of mourners were allowed into the cemetery to pay their respects at Alexei Navalny's gravesite. We'll bring the very latest from Moscow. Donald Trump arrives in Florida for a hearing on the timing of his classified documents case. New video from the chaos that ensued when Israeli forces opened fire in northern Gaza on Thursday. And my conversation with Palestinian photojournalist Motaz Azaiza, why he made the painful decision to leave Gaza. Extraordinary scenes in Moscow. Thousands of mourners gathered amid a heavy police presence to say goodbye to the late Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny. Following an open casket funeral, the late opposition leader was laid to rest around two hours ago. It is exactly two weeks after his death at an Arctic penal colony. His team says his coffin was lowered into the ground to Frank Sinatra song \"My Way.\" Some mourners have been allowed into the cemetery two pay their respects, but we are also hearing reports of at least one arrest at the funeral, according to monitoring group OVD-Info. CNN's Matthew Chance is in Moscow following today's service. He filed this report earlier as Alexei Navalny was being buried. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And I think the question that I had that I actually asked Navalny's team before he got on that plane and return to Moscow was, is Russia ready for a Nelson Mandela? Is this the moment when Russia needs a Nelson Mandela. And this is a critical moment now, Becky, I think where Russia will have to decide that. What will the future of the Russian opposition look like? It's clear that due to these sort of draconian crackdowns that this is a very challenging moment, but I also think that there's real hope that through his death and through his example, and through his legacy, that this might serve as kind of inspiration or sucker for the opposition movement. And while there's a broader realization that this isn't going to happen overnight, and that change may take a long time, and we heard from Navalny's team today putting out a message saying this is just the beginning of our struggle. This is the beginning of tougher times, but perhaps through his death, Navalny will be able to achieve something that tragically he was not able to achieve in life. I think that is the question, and we don't yet really have the answer.",

Thank you.Well, while the war rages on in Gaza, the European Union says it will proceed with a $54 million payment to the embattled U.N. agency responsible for providing aid to the enclave. UNRWA you'll recall is reeling from allegations that some of its staff members were involved in Hamas' October 7th attack in Israel. The E.U. says it will continue to fund the agency while an independent review of its staff is carried out. The U.S. and at least 13 of its allies pulled funding away from the agency last month. Right now Donald Trump is in court in Florida for a crucial hearing on the start date of the classified documents trial. That is one of four criminal cases facing the former U.S. president. And when it starts will impact the court calendar for the others. On Thursday, Special Counsel Jack Smith asked for the classified documents trial to start in early July. Trump's lawyers proposed an August start. Gene Rossi is a former federal prosecutor and a former assistant U.S. attorney, and joins me now from Washington. So who is likely to get a result in this? GENE ROSSI, FORMER U.S. FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: Well, Becky, I think if you had to bet money in Vegas, the only trial that's going to go this year is probably the Stormy Daniels hush money trial that begins on March 25th of this year. I think the January 6th Jack Smith case, that's going to be pushed to the end of the year. I think this document case, it may be set in July or August, but I think that'll be pushed. And the kerfuffle, the mess that's down in Georgia that may be pushed to next year. And here's why I say this, Becky, when the Supreme Court agreed to hear the absolute immunity arguments and have oral arguments April 20th or 22nd, that was a fait accompli that the court will not rule on this issue probably until the end of June. If that happens, all those trials that have been waiting for that issue to be resolved, the J6 case and the documents case, they'll be pushed back.

And you could see that in the days running up to this vote when you had the supreme leader come out urging people to vote. Also, the government urging people to vote, and really quite frankly, if you go around the city then pretty much on every corner, you'll see a lot of posters urging people to come out saying your vote builds Iran as they put it. So they say that this election is extremely important for the future of Iran to keep building this country. But of course you're also absolutely right to point out the fact that right now there are a lot of people who have lost a lot of trust in their politicians and certainly have done so since those massive protests took place in the fall of 2022. The economy of this country continues to be in a very difficult situation. And that's really manifold. On the one hand, the buying power of people has decreased significantly with inflation being extremely high. Of course, the sanctions against Iran playing a big role in that as well. But there are also a lot of people who feel that the politicians who have been in parliament so far have not tackled those issues adequately. And one of the reasons why some people appear somewhat disillusioned with the political process here in this country is, of course, the fact that so many candidates in the run-up to this election have been disqualified. That certainly is something that didn't sit well with many moderates. At the same time, though, the conservatives in the country and the government of this country are saying that more candidates than ever are actually on the ballot to run for the 290 seats. But when you're speaking about possible change happening and things, for instance, changing in the economy, many people are somewhat distrustful of that because they say, look, they believe the conservatives probably are going to ferment their hold on power here in this country. And it's very difficult for people to see that anything significantly is going to change in the policies that we've seen in Iran in the past four years -- Becky.",

They want things to continue the way that they are and they're going to come out and vote. But if you speak to more moderate people, and quite frankly a lot of people that we met on the streets here in Tehran, there are a lot of people who say that they don't trust the politicians who have been in parliament so far, who say that they are losing trust in the political process here in this country and in the electoral process as well. There's a lot of people who told us upfront that they are not going to come out and vote in the election today. Now, on the other hand, you have had the government who came out a couple of minutes ago and said they are extending the voting hours tonight. We spoke last hour and said the polls were about to close. They've now extended the voting by two hours, saying that there are so many people who do want to come and cast their ballot. Of course, it's unclear where that exactly is the case and what polling stations in the country that is the case. At the same time as far as the mood is concerned, it is certainly one that is very difficult. A lot of people talk about a very difficult economic situation, had very little in the way of hope that the economy of this country could get better in the near future -- Becky.",

And while thisisn't the first time the enclave has been targeted by Israeli forces it didn't always look like an inhabitable moonscape. These photos were taken in the days leading up to October 7th by someone who wanted to capture the beauty of Gaza. But overnight he found himself documenting carnage and destruction instead. If you've followed this war closely, you'd have heard of the name Motaz Azaiza, a 25-year-old Palestinian photographer who risked his life to give millions of people a raw and unfiltered look at the horrors of the war. After more than 100 days of tireless and distressing work, Motaz and his family were evacuated to Qatar. Well, he recently gave me an extensive interview where he talked about the toll the war has taken on him and what he intends to do next. And a warning to viewers, some of the images you are about to see, the ones Motaz has captured in Gaza, are graphic and you may find them disturbing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
