Straight down the main drag on the other side of the river. And they're firing into the town very regularly, direct fire with -- there you go. There's two detonations. Direct fire with either tanks or sometimes indirect fire with mortars. A lot of multiple rocket-launching systems. Last night, two people, according to the local authorities, were killed in -- on the outskirts of the city. That has become all too routine.

Those that remain behind really only turn up in this central area seeking help.

The White House's stance has been they're not going to negotiate over the debt ceiling, per se.

So about ten days ago, we saw them do their own search of the Wilmington home and then it was very much expected, which is why we had cameras there, right -- we've been waiting for this -- that this home would also be searched.
