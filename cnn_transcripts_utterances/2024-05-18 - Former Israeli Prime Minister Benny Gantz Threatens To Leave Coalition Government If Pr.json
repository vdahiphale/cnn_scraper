Israeli war cabinet member and former Prime Minister Benny Gantz a short time ago delivering an ultimatum to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, telling him the cabinet must agree on a six-point plan for the Gaza conflict by June 8th. He also threatened to leave the coalition government if Netanyahu does not meet his expectations.CNN's Elliott Gotkine is in in Tel Aviv for us.

      "sentences": "Fredricka, there was much speculation before Benny Gantz spoke this evening that he might actually be saying he was going to leave the government. But instead what we have is effectively an ultimatum for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that either he puts the national interests ahead of his personal interests, either he does what's best for Israel, or he goes with, in Benny Gantz's words, the radicals in his government, a reference, presumably, to the far-right ministers Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir. Either he goes with the nation or the radicals, or else Benny Gantz will leave this government.And you recall back in the aftermath of the Hamas terrorist attacks of October the 7th, Benny Gantz was the one of the leaders of the opposition. He decided to go into the government, into the war cabinet, effectively to ensure that Netanyahu's running of this war wasn't held hostage to the far-right elements in his government. And as a result, it's important to understand that the way that the war has been playing out has been a result, not just of Prime Minister Netanyahu and his broader cabinet, but really the decisions of the war cabinet, which include what one might refer to as slightly less right- wing voices, whether it's defense minister Yoav Gallant or Benny Gantz himself, former defense minister, in order to ensure that the conduct of Israel in the war is done in the best interests of the country. But recently there have been growing concerns that Netanyahu's decision-making is really being overly influenced by the far-right members of his broader coalition government, and that has led us to these words from Benny Gantz this evening. Now, in terms of his six-point plan, he has effectively given Netanyahu, the prime minister, a deadline of June the 8th, saying that the cabinet needs to come up with a plan that would achieve the disarming of Gaza and the elimination of Hamas, to bring back the hostages, to establish an alternative Gaza that would not be run by Hamas or Fatah, the Palestinian faction that is run by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, bring back the residents of the north. Of course, there are tens of thousands of Israelis displaced from the north as a result of attacks from the Iranian proxy Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. And also of course those in the south as well. And also, as part of that plan, Benny Gantz is insisting that this progress with normalization with the Saudis as well. But I think the key point here, Fredricka, is that Benny Gantz wants to see substantial progress, substantial evidence that Netanyahu is putting the national interest ahead of his own personal interest and ahead of those far-right elements in his governing coalition.

He was out on a bike ride on October the 7th, and when he was in a junction just slightly to the east of the northeastern tip of Gaza when he was killed by Hamas and his body was abducted back into the Gaza Strip. That's according to the IDF. Now, they say that they recovered his body along with those of the three other bodies of hostages that were recovered on Thursday evening and that were announced on Friday.And that still leaves some 124 hostages being held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip who were kidnapped on October the seventh. Around a quarter of them are already believed to be dead. And I think, as I'm speaking right now, protests are again taking place in central Tel Aviv, in other cities across the country to try and put more pressure on this government to do whatever it takes to bring the remaining hostages home, especially the living ones, because the big fear is that the longer this war drags on, the longer these hostage negotiations, which had have hit another impasse, drag on, the less likely it is that their loved ones will be returned alive and that the most they will be able to hope for is that their bodies can be recovered, such as the body of Ron Benjamin, 53 year-old father of two, whose body was recovered on Thursday night, and which was announced today.

There's got to be something that happens at the end of the conflict, at the end of the killing.Yes, it's great. We've got to go out. They have -- the Israeli government has to go after Hamas. They have to kill the terrorists or capture them. But there's got to be more in terms of the end state. It's part of the holistic view of warfare, Fredricka. You just can't have the military go out and execute unbounded operations. It has to be tied to a political objective. And so far, Mr. Netanyahu's government has not even verbalized what their political objective is for Gaza, other than destroying Hamas. And when you're talking about over 2 million in people that live there, you have to have a security agreement and understanding of what happens after the war is over, to take care of the citizens and a potential rebuilding capability, even though Hamas has basically built their strategy around -- they're using the civilians and not caring about the civilians of Gaza to execute their strategy against Israel.",

They've lost it long ago in terms of the way they're conducting operations. You will get a lot of military leaders who will say this is the right way to do things in terms of killing Hamas terrorists, and I agree with that. But you have to have a counterbalance to that in terms of protecting the citizens and doing the kind of counterinsurgency operations that will go after the terrorists but will also not destroy infrastructure and kill innocent civilians.So Israel is in a really bad place. They have been for quite a while. And that, in fact, is the strategy of the Hamas, to not only kill Israel, but make them world pariahs through their public relations campaign. And Israel is falling right into that trap. So they've got to change the way they're approaching this, and this is what President Biden has been telling them over the last several months.",

      "sentences": "Well, Fred, President Biden and his team have really been working on this speech for weeks, trying to take into account the concerns of students. They are well aware of the frustrations among some students and faculty on campus when it comes to the president's handling of the conflict in Gaza. In fact, they deployed the director of the White House Office of Public Engagement, Steve Benjamin, to Morehouse College just last Friday to meet one-on-one in the small group setting with faculty and students to talk about their concerns. I'm told that about half of that over two-hour meeting actually focus on the issue of Gaza.But the other issue at hand is that this is a commencement speech. And the president's advisers that I've spoken heading into the weekend acknowledged this is a moment so celebrate the future African American leaders that will be leaving Morehouse College tomorrow as graduates. And they also want to take into account issues that are of concern to them. There has been some concern among students that some of the attention that's been focused on Gaza and the frustration with the president might overshadow the events of tomorrow. But his advisers say that they will be keen, focusing in on the issue that they believe matter to students. But it does come at a time when Biden is really trying to shore up support among black voters. In just a short while we expect him to make a campaign stop to meet with black voters. He's also hosting a fundraiser here today. Tomorrow he'll be trying traveling on to Detroit to speak at an NAACP dinner. But it comes at a time, yes, black voters were a core part of Biden's coalition back in 2020. But if you take a look at recent polling, his support has actually been narrowing with that group. A recent \"New York Times\" poll in battleground states found that Biden earned about 63 percent support from black voters, while Trump had drawn about 23 percent. That's a real narrowing compared to 2020. And Georgia, of course, is also a critical battleground state. Biden barely won here back in 2020. If you take a look at the polling now, Trump is leading Biden here among registered voters by about 10 percent. So the Biden campaign acknowledges that they have work to do in battleground states like Georgia, where in the past Biden really put together this diverse coalition of voters and leaned heavily on the black vote. They acknowledge they have a lot more to do to win over black voters heading into November, and they believe that the formula for that will be, one, reminding voters of what Biden has done an office, but also trying to draw a sharp contrast with the former president and what he could offer in a second term. WHITFIELD: And the Biden White House knows that it can't afford to lose the black vote. It can't afford to lose the youth vote, the younger voters as well. And a lot of younger voters have made their voice is very clear, whether it be through the protests on college campuses or perhaps even talking about their frustrations about the economy on TikTok.

CNN has learned that there is no police bodycam footage of the incident that led to the stunning Friday arrest of the world's number one men's golfer. Scheffler calls the incident a big misunderstanding with police.It unfolded just before dawn yesterday outside the Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville, Kentucky. Police accuse Scheffler of injuring an officer who tried to stop him from driving through the scene of a fatal traffic accident outside the club. Scheffler was booked, was in jail, and was released in time to make his tee time. He is now facing four charges, including felony assault on a police officer. We've got team coverage.

He was taken to the hospital to treat some of those injuries.So there is a little bit of two different versions of the story here.

So still hundreds of thousands without power, most of them in Texas. And here's the heat that builds as we go through the next couple of days.These are the heat index values. So this is temperatures tacked on with humidity, looking at a feeling close to 103 in Brownsville, Texas, by Monday. Some real feels getting towards 100 degrees near Corpus Christi, some middle 90s for that heat index in Houston. So again, not the worst teeth that they've ever felt, but without the power, if you're outside, again, just remember to take breaks, because we also have poor air quality. There's the air quality alert and effect from Houston down towards Galveston, because when you have this hot air, it could be stagnant. That stagnant air traps the pollution from the tailpipes of our cars and can make that air unhealthy to breath, especially for children, elderly, anybody with a heart or lung disease. So keep that in mind as you're outside cleaning up the damage. This is what's left of the same line of storms. It has definitely weakened. I've been watching it all morning. It is on a weakening trend for sure. Got still a few lightning strikes in there and a couple of downpours. A lot of the flood watches have been allowed to expire as some of the downpours moved south and east. But notice some of the river flooding still possible as those rivers try to kind of recover from all the rain we've had the last couple of days. Here's that bull's eye today. You can see right along that Florida- Georgia line where we have the highest threat for damaging winds. But like I mentioned, it does look like that threat is continuing to diminish as we go through the afternoon. Something to keep an eye on, even going up into the Carolinas, you're looking at some of those showers and storms stretching all the way up towards Charlotte and Raleigh. It does look like, though, this isn't too much of an overnight threat. Things do start to clear as we go into the evening. Then we already have another storm developing in the Rockies, already a level three out of five severe risk across a much of Kansas as we go into tomorrow. Looking at the threat for damaging winds, large hail, tornadoes, again. And it lasts into Monday for Kansas, Nebraska, and then going into Iowa. So keeping us busy, continuing with a pretty active spring that we've had so far, already have had pretty high amounts of tornado reports so far in April. So May following suit.",

But something we did not anticipate, Fredricka, was -- you used the past tense, that students were struggling. That's not the case. It's actually the present tense. Students are struggling. In fact, the ramifications of the COVID closures and, frankly, the upending of the really the world as we knew it has changed everything.And so our students have more learning loss. Their behaviors are incredibly challenging. We have more students entering our systems with incredibly high needs. And so that's the part of the piece that we are really struggling with. The percentage of special education students who are on IEPs has increased. And so the needs we're seeing are actually greater.",

I know they've already started in Portland, I'm guessing they started in other places, of parents meeting with elected officials and saying, tell us what we can do, because this is too important. Our students only get fourth grade in one year.So they're rallying around. I don't know that we have a clear plan yet, and so I want to reinforce what Andrea said. This is raising awareness for us so that the folks who are impacted by all these cuts can come together in a thoughtful manner and unite about what we want the future vision for Oregon and other states to look like around public education.",
