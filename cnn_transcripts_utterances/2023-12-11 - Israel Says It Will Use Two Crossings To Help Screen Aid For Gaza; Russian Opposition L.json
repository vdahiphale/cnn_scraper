There were massive explosions across Gaza today. CNN crews captured this blast lighting up the sky as night fell.The Palestinian Red Crescent shared this video showing a dramatic rescue of a husband and wife who were trapped under rubble following a blast in central Gaza. Meantime, urgent aid like food, water, fuel, those are still not getting in in enough quantities according to these organizations. Israeli authorities now say they will use two crossings to help screen aid for Gaza. But they emphasize that no supplies will be entering Gaza from Israel. Let's discuss these issues and more with CNN chief national security correspondent Alex Marquardt and former spokeswoman for the U.S. Mission to the United Nations Hagar Chemali, thank you both for being with us. Alex, first, to you. An Egyptian official said that just 61 trucks carrying humanitarian aid went through the Rafah crossing into Gaza today. That's the smallest number in roughly a week. Israeli authorities are now saying they're got to start screening trucks at the Nitzana and Kerem Shalom crossings. What impact is that going to have?",

      "sentences": "Well, hopefully it's got to have a really big impact, Boris. The Israelis are saying that it could double the capacity of the number of trucks going into Gaza, which is obviously extremely good news. But it's not just the trucks going in that that's the issue. It's also what they face once they get onto the other side. And those are absolutely chaotic scenes that have been driven by this war.You have quite a few countries, Egypt, the U.S., Israel and others, plus the aid organizations who are all involved here. It's a very complex puzzle. There's a lot of finger pointing a lot of blame -- blame to go around and a lot of people are playing that blame game. But essentially what's got to happen now is a lot of the shipments that are coming into a port, a place called Al-Arish in Egypt. They're now going to go to the Kerem Shalom crossing for inspections. Israel has a very strict inspections regime before those trucks head on in into the Gaza Strip. Now, once those trucks go through, as we've seen, the situation is just extraordinarily desperate. There's so many hundreds of thousands of people who are packed into the southern part of the Gaza Strip that a lot of those trucks are getting overwhelmed. People don't have enough water. They don't have enough food. They don't have enough medicine. And then those trucks aren't able to go farther north. Because of the -- because the fighting. They can't get to people who have been displaced from the north. They can't get to the hospitals. So, what we've been hearing from the U.S. in sort of very soft language towards Israel, is that Israel and the humanitarian organizations need to deconflict, as Secretary, Blinken said, in order to better establish plans and routes and times so that these trucks can go in and better distribute that aid. It is a very complicated situation, but no doubt, Boris, this is good news that this Kerem Shalom crossing is going to be open, not to get aid in, but to inspect more aid -- Boris.",

      "sentences": "Alex, the United Nations is set to resume its emergency session on the war in Gaza tomorrow. The U.S. over the weekend, vetoing that resolution calling for a ceasefire. We have heard from U.S. officials, though, that Israel needs to do more to ensure civilian safety. What's the latest that you've heard from officials about getting aid in?",

      "sentences": "Well, Boris, clearly the U.S. is in a unique spot where it is increasingly lonely on the world stage in that it is the lone defender on the UN Security Council vetoing that resolution for an immediate ceasefire. But at the same time, it's really the only country in the world that can have any -- that can impose any kind of real pressure on Israel. So, you are hearing increasing alarm from the United States, perhaps not as much criticism as many would like. But you're certainly hearing the U.S. putting this pressure on Israel to both increase the amount of aid coming into Gaza -- and we saw the Israelis budge a couple of days ago, they started allowing more fuel in.But also, in terms of the fighting. And we heard Secretary Blinken over the weekend saying there is still what they're calling a gap between Israel's intent to keep civilians safe and what is actually happening on the ground. Clearly, the U.S. is upset by the number of civilians who are still being killed. And so, there is a lot of pressure coming from the U.S. behind the scenes. And there really is a hope in Washington that this phase of the war, this heavy phase of the war, only lasts a couple more weeks. Beyond that, I can imagine that you, we might imagine that American patience is going to start running out pretty quickly -- Boris.",

      "sentences": "Hagar, there's new reporting out there that I want to get your thoughts on it. Details this arrangement that was endorsed by Prime Minister Netanyahu. It helped fund Hamas for years, going back to 2018. Qataris would essentially deliver between $15 million and $30 million in suitcases to Hamas in Gaza. Netanyahu defended the program previously, saying that it would help prevent humanitarian disaster. But now his critics are incensed, saying they think that these payments actually made Hamas stronger, that it made October 7th more brutal. Is the criticism of Netanyahu here valid in your eyes?",

      "sentences": "Yes, to answer your quick your answer your question quickly, the answer is yes. We've known about these payments for a while and the fact is there's no doubt that they would have helped support Hamas because money is fungible. Whatever money -- and let's say they're not spending on mass humanitarian aid to their people. But some of that aid is going to fuel. And so, if Hamas is not spending its budget on fuel and energy, then that frees up money for them to spend on military capabilities.And again, the Hamas has a number of ways it finances itself. Iran finances them, they get charitable donations. They have investment funds in countries like the UAE, Sudan, Algeria, and Turkey that grow billions -- millions of dollars -- sorry. And so, they have other ways of growing their assets. But that is a significant way -- the part that's so ugly about this is that it is a policy directly endorsed by the Netanyahu government, by Prime Minister Netanyahu specifically, where he said that it may allow Israel to ensure that the aid goes for humanitarian purposes. But allegedly he also added that it would allow Hamas to remain strong in order to divide Palestinians, to pit Hamas against the Palestinian Authority, in order to prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state, and that is critical here. I do think that this is one of several of Netanyahu's policies that created the opportunity for Hamas to pursue the horrific terrorist attack on October 7th.",

Navalny has been in prison since 2021, serving a more than 30-year sentence. But his legal team says they haven't been able to locate him for six days now, and there is growing concern among supporters that Navalny may be in poor health. Joining us now is CNN national security analyst, former CIA chief of Russia operations Steve Hall. So, Steve, do you think this is just a case of Navalny being moved to a different place or could something else be going on here? What do you think?",

And of course, the people on Navalny's team are got to continue to try to get information out of there. So, we'll have to see whether anybody can actually locate him. But again, it's so difficult. And you have to remember that the Kremlin and Vladimir Putin would like nothing more than for Navalny simply to disappear, not only off Russian -- the Russian stage, but also the international stage. Because he remains a significant threat, I think to Vladimir Putin, as long as he's alive and as long as he's, you know, publicly out there and able to somehow communicate with the outside world.",

But clearly Shohei Ohtani is hoping that he's got to be more successful with the Dodgers. And he's now playing on a fabulous team with Freddie Freeman and Mookie Betts. So, they're got to be really, really exciting to watch.I agree with you, the number really is the story here. $700 million is just eye watering. You think about Patrick Mahomes, he's on 450 million playing for the Chiefs in the NFL. You've got Mike Trout on 425-ish. That was the previous MLB record. So this is absolutely shattered all of that. The other thing that's really interesting here is that he's not got to get all of that money straight away. In fact, it's not even 700 divided by the 10 years, 70 million. A lot of it is got to be deferred. And that is so that the Dodgers can invest that money in building a team because he really does want to win the big prizes. And he hasn't been particularly successful in that regard in his career so far. So that's what it's all about. You know, it's all about the money for us. For Ohtani, it's almost less about the money. He just wants to get out there and play on a good team and win some titles.",

It's always nice to win trophies and have more accolades on the resume. But hey, his team played well, they wanted to win. As you say, LeBron was the MVP. But I think probably the most important thing this weekend was seeing his son Bronny play his first ever college game. I think the parents among us who have kids who play sports can relate to just how special this would be.But of course, it's not just that. Remember, Bronny had the cardiac arrest, what, five months ago, when he was during, you know, in a sort of a preseason workout with his team. And there was so much concern around that time. And to see him bounce back from that, play his first game, have his dad court side must have just been so special for the family. And he has taken one step closer towards the James Dream of LeBron and Bronny one day playing on the same team in the NBA.",
