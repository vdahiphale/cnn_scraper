What a busy program, a busy hour that you and I have together. We are live tonight from Dubai on Monday, June 3rd, I am Richard Quest, and of course, yes, in the UAE, I mean, business. And a very good evening to you, a glorious evening. It is somewhat warm. Yes, it is a bit kibbitzing here in Dubai tonight, but we are at IATA's Annual General Meeting and what a day it has been so far. The world's largest airlines are all here. They are no longer concerned about COVID or indeed travel restrictions, they're actually making money; in some cases, good money. But all of that could be at risk. What a magnificent view that is we have from here. The challenges in front of them, the political stability. Hundreds of millions of people are going to the polls, making key decisions, oil prices amid geopolitical tensions and in terms of aircraft and manufacturers, safety as Boeing has faced quality concerns. Tonight, as you would expect on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, we will cover it from CEO's across its the world. In Europe, we will hear from the CEO of SAS which is about to become part, or at least a small part of Air France-KLM. Emirates in the Middle East, the giant behemoth Gulf carrier; Qantas in Australia, which of course is undergoing its own reforms. But we will start in the United States with United Airlines. Scott Kirby, the CEO is telling me, he is confident that Boeing will return to producing quality aircraft if it can change its culture. United has had to deal with Boeing quality control problems after finding loose bolts on its 777 Max aircraft. Scott told me what needs to change at the manufacturer. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
