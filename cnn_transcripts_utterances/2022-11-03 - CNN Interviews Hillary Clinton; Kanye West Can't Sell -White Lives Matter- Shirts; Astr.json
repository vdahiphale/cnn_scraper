The 25-year-old's fastball is a thing of beauty, and he is one of baseball's most underappreciated stars, undrafted from the Dominican Republic. His parents flew in before the game to see him pitch and told him, God willing, you'll throw a no-hitter, and that is exactly what he and his teammates did. Javier striking out nine over six innings, including five in a row. At one point, he turned it over to the pulpit, and then from there, it was Bryan Abreu in the seventh, Rafael Montero in the eight, and Ryan Pressly just slammed that door shut in the ninth. This is the Astro's second no-hitter of the season and the other one also started by Javier. That was back in June as Houston evens the series up at two. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Dan Snyder and his wife, Tanya, she has been running the team, say they have hired Bank of America to secure potential transactions. The news comes months after Snyder was forced to hand over control of the franchise's daily operations to his wife.And also, the House Oversight Committee accused of fostering a toxic workplace and using a shadow investigation to influence the internal NFL reviews. Snyder has denied this accusation. Let's go to our senior data reporter Harry Enten with this warning. This is like been a long time coming.

I just want to give you an idea here of -- but, you know, Dan Snyder might be forced to sell the team, but he's going to make bank, he's going to make bank which is -- look at this. Look how much the team is worth now. It's worth $5.6 billion -- billion dollars! When he and the group bought the team back in 1999, it was only worth $750 million.I mean -- so, you know, he might have the embarrassment of having to sell it, but he's going to make bank. And I want to give you an idea that the reason why he's basically being forced to sell the team at this particular point is not because necessarily the scandal, yes, that's part of it, but it also because there's a ton of fan pressure to get rid of the team, because look at the percentage of games his team won over the course of his ownership, only  43% of the games that they won. But I think the question might be then, okay, the team stunk, he's in scandal, why is the team worth so much money? Well here's the reason why. The reason why is pretty simple, and that is Snyder benefits from an addicted public. I will admit I'm addicted to football. I watch my Buffalo Bills every single Sunday. And if you look at the viewership of the last Super Bowl, get this, 112 million people watched this past year's Super Bowl. It was the most viewed program of anything by far and the most viewed non-NFL program in 2021 had just 32 million viewers. Look at that difference, 112 versus 32 million viewers. The public loves football. Of course, there's also another scandal that I think we should talk about here. The NBA Phoenix Suns are also worth a ton. Owner Robert Sarver is selling because of scandal as well, racist remarks, et cetera. He at this particular point, $2.7 billion. He's also going to make bank. That is up from $401 million when he bought the team back in 2004. You have all these owners who have embarrassment but they're going to make a lot of money.",
