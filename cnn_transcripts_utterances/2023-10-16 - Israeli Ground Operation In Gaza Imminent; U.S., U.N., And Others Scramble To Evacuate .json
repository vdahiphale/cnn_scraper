How concerned are you about the situation in the West Bank and also along the northern border with Lebanon?MICHAEL OREN, FORMER ISRAELI AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S.: Good evening. Hi. Good to be with you again always, Anderson. Well, about the recent item you just had with Becky, I would unequivocally condemn settler violence against innocent Palestinians in the West Bank, but let's put it also in context. Roughly 30 Israeli Jews have been massacred by Hamas and other Palestinian extremist youth groups, terrorists in the West Bank, Judea and Samaria since the beginning of the year, including the mother and two daughters of the Dea [ph] family. So, it's not just one-sided here. There's a battle going on there between extremists on both sides and everything, both of them have to be condemned and Israel has to defend itself. I'm very concerned about the situation up north. We've talked about it before. The possibility of a multi-front war is a reality and Hezbollah as a fighting force is roughly 15 times that of Hamas. Hamas maybe has 10 to 15,000 rockets. Hezbollah has 150,000 rockets, many of which are buried under 200 villages in southern Lebanon. They put the rocket in the living room with the family there. The family is a human shield for that rocket. They have a fighting force, which has been fighting on the side of Bashar al-Assad in Syria for 10 years, experienced with massacring literally hundreds of thousands of Syrians, a true terrorist group, backed fully by Iran. And what Hezbollah and its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, has been doing since the outbreak of the war in Gaza has been testing us. They've been shooting mortar shells across the border, some drone activity across the border. They've killed 5 of our soldiers so far, but they haven't unleashed the rockets yet. And the conventional wisdom here among security people is that Hezbollah is waiting to see how Israel advances with its ground incursion into Gaza. And at a certain point where it becomes clear that Hamas will be defeated, that is when Hezbollah will open up with its rockets. The great deterrence will be the presence of these 2 very large U.S. naval flotillas there, the two U.S. aircraft carriers, the Eisenhower and the Ford. And the very clear, I think, intention of President Biden and Secretary of State Blinken to say to Iran, Hezbollah, and I quote them, don't, don't dare. And I think that the president is willing to use force to prevent Hezbollah and Iran from intervening in this war.",

As a citizen, I'm not a spokesman for the state of Israel anymore, but I would say I would be in favour of relieving some of the human suffering in that area as much as possible if for no other reason. It's because the president and his secretary of state have asked that, they've asked us to help them help us help them help us by reducing as much as possible the human suffering element in this very tragic situation. Of course, we have no choice but to urge that population to move because the Israeli army is poised to enter into heavily mined, booby-trapped areas. I mean, as a former infantryman, I will tell you there is no greater nightmare than this scenario and most of the fighting will not be above ground, it'll be beneath the ground where Hamas has dug endless kilometers of tunnels and bunkers, all of which are mined and booby-trapped and Hamas's leadership is under hospitals, under schools. There could be no more nightmare situation.The least we can do is move that population out of there because if they were to remain there, then the level of civilian casualties would be far, far, far greater.

And we've tried many things. Israel has developed the world's most advanced tunnel detection technology. We share that technology with Homeland Security. America also faces tunnel challenges on its borders. We have built we have a subterranean metal wall that goes down many meters to block the tunnels from coming into our territory.But here, one of the attacks on one of our bases was undertaken by Hamas terrorists using a tunnel, even with all of these precautions. And to go into these tunnels is to go into an underground labyrinth. And by the way, the tunnels have plenty of electricity, plenty of water. They're no short of anything. It is, as I've said often to you, Anderson, I was in charge of Gaza and I'll tell you everything you learn about human nature, humankind is a goodness. You got to throw out the window when you're dealing with Hamas. They're completely, completely different. They will use their people as human shields, use the hostages as human shields. They will even shell their own people. And I think they have already. It's nothing that you and I could possibly understand. I was listening to your report before about the visit to the killing field of that former rave concert. And I haven't quite, I mean, as they say, I haven't gotten it together.

Keep in mind, that crossing is the main point of departure for evacuees and a critical entrance for arriving humanitarian supplies.

All of this as the U.S. is moving a second carrier strike group into the region.

They are extremely complex. They go for miles, hundreds of miles, underneath the three major cities within Gaza and in other places. They are deeply buried, some more than a couple of hundred feet underground. They have quick turns and complex weaves throughout the cities, where Hamas can establish fortified positions, defensive positions. They can move very easily, not only from above-ground buildings into these tunnels, but underground as well.This is the IDS worst nightmare. When you're planning an operation as a commander in this, it's extremely difficult to fight these kind of tunnel complexes, and what I mean by that is we trained some US soldiers on cave complexes that we came across in Iraq and Afghanistan. When you're talking about a force going into these tunnels, they go in in one direction and can only usually come out in the same direction. They are in a single stack of a line. You can't mass a force against an enemy force when you're going against a defensive position. You're crouched over, you can't see. The enemy has an advantage, and in our training, we saw cave complexes that were similar to these tunnels, where 3 or 4 or 5 soldiers could hold off an invading force of hundreds and more for long periods of time. We saw that in Ukraine, in Mariupol, where tunnel complexes existed under the Azovstal plant, and the Ukrainians held off the Russians for months with a very relatively small group of people. So, this is an infantryman's worst nightmare.",

They're trying to urge folks there, and a lot of them are moving, as we understand it, south of Wadi Gaza, south of those wetlands, into the southern part of the Gaza Strip there. You know, I think the assumption for many is that they will not be able to return home, maybe at all.Certainly, I think, considering some of the damage to these areas, we know they won't be able to return home anytime soon.

From the very top, where Gaza City is, to that crossing point at Rafah in the bottom of Gaza, or in the south of Gaza, is 25 miles. That's like going from the Washington Monument to Manassas, Virginia on 1 road with 100,000 or more people trying to execute that over rubbled cities. It's very difficult with no support. And these are individuals, the Palestinians, who are trying to get out, the women and children specifically, are scared, they're anxious, they know they're not gonna be going back home because many of their apartments have already been levelled.So, they're just looking for a means to get out and a means to be saved. With all the things going on around them, that 25-mile trek is just your worst nightmare. So those are the kind of things that are happening. And you would think that the Israeli military would try and support the continued flow of the refugees. But in some cases, it doesn't appear like they're doing much help. Of course, they're being prevented. The refugees are being prevented by Hamas themselves who are setting up roadblocks and continuing to rubble and also setting up explosive devices to further scare the citizens. Again, I can only put it that this would be a civilian, a mother, the children, this would be their worst nightmare.",
