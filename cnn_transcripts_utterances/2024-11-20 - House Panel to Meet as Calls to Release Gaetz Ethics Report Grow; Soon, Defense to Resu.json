And so he is on Capitol Hill today, along with Trump's vice presidential nominee, J.D. Vance, who are going to be trying to make the case for Matt Gaetz and start working some of these senators trying to build up support.Meanwhile, Donald Trump is standing by his controversial pick with a one word answer yesterday when asked about his views on all the concerns.

Dr. Oz, yes, the television personality, will be in charge of the center for Medicare and Medicaid. And then Linda McMahon, one of the former, Wrestling Federation founders, is going to be his secretary of education, just showing how experience is not necessarily as important to Trump as loyalty and ability to communicate, a message for him on T.V.The big question remaining is who will be Donald Trump's labor secretary as well as who will be in charge of the treasury. That is a job that is getting a lot of intrigue behind the scenes. Howard Lutnick is someone who wanted the position. Now that he's been named a secretary, we're told -- secretary of commerce, we're told that they will march ahead with a pick for treasury as soon as today. And the contenders are Scott Bessent, he's a hedge fund manager, Senator Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, Kevin Warsh, he's a former Federal Reserve governor, and Mark Rowan, the billionaire investor.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [07:10:00] BOLDUAN:  Today in Georgia, the defense team is expected to wrap up laying out its case in the murder trial of the man accused of killing nursing student Laken Riley. Prosecutors rested their case yesterday after introducing new surveillance video of Laken Riley jogging moments before she was attacked. And also video was shown of a man in dark clothing shown lurking near at an apartment complex near the crime scene hours before prosecutors arguing that man was the defendant, Jose Ibarra. CNN's Rafael Romo is following all of this for us from Georgia and joins us now. And, Rafael, you said, you told us yesterday things were moving along quite quickly.

It's very possible that the family and many friends of Laken Riley who have attended every day of court will find out the fate of the man that stands accused of her murder. Jose Ibarra's defense team has said that they only needed about half a day to present their testimony. And let's remember, Kate, this is a bench trial, not a trial by jury, which means many of the normal procedures don't apply and won't delay the trial because it's ultimately the judge who will decide whether the defendant is guilty or not.Among the most compelling evidence presented here in court yesterday was a college security camera video showing Laken Riley's last run the morning of February 22nd before she was murdered. The video also showed Jose Ibarra, the defendant, lurking near the crime scene. We also heard testimony about frantic texts and missed calls from Laken Riley's mother that the prosecution used to illustrate the timeline and in what's perhaps the most damning piece of evidence. A forensic expert testified how Ibarra's DNA was found under Riley's fingernails. We also heard from the medical examiner's official determination for a cause of death. Let's take a listen.

      "sentences": "Yes. Good thing it's not your job to explain it. It's my job, right? And this storm is very impressive, but it didn't make the three times bomb cyclone criteria that it needed to, to get to that triple bomb naming criteria.But, nonetheless, it made an impressive run. Nearly 2.5 times that bomb criteria because what this comes from is a term known as bombogenesis. Basically, when a unit of pressure storm system drops by 24 millibars in 24 hours, this one dropped 57 millibars in 24-hour period. And so that made again a 2.5 time run for that criteria to be met. So it is called a bomb cyclone. We've got a lot of these popular meteorological terms that float around the Internet, you know, from a sting jet to a poisonous wind field to a bomb cyclone. And they all mean certain things. Unfortunately, they can all mean destruction as well. So, we have seen that across the Pacific Northwest with, unfortunately, trees and power lines toppling onto roofs, taking hours for firefighters to rescue individuals out of the Pacific Northwest. This storm system very impressive on satellite loop, and that poisonous tail or sting jet, that's right here, the bottom portion of this bomb cyclone. That's where the most powerful winds of this storm are actually located. Fortunately, just offshore, but where the coldest, densest air actually rapidly descends to the surface, the air dries out and that's where we see those powerful winds and some of them made its way on shore. You saw the destruction that it left behind. But you look at these impressive wind gusts, Mount Rainier, 77 miles per hour. That's equivalent to a Category 1 Atlantic hurricane. Now, this thing is tapping into a jet stream known as a Pineapple Express. So, it's got deep tropical connections near Hawaii, in fact. So, it's going to take that moisture and create a torrent of precipitation in the coming days across the Western U.S. from one to two feet of snowfall, locally higher amounts across the mountains to up to ten inches of rain across northern sections of California. You can see why this bomb cyclone means business, John.",

But this new study that you're talking about says that all the hurricanes that formed, all 11 of them, throughout this 2024 hurricane season actually were made stronger than it otherwise would have been without climate change, human caused climate change, as a factor.Take Hurricane Milton, for example. This storm exploded in strength. 180 miles per hour was its top strength, but that increase in max intensity of 24 miles per hour, according to this study, is what was made possible because of the abnormally warm Gulf of Mexico Ocean waters, which, by the way, are roughly 2.5 degrees above average for this particular location. So, that rapid increase we keep talking about that bomb cyclone, the dropping of the pressure, the increasing of the winds. Well, that again was made all that more and more likely because of climate change, our warm oceans and our warm atmosphere. John?",
