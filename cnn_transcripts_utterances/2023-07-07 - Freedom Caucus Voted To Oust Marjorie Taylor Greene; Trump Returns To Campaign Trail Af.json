I was reminded about this January of this year, this quote in the New York Times, it says Speaker McCarthy gushed to a friend about the ironclad bond he had developed with an unlikely ally in his battle for political survival, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, \"I will never leave that woman. I will always take care of her.\" That bond has kind of allowed him to weathered some storms here and navigate this very narrow path of his speakership?",

You know, fundamentally, while it looks kind of ugly on the House floor, men behave like that all the time. The real issue here is her closeness to McCarthy. His constituency, so to speak, I don't know where it goes beyond Bakersfield, but within the brighter party, I don't know sort of who really loves Kevin McCarthy. They just know that Republicans are in power and they want to get things done. The definition of getting things done shifts depending on where you are sitting in the House.

He has actually -- Jim Jordan managed to escape a lot of the same heat that Marjorie Taylor Greene has taken, in part because he's built more goodwill within the conference. He's this founding member. He also doesn't publicly attack his colleagues. But for them, they have benefits, as well, to sidling up to Kevin McCarthy because they've both gotten prominent committee assignments by playing the inside game.Jim Jordan now the chair of the powerful House Judiciary Committee, Marjorie Taylor Greene got her desired committee assignments after being a real pariah when she first came to Congress. And so I think there is this broader debate inside the Freedom Caucus about whether you play the inside game, or whether you continue to try to throw roadblocks and try to just be antagonistic towards leadership.",

You can see there's a conversation going on behind me here a roundtable discussion about agricultural policy. The candidate is not here for that. He is still arriving and flying here to western Iowa. But he clearly is making the case, still trying to distinguish himself from his rivals. We're told that he will, in particular draw some distinctions today with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, over his wavering support for the ethanol industry. Of course, ethanol as part of the renewable fuels industry made of corn here, a central part of the Iowa economy.So the former president has been taking aim at some votes that Governor DeSantis made when he was in Congress. That is part of it. But he's also just simply trying to rally Iowa Republicans to enthuse them and keep them excited about his candidacy. We saw former Vice President Mike Pence here in Iowa last night. He was imploring Republicans to look for a new kind of leadership. So this will be essentially a bookend to that speech last night. Donald Trump will be clearly trying to make the case to Iowa Republicans, as well as some Nebraska Republicans here just across the Missouri River that he is the candidate to beat. So, Abby, it clearly is a sense of a busy caucus season, caucus summer of campaigning. There are many commercials on the airwaves here. Many candidates trying to break through the Donald Trump trying to make the case that he's still demand to beat here in Iowa. Abby?",

RON DESANTIS, (R) FLORIDA: The corporate media, who are they going after? Who do they not want to be the nominee? They're going after me. Who's the president of Mexico attacking because he knows we'll be strong on the border and hold him accountable and the cartels. He's going after me.

That's not great. And part of the reason why Trump has been -- has had such a different trail presence and media presence so far as because he doesn't feel much of a threat. He's got a lock, a tighter grip on the GOP base now than he had when he ran in 2016 -- 2015.And, you know, part of that is just the DeSantis for all the hype has not really lived up to his not really caught people's hearts and minds at this point. And I think that, you know, that has a lot to do with sort of where DeSantis is. You're going to see them try to run contrast around each other. But, you know, the Trump campaign and DeSantis' pack are going back and forth on Twitter. They're mocking DeSantis for being just a few points ahead of Vivek Ramaswamy in the polling, and 10 or 20 or 30 points behind Donald Trump. So there's already this kind of, you know, sophomore, back and forth that you're seeing on social media.

Also, with the Super PAC that has raised 130 million, some of that is transfers, but the Super PAC has already said we're going to be doing the ground game, we're going to be the ones kind of doing the boots on the ground paying people to do that.

And we should know that both the Ukrainians and the Russians have used cluster bombs since Putin's forces invaded last year.Let's go live to CNN's Natasha Bertrand who's over at the Pentagon.

U.S. officials and Western officials believed that by this point, Ukraine would be much further along in this counter offensive, but instead, they are moving more slowly. And then their day-to-day grind against Russian forces and defensive positions. They are expending a tremendous amount of artillery ammunition, so much that the U.S. is not sure that it will be able to sustain its supply of such ammunition to Ukraine, just given the sheer amount that they're using day to day.Now, there are also questions about whether this munition could turn things around on the battlefield for Ukraine, not necessarily as a game changer, but something that could help the Ukrainians break through the Russian defensive lines here because just to give our viewers a sense of what these cluster munitions are, they are bombs that when they go off, they scatter bomblets across a very large area up to around seven and a half acres. And they scattered the sub munitions. And the reason why they're banned by over 100 countries is not only because of the threat that they could pose in the near term, of course, to civilians who are anywhere inside that radius, but also because of the long-term threat they could pose to civilians who might encounter duds, essentially bomblets that have exploded as part of this costume munition that have not actually detonated. And so similar to land mines, they could pose that long term risk to anyone who encounters them. But the Biden administration is now saying, look, we have cluster munitions in our stockpile, that don't have a very high dud rate, less than 2.35%, they say of those munitions, the little bomblets will actually fail to explode. So they say this is a safer option. This could help Ukraine really turn things around in the counter offensive. And importantly, it could solve the problem of that ammunition shortage, Abby.",
