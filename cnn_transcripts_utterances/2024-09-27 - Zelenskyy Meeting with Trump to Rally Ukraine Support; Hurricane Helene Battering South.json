And of course, we have to decide it now. Because after November, we don't know who it is. Only Americans decide who will be the president. But we understand that until November, we can't stop Putin.We have to do it. We will try on the battlefield with our heroic soldiers. And we understand that after November, we have to decide, and we hope that the strength of the United States will be very strong, and we count on it. That's why I decided to meet with both candidates with all honor to them. Thank you.",

He's gone through hell, and his country has gone through hell like few countries have ever -- like it's happened anywhere. Nobody's ever seen anything like it. It's a terrible situation.And I will say I have had a great relationship. It was very honorable. I don't even know if you know this, but when they did the impeachment hoax, it was a hoax, just a Democrat hoax, which we won, but one of the reasons we won it so easily is that when the president was asked -- it was over a phone call with the president and he said he could have grandstanded and played cute, but he didn't do that. He said, President Trump did absolutely nothing wrong. He said it loud and clear and the impeachment hoax died right there. He could have said, well, I don't know. I don't know. I never even told you this to be honest, but he was like a piece of steel. He said, President Trump did nothing wrong. We had a very nice call. He congratulated me on his victory. You just won. And I remember that. I remember that. He could have played cute and he didn't play cute. And so, I appreciated that. So, we have a very good relationship and I also have a very good relationship, as you know, with President Putin. And I think if we win, I think we're going to get it resolved very quickly.

And if we have a win, I think long before I -- before January 20th, before I would take the presidency, it's January 20th, but long before that, I think that we can work out something that's good for both sides. It's time. And by the way, the president knows that too, he wants to get something done. He doesn't want to do this. And so, we look forward to having him. I look forward to being with him.

And what I try and focus on is not the tip of the iceberg that we see, especially when it comes to Trump's language.

You know, and he just said a few moments ago that the country has been through hell and something -- he essentially said something's got to give.So, you do have to wonder to what extent behind closed doors Trump is saying to Zelenskyy, you know, this war needs to end, which, you know, as Trump has been saying, as J. D. Vance has been saying, you know, that could play into Vladimir Putin's hands. So, Zelenskyy has a lot on the line here.",

And that's why they're trying to communicate with both sides.And I'd say real quickly, also communicate differently, right? If you go to towns in Ukraine or Poland, there are no Jews left. How do you communicate that to America? You talk about the persecution of Christians. You want to win Republican support?
