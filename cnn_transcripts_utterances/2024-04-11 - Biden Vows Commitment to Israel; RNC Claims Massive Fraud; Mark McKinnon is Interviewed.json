So Israel, under Netanyahu, has gotten itself into a situation where it doesn't feel like this is going to end anytime soon. The - the idea of getting rid of Hamas entirely, you know, in totality, every last fighter (ph) seems a somewhat elusive goal. And more importantly, Israel is racking up extraordinary costs, humanitarian front, the radicalization of the Arab street (ph), the increasing efforts to criticize Israel. Even in places like Germany, (INAUDIBLE) the second largest supporter of Israel after the United States. So, I think prime - I think President Biden might have to - might find himself having to get tougher and maybe make more public his disagreements with Prime Minister Netanyahu that here has so far kept it private because so far whatever Biden is doing is not working.

You can go back to that bipartisan border bill, you know, that got sunk by via Trump's social media post. You can go to this example. My - it's - I mean, you have to think of Trump as well. When Mike Johnson talks about changing Ukraine aid to be in some sort of loan, which we know is also a nod to the former president.
