The Fulton County judge overseeing the election subversion case in Georgia has thrown out six of the dozens of charges against Donald Trump and some of his co-defendants.

The Fulton County District Attorney's Office did not provide the necessary detail of the underlying crime these defendants were allegedly trying to solicit. Enough detail to get these charges to stick in this indictment. The charges have to do in part with a fake electors scheme.That's the so-called fake electors team trying to subvert the electoral college and unlawfully elect a slate of presidential electors. But it also has to do with that infamous phone call on January 2nd, 2021, when the former president and his former chief of staff Mark Meadows called Georgia's Secretary of State and asked him to find them more votes. But the judge in this order saying DA's office simply just didn't include the detail needed to have these charges stand. And this is what he's saying in part of his order. Quote: These six counts contain all the essential elements of the crimes but fail to allege sufficient detail regarding the underlying felony solicited. They do not give the defendants enough information to prepare their defenses intelligently. The order goes on to say: This does not mean the entire indictment is dismissed. So let's pick up from there. This entire indictment is not dismissed. In fact, the judge left the door open for an appeal from the DA's office but that would mean they would have to fill in the detail that the judge is looking for and then try to get another indictment. That would require them to put this in front of another grand jury which was just inevitably lengthened this process. All of this, of course, happening as we're waiting for that monumental decision from the judge. Will Fani Willis stay or will she go?
