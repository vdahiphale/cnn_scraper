You know that they are some of those who've been allowed out through the Rafah Crossing and into Egypt. These ambulances were part of a convoy that was heading south towards the Rafah Crossing. The Red Cross had been informed that the convoy was leaving the hospital towards the Rafah Crossing, and perhaps most damningly, we've just been hearing, Jessica, from the Red Cross who confirmed that they had been given information about this particular convoy that was due to leave the Shifa Hospital on its way to the Rafah Crossing. What we know about the attack is that there are several casualties, many wounded as well, and that this does appear now to have been a convoy of wounded Palestinians being taken to the Rafah Crossing that was hit as part of that IDF strike, now claimed by the IDF again with the idea that this was part of their operation to take on Hamas. The evidence that we're getting from those sources, not just inside the al-Shifa Hospital, but again from the Red Cross, does seem to contradict that, Jessica and Boris.",

      "sentences": "I think Israel has always set out this intent that it was going to completely deconstruct, demolish and dispose of Hamas in Gaza. And there was always a thought that if they go at it too heavy-handed, then Hassan Nasrallah and Hezbollah would therefore follow on with an escalated confrontation from the north to support Hamas.And we heard from Hassan Nasrallah, as Ben was explaining there, essentially saying they're already doing enough. They're tying down IDF troops on the northern border. They've caused a lot of civilians to be moved to the south. I think Israel would far rather have its fight with Hamas without having to even think about the northern border. So really, there - while there's consideration given, of course, to if Hezbollah escalates, how they would handle that and at the moment Israel is sort of playing it the same way that Hezbollah is playing it. It's strike by strike, soldier for soldier, if you will, more or less. So neither side has to get into an escalation, which Israel knows would consume a massive volume of its energies, efforts, firepower, distract from what's happening in Gaza. So I think as far as the Israeli government's concerned, Nasrallah, in a way, as Ben is explaining there, has left a lot of ambiguity. But in a sense, it's a very - he's blinked, if you will, in a game of brinksmanship in an ambiguous way. He's left the door open. But in essence, Israel is pursuing a very strong action inside Gaza to deconstruct, demolish, dispose of Hamas. And Hezbollah has, in a way, not escalated to a point of distraction. So I think for the prime minister, he will have also breathed a slight sigh of relief over that, although Israel had its plans to escalate if necessary.",

We saw some of these flight tracks on flight tracks on flight tracking websites. In fact, you can take a look at this graphic here, which shows you many of those flight tracks focusing around southern Gaza there.The U.S., however, and the officials that have spoken with CNN say these are simply unarmed surveillance drones. They're not intended to provide targeting information, but it's part of the U.S. commitment to helping Israel. Israel, obviously, clearly aware of what's happening in the skies over Gaza, so there must be some sort of coordination between Israel and the U.S. on the flights themselves, and then whatever intelligence the U.S. is able to gather from these flights. In a statement, Pentagon Press Secretary Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder said, in support of hostage recovery efforts, the U.S. is conducting unarmed UAV flights over Gaza, as well as providing advice and assistance to support our Israeli partner as they work on their hostage recovery efforts. Ryder then goes on to say these flights have been happening since October 7th. So this is a significant asset the U.S. has contributed. It also has not only more assets moving to the Middle East, but also in the waters off Israel as well, in a message to Iran and its proxies not to get involved here. But in terms of the drones themselves, unarmed surveillance drones trying to help in the hostage recovery efforts, as Israel tries to locate now more than 240 hostages in Gaza.

Eisenhower, known as the Ike, was on its way there and has since arrived there. Again, this is a massive show of force, two carriers, destroyers, cruisers, all in the Eastern Med. It's worth noting that the Ike will soon make its way through the Suez Canal into the waters of U.S. Central Command, the waters of the Middle East, where it will stay there, still very close to the fight, but closer to some of the adversaries the U.S. is watching very closely as a message to tell them, don't get involved.",

And so clearly the speech was full of rhetoric against Israel.But as Ben pointed out earlier, I mean, I think it certainly didn't suggest anything imminent that Hezbollah is planning. Hezbollah, after all, the situation in Lebanon, the economic situation there is absolutely terrible. A war would be very destructive. The 2006 war killed more than 1,000 Lebanese, inflicted billions of dollars of damage on Lebanon. So - and I think both Iran and Hezbollah don't right now want a wider war. Could that change as the pictures out of Gaza keep coming every day, every day for weeks and weeks and weeks? Maybe. But right now, I think there's - everybody's taking a bit of a breath.",

      "sentences": "Yes. Let's not forget that Lebanon is a flawed democracy and Hezbollah is an active, important participant in that democracy. It has 13 members in Parliament. It's been in government with ministers and they do depend on public support.There are sort of the hardcore people who believe in Hezbollah's military goals, which are, of course, to push Israel out of a part of Lebanon that's disputed. But by and large, ordinary people here, bread-and-butter issues do matter. The Lebanese economy has essentially collapsed. The standard of living has collapsed. People have lost their entire life savings as a result of the collapse of the local currency, the lira. And, therefore, as much as Hezbollah might want to become more involved in the war with Israel, they're really held back by the desire by many not to see the quality of their lives drastically drop as a result of the war. Now, I was here throughout the 2006 war and I saw how much destruction happened, not only in the south of Lebanon, but other - also the southern suburbs of Beirut, where many of the Shia live, who are the sort of the political base for Hezbollah. And that sort of destruction, people do not want to see happen again. So I think that really is tempering Nasrallah's approach to the situation. I think he's doing just enough to show that Hezbollah and, to a certain extent, Lebanon is trying to relieve some of the pressure on Hamas in Gaza, doing just enough to sort of be in the news, to force the Israelis to deploy more and more forces to the border with Lebanon and pull them away, perhaps, from the Gaza operation, but not enough to drag Lebanon into war with Israel. Other politicians here in Lebanon are coming out and saying, we do not want Hezbollah to - on its own with its own decision - drag this country into war. So I think there's a lot of reasons why Nasrullah is sort of putting his foot on the brake, not going full blast at the moment. Boris?",

No one has been killed yet.But the point is that I think it's also in Iran's interest not to dial the temperature up too far, because at the end of the day, I'm sure Iran does not want an outright military confrontation with the United States. But so what we're seeing is this kind of all these different proxies from Lebanon in the north and 1,500 miles to the south the Houthis in Yemen, all of whom are sort of participating to some degree in an attempt to kind of make it more complicated for Israel and the United States.",

A lot of color outside the courtroom, but inside the attorney general's office is trying to focus Eric Trump about his knowledge of Mar-A-Lago and how it was treated in the financial statement. So they showed an email that he was on that discussed the treatment of how they were valuing Mar-A-Lago.And what we have seen throughout this trial now at the end of its fifth week is that for the financial statements, Mar-A-Lago was valued as a private residence, which allowed it to have a higher valuation. But we've also seen evidence that Mar-A-Lago for tax purposes was valued as a private club, which enabled it to have a lower value. So this discrepancy was brought to Eric Trump's attention today on the stand, and he testified that both are accurate. So he's agreeing that it is also a private club while they were valuing it as a private residence in the statement of financial condition, which the judge has already said is fraudulent. So that was a key piece of this testimony today. He also said that he believed the financial statements were perfect and that he wouldn't have signed anything that wasn't accurate. So he wrapped up his testimony after about four hours over the past two days. Next week, the first person on the stand on Monday will be Donald Trump.
