      "sentences": "Hello, and welcome to Inside Politics. I'm John King in Washington. Thank you for your time today. Donald Trump makes plain who he is and what he thinks. Over 70 minutes, the clear Republican front runner spews lies about January 6, about classified documents, about his efforts to overturn the election. He said it's OK by him. If America default on its debt, called the Capitol police officer a thug, and said yes, he meant it. When he said, if you're rich and famous, you can grab women wherever you want.Plus, the pandemic emergency ends, and a giant new test begins. Right now, there's a massive number of migrants waiting on the southern border. As time runs out tonight on the Title 42 policy, they've made it easier to turn them away. And today, Ukraine gets a big battlefield delivery, cruise missiles from the U.K. President Zelenskyy says, he will win the war before the next U.S. election. Trump's townhall comments underscore the urgency there. Trump refusing to say who should win or if Vladimir Putin is a war criminal. Up first for us, we start right there with Donald Trump is unending lies and the audience laughter and cheers that speak volumes about his grip on today's Republican Party. His first answer at last night's CNN townhall was illuminating, a lie, and a lie that proves he cannot or will not quit his 2020 election fantasy. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, 45TH U.S. PRESIDENT: I think that when you look at that result, and when you look at what happened during that election, unless you're a very stupid person, you see what happens. That was a rigged election. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Mr. Trump also lied about his efforts to overturn that election and about his border wall. He mocked a woman a jury just this week, said Mr. Trump sexually abused and defamed. There was some important policy news. He said it would be fine by him if the country defaults on its debts. He may revive if elected again family separations at the border. And he was intentionally vague about if he would sign a federal abortion ban.Now CNN is offering townhalls to all credible candidates for president, and whatever your views of Mr. Trump, he is the far away early Republican front runner. Last night, his twisted take on democracy was quite clear. Elections are only honest, if he wins. He at one point pulled out his January 6 tweets and he offered to go sentence by sentence through his words insisting his conduct that day was defensible. Also defensible, in his view, was the conduct of all but a few of those who attack the Capitol hoping to block certification of Joe Biden's win. Given the chance, Trump said he would pardon most of the rioters. He called them people quote, with love in their heart. I'm sorry, this is not what love looks like. (PLAYING VIDEO) We know those images can cause a lot of people pain. We think it is important because of how he characterized that day last night to remind everybody of what that day was in reality. With me in studio to share their reporting and their insights, CNN's Lauren Fox, Zolan Kanno-Youngs of the New York Times, Axios's Margaret Talev, and CNN's Jeff Zeleny. One of the questions even in the audience, the pro Republican audience last night was why do you keep asking about 2020? Well, we keep asking about 2020 because democracy is the foundation of everything. And he keeps lying about 2020. He's a candidate, the leading Republican candidate in 2024. And Kaitlan Collins asked him last night, would he accept if he's the Republican nominee? Will he accept the results? Win or lose? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I just think that that was such a remarkable and insightful moment into the fact that he has not changed, and his views of that day have not changed.

We know what he's going to be like.The question is, are voters different? Have voters learned anything along this way? And we will see the audience without question. We've all spent a lot of time in New Hampshire. There is a strain there of certainly Donald Trump supporters, but he lost New Hampshire in the general election quite significantly, to Joe Biden. He wanted it very, very lost it narrowly to Hillary Clinton. So, the reality is there were Trump supporters and that does not mean every Republican out there believes this or would laugh at this. Of course, that's not the case. One thing that the audience did not -- we did not see in the audience is the exhaustion that I hear from Republican voters in every state that I traveled to, that they are ready to move on from the drama of Donald Trump. So, you know, not surprising that he demeaned and be literally E. Jean Carroll there.
