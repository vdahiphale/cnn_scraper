And today, jurors are hearing from two people who handled the accounts at The Trump Organization. Right now, Deborah Tarasoff is on the stand, another longtime Trump employee. Wolf?",

The prosecution says those checks were part of a falsified paper trail to cover up reimbursements for the Stormy Daniels hush money deal. I want to go to CNN's Elie Honig. He's over at the \"Magic Wall\" for us. Elie, take us through what Deb Tarasoff, another accountant who worked at Trump - for The Trump Organization is talking about now and how it ties back into the testimony from the former Trump organization executive, Jeffrey McConney, who also testified earlier today.",

Richard, thanks so much for joining us. Court was dramatic right from the start today with Judge Merchan finding the former president in contempt for violating the gag order once again for a 10th time. He imposed another $1,000 fine on Trump and even threatened to send him to jail - jail, if he violates - if the violations continue. So first of all, what's your reaction to that?",

And the truth is Donald Trump has been pushing the boundaries about whether he even recognizes the rule of law. He feels somewhat accurately that he is in contempt of the court.So I think it's an interesting dynamic here with a defendant, which most defendants obviously come into court with some of this deference to the authority of the court. Donald Trump doesn't feel that at all. So it's this struggle. And I think it really is going to play out depending upon whether he gets on the stand to testify.",

It's kind of like a jigsaw puzzle where they're just trying to put pieces together to really create a picture for the jury.I think there's clearly a theme that the prosecution is going for, which is Trump is involved. He has knowledge about everything. He has control over everything. And I think the - obviously, the defense is trying to lay a foundation to saying, look, this is the - during the middle of the campaign and this is not really what he's focused on at all. And I think one of the key pieces today also was that there was a lot of chaos in the 2017 period when he actually - when the - these recordings are made and so that - he really isn't aware of this. But the problem here is that Trump is very controlling and you have two financial people on this jury who are also looking very carefully at the financial aspects.

But we are learning is that an American soldier who was stationed in South Korea traveled to Russia of his own volition, where he was arrested on May 2nd by Russian authorities on suspicion of theft. Now, we don't know exactly what the circumstances of that arrest were. All we know at this point is that he is currently being detained in pretrial detention until at least July 1st, according to two U.S. officials.Now, the U.S. embassy in Moscow, they are trying to get consular access to this American soldier, and we are told that his family has been made aware of his detention. Furthermore, the White House said just moments ago that they're also aware of the case, but they referred, of course, questions to the Department of Defense here for any additional information. Now, obviously, this is a very, very sensitive moment for U.S.-Russia relations, particularly when it comes to those hostage negotiations. There are several hostages that the U.S. has deemed wrongfully detained, Americans being held in Russia currently, of course, including Evan Gershkovich and Paul Whelan. And so Russia now has added, it seems, yet another detainee to that list of Americans that the United States is going to have to determine whether or not this individual was wrongfully detained and take the appropriate steps from there to try to get him back. But, of course, this is not welcome news for anyone here in the U.S. who have been trying so hard as is to try to get the Americans who are already in the Russian prison system back home. Brianna?",

And two, to what extent can they impute that to Donald Trump? To what extent was Donald Trump aware of this specific mechanism? Who came up with it, by the way?

Now, a bunch of testimony came out that number one, he signs every check, that his signature's on it, and that these were coded to be, as Deborah Tarasoff had received, as legal expenses. Now, there's a little bit of a jump that jurors have to make there, but it's not that far of a leap given the kinds of things that we know about this quote unquote small business as we knew it.
