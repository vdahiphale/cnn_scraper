Neither side will confirm whether the deposition took place. Murdoch would be the most high- profile person to have to answer questions about the case under oath. It was just days after that election that lawyers supporting, then- President Donald Trump, began spreading unsubstantiated claims that an American company, Dominion Voting Systems, had rigged the election. They said Dominion was backed by Venezuela and that its machines and software switched millions of votes, from Donald Trump, to Joe Biden. They never showed any evidence. But that didn't stop pro-Trump attorneys, from making baseless claims, or conservative news networks, from giving them plenty of airtime. Dominion has filed eight lawsuits, seeking more than $10 billion, in damages, against Fox News, and other networks, corporations and individuals. But Dominion's CEO, John Poulos, has remained largely silent, until now. We spoke with him, recently, about the lawsuits, the lies, and the irreparable damage, he says, they've caused, to his company, and his employees. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

O'SULLIVAN (voice-over): While Gabriel Nicholas, who has studied de- amplification, says transparency is a good thing, there are some cases, where it is better to not inform a user, their account is being limited, such as the case of serial harassers. DR. JOAN DONOVAN, HARVARD KENNEDY SCHOOL: We look at the kinds of accounts that Twitter has de-amplified, or banned, over the last two or three years, it tends to be accounts that will post things that are both novel, and outrageous, and detrimental, in some way, to society, whether it's through hate, harassment or incitement. O'SULLIVAN (on camera): So, what is de-amplification? Well, sometimes, you open your Twitter feed, you're not just seeing the latest tweets. What you're seeing is the algorithm, recommending to accounts, and tweets, at things, you might be interested in. Now, let's imagine Twitter is Times Square. People here can say whatever they want to, whoever they want. But sometimes, the algorithm might pick up the more interesting comments, and tweets, and highlight them on some of the billboards. But if you're blacklisted, you're never going to get your comments, or tweets, up on these billboards. And that is what some people understand, to be shadow banning.",

He shows me his military booklet, with a stamp, signed by the Commander of the 64th Motor Rifle Brigade, Colonel Azatbek Omurbekov, known in Ukraine, as the \"Butcher of Bucha.\" Chibrin says he and his comrades were given shoot-to-kill orders, even though Russia has denied any wrongdoing, by its forces, around Kyiv. CHIBRIN (through translator): We had a direct command to murder those who divulged our positions. If someone had a phone, we were allowed to shoot him. PLEITGEN (voice-over): Chibrin says the unit was deployed to Belarus, shortly before the invasion, allegedly, for training. The soldiers had no idea they would soon advance into Ukraine. And he says, they weren't prepared for war. CHIBRIN (through translator): Everyone thought they could be like Rambo. Those who said, \"I will be shooting Ukrainians, easily, piece of cake,\" when they went to the frontline, and then they came back, they were like \"We don't want no war.\" PLEITGEN (voice-over): Chibrin says he too came under Ukrainian artillery shelling, and showed us this video, from near the town, Lipovka (ph), west of Kyiv. He tells me he refused to fight because he was opposed to the war, and that his commanders called him a coward, and reassigned him to menial labor tasks, in the rear echelon. He says he didn't witness the mass killings the unit is accused of, but did witness plenty of crimes, against Ukrainian civilians, including looting. PLEITGEN (on camera): They weren't trying to hide it. They did this very openly.",

And he's certainly living accordingly, in Europe.And one of the reasons, we saw there, in the report that he's not communicating, with his daughter, right now, which he says hurts him very much, is for safety reasons. He says, first of all, he doesn't want to communicate too much, with his family, because he's afraid the Russians might find him then. But also, of course, that they could pressure his family back at home as well. And of course, he's seen also what's happened to some other Russians, who were in exile, people who were poisoned, some who were killed. So, certainly he's definitely extremely concerned, and trying to play it as safe as possible, Anderson.",
