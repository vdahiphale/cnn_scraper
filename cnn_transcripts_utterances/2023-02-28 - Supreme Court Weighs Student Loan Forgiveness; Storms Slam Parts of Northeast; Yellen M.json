You know, on the surface, these nine justices might seem kind of detached from this kind of problem. You know, they're all -- most are wealthy. Most are graduates of the ivy league schools, but they all have their distinct experience with having to pay for college and finance it. And I'll just start with someone like Justice Clarence Thomas, who grew up in Georgia in modest means. And he wrote about his own loan burden back in a 2007 memoir. He had gone to Holy Cross for undergrad with some tuition help from the school, but then when he was at Yale, he had to take out loans. He said he and his young family, at the time, were really struggling with the bills. And the loans he took out, Jim, from Yale, he was still paying off when he became a Supreme Court justice in 1991 at age 43. You know, sometimes we do think about young people shouldering a lot of this burden, but as Rene pointed out, it's people who themselves have become parents and grandparents shouldering it.",

But then let's take some of the other justices who were lucky enough to be able to finance their own education but now have children. Justice Amy Coney Barrett has seven kids, some of them college age, who she's paying for to go to college.

Indeed, 100 years ago the court said we actually don't usually want states to be the lead plaintiffs because otherwise that will mean every single policy gets challenged in court right away. That's not the state's job. So, one of the things really swirling around these cases today is whether the conservative justices, because of their skepticism of this program, are actually going to be inclined to allow states like Nebraska, Missouri, to lead challenges to this kind of policy. And, Jim, if they do, it's only a matter of time before we'll see an explosion in states from across the political spectrum, attorneys general from across the political spectrum, seeing it as their job, basically the day any new federal policy comes out, to march into the nearest federal courthouse.",

This is - they're calling it the most significant measurable snowfall in New York City this winter. Up until last night, Central Park had seen less than half an inch. Now, as of 7:00 a.m., it has snowed 1.8 inches, bringing the snowfall total for this winter so far to a grand total of 2.2 inches. Now, usually, Central Park has seen 2 feet of snow by now in winter. So this is the lowest seasonal snowfall on record. But as you mentioned, not nearly as bad as it could be. We're seeing sloppy roads, messy commutes. But in other parts of the country, we've seen records. Milwaukee saw just over 2 inches of rainfall, and that's a new record as of Monday.
