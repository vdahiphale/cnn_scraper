Texas Governor Greg Abbott, however, has been pushing for a pardon. Perry's attorneys are asking the judge to sentence him to 10 years, prosecutors though are seeking at least 25 years in prison. Perry shot and killed 28- year-old Garrett Foster at a racial justice protest in Austin in 2022.CNN's Lucy Kafanov is now with us on the story. Yesterday, we heard from several witnesses including Foster's fiance. What are we expected to hear today about this?",

Now, prosecutors say that Perry who was stationed in Fort Hood in 2020, he had a side hustle as an Uber driver. They say he initiated this encounter by running a red light and turning his car into the crowd that was gathered at that protest where he then shot Foster. Now, in closing arguments yesterday, prosecutors cited Perry's numerous racist social media posts and text messages in which he advocated for violence to make the case that he remains a danger to the community and should have a more-strict sentencing.
