Welcome to CNN Tonight.We have much more on the biggest story of this night. The Supreme Court, of course, protecting access to a widely used abortion drug by freezing lower court rulings that restricted its usage. It's a big victory for the Biden administration. It is far from the end, though. The ruling means the appeals process now will play out and it is almost guaranteed the case will eventually land back before the justices. In the meantime, though, the FDA approval of Mifepristone stands as does current access. Plus, turmoil in the NFL tonight, three players suspended indefinitely, two others slapped with a six-game ban. So, what they do, is the punishment fair. And it wouldn't be a Friday night here without a news quiz. See if you know more about what happened this week than our distinguished panelists. Here is my panel tonight, Defense Attorney Misty Marris, John Avlon, our senior political analyst, former Democratic Congressman Max Rose, Jessica Washington from The Root, and joining us, Republican Strategist and Pollster Kristen Soltis Anderson. We do begin, though, this hour with CNN Justice Correspondent Jessica Schneider. So, Jessica, take us through in terms of the court's ruling. What does it do?",

But in the end, the Supreme Court did step in tonight to protect full access to the abortion pill, Mifepristone, while this appeals process plays out.So, what does it mean? Well, it means status quo for the administration of Mifepristone. That means women can continue to take it up to ten weeks pregnant, they can continue to receive it by mail and via telehealth visits with their health care providers and the generic version will still continue to be widely available. So, this is actually exactly what the Biden administration, the FDA, what they were asking for and pushing for. In fact, they warned that if those restrictions were imposed on the drug at this point, there would just be chaos and confusion. So, now, all of that has been avoided, and, Erica, the appeals process will start playing out in the Fifth Circuit court in New Orleans with briefs next week and then oral arguments in less than a month and May 17th.",

But because of the way this order structured, we actually don't know exactly how the other seven justices voted, if there were other dissents, only that five justices were needed to grant this stay, which, of course, they got.But Justice Alito did write that four-page dissent. And in it, he makes some arguments. He says, you know, the Supreme Court has previously been criticized for granting these types of stays, you know, these holds on lower court decisions. So, he's asking, why, fellow justices, are you willing to grant a stay now in these circumstances, especially because he's arguing there would not be any harm, in his words, if they let these restrictions go into effect. So, he wrote this. At present, applicants are not entitled to a stay because they have not shown that they are likely to suffer irreparable harm in the interim. But what's really interesting here, Erica, is that the FDA made a big argument that there would be major harm if these restrictions went into effect, with women not being able to fully access the drug, the chaos, they said, in the way that the changes would be made, to the way it was administered. But Justice Alito sort of disputing that that would actually happen. He said at one point, the FDA could just choose not to enforce those restrictions if they had taken effect. So, really a big dissent from Justice Alito with four pages of writing, and that might have been what took a little bit long to get this final decision here. Erica?",

That's a judgment of them being strategic. Previously, they said, well, you're going to go to space and then you're going to solve the border, and then they set her up to fail.

And that's probably a good thing for questions about the legitimacy of the court, et cetera, but also the more this is in the headlines, the more political peril, I think, Republicans have faced. You know, if you think back to a Supreme Court ruling around something like gay marriage, when they decided the Obergefell case, that was something that took a political hot button, and it took it off the table. It said the Supreme Court has made a ruling and no longer were Republicans really getting asked the same kinds of questions as often about, well, what do you define as marriage, et cetera. In this case with the fall of Roe versus Wade, with its overturning in the Dobbs case, it put abortion back on the political agenda, and Republicans, in my view, have been pretty flatfooted in their messaging on this.

If you fly a lot. Well, I'll protect the forest. A lot of times, you don't know if that forest is not going to burn or if it wasn't gonna be cut down anyway. And so, these kinds of ideas are verifiable. We know exactly how much he's pumping back down into the ground. That's his argument. If you can get the cost down, and we're going to pay for it as a society, that's sort of the next step. But I also talked to folks who want to spray sunscreen in the sky, high in the stratosphere.

On the night, the Supreme Court has protected access to a widely-used abortion drug by freezing lower court rulings that place restrictions on medication abortion. It's important to note this is not the end here. So, what does it mean? Well, it means the appeals process still has to play out. It's almost guaranteed, though, that the case will land back before the justices. In the meantime, however, it also means that the FDA's approval of the drug Mifepristone remains in place.My panel is here, but first, I do want to check in with CNN Justice Correspondent Jessica Schneider, as well as, Senior Medical Correspondent Elizabeth Cohen. Good to see both of you, tonight. So, Jessica, first of all, take us through this ruling, and what the decision actually means tonight. Jessica Schneider, CNN Justice Correspondent: Yes, So, Erica. This means that full access to Mifepristone will remain. As you mentioned, those -- that appeals process plays out. So, what that means practically, women can continue to take this up to 10 weeks pregnant. They can continue to receive it by mail. They can also get it prescribed via telehealth visits with their health care providers. And also, the generic version, it's gonna remain available. So, this is exactly what the Biden administration was asking for. They wanted this stay in effect, so these restrictions didn't take effect, and they warned that if there were restrictions imposed on the drug at this point, they said, there would be confusion and chaos. So, really now, all of that has been avoided and this appeals process will play out in a pre-speedy fashion in the Fifth Circuit. We've got briefs due next week and then arguments in less than a month on May 17th. Erica.",

You know, their approval is still there tonight. But what are the concerns about that process and the FDA's authority moving forward?",
