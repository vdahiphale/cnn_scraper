For the first time,we are getting some signs that Joe Biden may be wavering about whether to stay in the race for president. President Biden has told a close ally that he knows he may not be able to save his candidacy in the wake of that poor performance in last week's debate on CNN. CNN has learned that Biden is pinning his hopes on several key events over the next few days, including an interview with ABC News on Friday. He also has a meeting tonight with Democratic governors who are concerned that his debate performance has doomed his campaign. Let's go now to the White House and CNN's Arlette Saenz is standing by with more. So, Arlette, just walk us through what more we know about this conversation that President Biden had with an ally about the fact that he may not be able to save his reelection bid come the end of this week.",

This ally relayed that the president is clear-eyed and is aware of what could help him determine whether his efforts to save his reelection campaign are working or not. This ally telling CNN that the one scenario in which perhaps the president's attempts might not be working would be, quote, if the polls are plummeting, the fundraising is drying up and the interviews are going badly. This person added he's not oblivious. You've seen President Biden and his team both privately and publicly really try to reassure voters that he is up for a second term in office. But it comes as you've started to see these cracks within the Democratic coalition. Just yesterday, Congressman Lloyd Doggett of Texas became the first lawmaker to publicly call for President Biden to step aside in this race. There are other congressional Democrats who have openly said that they believe Biden would lose against Trump in November. And then there are concerns among many Democrats about what keeping Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket could mean for his own candidates, not just for his own candidacy, but also the impact it could have on Democrats in competitive House and Senate races. Now, the Biden -- President Biden, privately behind the scenes, has started working the phones to key congressional leaders, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, as well as one of his top allies, Senator Chris Coons of Delaware. Those calls are expected to continue throughout the day. And a bit later this evening, he will have a meeting here at the White House with Democratic governors who have expressed concern behind, privately, about President Biden's performance in that debate. Now, the president's also sketching out a public schedule where he can try to make his arguments to voters. He will have a major sit-down interview with ABC News on Friday. And then he will also be traveling to Wisconsin on Friday and Philadelphia on Sunday, two key battleground states. But here at the White House and on the campaign, they have really doubled down on the fact that President Biden is remaining in this race. Just yesterday, Karine -- White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre fielded many questions about the president's debate performance and his health at this moment. Take a listen to what she had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  The medical team said it is not warranted in this case. We have put forward a thorough, transparent annual report on his health. So, they have said that is not warranted. It is not necessary. Again, we understand. We understand. We're not taking away from what you all saw or what the American people saw. We understand. It was a bad night. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And so, Biden's really trying to, one, go out there, convince voters that he is up to a second term. But then we are also seeing the campaign really trying to refocus attention to centering this race against Donald Trump. That is something that they've been eager to do in recent days, especially in the wake of that Supreme Court ruling relating to presidential immunity. This morning, the campaign rolled out a new advertisement criticizing not just Donald Trump, but also the Supreme Court. So, that is something, from their messaging standpoint, that they really want to try to draw attention to, even as so much of the thunder or so much of the conversation recently has been focused on President Biden himself. And he's really entering this very critical stretch in the coming days where he's going to be answering questions on national television, be in front of voters. And his hope is that he'll be able to quell their concerns to stay in this race come November.",

So, while some of these people, people are talking about governors like Gretchen Whitmer or Gavin Newsom of California, are very skilled politicians, were they to walk into the tsunami of a presidential election campaign, they would never have experienced anything like it. The issue here, though, is that is a great risk, as you say. But is the bigger risk sticking with the president if it seems like there's no way he can beat Donald Trump? Because we know that a second Trump presidency would be like nothing we've ever seen before. So, it's almost like this is a colossal mess for Democrats, whatever happens in the next few days.",

I remember sort of four years ago, there was just so much excitement around Kamala Harris, you know, woman vice president, woman of color, a black woman at that, you know, child of immigrants.

Many people before Kamala Harris have found it difficult to adapt, to carve out a lane. I think you can make an argument that the White House in many ways didn't really help her that much. It gave her an assignment to try and fix the immigration problem, people coming from overseas into the United States. That is a real poison chalice, and that exposed her to a lot of early attacks from Republicans. But it's true, she isn't, if you look at her approval ratings, very popular at all. I don't think if there was an open contest for the nomination that she would necessarily win it, you know, if it was, you know, all fair and square and she wasn't anointed. So, she has that problem. Her campaign in 2016, in 2020, wasn't very successful -- her presidential campaign, and she didn't have a deft political touch. Having said that, lately, I think there have been signs that she has been adapting to the role quite well. She was very effective in defending the president immediately after the debate. So, politicians also evolve, and if she was the person in the situation, maybe she would rise to the challenge, to the moment of her life. I don't think you can really know until it happens.",

I mean, there is a widespread -- I mean, I've talked in the last few days to prominent pollsters and strategists, the leaders of multiple Democratic constituency groups, top fundraisers, members of Congress, and there is a widespread belief, you know, glung belief, Zain, that by this, this is -- this is an all likelihood not recoverable from -- for Biden. Don't forget the only reason this debate existed was because his campaign recognized it had to change the dynamic. They went into this needing to improve because they were not on a trajectory to win. And of course, instead of improving his position, it magnified the problem. I saw high quality private polling last night that had him trailing beyond the margin of error in Michigan and Pennsylvania which are the states that are most likely to be the tipping point in the election. So, that conviction is out there. It's been, you know, people have been frozen from saying that in public for a variety of reasons, including concerns about whether Harris would be a better candidate. But I think that logjam is starting to break, both in terms of people expressing publicly what they are saying privately about Biden, but also even among Harris critics, a sense that turning to her better option despite all the risks that entails. But isn't this a lose-lose? I mean, just speaking to our Stephen Collinson about this as well, just the risk of sort of staying with Biden this late in the game, you know, risking it all despite the debate -- debate performance we saw last week, obviously very painful to watch. Some people that I know described it as actually quite sad to watch versus then having someone who is untested in the presidential role.

But continuing with Biden at this point, at least for a growing number of Democrats, looks like, you know, that there's no way to overcome what voters saw. At least with another candidate, you would be kind of shuffling the deck. And I also think, at least in the last 48 hours, you know, there are other, there are certainly many in the party who would prefer that if Biden steps aside, that the party go past Harris as well, because of concern in particular about whether she can win enough white working class voters in the Rust Belt states. But I think that even many who believe that are starting to conclude that if you can somehow scale the first mountain of kind of, you know, nudging Biden out of the race, scaling another mountain by bypassing her in a contest that would be so racially fraught within the party might be too much. And it seems to me possible that the figures who are seen as a potentially better general election bet than her, like Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, would choose not to challenge her if Biden steps aside because of the risk of, you know, experiencing damage in their own long-term brand in the black community.

I mean, they have an ironclad in their support of Biden, but certainly, no one of great consequence has called for him to step aside. You know, most people are putting their hopes in polling that shows him slipping of the kind that I saw, that prompts, in particular, the seven Democratic Senate candidates running in states that he is now at high risk to lose, to put pressure, as well as the House Democrats in competitive districts, who I am told, quote, are \"melting down\". And the hope is that those vulnerable members pressure the party leadership in the Congress to put pressure on him in the White House. It is worth noting for audiences that in the last two presidential years, 2016 and 2020, exactly one senator out of 66 has won a race in a state that voted the other way for president. So, those seven Democrats in states where Biden is at real risk are absolutely on the front line of this, as is the prospect that Republicans could establish a big enough Senate majority that it would be very hard for Democrats to overturn it anytime in this decade. So, the stakes could not be higher. Ultimately, I think Democrats are pretty pessimistic about their ability to influence this decision, but it's, you know, it's clear that there is at least some fluidity now after that sense of paralysis in the first few days following the debate.",

It's that where does he go to get those last tens of thousands of votes that he needs to win Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, which are his really his only realistic path at this point in 270 Electoral College votes, the Southeast swing states, Georgia, North Carolina, the Southwest swing states, Nevada and Arizona look out of reach.

I think that, you know, what you have here is really astory about the sort of, in five chapters, each of them defined by one of the successive leaders that we've had of the Conservative Party over the last 14 years. So, with Cameron, you start off with the whole context of Brexit and ultimately capitulating towards that far right fringe of the department, which ended up defying his prime ministership. And ultimately he stepped down because he had not supported withdrawing from the European Union. And then with Theresa May, trying to sort of get the process done. She called a general election, lost the majority, closed a range of vote no confidence votes, and ultimately Boris Johnson was able to win a historic election on one single issue, the issue of Brexit. But by the time he eventually forced a withdrawal at a time when the U.K. needed such desperate leadership during the COVID pandemic, he failed dramatically, passing and imposing rules on people that he did not respect himself. I think that by the time we thought things had hit really rough bottom. Then along came Prime Minister Trust, of course only lasted seven minutes. And of course, by the time Rishi Sunak came in, it's five-point plan to train to sort of ship around with a general election coming along, it's too much too late. And I think you're absolutely right, that this election is really about holding them accountable for their 14 years in power rather than 14 years star.",

TheConservative Party is going to have to really do some soul searching. And what's interesting about this election is that the Reform U.K. party has really emerged as a factor. You think about what happened in 2019. They didn't even win one single seat. Nigel Farage really rebranded it. And so if you were disillusioned with the Conservative Party, but you still had issues when it came to the U.K.'s immigration policies, Reform U.K. was the way you go in this time around in these elections. Just talk to us a bit more about whether or not the Conservative Party's sort of policies will move more to the right or more to the sort of center right as a result of these elections.",

That's according to \"The Washington Post\", whose sources say the rules against charging or prosecuting a sitting president would not kick in until inauguration day in January 2025. A New York judge postponed Trump's sentencing in his hush money case until mid-September to consider Monday's ruling by the Supreme Court on presidential immunity. Let's go to CNN's Katelyn Polantz. So, aside from the fact that you've got a Justice Department policy against prosecuting a sitting president, there's also the fact that Donald Trump, once he becomes president, could click his fingers and make these cases go away, even going so far as to pardon himself. Just take us through that.",

He shouldn't have to face charges, that all of the charges, including the conviction in New York State against him, not a federal case at all, that that should be dismissed because the immunity decision and there should be a sentencing that is not even happening right now except for September.",
