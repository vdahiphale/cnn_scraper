First with the House, the party with at least 218 seats that will be the majority in the House. Republicans leading with about 195 seats at this hour. They need to win 19 competitive seats to gain control. Democrats have 176 at this point.Let's check the Senate now. The balance of power there. The chamber still hangs in the balance. Republicans still hoping to gain control of the Senate and at this moment all eyes are on four Senate races, Wisconsin, Nevada, Georgia, and Arizona. There are still no projections in those races. In Nevada Senator Catherine Cortez Masto, the Democrat, leading at this hour. In Wisconsin Democrat Mandela Barnes trails Republican Senator Ron Johnson. And in Arizona where incumbent Mark Kelly is facing Blake Masters, right now they are separated by -- get this -- about 140,000 votes. Let's head to Georgia now. Republican Herschel Walker and incumbent Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock, they are very, very, very close and we've got new votes in. We'll head to John Berman in a bit. If no candidate gets to 50 -- 50 percent of the votes, that race could go to a runoff. Secretary of State there already projecting that. In Pennsylvania, a huge night for Democrat John Fetterman. CNN is projecting that he has defeated Mehmet Oz, the famous TV doctor. This is after Fetterman had a stroke on the campaign trail, recovered and then of course, an endorsement from Oprah Winfrey.

An hour ago, it was more than 200,000 votes. That's just the way it goes. They're counting more ballots maybe more election day ballots there in Maricopa County, which is where Phoenix is. This is a County that Joe Biden carried by 2 points. You can now see Mark Kelly leads by about nearly 8 points there. So, still outperforming Joe Biden but the margin getting smaller and smaller.Pima County, which is Tucson, Mark Kelly again. Way up there, he's up by 33 points. We just saw a bunch of new votes counted there. This was a County that went to Joe Biden by 18 points. And, again, we saw Mohave County here, this is a Republican County, a vastly Republican County, a County that Donald trump one by 51. Now Blake Masters leads there by about 30,000 votes. The margin much tighter in the Senate race. Let me just give you the governor's race here. You can see Katie Hobbs with 51 percent, Kari Lake at 48 percent.",

Still could go either way.Nearby in Nevada right now, just 615 votes separate Adam Laxalt and Catherine Cortez Masto. We have a couple counties which skew Republican. These are heavily Republican counties. Donald Trump won these by 10,000 votes each. We have 0 votes in. So again, the Republican Adam Laxalt will pick up votes there. But Clark County, which makes up almost 75 percent of the vote. The vote remaining, yes there's 84 percent of the vote remaining is largely mail vote which they can count until Saturday and that skews heavily Democratic. So, we may not know in Nevada for some time. We did get some new votes counted in Georgia. Remember Don, what was the last time we spoke between the two men? It was 11,000 votes. Now Raphael Warnock, the incumbent Democrat, leads by 18,000 votes but he's grown his lead, he's grown his lead. He leads by half a percent. But the issue is he's only at 49.2. The magic number in Georgia is 50 plus 1 vote -- 50 percent +1 vote. If Raphael Warnock doesn't get there, there will be a runoff on December 6th. And the way things are going right now, if the way things are going, that could be decisive if Adam Laxalt was able to hang on in Arizona. Ron Johnson, we haven't called Wisconsin yet or projected Wisconsin yet. But he's been ahead by a point for some time now. If Ron Johnson wins in Wisconsin and if Mark Kelly hangs on as the Democrat in Arizona, then control of the U.S. Senate will go down to the runoff in Georgia on December 5th.",

Of course, we have covered over the last several weeks the concerns over drop boxes and security around those. Well, we know that the drop boxes will not be counted. We're now past election day, we're into the following morning. They could take until Thursday to count and where are they?Of course, and the most populous counties we've got down here, Clark County where we've got Las Vegas, the most populous county is the state. And then up here in Washoe County where Reno is and in much smaller Douglas County. Again, there is no way to know how many ballots have been dropped into those boxes but those will be counted over the next several days. And while we're here, let's take a tour through Wisconsin. We're told that there are fewer than 12,000 votes to count in the Milwaukee County. That does not mean there are 12,000 votes left to report. These votes that will be counted will, with the next tranche of reported votes there. But 12,000 there in Milwaukee County. In Arizona, the estimate there in Maricopa County, most populous county there with the biggest tranche of voters across the state, it'll take until Friday to count all of those ballots. Of course, at the top of this hour getting those new results, as John reported, from Arizona and the very tight governor and Senate races there. And in Georgia where the prediction from Gabe Sterling with the Secretary of State's office, that's a prediction from the state, not a projection from CNN is that that race between Warnock and Walker will go to that December 6th runoff. What we're learning from Columbia County, a big amount of votes still out there is all the early votes from Columbia. It's about 33,500. But as we saw from the math that John just showed us, still so many votes out in the Atlanta metro area we are waiting for. So, that's what we're getting the latest of where the votes are, the count and when we should expect those results.",

Most of the state has already counted at least 89 percent of the vote. These are the counties have got less than that. You can see, for instance right here, is Clayton County, which is a heavily Democratic county. They're at 87 percent. Raphael Warnock you would imagine would expand his lead some there.Then the rest of the counties, it gets pretty small. I like Sumter County, why? Hometown of Jimmy Carter. Plains, Georgia, Raphael Warnock's got a very small lead there with about five points. That's what Joe Biden did. That's at 87 percent. So, some of these counties down here Raphael Warnock could grow a little bit. Dougherty County right there he's got 11,000 vote lead, just 81 percent in. And he's outperforming what Joe Biden was there. There are some Republican parties still here but fairly small. Echols County and you can see the votes here are in the hundreds, right, there's votes to be counted there but not much room for Herschel Walker to expand. But we talk about this. And the important thing I think you remember, again, Raphael Warnock can be ahead of Herschel Walker by any amount but if he's not it 50 percent it's still going to a runoff on December 6. So",

Arizona, Mark Kelly the incumbent 52.4 percent to Blake Masters, the Republican trying there was trying to win from the incumbent, 45.4 percent. But here's the interesting part. That has shrunk just over the last couple of minutes. We're going to head to Georgia now. Let's go to Georgia. Everyone is watching that race in Georgia. This is where Raphael Warnock has 49.2 percent of the vote and Herschel Walker has 48.7 percent of the vote.

Mandela Barnes, 49.3 percent of the vote. 94 percent of the estimated vote in right now. That could shrink a little bit but we have to see where the outstanding votes are.
