Fourteen people killed when a pickup truck rammed through a crowd of people on Bourbon Street early New Years Day. Officials had originally said that 15 had been killed. Law enforcement identifying the suspect as 42-year-old Army veteran Shamsud-Din Jabbar of Texas. He was killed in a firefight with police.CNN obtained this exclusive video showing the driver shortly before the attack. You can see him putting something in the bed of the truck and working on the hitch. Investigators say an ISIS flag was among one of the things that he placed in the truck. According to President Joe Biden, explosives were found in ice coolers in two other locations in the French Quarter, and the suspect had a remote detonator in his vehicle. A law enforcement official familiar with the investigation telling CNN that FBI agents and local police found chemicals, typically used to construct explosives, at the attacker's home in Houston. Plus, another investigation on the other side of the country. Law enforcement looking into an explosion in a Tesla Cybertruck that also occurred on New Years Day. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas says there's nothing linking the two incidents yet. However, both men seemingly involved had military ties and both vehicles were rented through their website, Turo. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

However, the similarities are remarkable, shall we say. What do you see in it, particularly the fact that, you know, these are both ex, you know, well, one active duty military, but people with - both people with military experience and training? DONELL HARVIN, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY'S EMERGENCY AND DISASTER MANAGEMENT: I hate to - I always get in trouble when I link military to extremism, but we've been talking about this since 2018 when I ran the Fusion (ph) Center here in D.C., the intelligence center, we actually wrote an intelligence product talking about extremism in the ranks of active and retired military. And if you, you know, fast forward to January 6th, you know, 16 percent of those individuals that were arrested and tried for January 6th were active or former military or first responders. And so, we see this radicalization in those individuals that, you know, swear the oath to the Constitution. You know, they're still looking at why these individuals are doing this, but it's something that's been on our radar in the homeland security space for a few years now.",

And so we've only seen this spate of attacks, you know, Fort Hood, things like that, recently. I also think that ISIS and al Qaeda, to a lesser extent, but mostly ISIS appeals so much more. They have so much more outreach. And if you're downtrodden, and I've consumed their products for over ten years, I have to dissect them, I have to train individuals on them, they're very appealing to many people who are downtrodden, who are very angry at individuals.

MOLLY BALL, SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\": I think that the senators are going to have a lot of questions for these nominees about exactly how they are looking at attacks like this, given that they - you know, particularly the New Orleans attack seems to have been, you know, inspired by a foreign ideology, but was not - but did not have, you know, foreign roots. It was essentially a - from what we know so far, a sort of homegrown lone wolf inspired by ISIS. You know, how are - how do they view these kinds of attacks? How do they want to approach them? How do they think that we need to take them on? Presumably it is not a military invasion of Syria. But short of that, you know, what is the strategy? Because, you know, we saw Trump repeating misinformation about this attack initially, trying to blame it on immigration, trying to blame it on the border. That was not the case. So, are, ,you know - you know, you heard Mike Waltz talking about, you know, the narrative that the administration puts forward about these attacks. I think we need to hear from the various cabinet appointees how they are conceptualizing this problem and how they plan to approach it.

The stunning losses that we've had, the fact that our brand is so badly battered that the hardest working people in America lost sight of us, thought we were more for elites than we were for them. This requires a time of change. And I believe that I have the ability to be that change agent. If you want a caretaker, if you want a state chair, somebody that understands state parties, I mean, certainly I understand that having been a governor, had to make my own party stronger. But I believe there's a skill set that's required for this moment of profound change that's actually bigger than any state chair has the power to offer. I am a turnaround - operational turnaround leader. Probably the best in our party, which is why the president dispatched me to Social Security. Secondly, I've actually chaired a national committee, unlike the other fine people in this race, the Democratic governors, where we expanded the map and three years of record fundraising. And third, and finally, I've actually run for office. I have been elected. I have knocked on those doors. I understand what the 36 Democratic governors who are up this year, I understand what those members of Congress who Hakeem Jeffries is counting on taking back the House, what they need in order to have their back to be successful and do the things that we must do, be ruthless about winning the next elections.",

You know, Donald Trump is a master practitioner of the politics of fear. Ours is the party that says, we have nothing to fear but fear itself. We can make tomorrow better than today.

I think it should be the men and women running for courthouse seats and city hall seats. I believe it should be the Democratic mayors of the United States of America. It's interesting, Kasie, you know, I was chair of the Democratic Governors Association and - for three years. And it was during President Obama's re-elect. For a brief, shining moment, we were all communicating, you know, on the same page. But our national party tends to run itself like an exclusive club rather than being cognizant of the fact that the very people that connect us to the economic realities in all 50 states, in all of these big metropolitan economies are mostly Democrats. And it's the Democratic mayors. And we need to make sure that we communicate with the Democratic mayors, with the Democratic governors, bring them together in a - in a sort of battle cadence, a war council, if you will, so we can all get on the same page and communicate to the economic concerns of the American people.
