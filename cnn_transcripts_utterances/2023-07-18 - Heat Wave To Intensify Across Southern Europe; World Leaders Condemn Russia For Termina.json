Already this morning in Athens it's 29 degrees Celsius at 6Temperatures well above 40 degree mark across Spain and Italy as well. Italian authorities have issued a warning to avoid direct sunlight between 11:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. Across Greece, the heat has sparked 81 wildfires. The Civil Protection minister says the day ahead will not be easy for hundreds of firefighters on the frontlines. Heat waves red alerts have been issued for 20 Italian cities, including Venice, Naples and Florence. And CNN's Barbie Nadeau begins our coverage from the Capitol Rome. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BARBIE NADEAU, CNN CONTRIBUTOR (voice over): Summer is here. But across Europe, people are battling the extreme heat just to keep cool. Spain, Italy and Greece are just some of the countries that have been battling the blistering sun for days already. In Italy, authorities issued extreme health warnings, saying that even hotter temperatures are yet to come. And even for locals, it's sweltering. FEDERICO BRATTI, ROME RESIDENT (through translator): This is not normal. I don't remember such intense heat, especially at this time of year. NADEAU (voice over): But that didn't stop people from trying to catch a glimpse of the Pope. As priests nuns, locals and tourists filled out St. Peter's Square dancing around in the heat. One priests from the Democratic Republic of Congo compared Italy's sun to be hotter than Africa. FRANCOIS MBEMBA, PRIEST, DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO (through translator): The heat goes on well into the night and sometimes we even find it hard to sleep. NADEAU (voice over): In Rome zoo, it's feeding time, and workers are giving animals frozen fruits as treats to help keep them cool, a welcome break during the heatwave. Over in Spain, it was a long night for firefighters battling a wildfire in the Canary Islands raging in a dry wooded area. Emergency workers are however not losing hope. JOSE FERNANDEZ, LA PALMA FIREFIGHTER (through translator): It was a bit difficult because of the shifting wind and the heat of the last days. But we're holding on. NADEAU (voice over): Last week, tourists who braved Athens heat did so well stopping by the fountain in Syntagma Square to cool down as temperatures rose above 40 degrees Celsius or 104 degrees Fahrenheit in some areas. These horses also felt the heat after being evacuated from their stables because of wildfires ripping through their home. After extreme heat caused nearly 62,000 deaths in Europe last year, meteorologists are warning that over the next few days, things could get worse in parts of Europe. And this intense and prolonged period of extreme heat could be the new norm. Barbie Latza Nadeau, CNN, Rome. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And the Black Sea Grain Initiative can and should keep operating, if without Russia then without Russia. That was after Russia entered the Green Deal. Russian drones attacked Odessa, Ukraine's major port city on the Black Sea. CNN team there recorded these images of a large explosion in the nighttime sky. Ukrainian officials say air defenses were successful, but they warned several waves of attacks are still expected and missiles could still be incoming. Meantime, fighting is intensifying in the Kharkiv region. Ukraine's military says Russia has grouped some 100,000 soldiers in the Kupyansk region where they're putting everything they have into breaking through Ukrainian defensive lines. They say Russia is desperate to have some success on the battlefield after Ukraine gained momentum around the city of Bakhmut. Still unknown is the attack on Odessa is Russia's retaliation for a strike on the Kerch Bridge early Monday, which damaged the major crossing between Russian occupied Crimea and mainland Russia. Ukrainian minister says the bridge was hit by naval drones. Vladimir Putin is promising payback for what he calls a senseless terrorist act which left two people dead. More details now from CNN's Fred Pleitgen. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Russian investigators at the scene of the blast on the Crimean Bridge that killed the couple driving this car and wounded their daughter, also causing part of the roadway to collapse. Russian President Vladimir Putin irate, vowing revenge. VLADIMIR PUTIN, PRESIDENT OF RUSSIA (through translation): There will be a response from Russia to the terrorist attack on the Crimean Bridge. The Ministry of Defense is preparing relevant proposals. PLEITGEN (voice-over): A source in Ukrainian intelligence acknowledges Kyiv was behind the attack. The Crimean Bridge connects Russia to occupied Crimea. Ukraine says cutting the roadway could hamper the logistics for Moscow's war effort in Ukraine. Analysis of the operational situation and the traditions of warfare allow us to cut off the enemy's logistics routes, the spokesman for the SBU says. The Crimean Bridge is currently one of the transportation corridors for military supplies for the Russian army. It's not the first time the bridge has been hit. In October 2022, a fuel tanker exploded, severely damaging both the road and railway and causing a massive fire. A Ukrainian official only recently explicitly indicating Kyiv's involvement. Russia now also announcing it is canceling a grain deal that had allowed for the safe transport of agricultural goods out of Ukrainian ports. The move could cause havoc on international grain markets, prices already surging. While the Kremlin says ending the deal is not related to the bridge attack, the E.U. and U.S. blasted the move accusing Moscow of weaponizing world hunger.",

And that creates a real problem for the Russians because a considerable portion of their war material that is destined for the southern front goes over that bridge. We do have other ways of getting things to the southern front, but this is one of the main arteries, that's going to be a major issue.As far as securing the bridges concerned. Well, obviously, they've lost a chance to do that already. And they're somewhat of a disadvantage because the Ukrainians have found a way to attack the bridge that has gone seemingly undetected by the Russians. So, we'll see, it's going to be a bit of a losing battle for him in that sense, because the Ukrainians, as long as they have the weapon systems, such as the unmanned surface vehicles that they apparently used in this case, they can mount a pretty big attack. And as far as response options go, the Russians, they can do everything from a major attacks on cities in Ukraine, using their cruise missiles, using munitions, using their drones, especially the ones they have from Iran. And of course, if they still have some hypersonics left, they can use the hypersonic missiles to do that, as well. So, there you have several different options.",
