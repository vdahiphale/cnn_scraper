There -- you know, Victor, there really isn't a roadmap for a circumstance like this, becauseof how remarkable the circumstances are in this is that, as the Attorney General laid out, you have a former president being investigated by the Justice Department. If -- to do this by the book, to conduct these investigations in a way that sort of the textbooks would say to do it, then yes, the Attorney General had to appoint a special counsel here because what you have to do is take out even the appearance of impropriety. Now, look, we all know that and you know, I wasn't born yesterday, and within hours, the record of Jack Smith is going to be picked apart. And he will probably be seen by some or criticized by some as being a partisan political hack or tool. We saw this play out with Robert Mueller several years ago. But the simple fact is removing it from the chain of command, to some extent, as Elliott said, from the Justice Department was very valuable. Look, one more point that I'd make here as an interesting bit of stagecraft, the one person who was not there on that stage was Jack Smith. And that was to give at least the sense of clarity that this is a separate individual from outside the Justice Department who is coming to take this matter over. And it's almost the best of all worlds, at least in the Justice Department's perspective, because number one, as has been said, he gets all of the staff that had been working on this for quite some time. And number two, a future president cannot really fire a special counsel, except there's some extraordinary reason to do so like he literally shows up to work drunk or something like that. The Attorney General just doesn't have the same latitude that he would with a senior political appointee. So, yes, I, you know, I know there are people who might criticize this decision, but it sort of had to be done, regardless of what the President's actions were previously.",

But despite those two wide ranging investigations, the new special counsel, Jack Smith, he's actually been given fairly specific instructions as -- at least as it pertains to January 6th, you know. The Attorney General mentioned it at least twice. And when he came out to talk to reporters, you know, he said that he'll be looking into the potential interference into the transfer of power, the certification of the vote in 2020. So that January 6th investigation that's been ongoing now for almost two years, it has many different facets. The rioters, all of those rioters who had been arrested, charged, we're now seeing the Oath Keepers trial, that will continue to progress under the purview of the U.S. Attorney here in D.C. But it's this very specific question about interference into the transfer of power, the certification. In particular, our team led by Evan Perez has reported that it goes to the heart of these -- this fake electoral scheme where these Trump supporters were fake electors. They wanted to try to disrupt the elect -- electoral count here. So, that's the primary focus of that facet of the investigation. But then the Mar-a-Lago documents investigation, we saw that peak with the FBI search at Mar-a-Lago back in August, but that has been ongoing for several months as well. So you're right, it will take time for this new special counsel to get up to speed here. And the big question is, how quickly will he act? Will this be a wide-ranging investigation or a long investigation, as we've seen with John Dermot -- Durham, especially complicating things, the fact that the former president will be running for president again at the same time this investigation is ongoing from the special counsel. So a lot of outstanding questions here.",

As Kaitlan said that the legal team was dreading this, so was the campaign team. They believe that this could be coming. And we have to continue to say that part of the reason that allies believe that former President Trump was announcing so early, in addition to wanting to freeze the field and get out there was also that he wanted to, as you said, insulate your -- himself and have these legal protections and be able to continue to campaign on the idea that he is the victim of a political witch hunt. This is something that we have heard from him since these investigations began. And we heard it on Tuesday night when we were at his announcement. He referred to himself as a victim multiple times. He said that the Justice Department was weaponized against him. He has continued to talk about the FBI in the same way. And this clearly, as you said, and as Garland said, this was a catalyst not serving as the -- what they had hoped it would do, which was give him back those legal protections. However, I do not think that it seems, at least now, that Trump is going to change his tactics in any way. We know that he has doubled down on this idea that he is a victim, that this is all politics. So, to see him shift away from that in any way seems very unlikely.",

He was one of a number of people killed Wednesday in what state media said was a shooting incident in the southwestern city of Izeh where anti-government protests have been raging for days. Family members say Kian was on his way home with his father when he was shot. The Iranian government says this was a terrorist attack. But activists say Kian is a victim of the regime's ruthless crackdown on protests, one of more than forty children killed since September according to rights groups. Every day for more than 60 days now, Iranians have been burying their dead. More than 300 lives lost in this battle for change. 30-year-old Borhan Karami was shot in the head on Wednesday according to activists. This disturbing video captures the moment a bullet struck him. At Karami's burial, mourners chant, \"Mother, do grieve for your child, we will take his revenge.\" With every funeral, their rage grows, the brutality only fueling their determination to risk it all for regime change. That regime struggling to contain the popular uprising is now sentencing protesters to death. Several have been handed the death penalty this week in what human rights groups say are sham trials, the repressive republic's latest attempt to crush the growing dissent. But nothing seems to be stopping the will of the people. The third month of the uprising began with a new wave of strikes and protests sweeping across the country.

So, this additional strain is put on the system. People -- some people have got some gas supplies, but we know that gas is being targeted as well, communications being hit. The people in the east of the country, who we met not far from the frontlines in the east in the town there of Kramatorsk, were living in basements with perhaps just one tiny heater. Among many of them, one elderly lady we talked to there, told us she'd -- she was born during the Second World War, the terrible conditions, the cold, the starvation conditions. She said she'd survived that, but she worried that she wouldn't survive this winter. She said I might die in this war. The mayor of the town told us that he was worried that people would succumb to the effects of the winter. The old lady I was just mentioning there, when I said to her what happens when the electricity goes off and this little heater that's providing heat for -- in several rooms, one heater for several rooms and dozens of people, what happens when that goes off when there's a power cut? And she said, well, simply just we put a coat on, we wrap ourselves in a blanket, and we go to bed. And it's very hard to see a different outcome for winter at the moment.
