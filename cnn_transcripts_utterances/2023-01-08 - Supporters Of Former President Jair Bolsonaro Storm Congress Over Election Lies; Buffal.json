I'm Pamela Brown in Washington on this Sunday. The top stories for you, just days after the United States marks the second anniversary of the Capitol riot protesters in Brazil who believe their recent presidential election was stolen staged something very similar. And after two years of repeated calls for members of both parties, President Biden visits the southern border for the first time since taking office. Plus teams and fans across the NFL honor Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin. Wait until you see what his team did. You are in the CNN NEWSROOM. A relatively peaceful protest followed by an assault on the halls of Congress. Sound familiar? Well, this is not January 6th two years ago in Washington, D.C. It's happening in Brasilia, the capital of Brazil, today. Devout supporters of the former president Jair Bolsonaro breached security barriers this afternoon. They have spent hours vandalizing Brazil's Congress and Supreme Court and the presidential palace. CNN's Rafael Romo has the latest. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

In the last hour Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva who took office only a week ago reacted to the events describing them as barbaric and calling those responsible for acts of vandalism fanatical fascists. These people he said are everything that is abominable in politics to invade the government headquarters, the headquarters of Congress, and the headquarters of the Supreme Court like true vandals, destroying everything in their path. It started a few hours ago as a peaceful protest in front of the army's headquarters in Brasilia, the capital of Brazil. Then a numerous group of protesters started marching towards the area where government buildings for all three branches of government are located. At one point, protesters stormed the building that Houses the Brazilian Congress before other groups did the same at the Planalto Palace, the seat of the executive power, and the Supreme Court. Initially they clashed with the few government employees who were trying to stop them. There is a video of a man sitting at the desk of Brazil's Congress president. Other videos show protesters carrying flags and throwing objects amid tear gas clouds. Police in riot gear and the armed forces have been dispatched to the area where there have been clashes in the last hour. Brazil has a new president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who took office exactly a week ago. His predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro, lost the second round of the presidential election in October by less than two percentage points. As you can imagine, Brazil is a polarized and deeply divided country. Bolsonaro instead of attending the swearing-in ceremony decided to leave the country and travel to Florida where he is currently.

When you go back and talk to your family and all of a sudden you see what you saw the other day, so I have no reporting on that.

They say a single shot was fired and no other students were involved or hurt.CNN's legal analyst Joey Jackson joins us now. Wow, I mean, this is such a troubling case on so many fronts, Joey. Virginia law prohibits leaving a loaded gun where it is accessible to children under the age of 14. Now the child could be criminally charged. What type of legal scrutiny falls on the parents or adults in this case?",

      "sentences": "Yes, quite a bit, Pamela. Imagine what we're speaking about. We're speaking about a 6-year-old, who was a first grader, shooting a teacher in the school, and the police having reason to believe that it was intentionally done. Wow is that significant. And it's even more significant in as much we're examining what the laws really allow the state to do with the child, which is another matter I'm sure we'll get to.But with respect to the parents, you know, look. You know, there are certainly the amendments, right, that everyone believes in which is the right to bear arms. And that's something that people can freely exercise but it comes with a certain responsibility. And that responsibility is to ensure that you do not allow a child to endanger themselves or someone else with regard to you not being very, very clear about where that gun is and the fact that it doesn't get into their hands. So I think an investigation will reveal, again, we don't know and I don't want to presume but how does a 6-year-old get a gun? I think they will determine that and if there is anything that parents or relatives or guardians did that was inappropriate, reckless, or otherwise endangering, then I think they'll have criminal culpability. To that specific point there is a law that you just mentioned which criminalizes, right, the person who would allow this to occur. And so yes, I think a parent or guardian would have significant legal exposure here, Pamela, in the event that that's found to be the case.",

Us lawyers have a fancy word, we called it mens rea, that is that act intentionally, did you act recklessly, that is with a conscious disregard to what your conduct can cause? Did you act negligently? That is, were you not careful?As it relates to a child, though, there are significant issues. When you talk about a 6-year-old the fact is, is that unless we're dealing with a 14-year-old, Pamela, or older who could potentially be charged as an adult what do you now do? When you look at child laws not only Virginia but every state they're focused on rehabilitation. And so what you look at and examine is, how do you get the person, the child at issue the care that they need so that they could improve, they could develop themselves, they could advance. Obviously a child's brain works differently. And so I think what they'll do is the authorities will get together to see what the best course of action. Should the child be detained? There are certain laws that say you can't detain a child in a secure facility. Is there a child welfare agency that they could be detained? Are there some programs that they could avail themselves to. So I think there's a lot of questions authorities will ask themselves to get the help for the child, the rehabilitation for the child, and certainly look to issues of accountability and look to the critical question, is how this could happen and how do we prevent it, Pamela, from happening again.",

You know, a lot of us as conservatives have been frustrated with that. This game has got to end. And those were the discussions we've had.

So to me, that is the real question here is not the -- what it took to get McCarthy into the speaker's office but now that he has it, you know, how do the rules work?

But I think we were always in for a very closely divided Congress. There's only 222 Republicans. And then of course within the Republican Party which was on full display last week there are between six and 20 that at any given time are willing to, you know, take matters into their own hands and buck leadership.And so I do think there is going to be a lot of tumult. I mean, there are people in Congress for instance who are not going to want to cut defense spending among the Republicans and there are Republicans who are going to want to do that. That's going to be a debate for instance. So I do think we are in for a little bit more must-see TV on the House floor. And we should expect that really for the next couple of years.",

There are debates to come, however, that lend one to believe that there may have to be some bipartisan work done to do the business of the American people when the debt limit comes up in the summer. For instance, you can imagine a world where that has to happen for the debt limit to be raised.But in the short term, what he has to do is get everybody believing they're on the same team. That's one thing about last week that troubled me was that there are a few people that I don't think necessarily believe they're on the same team as the other 200 or 215 people. And that's troubling if you have folks out there who care more about themselves than they do the team. So to me that's Kevin McCarthy's first task, drive a team mentality among all 222.",

That's what these numbers are.Take a look at the net favorability rating, that's favorable minus unfavorable for a potential first-time speakers. Look at Kevin McCarthy. Minus 19 points. That is even weaker than Newt Gingrich back in '94 when he was at minus nine points. The rest of them are in positive territory. You know, Nancy Pelosi at the top of the list at plus 18 points. Republicans always love to run against Nancy Pelosi. Democrats especially after this week I think they are licking their chops.

John Boehner plus 56 points. Nancy Pelosi plus 54 points. Paul Ryan plus 48 points.This is the type of net favorability rating that you would expect from somebody that, you know, their own voters like but not love.

Kevin McCarthy's majority at this point is just 222 seats. That is the smallest, the smallest for a first-time speaker since 1931. You have to go all the way back to John Nance Garner, you know, when you're bringing that name up and you're talking about 1931, you're talking about 90 years ago.This I think is sort of a representation of why it was so difficult for McCarthy to actually win that vote was because all it took was five folks to basically say, on the Republican side, eh, we're going to run out this clock and essentially make everybody's day very, very late and then cast so many votes.

It was the first time in about a dozen years in which the kickoff returner had two, not one but two kickoff returns for touchdown. That was amazing. A lot of energy.In terms of high school sports, not really much of a surprise to me given all the safety concerns since the beginning of the century, essentially 20 years ago, football participation is down 14 percent. It's, still, look, Football is still king but soccer and cross-country are coming up on the heels of football.
