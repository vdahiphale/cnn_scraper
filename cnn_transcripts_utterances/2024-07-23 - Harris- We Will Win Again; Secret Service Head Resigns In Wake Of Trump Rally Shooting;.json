It starts off with this, I know Donald Trump's type, the fraudster, the sexual offender, et cetera, et cetera. Then she goes into two visions of America for the future and then what she is actually going to do. That seems to be the way she portrays it now. EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER: That's right. It is defining herself. Obviously, she has been vice president for the last three years, three-plus years, but what polls find again and again as people don't know that much about her and her own team has found that when more people -- when people find out more about her, they tend to like her more. So she is introducing herself, her prosecutorial background, giving a sense of a fight against Donald Trump and a contrast to Donald Trump, that prosecutor versus convicted felon and saying that she knows his type, but also then trying to talk about the future saying this is not just about Donald Trump. And the truth is, that that is something that Biden aides knew that the president was not able to do credibly because of his age to talk to people about what the future he saw was. He kept saying he wanted to finish the job and that was his slogan. Kamala Harris, obviously a younger candidate starting out as president, if she were to win, is talking about what she wants to do in the future and that flips it around from the way it was where Donald Trump was the one who is maybe thinking more about how things would be different going forward.",

That is up significantly from late 2021 and it is basically right in line with what people were saying in mid-2008, just before the Great Recession really started to get bad. And this is just another reminder of how despite those national economic statistics that show unemployment is low and inflation is cooling, millions of Americans are hurting from years of rising prices, and this really is the number one financial headache for families right now. Sixty-five percent of adults in this CNN poll say that expenses and the cost of living is the top economic challenge facing their families. That is down a bit from two years ago, but it remains well above the levels of late 2021. And I spoke to a woman in Ohio who works for the CDC and she told me, it is just outrageous what she is paying at the grocery store. She said it is not just food prices. She said, it is really astronomical everywhere from insurance to the cost to get clothes, and it is really these concerns that the presidential candidates are going to have to address. I mean, former President Trump is already hitting Vice President Harris on the cost of living, but he is going to have to offer solutions of his own and some mainstream economists they fear that the Trump economic agenda, the tax cuts, tariffs and immigration crackdowns are going to make inflation even worse and Vice President Harris, she is going to have to acknowledge these real cost of living fears that people have and offer solutions of her own -- Richard.",
