If you were a prosecutor, if you are sitting at DOJ and the Trump team comes to you after you found these classified documents from Mar-a-Lago and says, look, let's strike a deal here.

Once DOJ has got to the point where they've gone to a judge, said we have probable cause, you've done the search warrant. Now, that said, I think if the lawyers had gotten through to Donald Trump way earlier in the process, before DOJ got involved, when it was just Archives or maybe early on in the DOJ process and said, OK, sorry, there has been some bad communication here, maybe he has gotten some bad advice. He wants to give you everything. We are going to invite you in, we're going to work with you, back then I think there would have been a chance of a deal that did not involve a guilty plea.",

This according to source with knowledge of that case. We are expecting that formal announcement to come later today. He is accused of killing Jordan Neely last month. He says he felt Neely presented a threat and a danger on the subway train. Witnesses describe the homeless man getting on the train, shouting that he was hungry, thirsty, didn't care if he died. They said Penny walked up to Neely at one point and put him in a chokehold.CNN has reached out to Penny's attorneys for comment as we wait to hear back on all of that.

What is this special treatment? The district attorney's office said we want to hear more about the case. What are the other witnesses on the train saying, what is the video, is there another video, and so on. They put it through the grand jury. That's the first test. That's 23 people who say, well, I'll hear all of that, or as much as the district attorney will present, and decide is there probable cause to sustain this manslaughter charge, which means he recklessly, not intentionally, recklessly caused the death of another by taking actions that a reasonable person should have known were likely to result in that.The key now is going on to trial, two big questions. I don't know the answer to the first. I do know he was indicted on man two yesterday. We don't know if Daniel Penny testified before that grand jury and told his story, because if he did, it shows us it did not move those people. If he didn't, he is saving that for the trial where he is going to have to articulate what was in his mind that made him think that that use of force was justified, that this -- that Mr. Neely was about to do something.",

At issue here are plans for the University of North Carolina and Harvard, and these schools argue that they want to take race into consideration so that they can increase diversity on campus. They say that that leads to a better learning environment. And at oral arguments you heard Elena Kagen say these schools are very often the pipelines to leadership in society. But the challengers, they come from a conservative group here, and it says basically that these plans violate equal protection principles as well as federal law that bars you from race discrimination. They say that the plans actually thwart their goal of a colorblind society. So the most important thing to remember here is almost just a year ago the court made that move to overturn precedent in area of abortion. Now the big question is whether this conservative court that is bolstered by three of President Trump's nominees is ready to make that move again to overturn precedent and to get rid of these programs that have benefitted black and Hispanic students.

This institution has been rooted in white supremacy, has been rooted in patriarchy and injustice for a very long time. And the ramifications of their decisions, because they have been supporting a mob autocracy instead of a democracy, have been hurting our democracy through anti-democratic behavior such as our expulsions.
