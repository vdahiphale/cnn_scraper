CNN's special coverage has been following all the historic wins, major upsets and some races that could take days if not weeks, to crown a winner.This is the state of play right now. OK. We're going to get the balance of power in the House. Control of the House is up in the air right now. 218, that is the magic number this morning. That's how many seats both parties are hoping to win, OK? So let's take a look. Closer look now. Democrats on the defense. 178. Republicans leading with 198. These results not stopping House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy from claiming victory despite many undecided races. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): Now let me tell you, you're out late but when you wake up tomorrow, we will be in the majority and Nancy Pelosi will be in the minority. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)",

Republicans still hoping to gain control at this moment. We are watching four key races here in Nevada, Wisconsin, Arizona and Georgia, and CNN has not made any projections in these states at this hour. And you can see many of them very, very, very close.In Nevada, Republican Adam Laxalt inching ahead here. This race is very close. His opponent Catherine Cortez Masto was ahead earlier. In Wisconsin, you see there Ron Johnson who is the Republican hanging on to a lead. The Democrat Mandela Barnes trailing 49.3 percent, 50.5 percent for Ron Johnson. We have 94 percent of the vote in right now. Let's head to Arizona. They are doing reporting. Their votes are -- reporting the votes in the biggest county. Maricopa County until later tonight, OK? So they still have some work to do there, but there's a lot going on. The elections office is moving on to the early ballots there. Victor Blackwell reported that just moments ago here on CNN. As it stands, though, the incumbent Democratic Senator Mark Kelly is in the lead there. We'll keep a close eye on that. 67 percent of the estimated vote in there. And in Georgia, Republican Herschel Walker and incumbent Democratic Senator Raphael -- Warnock, I should say, excuse me, locked in a very tight race there. Could this head to a runoff? The secretary of state is saying it will. CNN has not projected that. Our coverage has people all over the ground. We're all standing by here. So let's take a look here. We have all of our folks standing by, our reporters, our correspondents, our producers, crews, all in the field. Now to Mr. John Berman. John, there's so much to get to.

I'm going to switch screens here to show you why that matters because it's so interesting. Let's go the battle for control of the U.S. Senate. These are the four seats that we have not projected yet. You can see 48, 48. Republicans need 51 to control the U.S. Senate. To take control Democrats just need 50 because Kamala Harris, the vice president, would break a tie. Let's allocate these races right now. Ron Johnson if he maintains his lead in Wisconsin, that would give Republicans 49. If Adam Laxalt were to prevail in Nevada, that would give Republicans 50. They're close. But Mark Kelly leads in Arizona. Democrats have 49. And then what are you left with? You're left with a runoff in Georgia.",

Kari Lake right now only down by two points, obviously as you and John have been talking about a lot of vote is still left to be counted.But beyond Arizona it was a very bad night for election deniers at least in the gubernatorial races in blue and swing states. So let's go to Massachusetts, right. This is a state you say, OK, it's a really blue state but, remember, it had a Republican governor for a long time in Charlie Baker, but here Geoff Diehl got blown out, got blown out, losing by nearly 30 percentage points. It didn't sell in Massachusetts. How about Michigan which of course is a perennial swing state? What happened there? Tudor Dixon losing by eight points to Gretchen Whitmer, the Democratic candidate. Again election denialism did not sell in a swing state like Michigan. How about Maryland which of course is a blue state but of course one that had a long-time Republican governor? What happened here? Dan Cox getting blown out, 22 points. Down to Wes More, easily winning the Democratic candidate. And of course in Pennsylvania which we've been talking about all night long in that gubernatorial race, what happened? Doug Mastriano, one of the most full-blown election deniers, getting blown out in the state, losing by nearly 13 percentage points in a state that Joe Biden won by just over a percentage point. Election denialism in blue states that had previously elected Republican governors and in swing states for the most part it just didn't sell -- Don.",

This was Donald Trump backed candidates for the most part because there was an election litmus test within the Republican primary and the question was in this out year election could that be enough where they might win a general election?Because it's a dangerous game Democrats were playing there and Republicans, too. It looks like at least in that northeast quadrant of the United States the answer is a definitive no.

We're not there yet, we've got to count all the votes but if things keep going the way they are right now they would get control, but look at that margin.It's barely anything. It's nowhere near what they were hoping for. It would be a good night for them in the sense they take control of the U.S. House, a disappointing night in terms of expectations. I want to look at the competitive seats, 82 competitive seats in the country between CNN and Inside Elections project that. You can see Democrats are leading in 47, Republicans in 35. The Republican path, though, is much shorter. They only need to win 30 of the Republican seats. They are ahead right now in 35. So you can see they're doing what they need to do to take control, but not the night by any means that they were hoping for, Don. Let me show you some of the states that are very interesting at this hour. Let's look at New York. OK? One of the things I've been pointing out all night long, we live in New York, right? Ten competitive districts here we consider. Two years ago -- right now Republicans are leading in eight of them. Two years ago eight of those districts were Democratic, just two Republicans. So Democrats, believe it or not, right now their margin in the House is because they're underperforming in New York state. Go figure. Blue state right now. Another thing I want to show you is in Colorado. That's New Mexico which is near Colorado but not, in fact, Colorado. Let's go to Colorado. What I wanted to show you was that New Mexico is near Colorado.",
