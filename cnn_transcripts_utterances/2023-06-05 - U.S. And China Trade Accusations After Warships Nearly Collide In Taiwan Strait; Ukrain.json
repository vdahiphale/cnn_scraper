Now if other people have the right to make copies of that or machines are capable of doing that, what will happen?

It's going to be harder to pick between the real thing and not. And the other thing too, do you think the interfaces that allow people to use AI are just going to become more and more accessible, more simple to use. Where is it headed? CLANCYFirst of all we have to realize that AI isn't necessarily the problem here. AI is just a tool. So AI is a way, why are these occurring? Why is it so dramatic? It's occurring so dramatically like ChatGPT because they are great fun. We have to look at this and actually say, who is using it, and who's having great fun? It is humans. It's people like you and me. And if we are using it and having fun, then just like anything else that we have fun with we should try to do the right thing. In this case the way to do the right thing is to figure out ways that we can license these products and services to make growth, make more money to allow more humans to work within music, and we can use AI to do that. For instance, the avatars are a great example of that. So that's the case of the show in London that sold over a million tickets recently, which was created by the artists, employs loads of people locally, uses the latest technology, everybody loves it, the audience loves it. So that's a great example of this -- of similar technologies used in a way that everybody's having a great time and profiting a business is good.
