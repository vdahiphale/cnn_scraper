There was a place that picked up a foot and a half of rainfall over the weekend. Now, all of that water in these rivers has to eventually get into the Missouri River and then head on down toward the Mississippi. That may help Mississippi levels months from now. But now we're still dealing with 24 outages here where some of these river gauges are so high, they can't even record anymore. They can't report anymore. Here's one here from the Big Sioux River. Now it's still going up in Sioux City, but finally coming down here after getting all the way past record levels. We'll get some rainfall today. We'll even get the chance of a thunderstorm or two. But it's going to be the heat, all the way from the upper Midwest all the way down to the Deep South. And 77 percent of you will be over 90 degrees today. This record heat goes all the way from about 1,000 miles from the Gulf of Mexico, all the way to it. And here's what I'm saying. You know, 96 in Atlanta. That's what the computer thinks for today. But it was 99 yesterday. I don't see that being any different. There's just no different air mass. So just sitting right over us. And so, yes, the heat will be here today. Not as much for the Ohio Valley, not as much for D.C., certainly not for New York and all the way into Boston. But for tomorrow, same story. Same heat. Same humidity. And it will feel like 107 to 110 around New Orleans, especially on that concrete as you walk around the city there, or for that matter, any little city center will certainly be warmer than the surrounding rural areas, feeling greater than 100. My thermometer on my balcony today said my heat index was 107 and I left my house about an hour ago. So that's how hot it already is.",

And while some crew members were allowed to leave Baltimore, others actually had to stay behind during the ongoing litigation surrounding the incident.

But it's important to note that all of these numbers represent actual people impacted by gun violence, many of them killed.In this new report, the FBI looked at active shooter incidents from last year, 2023. They found that there were 48 so-called active shooter incidents. So that's what they defined as one or more people actively trying to kill people. Most of the incidents were seen in California, Texas and Washington State. As you mentioned, looking at the trends here, down slightly from the previous year, about 4 percent. But if you look since 2019, the FBI has seen a 60 percent increase in active shooter incidents. And take a look at this graph. This is from the FBI. There's a lot going on in this chart, but look towards the right there. You can see the last few years. Since 2000, there's been the spike of incidents that the FBI notes. And so, overall, what criminologists say is that violent crime has been down, the murder rate is dropping, but still, looking at these numbers, guys, a lot of work to be done by public and safety officials to try to bring down the number of these deaths.",

So often when we focus on these shootings, rightly so, we talk about the number of people killed.But there are a number -- you know, time and again, so many debilitating injuries that people suffer. So even if they do go on to survive, that impacts their lives, sometimes for the rest of their life. Now with respect to this whole debate regarding bump stocks, you know, one of the central themes we've continued to hear from both law enforcement as well as from gun safety advocates is focused on trying to reduce the amount of time that a shooter can fire without having to reload that weapon. And you know, with this device called a bump stock that allows shooters sometimes to fire hundreds of rounds in a very short amount of time, there has been a debate on the high-capacity magazines that go into a lot of these firearms. And again, the longer that someone could shoot, quite obviously, that is less time that law enforcement can be intervening or that people can be fleeing.
