She talks about his disrespect for those who serve their country in uniform, and that he can't be trusted to be the commander-in-chief.

Police say they're trying to talk that man out of the house.Now, to backtrack. This started roughly four hours ago when police came to that house to execute a search warrant for animal cruelty. They say the man inside would not open the door. Police then tried to gain entry to the house.

There are a lot of individuals with guns on the street. And I know Security C is part of the legislation that we're asking our council members to pass. The penalties for folks that are just discharging firearms who do not have a right to do that is very challenging for us.

A few hours earlier during the game, Travis Kelce took quite a bit of heat for a moment on the sidelines where he shoved his head coach Andy Reid. He was screaming in his face.
