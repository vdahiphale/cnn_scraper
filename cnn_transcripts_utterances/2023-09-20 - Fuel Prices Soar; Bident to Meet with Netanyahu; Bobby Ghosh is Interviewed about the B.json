Try to figure out what these 11 rate hikes mean to the economy. They want to get more data and they want to take a look at that and see where they need to go from there. But if you look at inflation last month, it did rise 3.7 percent year over year, 0.6 percent month over month. But that was mainly because of rising gas prices. But if you look at core inflation, that's what the Fed really likes to look at, that actually cooled a bit. It's 4.3 percent in the past year, but that's coming down from the prior two months when it was 4.7 percent. So, the Federal Reserve likes to look at this. This is taking out volatile elements like food and gas. But just as important as it is to hear just how much they're going to raise rates by, it's important to look at what they're going to say about the future. There's a couple things that the Fed is looking at. They're going to be looking at the strike, the UAW strike, what that means for the economy.

So, advisers have crafted an agenda that includes its disapproval but is not limited to that, as the two leaders try to cover ground on a host of other issues, including the normalization of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia. The Biden administration had previously said that there were some elements coming together directionally for that, even though terms of any specific agreement still needed to be worked out. That they were heading in that direction. That will certainly come up.And then there is the shared goal of a deterrence of Iran. The leader of Iran at the United Nations had some harsh words for the United States in the last days, suggesting that - you know, it released prisoners based on humanitarian motives but that the U.S. needed to show good will toward the country and needed to show that it wanted to reengage with the 2015 nuclear deal before any talks there could begin. The U.S. has said that there are no direct talks with Iran planned for the foreseeable future. So, you can imagine that Biden and Netanyahu will be discussing that. But the judicial reform plan is going to figure very prominently in this conversation. You mentioned that President Biden said this spring that Israel cannot continue going down this road, and yet it has continued going down this road. That is one reason why advisers, when they were discussing the backdrop for this meeting and where it should be held, there was a discussion of possibly having it at the White House, but that was seen as providing approval for the plan. And so that is why the meeting is happening on the sidelines of the United Nations instead of at the White House. We'll see if they can reach any sort of agreement or compromise, which the White House has been seeking for several months.",

Over the course of the summer, officials were pleased with the lower numbers, the lower border crossings as they levied consequences against those who crossed the border unlawfully. But amid shifting demographics and changing nationalities coming to the border, it makes this all the more difficult.So, to put this into perspective in the numbers, in May, post Title 42, numbers of daily crossings dropped to about 3,500 a day. Now, as of Monday, a Homeland Security official tells me they encountered more than 8,000. To give you some context, that's where we were in late spring when there were alarm bells going off within the administration over just how many people were crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. And what this means on the ground is facilities that are crowded and ill-equipped to handle this many people -- and we learned just on Friday in a court filing that in some cases children were temporarily separated from their parents because of crowded holding areas as they were processed through. All of this is not what the administration wants to talk about when they're looking into a re-election campaign ramping up this fall and into early next year. This, of course, is a very delicate, political issue.
