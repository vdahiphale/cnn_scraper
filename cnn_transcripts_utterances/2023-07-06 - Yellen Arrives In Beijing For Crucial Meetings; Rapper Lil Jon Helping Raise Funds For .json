What they say is that they want to set a new normal and perhaps have a thaw in U.S.-China relations, which is a good goal. No one could be against having good China -- U.S.-China relations.But don't expect any sort of trade deals. Don't expect the administration to back off any tariffs or investment bands like the Chinese government wants. Just expect a lot of happy meetings where we say that we're going to avoid the economic war, and then a return to the tensions that we've seen. Because at the baseline analysis, the Chinese government is not willing to stop any of its economic aggression. And the U.S. government's not willing to let any of that go. So, this will be a roadblock in the ever-descending U.S.-China relationship. Nothing more.",

They don't like the fact that he wants to talk about the Uighur genocide and national security issues and China's military aggression. They are hoping that they're getting a more sympathetic ear from Janet Yellen.And to a degree, they're right about that. She has a more moderate stance. She represents the Treasury Department and Wall Street, which wants to make economic relations better. But, again, that only goes so far. Unless the Chinese government's willing to play ball on some of the things that the United States is concerned about. They can just have a bunch of happy meetings. And you know, Janet Yellen, of course, would like to lower tariffs and get back to business. But it takes two to tango.

That's not the government. Everybody sort of knows the sleight of hand that's going on there but hey, it's better than the Chinese government arming the Russians openly. And if the Chinese government wants to tell the Russian government, hey, you better not nuke Ukraine, or we'll be angry. That's fine. So, I think it's sort of an agreement where we look the other way as they help the Russians. They don't help the Russians as much as possible.

Now, of course, we want a good economy, too. We just don't want it on their terms. So, of course, Xi Jinping is going to try to charm Wall Street, try to charm Janet Yellen into letting go of the tariffs and sanctions so that they can get back to business.

And they are part of the items that we encounter every day.Like you can find them in a non-sticking cooking pan or in fast food containers. And they're called forever chemicals because they break down very slowly. Now, for this new study that just came out, what researchers did, they analyzed tap water samples from more than 700 sites across the United States. Those samples included private wells, public sources, and they found about 45 percent of water samples contained PFAS chemicals. And they noted that most of these samples containing PFAS were in or near big cities, in or near urban areas. And this isn't meant to scare people, John, but it's more so to raise awareness about how really prevalent these chemicals are. And we know that they have been linked to certain cancers, to thyroid disease. There is ongoing research looking into the public health implications here but one takeaway for all of us one way to reduce your own exposure to PFAS chemicals would be to use a carbon filter for your water at home or there are even tests you can purchase online or from certified labs to test your own water. And we know that public utilities are doing a lot of work in this. EPA is doing a lot of work on this. But these are forever chemicals so that work will take some time. Take some resources.
