FBI Director Chris Wray has said that he can't remember a time when all these different types of threats were actually elevated at the same time.And of course, the Department of Homeland Security recently issued an assessment of its own. I'll read you part of that. They say that, \"While sustained counterterrorism pressure has significantly degraded the ability of foreign terrorist organizations to target U.S. interests, foreign terror groups like al-Qaeda and ISIS are seeking to rebuild overseas. And they maintain worldwide networks of supporters that could seek to target the homeland.\" And of course, these assessments aren't academic. We see that the threat from ISIS remains. You look just three months ago in Moscow where 139 people were killed at a concert venue when four nationals from Tajikistan allegedly conducted this terrorist attack. And as part of that attack, we saw that they set fire to this facility. Multiple people were inside and died. And as that was still going on, the fire, ISIS then claimed responsibility, releasing videos of these actors. So certainly the threat like this remains. The big concern for U.S. law enforcement is try to - trying to stop, interdict any potential threats here at home.",

But the U.S. justice previously found that Chiquita paid the AUC over 100 times between 1997 and 2004 for $1.7 million in total. Monday's verdicts ruled that the money was instrumental in propping up the AUC and that Chiquita was liable for the human rights abuse committed by the group.

And a team of attorneys that brought successfully forward these cases intend to follow with further and further suits against Chiquita. For CNN, this is Stefano Pozzebon, Bogota. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
