      "sentences": "Good morning, everyone. You're live in the CNN Newsroom. I'm Alisyn Camerota in today for Jim Acosta.And we're following several breaking stories this hour. At any moment, the Republican-led House Judiciary Committee will begin its grilling of Attorney General Merrick Garland. Garland is expected to push back against GOP attacks on the Justice Department, and GOP claims that the DOJ is weaponized against Donald Trump. Also, opening statements are underway in the trial of the president's son, Hunter Biden, on three felony gun charges. But there are already some developments inside that courtroom we'll bring you. And President Biden is about to announce an executive order on illegal immigration, cracking down on the flow of migrants across the southern border. The move is controversial. It's drawing fire from Republicans, no surprise, but even from Border Patrol agents. We'll find out why. But, first, let's go to Paul Reid. She's outside the courthouse in Delaware where Hunter Biden's trial is starting. Paula, you've got some breaking news about the jury. What just happened?",

      "sentences": "That's right. Even before opening statements got underway this morning, we already lost a juror. Now, this juror, we know this is a woman. She said yesterday in court during the jury selection process that she is unemployed. And overnight, she emailed the court to say that she did not want to serve. She said she lives about an hour away and she didn't realize she had to be here every day and didn't want to go through that commute.She also said that the only reason she showed up yesterday is because her dad took the day off to bring her here. So, Alisyn, it does not appear that there is a political or a safety reason for her saying she does not want to serve. But notable, we've already lost one juror before the trial really gets under way. Of course, there are four alternates. One of them will be selected to fill her seat before opening statements start any minute now.",

In just moments, Attorney General Merrick Garland will defend the Justice Department before Congress. These are some live pictures from inside the room. House Republicans want to hold him in contempt for refusing to turn over recordings of President Biden's interview with the special counsel, Robert Hur. Garland is expected to push back, though, including on the accusation that the DOJ is targeting Donald Trump for political purposes. Joining me now, CNN's Lauren Fox on Capitol Hill and CNN's Katelyn Polantz in Washington. Okay, so, Lauren, do we know what the attorney general plans to say?",

      "sentences": "Yes. We are getting an early glimpse of what his opening statement is going to be in just a few minutes, Alisyn. He is expected to tell House Republicans and House Democrats on this committee that nothing he is doing is intended to go after President Trump, that the people who work at the Justice Department are making decisions based on the law.He's expected to say that certain members of the committee and the Oversight Committee are seeking contempt as a means of obtaining, for no legitimate purpose, sensitive law enforcement information that could harm the integrity of future investigations. This effort is only the most recent in a long line of attacks on the Justice Department's work. He also is saying that the folks who work at the Justice Department are simply doing their job. Now, this comes as House Republicans are trying to assert efforts to try to cut funding to the Justice Department as they begin their annual appropriation season. They are trying to crack down on the Justice Department through legislation. And actually, just a few minutes ago, our colleagues who were outside the House Republican conference meeting, reporting that inside that meeting, Speaker Mike Johnson laid out a three-pronged strategy for House Republicans to try to go after the Justice Department after Donald Trump was convicted in New York last week.

      "sentences": "They may. But, Alisyn, let's take a minute to remember exactly what the clash is over that is bubbling into this contempt discussion that House Republicans are having with Garland.So, Garland is speaking more broadly about defending the Justice Department, but House Republicans are mad at him because they want the audiotape of Joe Biden sitting down with Special Counsel Robert Hur and giving an interview, a lengthy interview about how he had classified documents in his possession in an investigation that resulted in no charges, ultimately. [10:05:07] Garland is telling Congress, we're not giving you that audio tape. And, in fact, Alisyn, CNN is even suing for access to that audiotape. And the Justice Department is separately in court telling a judge, yes, we're not giving over this audiotape. We've given a transcript of Biden. We have too many fears of chilling witnesses hurting future investigations. So, that is what the contempt fight is over, and right now, Merrick Garland says, no. Remember, though, even if the audio tape does get produced publicly at some point, perhaps under a judge's order, maybe potentially, there is this history of Republicans picking these types of battles with cabinet officials, including in the Biden administration, but also dating back to Eric Holder as the attorney general, who was held in contempt for the first time in a long time starting that sort of process where an attorney general is focused on by the opposing party in Congress just as a way to make a political point.",

      "sentences": "Thank you for the refresher on that background. That is really valuable.Lauren, here's another confounding issue today. Last night, three Republicans on the House Judiciary sent the attorney general a letter demanding information about the prosecution of January 6th criminals. Okay. It says, quote, we're concerned about the Department of Justice's aggressive prosecutions of American citizens who were present at the U.S. Capitol on January 6th, 2021. Now, Lauren, the convicts from January 6th tried to kill police officers. They ended up injuring 140 police officers. How do Republicans explain why they support violence against law enforcement?",

So, people, like Thomas Massie, who sent that letter last night, they are expected to ask Garland about that very issue and we'll get a lot more insight.But this has been something that House Republicans have been fighting against for several years now. This is not a new issue, just simply something that Republicans are certainly going to be talking about with Garland in there in just a few minutes.",

Some baseless conspiracy theories, including that, quote, investigations have pointed to the FBI's possible involvement in facilitating the events of January 6th. There's no evidence of that, of course. In fact, the FBI informants were trying to stop the violence there. That's why they were there. But as the alleged source for these Republicans, the letter cited a New York Post article about the FBI informants who were sent to Stop the Steal rally to surveil what the violent Trump supporters were up to. So, again, how exactly are Republicans threading this?",

The FBI director has said that was not what happened on January 6th. There have been hundreds of successful prosecutions, people pleading guilty who took part in those attacks and essentially saying that they were wrong for what they did.And another point on what Lauren was talking about regarding the people being held. Those people are a very small number of the hundreds of convicted -- people who have been convicted in January 6th cases, and they are largely -- the people who are in jail, they are largely violent offenders that receive extremely long sentences, longer than they're being held pre-trial. So, what is being said about January six on Capitol Hill often is just not the case in court.",

About half of them or more have had a drug addiction touch their families. So, this is important. This is a cross-section of America. And these are the kinds of jurors that are going to figure quite largely in the decision-making.Don't forget, the court's questions to the jurors were in three categories, politics, guns and drugs.

According to The Washington Post, quote, there was a female prospective juror who said, who they said laughed out loud when she realized what case it was, asked her opinion of Hunter Biden, she said, quote, not a good one. So, she was dismissed. But the point is what impact do you think that high-profile cases and defendants like this have on juries? MICHAEL MOORE, CNN LEGAL ANALYSTDelaware, this is not a big place. You know, it's not the same as trying a case in the middle of New York or in Texas or other places like that. I mean, we're talking about a relatively small place. It'd be like trying the mayor's son of a small town somewhere and getting a jury, you know, chosen. So, they do know folks and people know them. That's cuts both ways. You can have it good. You can have it bad. They may have a good reputation where they help some folks and a bad reputation because they tick some other people off. But the Biden name there, certainly his connections to the state, long connections and things he's done for the state have been good. But all that said, this case is not a strong case. I think it would have never been brought but for the fact that it's about, I mean, this is not a case that a federal prosecutor would relish to bring him in and they're having to rely on a book that he wrote to say that he was using drugs some time --",

And so now we're bringing this case to say, basically, well, at some point, he may have been an addict. He said in a book he was an addict. I mean, that's like having your insurance policy canceled because you wrote a book about diets, and they said, well, you must have been fat and didn't tell us at the time. That's ridiculous.I mean, we're, this case is being brought on the basis of something that is -- we got a lot of other stuff to do it. But for the hoopla and hubbub that's been raised, this case would not have been brought. I mean, was he an addict? Did he subjectively think that? Did he objectively know it? Did other people say, well, maybe he was, or maybe we saw something at the time he filled the form? There's all this kind of thing that he's going to give an appeals court if there's a conviction there. And, look, I've been an equal opportunity critic of both the Trump case and this case, so I'm not weighing it down.
