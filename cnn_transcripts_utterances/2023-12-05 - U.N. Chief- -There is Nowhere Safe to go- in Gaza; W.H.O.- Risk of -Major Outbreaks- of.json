The constant bombardment is increasing risk of disease and hospitals there are struggling to keep up. And climate change is a harsh reality that some face every day. We take a look at the unprecedented flooding in East Africa. Welcome to the show. And one impossible choice after another the UN's top emergency relief official says that is the gut wrenching reality facing the people of Gaza in what he calls apocalyptic conditions. The UN Secretary General is also appealing to Israel's military to spare civilian lives as it ramps up ground operations in Southern Gaza and targets what it says are Hamas command-and-control centers in the north. The Hamas controlled Health Ministry in Gaza counts more than 15,000 deaths there since the war started almost two months ago. It is not clear how many have been killed in terms of Hamas militants. An Israeli military spokesperson says a reported ratio of two civilians killed for every militant killed is \"Tremendously positive given the challenges of urban combat\". We've got Alex Marquardt in Tel Aviv for us, great to see you, Alex. I'd like to start off with some of the intercepts, the rocket intercepts that we've been seeing over Tel Aviv.

About 35 minutes ago, we heard the sirens going off which is not all that uncommon. And we heard the Iron Dome interceptor rockets taking down some of those Hamas rockets. But what is relatively rare is then the impact that we saw just north of our position here in the northern part of Tel Aviv by a power station a large plume of black smoke. It is rare for some of those rockets to get through the Iron Dome. The vast majority of the rockets that are fired are usually taken down. But the Iron Dome is clever enough to also determine whether or not a rocket is going to impact near a civilian area. And I do have to say that this was quite close to a residential area. We understand from the police that they are checking to see whether there were any injuries or casualties. And so far none have been reported. But Eleni this does come as the IDF is not only expanding but intensifying their operation moving not just from the north where their operation has been taking place for the past few months, but into the south, we've seen satellite imagery. We've seen other video of dozens of Israeli armored vehicles in the southern part of the Gaza Strip. Now remember, Israel had told North Gaza residents to move south more than a million of them. Now Israel is telling parts of Southern Gaza to evacuate as well, particularly around the City of Khan Yunis, where officials believe that some Hamas leadership has gone. And so it is an extraordinarily chaotic situation in Southern Gaza. 1.9 million Gazans are displaced according to the United Nations. That is the vast majority of the 2.2 million Palestinian population of Gaza, Eleni.",

And therefore they're going to be in addition to under the threat of disease, starvation, dehydration, now they have the weather to deal with as well. And in fact, Martin Griffiths, the Chief the UN Relief Officer said the following, every time we think things cannot get more apocalyptic in Gaza, they do. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WEDEMAN (voice-over): Desperate times call for desperate measures. And in Gaza if that means looting the local bakery destroyed overnight by an Israeli airstrike, so be it. Look at the people, says Ikrama Rai (ph). They're doing this out of hunger. It was the Baraka bakery. Baraka is Arabic for blessing. But now Gaza is under the curse of war. It was the last functioning bakery in Deir al-Balah -- basic needs striking it is a kind of terrorism. Once the sun came up Monday, people of all ages descended upon the bakery. Taking away bags of flour, cooking oil, scraps of wood to use for cooking and heating, and just about anything else they could carry away. This man describes it in one word, chaos.

So many volunteers in such an acute period of time, such acute levels of population displacement, and there's little access to those in need. And it's not just me who's saying this. Quite a few of my senior humanitarian colleagues are saying the same thing. It is catastrophic, dire. You know, I don't think any feeling person who sees the videos of children who have been nine, children who have been orphaned, parents who are just in inconsolable grief, and the levels of destruction, I can't imagine anyone seeing those countless videos and thinking there's got to be a better way.

The health system has undergone a massivedegradation throughout the conflict; we've gone from 36, functioning hospitals down to 18. And of those 18, they're all only partially functional. So what we are trying to do is expand the capacity of some of the hospitals by bringing in tenant facilities, prefab facilities, particularly to the three main hospitals in the south. We know that many of the major hospitals in the north are either completely out of action are only very, very partially active. We're very concerned that the new -- the escalated offensive is going to put out of action, the remaining hospitals in the south, that cannot be allowed to happen. So what we're trying to do is we're advocating that these hospitals be protected, that they'd be supported, we're putting in more beds, bringing in supplies as best we can. We're also working with a number of partners to bring in a limited number of field hospitals and put them in strategic places. There are not many agencies in the world who wants to -- who feel that they can bring hospitals into southern Gaza because of the insecurity, because of the lack of fuel, because of the questionable supply ones, but that's another option.

Well, in Gaza, tens of thousands of displacedPalestinians have migrated south towards the Rafah border crossing with Egypt over the past two days according to the UN. Most newly arriving people are settling in the streets and in empty spaces across the city, where they've been erecting tents and makeshift shelters. Meantime, Israel says it --180 international humanitarian aid trucks and two fuel tankers for entry into Gaza on Monday. The UN says it only counted 100 trucks, which had called insufficient to meet the needs of civilians trapped there amid the war. We've got CNN's Larry Madowo joining us now from Cairo with all of these developments, Larry, good to see you. Look, the reality is, and we've been discussing this, that it's just not enough aid, we're not seeing it -- you're seeing enough trucks going into Gaza.

Hundreds of trucks waiting to get in, most of them have still not been able to get in. Because even though there's many trucks on the Egyptian side of the crossing, for them to get past, they have to go the Nitzana crossing where Israelis verify every single thing that's coming in, that's when it goes back to the Rafah crossing. And that's then unloaded onto trucks, on the Gaza Strip however, that's been much slower. These rallies said yesterday that 180 humanitarian trucks were allowed in, but as you mentioned, only about 100 trucks were received. That's according to UN humanitarian operations there. That's about 110,000, during the truce about 110,000 liters of fuel was coming in. Yesterday, that was 69,000 liters of fuel and almost 200 trucks were allowed to come in. And even that's still smaller than the amount that was coming in before October 7th; almost 500 trucks of aid were coming in. Right now, the UN saying that the conditions for delivering aid do not exist, the amount coming in is not enough. And humanitarian operations cannot be operated based on a drip feed of fuel, which is important to learn hospitals, water desalination plants and just about every other bit of humanitarian infrastructure.

      "sentences": "Well, Eleni, the U.S. has continued their both private and public pressure campaign in urging Israelto take more precautions to protect civilian lives as they are waging this campaign now in Southern Gaza. But the White House so far, Jake Sullivan yesterday has been unable to say whether they believe that Israel has actually been more precise in their targeting. We've heard officials over the past few days saying that they feel that Israel has been receptive to this advice from the administration. But so far, the administration really hasn't been weighing in on the specifics of some of their tactics. Things like the fact that they dropped leaflets, with maps showing people where they could go, also those leaflets, the pamphlets with QR codes that people could scan to figure out the safe areas to go to. It really speaks to this willingness from the administration to try to just talk and offer this advice behind the scenes and a little bit publicly without trying to criticize Israel publicly for the tactics are being used. So we will see whether they offer any other guidance on if they feel Israel has been taking the right precautions to protect civilian lives in Gaza as they are continuing their hostilities against Hamas. Now, at the same time, there is also the concern about those hostages being held that roughly a little less than 140 hostages, eight of which are believed to be Americans, that one woman and also seven men. Now, the National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said that there were intensive discussions between the U.S. Israel, Egypt and Qatar. But the negotiations to actually get these hostages out, those negotiations that had been ongoing between Israel and Hamas simply don't exist at this moment. And officials say it seems unlikely that they would restart anytime soon. There have been major differences over the types of hostages to be released, Israel and the U.S. insisting Hamas still has more women, Hamas wanting to move on to the discussion of others, as well. At this point, it seems to be that the conversations the U.S. is having about this is simply strategy sessions trying to figure out how they can get these hostages out even as the negotiations have completely stalled. Now National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said that they've been briefing President Biden on all options to get hostages out specifically those aid Americans. But officials also say right now that it's unlikely that the U.S. would be striking any type of separate deal just to get these American hostages out. So these are two of the main concerns facing this administration right now, as they're trying to get more hostages released from Hamas, even as those negotiations have stalled and then also going to great lengths to warn Israel about protecting civilian lives as they are waging their campaign.",
