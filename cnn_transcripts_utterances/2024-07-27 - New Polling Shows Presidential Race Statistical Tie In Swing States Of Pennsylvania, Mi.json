There are now just over 100 days until voters head to the polls to pick the next president. Today, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are both out on the campaign trail. And at any moment now, Harris is set to hold the fundraiser in Massachusetts. Meantime, her political rival will be speaking in the next hour at the Bitcoin Convention in Nashville. And this comes as new polling shows that two candidates locked in a tight race. According to this FOX News polls, the presidential race is now a statistical dead heat in swing states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. CNN's Steve Contorno is covering the Trump campaign from Nashville. Eva McKend is in Washington covering -- or you're not in -- yes, you are. You're in Washington covering the Harris campaign while she's making her way to Massachusetts. So Eva, you first. Set the stage for what this weekend is all about for her.",

We were getting a bit more all optimistic that we were inching closer to a deal, but I've been checking my notes, and you remember back in February, it was President Biden in Michigan chomping on an ice cream hoping, saying that he expected a hostage deal to come about by that weekend. And we're obviously several months further forward than that. It's obviously good to be optimistic that the two sides could be getting closer towards some kind of deal that would see a ceasefire and the number of hostages released and a number of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails released as well.But we know from previous experience, the number of times we've been having this conversation about whether we hope these talks are actually going to get a deal over the line. It pays to be cautious when these talks are taking place. There's still much to discuss, everything from the ratio of Palestinian prisoners to hostages being released, if Israel will have vetoes on certain Palestinian prisoners being released, if Israel will retain control over the Philadelphi Corridor which runs between Rafah and the Egyptian border, which Israel has said it must control in order to prevent weapons smuggling to Hamas afterwards. So there's still a lot of details that needs to be finalized. So although they are still talking, so it's possible that a deal can be done, the likelihood is that if a deal is going to be done, it's still some time away. Fred?",

For the last 10 months you've seen a daily exchange of some high trajectory rockets anti-tank missiles.This is the most deadly incident. Mashtal Shams is in the southern foothills are the Golan. Its primarily or Druze town. I've looked at some of the pictures. The rockets, even though Hezbollah has denied it, they're the likely suspect, seems to have hit a play area, a soccer field, as many as 10 dead. The real question, I think, is how he Israelis choose to respond to this. If they -- I don't think it'll be a massive, massive attack, but it could create, depending on what they do, a Hezbollah response, which could then go up the escalatory ladder. And if that happens, it will in fact affect and undermine any promise of quick progress between Israel and Hamas on the hostage negotiation deal.",

Druze are Israeli citizens. They serve in the IDF. They've died in the Israeli-Hamas war in Gaza. So I think the Israelis will mount a robust response.Again the escalatory ladder has not yet been climbed to the conclusion that I think neither Israel, Hezbollah, the United States, probably not in Iran wants right now, which is a major escalation that trips into something the Middle East has never seen before, which is a major war, which could involve Israel and Iran, Israel and Hezbollah, and the U.S. and Iran, that could even spread to the Gulf. So I don't think we're on the cusp of that, but the northern border is really on the cusp, it seems to me, and has been of some sort of escalation.",
