We're getting word that more than 100 people were killed, 140 injured, after two blasts struck near the grave of the Iranian military commander, the late Iranian military commander, Qassem Soleimani. Iranian state media captured the moment that one of the blasts happened near very crowded streets. You can hear the fear of the screams there. According to Iranian state media, officials describe the explosions, they are calling these explosions a terror attack. CNN's Nada Bashir is following this for us. Nada, what is the latest?",

General, good to have you today.First, just your reaction to this news out of Iran, the timing of this, especially on this day, as Nada mentioned, four years after the death of Soleimani, what do you make of this? BRIG. GEN. STEVE ANDERSON (RET.), U.S. ARMY:  Well, thank you, Rahel. Obviously, a great concern that tensions could escalate and there would be more bloodshed. And somehow what's going on in the Gaza Strip escalates to something much bigger. But I can tell you right now, I mean, I don't know for sure, but I'm going to go out on a limb here and say the United States had absolutely nothing to do with this. My suspicion is that this is an internal issue within Iran, particularly if you look at what was targeted, Soleimani, who was taken down four years ago by the United States. But the last thing we want to do is take out civilian casualties like this and escalate tensions. I mean, everything is already on edge right now after the assassination yesterday of Al-Arouri in Beirut. And so there's no way the United States is behind this, and I suspect Israel as well. So, again, my inclination is this is an internal issue within Iran because they have a lot of competing factions within that country.",

I would point out, though, that, no doubt, the Israelis are behind this, but it was a precision attack and they very rightfully just targeted Arouri and two of his compatriots and they didn't take out any other casualties. And so their focus has been on Hamas. And I think they've made that very clear that they are trying to minimize casualties in Beirut.I've been there a couple of times in the last couple of years, and it's a very vibrant city, but everybody knows where the Hezbollah areas are, where the Christian areas are, where the Shia or the Sunni areas are. And so everybody knows that this is where Hezbollah is hanging out, so to speak, and where Hamas, I'm sure that the headquarters there was well known. So, the fact that they took it out and they minimized the casualties as they did, I think, is a good sign that Israel is doing everything they can to take down Hamas without escalating tensions further.",

ANDERSONin this, and that's why I'll be listening for how does he attribute this attack and what is he calling his people to do. There's already a lot of tension on the northern border of Israel, and, of course, there are 40,000 missiles aimed at Israel from north in the Lebanese area and Hezbollah-controlled areas. So, I'm going to be looking for what is he calling his compatriots in Hezbollah, what is he asking the folks in the West bank that are obviously in support of Hamas, and then further, what is he saying to his leadership in Iran, because, of course, Iran is behind all of these activities. What I want to see is hopefully a de-escalation of tensions and in recognition that Israel did everything they can to minimize casualties and focus only on Hamas leadership. [10:10:7]",

Well, 12 days until the voting finally begins in this 2024 campaign and it feels like there is no doubt that Donald Trump is still the overwhelming front runner.But you mentioned Nikki Haley's money. She's using a lot of that newfound money to put television ads on and right now, this is a race for second place. We've talked about this a lot for the last several months. You can just feel that really taking shape though between Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis, through television ads, through their own messages, what their supporters are saying. It is clear that both of them are trying to slow the other's momentum. In Nikki Haley's case, she believes a stronger than expected finish here could really end the candidacy of Ron DeSantis. We will see if that happens. But, John, Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor, he'll be campaigning here behind me in Waukee, Iowa, just west of Des Moines, a critical suburb where a lot of Republicans are and he's been making his case across the state, be traveling to four other spots today. But it is that race for second place that so many Republicans here have their eye on. And, basically, it breaks down like this. If you're a supporter of Donald Trump, you've long been a supporter of Donald Trump and, yes, you will probably still be supporting him, but half the party that's looking for an alternative, they are split between DeSantis, Haley and perhaps still Vivek Ramaswamy and others. So, that is the question here. Can either of those two kind of pry this race for second place loose? That's what they are trying to do. But, of course, our CNN town hall is here tomorrow, that debate next week. So, yes, it feels like caucus time is just around the corner, but it also feels like Donald Trump has its win and the second place is what everyone has their eye on. But that's important, of course, heading into New Hampshire the following week, John.",

LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST:  Well, they're not going to get the nomination, if that's all that they ever get, John. And that's the issue right here. You're seeing that Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley, at different points, are trying to still defend former President Donald Trump, the frontrunner. Maybe potentially candidates like Ron DeSantis are looking for some type of cabinet position. There's a bit of skepticism from really close Trump allies about whether or not Nikki Haley would be someone that the majority of his supporters really want as a potential vice presidential pick. But right now, look, Nikki Haley appears to be gaining momentum in states like New Hampshire and is coalescing a lot more support and getting more money from donors, but it doesn't look like it's going to be enough.",

Listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) QUENTIN FULKS, BIDEN-HARRIS PRINCIPAL DEPUTY CAMPAIGN MANAGER:  Donald Trump is telling us every day who he's going to be if he's re-elected president, a dictator on day one, ripping health care away from millions of people. These are threats to democracy and we feel that the American people deserve to hear these things from us. And it's a moral responsibility of this campaign to paint that picture for the American people. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

President Biden, when he launched then, also made this very much about threats to democracy and about what he saw as rising extremist forces, referencing Charlottesville repeatedly in his launch video when he ran in 2020. And so we're seeing that again, that President Biden is saying that the threat hasn't gone away. And if anything, it's only grown because of January 6th and the insurrection on the Capitol, because of the very rhetoric from former President Trump himself, where rhetoric where he says that migrants are poisoning the blood of the country and echoing Adolf Hitler. And so that's something that we've seen the Biden campaign say that they are going to repeatedly talk about and then brought in that out more, the campaign officials have told me, to attacks on personal freedoms. So, it's not just attacks on the foundation of the country itself, but also they're saying that they're going to really be hammering what they see as not just Trump, but the larger Republican Party, attacks on abortion and potentially other freedoms, birth control and things like that, that they see as Republicans targeting.",

And, of course, that's the lynchpin in terms of trying to keep the government open with the continuing resolution the C.R. that otherwise expires in just two weeks with the House coming back next week. That's one of the lynchpins.Trump probably is not going to want to see some type of acceptance on immigration because it's not going to be good enough. And so you're going to see this dysfunction really propel itself into the next couple weeks with the real threat of a shutdown across the government with no deal on the spending. The top line spending number still has not been agreed to despite Congress being out of session now for some three weeks. Negotiations were supposed to be happening on the side. But, really, there's been no breakthrough at all. So, January 6th is going to be an issue way back in the past as people look at the issues that confront us literally in the next couple of weeks.",

The goal here is to try to delay this case until after the 2024 election.And it's unclear how successful they'll be if this will take enough time to potentially push this entire trial, which was scheduled for March back beyond the election, or if it's decided pretty quickly by the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court does whatever it will or will not do here pretty quickly, they still might be able to squeeze in this case. Parlatore put it at about 50-50 whether this case will go. But just as much as we're looking at the answers from the Court of Appeals on the constitutional question of whether Trump has immunity, we saw him doubling down on this argument last night in his filing.
