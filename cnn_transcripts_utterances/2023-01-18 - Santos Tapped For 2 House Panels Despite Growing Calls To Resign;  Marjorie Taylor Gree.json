I'm told he pushed for very high-profile committee seats on the House Financial Services Committee and House Foreign Affairs Committee. Republican leaders decided against that. Instead, gave him two other committees, lower-profile committees, the Science Committee and the Small Business Committee, but still having committee assignments, nonetheless. Republican leaders say because they're investigations are ongoing and an ethics investigation will take place, they want those to play out. If there were ever an indictment, that's when he would lose the committee assignments. But there is precedence for knocking off people from committee assignments when they have not been indicted. In 2019, then-Congressman Steve King made some racist comments. Then- minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, pushed to have him removed from his committee. But Republicans say this situation is different. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. ROGER WILLIAMS (R-TX): I don't condone what he said and what he's done. I don't think anybody does. That's not my role. He was elected. He represents a million people. REP.

But that same district is a blue one, one that Joe Biden carried by eight points.And that is a major factor in how Republican leaders are dealing with it. The last thing they would want, at this point, according to a number of Republican sources, is for a resignation to happen. That would set up a special election that could make it very difficult to hold on to that seat and tighten McCarthy's already very tight majority in the House.

It is a person who is frankly a conn man. There's nothing about him that seems true. He seems to be not just full of himself and somebody who is embellished. He seems to be quite dangerous. I felt like he's the kind of guy who with stay and stay until he's led out in handcuffs. Kevin McCarthy did not grow a backbone to deal with this. They just can't afford to love his vote.

No response there. That is the height of irresponsibility by Kevin McCarthy. He could have put her on House administration. There's many committees you can plug someone like her where she can't do real damage. But Rina said something important that I think applies to both of these individuals, which is there's a danger element here. Especially George Santos, a known con artist. This is somebody that foreign adversaries would be champing at the bit to exploit. When you're this caught up in legal woes, you don't have an off ramp, this makes you susceptible to things like blackmail. And he's now to have access to what members of Congress do. She's somebody as well. She's not demonstrated the judgment, the integrity to be on a committee dealing with our homeland. And finally, one of the biggest issues Homeland Security should be dealing with is homegrown domestic terrorism, the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers.

We heard Citibank saying it's changing the call for the February Fed meeting to a slower rate hike.And we heard from several Fed officials saying they're not done yet. And that's part of the reason the Dow was off more than 400 points. What did we learn in the report this morning? Producer prices, the wholesale retailer inflation, supplier inflation, and what it showed is prices fell 0.5 percent on a monthly basis. On an annual basis, prices are higher by 6.2 percent. Take a look however at the last few years of annual PPI, or producer inflation, and you can see the trend that is certainly encouraging, 6.2 percent at an annual rate, as I just said. But compare that to the peak of 11.7 percent in March of 2022. We like to see it. Now, take a look at consumer inflation, which is inflation that we as consumers all experience on a day to day. You can see it is following a similar trend. Consumer inflation also falling. You have consumer inflation falling, producer inflation falling, wages moderating. Part of the reason why you're hearing banks say the Fed can do a little less now because it is working. At the same time, we got retail sales that showed, look, it was a disappointment. Consumers really pulling back how they're spending. Retail sales fell 1.1 percent on a monthly basis in December. November was also revised lower. And, guys, the pullback was pretty broad-based. Even parts of the economy that had been doing really well, like restaurants and bars, we saw some pullbacks there in the last month. So, you know, is it good? Is it bad? It's like when you're in a relationship and the label isn't really defined. It's complicated. (LAUGHTER)",
