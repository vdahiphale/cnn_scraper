They were already, many of them, dependent entirely reliant on humanitarian aid even before this earthquake. Now, they are made ever more vulnerable. And that civil war, that civil conflict is playing out during these rescue operations, Rosemary, because you have different authorities on the ground. Syrian government controls part of the north. Other parts are controlled by rebel forces where families have to depend on rescue groups like the White Helmets. Of course, resources stretched thin after over a decade of war. It is important here to note that this entire region has been affected by weather storms that have really dampened, hampered, created another challenge for these rescue workers. But really right now it is all about finding the survivors.

So, you can imagine for families, just that constant rattling and shaking, how horrifying that must be.Yes, this is a country very much prepared for earthquakes in the sense that it sits on a fault zone. It has been trying to bring up its building codes. But perhaps this part of Syria was -- part of Turkey, rather, was less prepared. It's a part of the country where Syrian refugees live, where there is more poverty, where there might be less of those stable structured buildings. A lot of concern around that. That's what you saw happening last night. I know we have images of people essentially forced out of their homes or unable to go back home, made homeless, spending the night in these freezing cold temperatures with no help, with no shelter. Again, you are looking at resources. They are absolutely stretched thin. We've already heard from families on the ground who say they received no help, that they are relying on the kindness of their neighbors and strangers who themselves have been forced out of their homes. Again, think in Syria where there is very little in the way of resources at all. And so, today, as you see the sunlight come up, the search and rescue efforts go underway. You're going to start to see the tentacles of this help operation, this aid operation, really reach more of these affected areas and begin to address the needs of these families.

One saving grace, of course, is the fact that international assistance is on its way, but it couldn't come quick enough. There is obviously a huge time gap between, you know, pledging deployments and actually synchronizing with local authorities to get people to work.We have also seen the weather is closing in on many of these regions. It is cold, it is wet, it is making the initial response a lot more difficult. Countries from around the world are pledging as much as possible. You're seeing the United States saying that they're going to be spending 160 personnel. The E.U. has activated its emergency response team and also satellite-mapping services, which is going to help people on the ground. Britain is sending teams. The UAE and Qatar are also sending up teams, personnel, and importantly, field hospitals. And just to give you a glimpse of what is going on, sniffer dogs are absolutely vital in the process. You can see equipment is required. You need manpower to lift the rubble, to try and find people stuck beneath that. In terms of Northwestern Syria, you are seeing the hardest hit areas already impacted by millions of displaced people, where this area has been impacted by almost 12 years of civil war, and largely, the rebel- held region, you know, cuts off from the rest of the country. Some aid from Iraq has arrived in Damascus. The big question is, is that going to now be fed through into the rebel-held territory which, of course, is not synchronized with the rest of the country. A lot of the aid has been coming in from Turkey. Some of the other pledges that we have seen from Pakistan, from Spain, neighboring Greece, sending systems as well to Turkey. You know, just seeing the international response has been overwhelming. But look, you're looking at a critical situation, every second absolutely counts. The White Helmets that operates in Syria say that they are running out of time. And to further exacerbate the issue, shelter options for the people who are impacted are few and far between. We are hearing from an eyewitness that we spoke to, saying that he is seeing people sleeping out on the streets, in the freezing cold, that the hospitals were just not geared for this kind of catastrophe which is ongoing. This is going to be happening and occurring over the next few days. We are seeing over 100 aftershocks that are hitting this region. Some as big as the initial earthquake, 7.8 in magnitude. The fear is that the already susceptible buildings are going to turn into rubble, impacting even more people. You can see on that map, Rosemary, just how many regions. You are seeing metropoles impacted, you're seeing villages which are harder to reach and not getting that initial critical response as quickly as other regions. Now, hopefully, they are going to have some of that pressure alleviated by the international community that is stepping in. The value chain that is required here, you need people, you need sniffer dogs, you need medical assistance, blankets, food, water. Some countries are also stepping in with monetary assistance which will be important for the secondary part of the story in terms of dealing with any disease outbreaks and, of course, the trauma cases which we are seeing coming through. Over 15,000 people, Rosemary, are said to be injured in Turkey alone.",

Yes, we are trying to warm up as we get out of the morning hours and into the afternoon, but as we clear the skies out in the upcoming evenings and early morning hours, all that heat escapes back through the atmosphere and we wind up much colder. So, you're looking at satellite. The oranges, the purples, indicating moisture. That is starting to fade away, meaning that rain chances and snow chances will fade away, which is great, but the problem is the colder air that sets in behind. There is Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday showing you the rain chances and the snow chances starting to fade. But now, the colder air moves in as the winds switch more out of the north and we wind up freezing if not frigid in some cases, especially in central Turkey where temperatures are going to be well below normal. Tuesday into Wednesday, notice the blues, the darker blues, really setting in. That sinking cold air pushes all the way down into Syria where temperatures in the morning will likely be below zero. Aleppo, four below on Thursday morning. High temperatures, well above zero are still below normal. Wednesday, Thursday, Friday in Aleppo are all at eight degrees. That magnitude of 7.8 that struck on the 6th of February early in the morning, that was the epicenter. We have the two plates that we are really focused on, the Arabian plate and the Anatolian plate. The Arabian plate is pushing the Anatolian plate. And along that fault line, we will experience more aftershocks. So, we can expect that here in the upcoming days. Again, it's not a good situation with the cold. Just to reiterate, we are staying below freezing in some of these cases, especially in central Turkey, so we will need to bundle up for many who are going through that process over the upcoming days, Rosemary.",

China continues to insist that this was a civilian vessel that blew, of course, but the U.S. State Department overnight said that explanation rings hollow and insists this was used for spy craft.In fact, according to the White House, they said that they found on this balloon, as they analyze and recover the debris, a propeller as well as an aerial rudder which gave it maneuverability. Earlier, China condemned the U.S. shooting down this Chinese balloon, calling it an overreaction. China also says that it reserves the right to deal with similar situations, but did not elaborate on that. Today, this afternoon, at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a spokesperson said that the debris that is being recovered and analyzed right now by the United States belongs to China, not the U.S. Let's bring up the statement for you. This is according to the MOFA spokesperson, Mao Ning, who said this. Quote -- \"The airship is China's, not the U.S.'s.\" -- end quote. It goes on to say that the United States should have handled it properly in a calm, professional, non-forceful manner, but its insistence on using force is a clear overreaction. The Chinese balloon caused a political uproar in the United States. It also prompted the U.S. secretary of state to cancel his planned February visit to China. The White House says that this Chinese balloon was not for meteorological purposes, but it also says that it plans to maintain a calm approach when it comes to U.S.-China relations. We're going to share with you this quote from the U.S. White House press secretary overnight, saying this.

(END VIDEO CLIP) GOLD:  So, Netanyahu also said that he received that request for Syria -- for help in Syria, through diplomatic channels and we've actually learned from an Israeli security force that that diplomatic security channel was actually the Russian government who came to the Israeli government and asked for help to Syria. Although a Syrian government source speaking to a pro-government media outlet in Syria rejected the notion that Syria had asked the Russians to ask the Israelis for help, although Israeli officials tell me that they are planning to send things like blankets, food, and medical supplies. Still not clear on how that is getting to Syria from Israel. I also actually just heard from two different Israeli aid groups who say that they have chartered a special flight that will be taking off in the coming hours to southern Turkey. They are getting as close as possible as they can. There will be at least a dozen search and rescue specialists. They are also sending more than a dozen medical personnel, doctors, paramedics, as well as people who are -- their specialty is in water filtration, in psycho-trauma, and things like that who can try and help on the ground. We also heard overnight from the Israeli minister of defense they have received approval from the Turkish government to get a field hospital into southern Turkey. That will likely be coming in the coming hours, a day or so. This will be a military field hospital likely coming in on military planes. And I know that more aid groups are trying to get as much supplies as they can onto these planes. From Israel, it's about a two-hour flight to get -- if you can fly direct as close as possible to where this happened. Obviously, there's a lot of issues when it comes to the condition of the airports, of the airfields, how close you can get, of course, the roads. Lots of logistics to be worked out, but there is a major effort from across governments who are around the area. As we noted, we could feel the earthquake, the initial earthquake here and in fact, some of those really strong aftershocks were felt in places like northern Israel that prompted people to evacuate. So,0 there is a very much an awareness here of what's happening. And also, that weather, that winter storm that's affecting southern Turkey and northern Syria, we're feeling it as well down here. And so, there is very much an awareness of what they are facing. Many aid groups, governments from Israel across the (inaudible) territories and to Jordan are trying to send whatever aid they can.

Russia has denied such claims, but the deputy head of Ukraine's defense intelligence says Kyiv expects Russia to mobilize up to half a million additional troops to carry out operations in the east and south.Already, we have seen fierce fighting on the front lines in the east, in the town of Vuhledar, in the Donetsk region, and in the city of Bakhmut where intense battles are ongoing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE (through translation):  In the Donetsk region and in other areas, special attention is paid to Bakhmut, to our defense, to the occupiers that seems to encircle the city and break defense lines there.

You'll remember how unpopular the first wave was, sparking panic in Russia and mass exodus of fighting aged men. So, they may be reluctant to do it again, given the risks of rising dissent at home.This is, you say, is coming from Ukrainian military intelligence. The deputy head of defense intelligence saying that he expects not only a second wave of mobilization, but it'll be bigger than the first, up to half a million men, he says could be mobilized. It could take two months, which by the way is twice the length, timewise of the first mobilization officially. And he says this is designed to fuel offensive operations by Russia in the east and the south. We know that Ukraine has, for many months, been telegraphing that it expects Russia to ramp up offensive operations in the spring and potentially the summer, a major offensive designed to take more ground not just continue what they've been doing in terms of mostly defending the ground that they already have. As I said, the Kremlin denies it. We do know that they are planning to modernize their military including increasing the size of their standing army. And we know from reports on the ground that they have been taking heavy losses so, it could stand to reason that they want to replenish those losses as well as potentially add to their numbers in Ukraine for some kind of spring offensive.",

Vladimir Putin underestimated the will of the Ukrainian people. From soldiers serving as snipers to the 102-year-old great grandmother who is helping them hide and fight. Sam Kiley has her remarkable story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  At 102, Liubov's survival is extraordinary. Not least because she has endured three famines over her century and all of them blamed on the Kremlin. LIUBOV YAROSH, HOLODOMOR SURVIVOR (through translation):  We ate linden leaves and nettles. We used to grind these wild plants into flour, bake with, it and eat it. KILEY (voice-over):  At 13, she saw her older brother and sister perish in Ukraine's worst mass starvation, the Holodomor. YAROSH (through translation):  My legs were swollen. My arms were swollen. I was so sick. I thought I was going to die. KILEY (voice-over):  In the early 1930s on Joseph Stalin's orders, Ukraine's farmers were stripped of every grain they produced to feed Moscow's industrialization. YAROSH (through translation):  Tiny children were dying of hunger. They were taken to a truck. They dug a big hole and threw them all in. KILEY (voice-over):  Ukraine is now 11 months into the latest Russian invasion. Three of her grandchildren are soldiers fighting Russian troops because Russia's president doesn't believe that Ukraine exists. VLADIMIR PUTIN, PRESIDENT OF RUSSIA (through translation):  It should be noted that Ukraine actually never had stable traditions of real statehood, Putin claimed. KILEY (voice-over):  Russia's assault on Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, failed last year. Many Ukrainians believe they are fighting off another attempt at genocide. MYKHAILO KOSTIV (through translation): The leaders and organizers of the genocide sits in the same offices, in the same place. At the center of these events is Moscow and the object of destruction is Ukraine nation. KILEY (voice-over):  Ukraine's government says that thousands of citizens have been forced into Russian territory and 14,000 children are missing. (On camera):  How many millions of people died in the many famines brought upon by Russia in this country over the last century is a matter of debate among historians. So, human rights lawyers will debate whether or not what is happening today can be defined as a genocide. But there is no question that over the last hundred years, the relationship between Moscow and Ukraine has been bleak. YAROSH (through translation):  We need to exterminate them so that not a single one is left. Only then can there be any peace. KILEY (voice-over):  To help the war effort, she ties burlap in the netting to make sniper camouflage. But it may be her laughter that has kept are going so many years.
