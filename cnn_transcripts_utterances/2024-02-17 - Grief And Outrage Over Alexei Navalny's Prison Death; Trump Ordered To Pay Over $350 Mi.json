And we are coming up on presidential elections next month in Russia, where there is not going to be any kind of serious opposition figure, someone certainly of the stature of Navalny on the ballot. Because over the past 20 years of Putin's rule, Russian civil society has essentially been crushed and independent media, there has been -- have been muzzled. So this in a lot of ways is not really an election. It's kind of a reannointment (sic), a sort of plebiscite, you could say, which the Kremlin wants to hold as a form of political theater to show that the Russian people are behind Putin.

Want to get back to one of our top stories we're following this hour.U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been ordered to pay nearly $355 million for fraudulently inflating the value of his properties. A New York judge found that Trump submitted, quote, \"blatantly false financial dates\" when he applied for loans, allowing him to get more favorable rates. Now the judge didn't dissolve the Trump Organization. Instead, it faces additional financial oversight and Trump himself is banned from serving in certain top positions at New York businesses for the next three years. Now Trump is vowing to appeal but in order to move forward, he'll likely have to turn over the full judgment of $355 million. And that's not his first multi-million-dollar legal fine. CNN's Kristen Holmes looks at what his strategy might be to pay it all off. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: In addition to the $355 million that the judge ordered Donald Trump to pay, he was also last month ordered to pay $83 million in the defamation case of E. Jean Carroll. Now obviously, these are both being appealed. How much money he'll end up owing at the end of the day still remains a question. It's going to be a lengthy process. But of course, it raises the question of, does Donald Trump have this money? It's an extremely huge amount of money. And how would he actually pay for this? And in the past, he has used his leadership PAC, his Save America PAC, to pay a lot of his legal fees. When we talk to campaign finance experts, who said that that would be possible, that there are loose interpretations of how the rules work around leadership PACs. So it would be likely that he could dip into that PAC to pay some of these fines. However, there's one glaring issue with that, which is, just in 2023 alone, Donald Trump spent more than $15 million from that PAC on legal fees, leaving the amount of money in that PAC at the end of the year at $5.1 million. That is far short of the more than $400 million he owns in these various legal fines and fees. So one issue there. The other thing to point out here is fundraising. Donald Trump will continue to fundraise. We know he spoke to a number of Republicans who say they don't care where the money's going. They give it to Donald Trump. If he wants to use it for legal fees, he can do that. And they can donate directly to that leadership path. But there is one thing to point out, which is that Donald Trump, most of his money, most of his finances that he raises, are from small dollar donors, small dollar donations. It is very hard to add up to more than $400 million from those small dollar donations -- Kristen Holmes, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Joining us now in London is Andrei Soldatov. He's an investigative journalist and author of \"The Red Web: The Struggle Between Russia's Digital Dictators and the New Online Revolutionaries.\" Thank you so much for being here with us. Let me start with this. Do you believe Putin is responsible for Navalny's death?",

And that may be -- made me extremely angry because, every time I put it on a (INAUDIBLE) tag (ph) gets killed, a journalist or activist or a politician, the Kremlin presents the same line of defense.That's a big to us (ph). So insignificant that it didn't make any sense for Putin to kill him and, to be honest, we all learned, after more than 20 years in power, that actually it made perfect sense for Putin. And political assassination became part of his political toolkit.",

      "sentences": "Navalny built a very successful organization in the country. He is only Russian politician who was capable of doing this. So before he got to jail, he or his organization was capable of organizing protests in more than 100 Russian towns.And that was always seen as a big threat by the Kremlin, despite the fact that Navalny was in prison. Even with Navalny in prison, Navalny's organization stayed extremely active. They're very active at communicating. We have the Russians in the country and Russian diaspora. And given the fact that we have the election, even if everybody understands the results of elections during the war, we all know that the Kremlin is always getting extremely paranoid and they are suspicious before elections.",

What is good that, despite the fact that Navalny was killed, his people, his supporters, organization he build is still there and very much alive and active.And that would help to keep it going. And I think now, while we have so many Russians who are really angry and want to do something about what is going on in the country, so if there would be a chance, it will be chance. BRUNHUBER: Navalny relied and in large part on social media. That was clearly part of his success, maybe part of his legacy. Does that make it easier for someone to pick up the mantle?",

      "sentences": "Yes, to some extent because, after the war started in 2020, not only Russian journalists in exile like me, became very active in social media because this is a way for us to communicate.We have people who stayed in the country but also all Russian political opposition actually moved to online journalism. So every Russian politician and exile has now a YouTube channel or Telegram channel. And they have millions of subscribers. So this technology developed and actually used by Navalny so successfully, now used by many.",

      "sentences": "Well, Putin is a very practical man. And I think it short- term strategy is that it actually would have this chilling effect on hundreds of Russians who are in the country. And even before Navalny was killed, as a cost for going to the streets to protest, were extremely high, sometimes 10 years in prison.So I do not expect any big protest right now. But it doesn't mean that this feeling is not that and people are not angry.",

Now the teams were broken up into four squads this year. The rookies, sophomores and G league players all competing. This is Victor Wembanyama's0 first All-Star Weekend, likely going to be the last time he's not playing in the big game on Sunday. Now Wemby scored 11 points at two blocks but his team would actually lose their first name. It was the Pacers' Bennedict Mathurin just putting on a show for his hometown fans and he would lead his squad to two victories and was named the Rising Stars MVP. Now tonight it's going to be a very busy one for Mathurin and his teammate, Tyrese Haliburton. He's competing in the skills competition and the three point contest. Now Pacers legend Reggie Miller told me yesterday that Haliburton, he just has that \"it factor\" when it comes to being one of the game's next superstars. And I sat down with Haliburton and asked him, how does hearing that make him feel? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
