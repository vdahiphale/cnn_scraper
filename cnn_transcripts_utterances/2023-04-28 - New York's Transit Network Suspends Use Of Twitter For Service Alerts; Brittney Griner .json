      "sentences": "This morning, the largest transportation network in North America is giving up on Twitter. New York's MTA says it will no longer post updates on their subway train and bus service on Twitter. The move affects more than 15 million people who rely on the transit service in and around New York and Connecticut.CNN's Brian Fung has been following this. Brian, why? Why did the MTA decide to do this? BRIAN FUNG, CNN REPORTER (on camera):  Well, John, this all ties back to what the MTA says were multiple and repeated interruptions in its access to Twitter's platform, just twice in the last two weeks alone. And this all likely has to do with some of the changes that Twitter has been making under CEO Elon Musk to the software interfaces that you know agencies like the MTA used to push real-time updates to users. It's the software interfaces that also allow for users to get you know, real-time weather alerts, or for third-party apps to be able to post tweets on Twitter. Now, Musk sees all of this access as a revenue opportunity. So, in the last few weeks, Musk has changed so that it -- he's erected a paywall for this type of Twitter access with three tiers. And I'll just briefly go over those here in a second. He has a free tier that lets you read 1500 tweets a month and not post anything. There's a basic tier that costs $100 a month that gives you a little bit more read-and-write access. And then get this. There's a commercial tier in which Twitter charges $42,000 a month or up to $210,000 a month for expanded read-and-write access. Now we're talking here at the high-end of costs of up to two and a half million dollars a year. Now, obviously, the MTA is not paying for this service. It says that it -- you know doesn't typically make a habit of paying tech platforms to push real-time updates. And it's saying that in this case, in Twitter's case, the reliability of the platform can no longer be guaranteed. Now, the MTA isn't the only transit agency that's worried about this. You also have other first responders and government officials making similar statements. You know you have the National Weather Service saying it is planning to scale back real-time weather alerts for some of its regional Twitter accounts. And you also have academic researchers who are saying, look, even if you pay for the higher tier services of Twitter and its API, the company actually makes less information available to you than it used to back when things were free. So overall, things appear to be you know getting less useful both for Twitter's institutional accounts as well for its individual users, John.",

NYGAARD:  Well, I want everyone to make their own choice, right? As athletes, they have a limited amount of opportunity to maximize their earning capacity, right? Their bodies won't last forever.

I watched your story. It's really interesting. What can you tell us? VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS &amp; POLITICS CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Well, I learned first off, the bat that just one percent of body camera footage is actually reviewed right now. But with this technology, this artificial intelligence called Truleo, the founder says it can review one hundred percent of body cam footage. Here's how it works. This artificial intelligence was trained on five million terms. And there are key terms that the artificial intelligence is looking for, as it's scanning these body cam footage, insults, profanity, and non- compliance. But also on the flip side, sort of positive traits professional language, and explanations. And ultimately, what this is hoping to do is catch problematic behavior with officers early on, so we can possibly prevent situations like Tyre Nichols and George Floyd. So, we traveled to Castle Shannon, Pennsylvania, and spoke to a chief who is using this technology. He talks about the reports he gets every single day about his officers. Listen.
