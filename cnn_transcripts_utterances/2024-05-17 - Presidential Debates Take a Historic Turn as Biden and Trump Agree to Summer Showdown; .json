President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump have accepted CNN`s invitation to debate in June. This is an historically early debate that will set the tone for the final months of the 2024 campaign. And it`s unique because it`s a presidential debate between two people who`ve already done the job. Both men also accepted an invitation for a second debate in September. President Biden released an ad campaign confirming his participation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, (D) U.S. PRESIDENT: Well, make my day, pal. I`ll even do it twice. So let`s pick the dates, Donald.

The competition is trying to show that doing absolutely nothing can be valuable. CNN`s Hanako Montgomery has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) HANAKO MONTGOMERY, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A crowd gathering, media jostling for the best spot to catch sight of a fierce competition among more than 100 people in South Korea recently. They are rivaling each other in Seoul`s annual Space-Out Competition, where contestants have to zone out for 90 minutes without falling asleep or checking their phones. The winner gets determined based on audience votes and competitors` heart rate. This year, more than 4,000 people applied to participate in the competition, the city government says. From an Olympic athlete to bakers, contestants came dressed in clothes that reflect their different professions. KWAK YOON-GY, SHORT TRACK SPEED SKATER (through translator): I tried out for the Olympics five times and have never taken a proper rest while training for 30 years. I heard this place is where I can clear my mind and rest at least during this time. So I came here thinking, wow, this is what I needed so much.
