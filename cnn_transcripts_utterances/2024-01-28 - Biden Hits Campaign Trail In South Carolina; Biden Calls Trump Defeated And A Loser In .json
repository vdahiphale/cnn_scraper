And that's because Nikki Haley is not participating in the caucus here. Instead, she's on the ballot for the primary.But the caucus is really where the states -- a crucial delegate will be awarded. And so, that was a key part of Trump's message on Saturday. He was telling voters to go out to the caucus, skip the primary and really focus on the race for Donald Trump will matter. But because they don't see Nikki Haley as a player here, it also allowed Trump to shift his messaging towards a general election rematch with Joe Biden. And the key issue was talking about the border. Part of that is because the border is a very important issue to Nevada. It's a state with a very large migrant population. But it's also the timing that is noteworthy. I think, you know, in Congress there is this bipartisan immigration deal that Donald Trump has privately and publicly been urging lawmakers to reject. And he went further than he had yet with his rhetoric on Saturday declaring that there is -- quote -- \"zero chance I will support this horrible, open borders betrayal of America.\" Take a listen to how he put it.

Israeli soldiers standing guard near them.Now, we now know that those men were Palestinians who were arrested by the Israeli military inside of Gaza and brought to Israel for questioning. Now, these men were blindfolded. They were barefoot. And if you look in this video, you can see their hands are tied behind their backs and all they are wearing are these disposable white coveralls. Now, it's important to keep in mind that it was about 50 degrees Fahrenheit, 10 degrees Celsius and quite rainy when we filmed this video. And the men in this video seem to be physically exhausted. You can see them kind of swaying around their heads bobbing as they seem to be falling asleep. One man was actually lying on the ground before an Israeli soldier came to rouse him and prop him up. Now, the Israeli military for its part said -- quote -- \"The individuals shown on camera are suspected of terrorist activity and were arrested in Gaza and transferred to Israel for further interrogation. Relevant suspects are taken for further questioning within Israel. Individuals who are found not to be taking part in terrorist activities are released back into Gaza as soon as possible.\" Now, the Israeli military also addressed the condition in which we found these Palestinian detainees. They said that they were wearing these white coveralls because they had been stripped and searched to ensure that neither they nor their clothing had any explosive devices or weapons on them. And they said that they were about to be placed on a heated bus and taken to a detention facility where they would be provided with actual clothing. Now, we were not able to verify exactly how long these men were sitting outside in the cold because an Israeli soldier came to us and directed us once he saw we were filming to leave the premises. Now, as it relates to this -- claimed by Israel that these men are suspected of terrorist activity, it's important to note that while this is the first time that we have actually been able to directly document the detention of these Palestinian men from Gaza, there has been a lot of footage circulating from Gaza of Palestinian men being detained. And in many cases, those men actually turn out to be civilians. They are spotted by their relatives or their friends as civilians. And in December we actually spoke with 10 Palestinian men and boys who had been detained by the Israeli military, held for five days, and ultimately released without charge. Now, these men and boys all of them had swollen wrists. Some of them bruises on their wrists from having their hands tied behind their backs for five days.
