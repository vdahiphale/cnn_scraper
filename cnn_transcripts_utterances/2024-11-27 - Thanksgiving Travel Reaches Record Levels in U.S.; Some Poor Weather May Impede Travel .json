Boston's Logan Airport, Boston, of course, the home of the NBA champion Boston Celtics. Just one piece of trivia there.

The airports this week, busy is an understatement. The busiest on record is actually more appropriate -- 18 million Americans are expected to fly this week, and today the airports will be packed. There is some good news for last- minute travelers, though the weather should not be your biggest headache. The forecast today, good. The forecast tomorrow, not so much. A storm could bring a side of snow for Thanksgiving Day in more than one place.CNN's Whitney Wild is at Chicago O-Hare. Derek Van Dam is tracking the forecast for us. Whitney, how is it looking there now? What are people telling you? WHITNEY WILD, CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT CORRESPONDENT:  It is really picking up, but for the most part, everybody is saying that this is very, very smooth. This is going to be an extremely busy weekend for Chicago area airports. They're thinking, Kate, that there could be more than a million-and-a-half people that come through O'Hare and Midway over the holiday weekend. They're thinking Sunday is going to be the busiest day. They're thinking Sunday is going to be 254,000 people through O'Hare alone, so that gives you a sense of the volume here. Kate, as you mentioned, these are record numbers. Theres going to be an 11 percent increase this year over last year, many more people taking to the skies. But the number that matters, Kate, is this very small number, just 19 cancellations throughout the U.S. That is an absolutely perfect Thanksgiving travel situation, the holy grail of holiday travel. The other numbers that you want to see on a day like this, Kate, look at these security numbers. Look at this. Ten minutes through TSA security, five minutes through premier access, 15 minutes through economy security. Kate, when you have this many people pouring through O'Hare, you can't get any better than those very brief security numbers. I asked a couple of folks out here, what are your tips for traveling this busy holiday season? Here's what they said.. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We've overlaid the current radar with the airport delays. And this is what we like to see. I mean, this is just absolutely perfection from west coast to east coast. There is a storm system, though, that is moving through the Rockies and its bringing considerable snow to I-70. So if you're hitting the stretch of roadway there just east of Denver, could get a bit dicey. But all in all, today is the day we've hit the jackpot. You've hit the lottery. If you've decided to listen to the weatherman and leave the day that you should, which being today. But tomorrow is going to be a completely different story. This storm system and all of its energy is going to kind of congeal over the next 12 to 24 hours and explode in size. Watch, here it is now currently located over the southern plains. And then as we head into the morning and afternoon hours of Thanksgiving, this storm becomes a bona fide winter storm. However, the devil is in the detail here. The rain will be located along the coastline. We know how these things pan out this time of year. It's the interior that will feel the snow. In fact, there are winter storm watches there. And I want to point out this cold front that extends all the way into the southeastern U.S. This system is going to bring the potential of some severe weather. So we need to be aware of this possibility today across Mississippi and Alabama, tomorrow into southeast Georgia. There's the rain and snow accumulation. We could get four to eight inches in the Hudson Valley and into some of the mountains across northern New England. So that would be the trickiest travel conditions, but that's not until tomorrow.

      "sentences": "Well, John, for starters, he is moving quickly because he is more comfortable with how Washington works versus his first time in office. And he feels more emboldened by the Electoral College victory and the size of it that he had just a few weeks ago. But there's other key factor at play here, and that is that Donald Trump is essentially going to be a lame duck from the moment he takes office. He will be a one term president. And on top of that, they can only guarantee that they're going to have control of the House and the Senate for the first two years that he is in office.So what I am hearing is that as fast as Donald Trump has maneuvered during this transition, you can expect that speed to continue from the moment he takes office in January. In fact, one longtime Trump adviser and a lobbyist who is close to many of Trumps cabinet picks, Brian Ballard, he told me, quote, \"Everyone understands we have a two-year window with a majority in the House and Senate. Who knows what happens after that? And if you are not running at breakneck speed, you shouldn't be part of this administration.\" And that speed continued yesterday with another flurry of new names added to his administration, including Jamieson Greer. He is going to be the U.S. trade representative for Donald Trump. He is someone who is familiar with the role, having served as a chief of staff for that position in his last administration. And as we saw already yesterday, that job will be partially put him in charge of negotiating Donald Trump's tit-for-tat trade war that he is already launching with his threats for 25 percent tariffs on goods coming out of Mexico and Canada, so that is a key role that Donald Trump filled last night, and one that will be very important to this effort that he is engaging with as soon as he takes office, John.",

They resigned as his counsel under the rules of professional responsibility, because you can if you believe that your client is engaging in fraudulent or illegal activity and after that happened, it was just a matter of hours that brand new charges were filed, solicitation to commit murder, another charge of murder, and our great producer in the Denver area found out that it was because he was trying to solicit the murder of a detective investigating his own case. So now he's got to get new counsel, he's got another couple of serious charges. But you know, this just started last year because James Craig, very successful dentist in the Denver area. I mean, great practice, lots of patients. He and his wife, Angela had been married 23 years. They had six children. All of a sudden, she doesn't feel well and she's in and out of hospitals in March of last year. She just doesn't feel well. And she's finally to the point of being comatose and one of the managers of his dental practice realized they had just gotten a package of potassium cyanide at the office. And they don't use that in the dental practice. So, even before Angela passed, a homicide investigation was begun and what they found out was that he was buying those poisons. He was researching them on his computer, undetectable poisons, five top undetectable poisons. How to murder someone, make it look like a heart attack. But once he's arrested and put in jail he starts to become friends with the inmates. And according to the legal documents, he asked an inmate hey, can you go? I'm going to write some notes. Make it look like Angela's handwriting can you go up, put them in my house, put them in my truck when you get out to make it look like Angela committed suicide. He then asked another inmate, hey, when you get out, can you go find a couple of women and tell them you know, say that I was having an affair with them. Angela found out she was so upset she wanted to frame me because she wanted to commit suicide and he starts talking -- even his daughter.

There's a lot of green on that pool table between the signing of the deal and what the end state ultimately is going to look like. The good news is, as Netanyahu indicated is that leadership infrastructure and ammunition stockpiles have been eliminated, reduced, and the proximity of all of that to the border of Israel has now reached a state what I would label as an irreducible minimum. Look, there's always going to be some element of that that's there. And that's what we have right now. Will it grow from there? We would anticipate that it would. But this gives Israel and it gives the region an opportunity to see what the next steps are going to look like. It's what we call your trading space for time. You've achieved some objectives.
