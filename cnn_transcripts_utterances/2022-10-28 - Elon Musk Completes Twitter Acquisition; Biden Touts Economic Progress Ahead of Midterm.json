Musk has suggested Twitter could be in for a major shakeup now that he's in charge including possibly allowing former U.S. President Donald Trump back onto the platform.

How to deal with it legally. How to deal with it morally and how to deal with it contextually. That's something that legal scholars and technologists and anthropologists have still have not figured out fully how to deal with. The challenges Twitter faces are in many ways ones for the entire sector and no one has quite figured it out yet.

But the speculation, it was related to the Justice Department's efforts to recover classified documents it believes are still and Trump's possession.The U.S. Supreme Court could have the final word on another critical inquiry. But as of right now, Donald Trump must surrender his tax returns to Congress.
