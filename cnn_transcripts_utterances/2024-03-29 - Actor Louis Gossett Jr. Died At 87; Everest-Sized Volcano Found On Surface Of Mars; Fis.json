      "sentences": "What an awful story. Veronica Miracle, thank you. And movie fans are mourning the death of Oscar and Golden Globe-winning actor Louis Gossett Jr. CNN's Stephanie Elam has more on his trailblazing career.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) STEPHANIE ELAM, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Louis Gossett Jr. played some of T.V., stage, and film's most recognized characters. But behind the scenes, he was an activist with an audacious goal. Ending racism. Gossett debuted on stage as a teenager. A basketball injury had knocked him off the court. He signed up for an acting class and found his calling. LOUIS GOSSETT JR., ACTOR: I grew up with this ability to seek anything without the shadows of my mind. ELAM (voiceover): That first Broadway role was in a play aptly named \"Take A Giant Step.\" Other parts followed, \"Like The Blacks\" and \"A Raisin in the Sun.\" Gossett continued to hone his craft with an eye toward Hollywood, taking classes alongside Marilyn Monroe and Martin Landau. But as a black actor, it wasn't easy. GOSSETT JR.: I had really learned the importance of what it takes to survive in this town. And I had to act as if I was a second class. That to ingest the oldest of being an African American person in America. ELAM (voiceover): In 1961, Gossett made his silver screen premiere in the film version of \"A Raisin in the Sun.\" During the 70s, he appeared in several Blaxploitation films but struggled to land significant and good-paying roles. That all changed in 1977 when he played Fiddler in the groundbreaking T.V. miniseries \"Roots.\" GOSSETT JR.: Pay me a song. I watched the (INAUDIBLE) ELAM (voiceover): Gosset initially didn't want the part. He explained in this Television Academy Foundation interview. GOSSETT JR.: I started doing the research, and I realized there's no such thing as an all-the-time. And those particular people -- those different sections, those particular people, if they had not survived, I wouldn't be sitting here. ELAM (voiceover): He earned an Emmy for his breakout performance in \"Roots.\" But it was his 1982 portrayal of a marine drill instructor. GOSSETT JR.: You said you wanted to meet me in private. ELAM (voiceover): And an officer and a gentleman that thrust Gosset into Bonafide stardom. GOSSETT JR.: I was the only black actor that went up for the officer and gentleman apart. And I got it. ELAM (voiceover): Gossett won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. GOSSETT JR.: Look at me when I talk to you. ELAM (voiceover): He went on to play more tough military roles in the Iron Eagle movies, and the miniseries \"Sadat,\" where he portrayed the late Egyptian leader. In 1992, he won a Golden Globe playing civil rights activist Sidney Williams, and HBO's \"The Josephine Baker Story.\" But then, the actor's career fell flat. By the early 2000s, he was hooked on drugs and alcohol. Addictions he said were fueled by racism experienced throughout his career. By 2006, Gossett was sober and eager to deal with racism head-on. He started Eracism, a nonprofit foundation dedicated to ending racial prejudice, starting with youngsters. Early in 2010, Gossett announced he had prostate cancer, then went on to have a distinguished decade, mostly in T.V. shows like \"Madam Secretary,\" and HBO's \"Watchmen.\" Through it all, he continued to fight racism and set an example as an actor, as an activist, and as a gentleman.

One, because if it is here, it's flat, it spread out, they've located a landing area kind of near the Caldera -- the remains of the caldera where they would be able to put a robotic probe down or people if we ever get there.And the main thing they're excited about is this. They think that underneath that, there may be a vast sheet of glacial ice. And that means water. And water is a big deal when you travel here. Hydrogen, oxygen, rocket fuel, survival for human beings, all of that matters. And it's a bonus too, the location of this. Because if we're talking about this being on the equator of Mars, which is where it is, during the daytime, at the height of temperature, it can feel like 70, 80 degrees right there. That's a really good working temperature. I will warn you. At night, it goes to like 200 below zero Fahrenheit. But in the daytime, that's a good working environment. So, what these people are saying is maybe this is the place we should be looking at where humans could do work when and if we ever get to Mars. In the meantime, go to Iceland, and go to Hawaii if you want to see a volcano. But there's one waiting out there.",

      "sentences": "Alisyn, there are about a couple dozen different scientists at different departments of the states and academia here in Florida trying to solve the mystery of the spinning fish in the Florida Keys. This whole thing started back in the fall, the first multiple reports of the odd behavior of small pinfish, Goliath Grouper, the big-endangered sawfish, all spinning, somersaulting, acting in obvious distress. Some of the sawfish actually beaching themselves into mangroves and essentially killing themselves.Usually, they lose maybe five sawfish a year in Florida. This is an endangered species. They've lost a few dozen as a result of this. Now, they've tested for everything from Red Tide to pollution to try to figure out if that has anything to do with it. Low oxygen levels, perhaps. All of that has come out negative right now. And so, the number one suspect is a tiny single-celled algae. It lives at the bottom of the ocean that eat seagrass called Gambierdiscus. And it creates a neurotoxin that can cause strange behavior in fish. They have anecdotal evidence that some of these fish that are acting crazy have moved -- have moved to clean water and it stops. So, now they have to duplicate those conditions to try to exactly figure out if this stuff is now supercharged as a result of warmer oceans. The temperatures here in the Keys last year hit almost a hundred degrees. Super stressful to all marine life in Florida as well. But this is a new one. And so, it could take months to figure out. There are so many samples to sort through. A lot of folks doing volunteer science to try to figure it out at this level. There are no warnings against eating seafood coming out of Florida as a result of this. Although, you're normally warned against eating Barracuda and other sorts of grouper that might have neurotoxins in them. They don't think that's associated in this case. But it's troubling and it's worth paying attention to. And we'll stay on it to figure out more. Alisyn, back to you.",

And later today -- tonight, Rome time, he will be at the Coliseum for the Stations of the Cross service, which again marks Jesus' suffering and death. And the pope has in an unusual move, written each of the meditations for this service and he's covered a range of topics in them from online hatred to injustices against women.
