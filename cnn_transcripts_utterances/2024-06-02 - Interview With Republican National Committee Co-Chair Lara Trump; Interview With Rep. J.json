I'm Kasie Hunt in Washington, where the state of our union is in uncharted territory.For the first time ever, a former U.S. president, Donald Trump, is a felon, convicted on 34 counts. He will be sentenced by a judge just months before he stands in the presidential election. Last night, Trump leaned into his stance as a self-proclaimed -- quote -- \"warrior\" with a visit to the Ultimate Fighting Championship in New Jersey. And the Republican Party seems to be buying his message. Trump has raised tens of millions in donations since the verdict Thursday in New York, as Republican officials of all stripes are backing him and attacking the U.S. judicial system. But the effect on his bid to unseat President Joe Biden, particularly among independent voters, is far from clear, not to mention the legal consequences of his conviction, which he will appeal. His attorney Todd Blanche told the AP he plans to argue strenuously against potential prison time. And Trump was asked about the possibility he will face house arrest or prison on FOX.

What is he saying will happen? L. TRUMP:  I think you have seen already what's happened. It's that the American people have really spoken up. And, Kasie, they have spoken with their wallets and their pocketbooks. Even in a time where our economy is in such bad shape, thanks to horrific policies by Joe Biden, the American people came out and in 48 hours after Donald Trump's verdict was read our campaign and the RNC raised $70 million in digital fund-raising. This is small-dollar donations. And I think the amazing statistic to take out of that is that 30 percent of that money came in from people who had never once donated to Donald Trump. People are very upset about what they saw happen this week to someone they -- that should never have had a case brought against him. We all know that, if his name had been anything other than Donald Trump, this case would have never seen the light of day. And what people are seeing now is that they can't trust our judicial system. They are very worried about the America that we are facing if this is the precedent we are setting in the United States. And so I think that that was a very quick, very rapid and a very strong response from the American people. It has gone way too far, the judicial system being weaponized against a political opponent. The American people are upset, and they spoke out about it.",

There's nothing to do, other than make your voices heard loud and clear and speak out against this, because this is not the United States of America, Kasie.
