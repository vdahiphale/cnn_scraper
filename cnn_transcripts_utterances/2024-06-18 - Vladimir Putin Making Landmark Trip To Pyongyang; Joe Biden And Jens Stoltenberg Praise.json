That's more than double the statistic from just a few years ago, and that statistic was a point of ongoing criticism from former President Donald Trump and the current GOP opponent.Jens Stoltenberg visit to Washington, he made remarks outlining several priorities for the Alliance as the months proceed. Those include allowing NATO to take a leadership role in the deployment of military aid and the training of soldiers for fighting on the battlefield. He also said that more costs need to be imposed on China for its material assistance of Russia on the battlefield in Ukraine. But this all comes amid far right movements on both sides of the Atlantic that currently challenged the status quo of the Alliance, as well as continued bloodshed on the battlefield in Ukraine now more than 2-1/2 years at war.

It affects impulse control and attention and mood regulation. And then social media adds extra layers on top of that. So, it not only exploits the reward pathways but because it is social, it meets -- needs it is meeting all these developmental needs that are very strong during especially adolescence and in particular, early adolescence. So, the need to role-play, to be seen, to belong, all of those things are being exploited by very sophisticated techniques.So, we actually see like for younger adolescents, with their brain lights up even more strongly than an older adolescent's brain like when they are getting social media cues. So, we know their brains are extremely vulnerable and they are not as able to -- they don't have the impulse control or the executive control to stop using it. So it is really -- really setting them up to be depressed. So all of these brain changes are happening even if they are using it in an inappropriate way and we also see that kids who are prone to being depressed or anxious or have poor social skills, those kids are the most vulnerable and they are having even stronger effects. So, all these effects are playing out. Clinically, we are seeing acuity levels that I have never seen before in 20 years. It is not sustainable. I mean, kids are cutting, they are self-harming. They are overdosing. A lot of them have eating disorder issues and we are seeing it. It is more so in girls, but we are seeing this in boys and young men also.
