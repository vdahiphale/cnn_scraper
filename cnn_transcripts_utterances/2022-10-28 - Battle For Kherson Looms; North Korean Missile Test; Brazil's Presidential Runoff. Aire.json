Welcome to THE GLOBAL BRIEF.Coming up, as the battle for the Ukrainian port city of Kherson nears, a council worker there says soldiers now outnumber civilians on the streets. Also ahead, a serious act of provocation. South Korea calls out North Korea of its latest missile launch. We'll look at the threat of Pyongyang's nuclear ambition. Plus, guns and god, two of the issues facing Brazil's high stakes presidential runoff election. We'll have more from the capital. Ukrainian forces are digging into the trenches near occupied Kherson as they prepare to take back the port city from Russia. It's located on the Black Sea and along the Dnipro River. It was once a major shipbuilding hub. And before the war, almost 300,000 people lived in Kherson. Now, soldiers outnumber civilians. That's according to a local official. Ukraine estimates that Moscow has sent up to 1,000 newly mobilized troops to defend the city and says the mood there is tense. Well, Russia is relentlessly targeting the country's power grid, causing more blackouts. The mayor of the capital says it could take 2 to 3 weeks to repair the power facilities. And Russia is sending a message that stands close to blackmail. Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy chair of the Russian security council, said that the light will come on in Ukraine when the country recognizes Russia's demands. Along the front lines, fighting is fierce but Ukraine's progress is slower than it had hoped. Our Frederik Pleitgen brings us the latest from the battlefield. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
