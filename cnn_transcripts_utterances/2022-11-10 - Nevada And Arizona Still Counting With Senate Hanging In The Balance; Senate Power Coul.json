Take a look at the race between incumbent Democrat Mark Kelly, Republican challenger Blake Masters, is still too close to call, with Mark Kelly leading. We're expecting more results as well tonight in Nevada, where incumbent Democratic Senator Catherine Cortez Masto trails Republican challenger Adam Laxalt, but is closing the gap. Nevada and Arizona, look at the map, if Democrats win both, they hold the Senate, even with a loss in next month's 'Georgia runoff.We've got live reports from both states. Kyung Lah is in Arizona. Gary Tuchman is in Nevada. Let's go to Kyung first in Phoenix. We can see the podium behind you. The hope is we'll get a little more clarity on a new vote tally this evening. What's going on?",

We just heard from his handler that he's just minutes away from coming here to the podium to give us the very latest numbers. She did say that he's looking at some final numbers. So, we expect that there will be just a bit more information when he comes to this podium in just a couple of minutes.What we can tell you is that the elections department says that we are getting a little more clarity about exactly what tonight's numbers will look like when this county releases what they have counted so far. It is going to be ballots from Saturday night, Sunday and most of Monday. So, these are early ballots that were received by mail before Election Day. So, these are what are known as the late earlies. Again, these are ballots that were mail-in ballots filled out and then received here at the elections department before Election Day. So, those same- day -- Tuesday ballots, people who voted in-person on Tuesday, they are not going to be a part of tonight's release. We do know as well, Anderson, that there has been the count -- the count of the so-called box 3 ballots. These are the 17,000 ballots that people who went to the vote centers on Election Day and the printers -- the printer error that happened, there are about 17,000 of those ballots that were not tallied on Election Day. They are being tallied right now, but they are not going to be a part of tonight's vote release. So, expecting much more information from that. The person we're anticipating, and I'm keep looking at the door to see if he is coming, is Supervisor Bill Gates. And earlier today, he did talk about exactly why this is taking some time. It is taking time because this is a slow process, but also because of the volume that were received. And it does look like -- I'm actually seeing the -- tossing to that sound, we're actually seeing him walk his way around the room, Chairman Bill Gates, he is walking around the room. We anticipate that he will have a bit more information, some new numbers from Maricopa County. And I'm just going to drop down here. And so this is a board that has been sharing information as they have it and this is the -- you see them standing back here, as well as Maricopa County recorder.",

But, obviously, the key headline there from the update, Chairman Bill Gates, who you saw here on our program just last hour, he said the original goal had been to count 95 percent to 99 percent of the votes by Friday, but that that goal post has changed, he said, because they had 290,000 ballots dropped off on Election Day. They have to open each one of those, they have to verify the signatures, and he says that's a number that's 70 percent higher than any other Election Day and it is going to take longer because of that.So, let's go to John King at the magic wall. So, John, this is interesting, right? They're saying, look, it's going to take longer. They're still expecting to release tonight, though, Chairman Gates said, more than 62,000 votes from his county, Maricopa, which is the most populous in Arizona. So, how does that fit into the big picture, both what we're going to get tonight and the fact that it is going to take longer to get all of the outstanding votes counted?",

It's frustrating to the candidates in these close races, frustrating to their staff, it's frustrating. If you're Chuck Schumer or Mitch McConnell, you're trying to figure out who's going to control the Senate. So, it's frustrating to a lot of people and it's frustrating to us, to a degree, because we want finality, but guess what, we need to trust the process. It took time in Arizona in 2020, they got it right in the end. But that was held up after recounts. That was held up after lawsuits, so we just need to trust the process.But what does it mean? It means we wait on two and down ballot other critical races. But the two the country is waiting for, the Senate race. Mark Kelly now 99,638 votes ahead. That's why that number is so important. We'll get 60,000 tonight. We will see. The last they released some newly counted votes, Senator Kelly's lead expanded, right? In the governor's race, which I'll get to in a second, Katie Hobbs, the Democrat -- both Democrats had their leads grow a little bit, right? We'll see if that thread continues. That's what we're watching. As they release 60,000, then maybe it's 20,000 next time or maybe 100,000 next time, has the trajectory changed, right? Are there new ballots and those different kind of ballots, are they telling us anything different? Right now, if you're Mark Kelly, you have a 99,000-vote lead, 51, round that up to 52 to 46, you're in the lead but you know there are 400,000 more votes, right? You have 989,000 so far, but 410,000 more. There are plenty of votes to change this race, is what I'm trying to say, which is why we need to watch with each installment that is released. Is the trajectory changing? Are they each getting about the same percentage or has that changed? And so this is in the Senate race, and then I'll just put up the governor's race for you. Please jump in if you have a question. This one is closer, right? This one is closer. So, 410,000 can change either one of these races. When you have a 16,677-vote lead, simple math there, there's more of a possibility that it could change. The question is, in 2020 when we were waiting, the votes followed a certain pattern, right? And in Arizona, it was interesting. Yesterday, both Democrats increased their leads when the votes came up. In Arizona, Biden had a lead that was shrinking as they released more votes. He held on in the end and won the state by 11,000 votes and changed, but there was a lot of hope in the Trump campaign, which was first criticizing the process repeatedly, saying it's taking too long, why are we waiting, and then they started to voice hope when the Biden lead started to come down. In the end, when they were done, Joe Biden won and he won Arizona. That's the process we are going to have to wait for again.",

The question is how big is that some.Well, Rupert Murdoch's media empire, which obviously was once solidly behind Trump, is now blaming the former president for the GOP (INAUDIBLE). A cover at the New York Post today read, Trumpy Dumpt, saying that he had a great fall. Yesterday, the newspaper's cover applauded Ron DeSantis' re-election, calling him DeFuture of the party. The editorial page at The Wall Street Journal that was mentioned earlier writing, Trump is the Republican Party's biggest loser, saying his candidates failed at the ballot box, which, of course, is the truth. It also said, since his 2016, he has a perfect record of electoral defeat. Okay. Back with us, our panel. And, Jonah, it's true, he does have a perfect record of Electoral defeat, except for his win for the White House, his first and only win for the White House.

Republicans plan to focus on Hunter Biden's business dealings and they want to link him to his father. Hunter Biden has denied wrongdoing and it's unclear what evidence they have uncovered on him. The president son is facing a federal investigation and a potential tax violations and allegedly making a false statement about a gun purchase. But he's not been charged with any crime. Now, another big investigation that House Republican have their eyes on, a probe of the FBI search of Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate back in August. The likely future speaker of the House, Republican Kevin McCarthy, issued a warning to Attorney General Merrick Garland right after that Mar-a-Lago, telling Garland via Twitter to, quote, preserve your documents and clear your calendar. He was referring specifically to a Republican controlled House investigating the search. And McCarthy in that same tweet said that the Justice Department had, quote, reached an intolerable state of weaponized weaponization. Another likely target of House investigations under Republican leadership. That's going to be President Biden's Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. Republicans really want to go after Mayorkas over the administration's handling problems at the southern border. Now, some far right Republicans have even talked about trying to impeach Mayorkas, and there's been some thrash talk going on. This is Republican Congressman Steve Scalise who could soon be the House Majority Leader talking about Alejandro Mayorkas. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP.
