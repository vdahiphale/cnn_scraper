Before leaving Warsaw this morning, the President met with leaders from NATO's eastern flank and reaffirmed their joint commitment. Quoting the White House here: \"... to stand with the Ukrainian people for as long as it takes. \" Vladimir Putin for his part was also Alliance building, meeting today with China's top envoys saying cooperation between their countries is very important for \"... stabilizing the international situation.\" Russia wants weapons from China. A Pentagon spokeswoman today warning it would \"certainly be a miscalculation of China to provide lethal aid to Russia.\" President Biden had a similar answer today when ABC's David Muir asked him about Putin's announcement yesterday that Moscow was suspending participation in the New START Nuclear Arms Treaty with the US.

There was the speech that the President deeply wanted to deliver that not just laid out the broader stakes here, but also elevated them as well, and then there were the myriad of meetings with key US allies providing a personal commitment, a reiteration of US alliances and the value of them, but also the steadfast effort going forward on what is a war that shows no signs of ending anytime soon. And I think it's those meetings that will probably have the larger impact on this course of these three days. When you talk to officials they made clear, there were substantive and very detailed discussions with President Zelenskyy behind closed doors, with President Duda here in Warsaw, and with those nine leaders of the Bucharest 9 countries earlier today. Those are not just grip and grab handshake type meetings, Anderson, those are tangible meetings about next steps, about what's needed in this process ahead and about very complex and difficult decisions that need to be made. Those decisions and how they bear out will probably be the real test of how successful this trip was in the long term.

I think that the truth is, were China to start aiding Russia in a significant way, it would be a game changer. The Russians are running out of supplies, they're running out of missiles, they're running out of high-tech gear, China could fill many of those gaps, not all those gaps. And the state of US-China relations are so bad, it is not clear what the Chinese have to fear. The Biden administration has already continued the Trump tariffs, they have blocked China's access to lots of high tech equipment and computer chips. They're putting in place more processes to do things like that, that deny China access to a number of the kind of key technologies they need. So you can imagine from Beijing's point of view, they're asking themselves, what do we have to lose?

We still could have a better relationship with China than we do. It is not absolutely necessary, as you say, for them to be so closely aligned with Russia, and China, unlike Russia is not fundamentally a spoiler state, by which I mean, Russia thrives on this kind of geopolitical tension. Oil prices go up, it helps it. China thrives in an open, peaceful, prosperous trading world. That's how they've grown strong. And so it's an interesting question as to whether there is anything the Biden administration can do to wean China away from Russia, because they have -- put it in another terms, Anderson, of the three major nuclear powers in the world, to have to have them closely allied with their missiles pointing at the United States is a sobering prospect.",

They've also asked people in the city of Kherson, which is a city in the south that was liberated a few months ago but has come under just constant shelling with the Russians sort of have pulled back their forces, but can still hit it pretty hard.

Once again, residents of East Palestine, Ohio and Governor Mike DeWine join Jake Tapper for live CNN special \"Toxic Train Disaster.\" Ohio residents speak out about 20 minutes from now, right here on CNN.Meanwhile tonight, more than 1,600 flights were canceled tonight as a powerful winter storm hit much of the country, more than 65 million people, all the way from California to Maine are under winter weather alerts. Senior Meteorologist Jennifer Gray is tracking it for us. So, where are conditions the worst right now and where is the storm heading? JENNIFER GRAY, CNN'S WEATHER CORRESPONDENT: Well, conditions are going to be the worst across portions of the Midwest, places like Western Minnesota, South Dakota, North Dakota, you can see that blizzard warning in effect. We are going to see blinding conditions with just driving snow, very strong winds. In fact, some of these winds will be anywhere from 50, maybe 55 miles per hour across the southwest. We could see winds of 60 to 70 miles per hour. So you can see where the biggest impacts are going to be. These areas shaded in red. Also power outages are quickly piling up. More than a quarter of a million power outages with very frigid temperatures. We are going to see very high impacts across the Sierra as well as the snow piles up. So here's the radar and you can see where the snow is now. That northern tier across the northern plains, Midwest, the great lakes, that's going to continue to come down throughout the overnight hours. We're also seeing icing across these areas and that's also going to make travel nearly impossible throughout the overnight and early tomorrow. This should be winding down though, by the time we get to midday tomorrow and moving out. This is going to have a huge impact on northern New England as well because we could see a foot to a foot-and-a-half of snow there. As far as the ice goes, we could see a quarter to a half-inch of ice. And here is the snow yet to come. We could see an additional eight inches of snow across the Midwest. And as this moves into New England, Anderson, we could pick up as I said a foot to a foot-and-a-half of snow.",

The president has not actually gotten off yet. You actually can see the stairs are being brought to the plane. You heard Phil Mattingly at the top of the hour, his sources at the White House telling him that they are pleased with the president's visit and what the president accomplished as the anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine approaches.Meantime, the all but declared presidential candidate see our Florida Governor Ron DeSantis took a big leap forward in the money primary this month, with some seven-figure checks from top Republican donors. According to records viewed by CNN, DeSantis' operation got a $2.5 million check from one donor and a $1 million apiece for two more. CNN also reports his total cash on hand now puts him on a about equal footing with the former president. This comes on the heels of the president's day campaign style stops at New York, Philadelphia and Chicago area police officers. This weekend, he's scheduled to host a three-day donor retreat, a few minutes' drive from the former president's Mar-a-Lago estate. And then next week, another potential campaign signifier (ph) a new memoir comes out followed by a future book tour. Joined now by our Senior Data Reporter Harry Enten with more. So, does it surprise you that DeSantis is getting these big checks without even announcing? HARRY ENTEN, CNN'S SENIOR DATA REPORTER: No, I'm not surprised at all, Anderson. The reason I'm not surprised at all is, look how much money he raised during his 2022 bid -- re-election bid for Florida governor, north of $200 million -- north of $200 million, and look at how much Trump raised in essentially the first month and a half of his campaign ending at the end of 2022, only about $10 million, in fact a little bit less than that. And you know, money isn't everything in politics, in a presidential bid, but you can't have a successful campaign without having money on hand.",
