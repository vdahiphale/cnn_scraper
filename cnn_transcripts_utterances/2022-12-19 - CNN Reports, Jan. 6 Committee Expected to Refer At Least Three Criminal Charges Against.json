And today is the culmination of this investigation that's been going on for a year-and-a-half.Now, this is not a type of hearing where we are going to see more witnesses testify. The investigation itself is done. Today is a business meeting. And there are two key items on the agenda. The first is, as you noted, the question of a criminal referral. Who does the committee believe after this investigation should potentially be held criminally responsible for what happened? They're going to make recommendations to the Justice Department, we expect at the top of the list will be former President Trump. They are expected to recommend that he be charged for three different crimes, including insurrection, obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy to defraud the federal government. Now, we know from our reporting that they're also considering criminal referrals for other individuals but at this point it is not clear if that will happen today or at all. But these are largely symbolic. The Justice Department, they're on it. We know they're already investigating the former president and his associates for their roles in January 6. That is handed off to Jack Smith. So, there is no guarantee to be an indictment just because they made this referral. The other big thing we can expect today is the committee is going to vote to approve its final report. That's the big summary of everything that they've uncovered. We'll get a summary of that report later today. The final report, though, won't be released until Wednesday. But it is a historic day on Capitol Hill, no doubt.",

Now, the question is can anyone be convicted of a crime based on what they've seen thus far. Of course, not, and that is for prosecutors to decide.",

And so I think that that just, as a historical matter, is extremely momentous.Now, who will it impact, who will pay attention to this, you know, integrate the findings of the report, that is an open question. I think generally, as we've seen, there is a core group of people who are always behind Donald Trump no matter what and everything is a persecution against him if you -- the investigation was would be just yet another persecution, but I think that there are a lot of people in the country who are open minded and who are more in the middle and certainly, if we're going to talk politics, are people who are the swing voters who could be impacted by this, by the findings, and what is in the report, and a criminal referral and what the Justice Department ultimately does.",

Yes, they have a week if Democrats really wanted to or the committee really wanted to go down the road of charging their colleagues with crimes, they certainly could try to, but to backing up Kirsten's point, look, come next year, Republicans will have these gavels and it might be in Democrats' interest to just let them blow these subpoenas off because turnabout is fair play and they'll have every opportunity to block off subpoenas next year if they are -- and they're going to be subpoenaed, let's be clear.",

He says this is the first time in his life he's ever had to spend the night on the street and he feels completely lost. A thin pair of New York Giants socks and unlaced shoes won't be enough to get through the frigid night.

The city has learned exactly what it looks like over the last several months to see these asylum seekers who cross along the southern border, many of them either bused by Republican governors or coming here on their own, but all of them certainly adding strain to the situation here with roughly 100 asylum seekers arrived here this morning, part of that ongoing trend of these buses coming here to New York City. Still two more buses expected later today.And, yes, the flow has greatly reduced compared to where we were but the numbers are not going to stay like, that according to New York City officials -- that the city does need financial help, already spending roughly $1 billion to house, feed and educate some of these asylum seekers, of course, talking about their children in some of the city's schools. And the city recognizing that now with Title 42 potentially going away in a couple of days, that those numbers are going to continue to increase. You mentioned those numbers. Roughly 31,000 asylum seekers already processed by New York City officials, about 21,000 of them still sheltered here in New York. So, what they expect here, according to a new financial analysis that was prepared by the city, is that if these trends continue, then New York City stands to spend roughly a billion dollars a year for the next four years, according to the comptroller's officer. This has created a very sort of uncertain financial factor that the city has to deal with it. So, what we're hearing right now, Erica and Jim, are these growing calls for not just the federal government to step in and assist financially but also the state of New York, which, according to New York City Mayor Eric Adams, both have been unresponsive right now, both state and the federal government, when it comes to helping foot the bill. So, it will be interesting to see now with Title 42 potentially going away. As we know, many of the families that were coming in were Venezuela asylum seekers. They had few to no social ties, so they were very relying on the government, or at least in the city government, to be able to house them. So, it will be interesting to see now we see more Mexican nations, more Central Americans, more South Americans coming in. And if they do have some of those social ties, and perhaps they would be less of a burden but we'll certainly have to see that there is still a lot up in the air as we get closer to the removal of that Title 42 protocol.",
