That's when it seems to be the most people will show up to try to sneak in and cast their ballot in-person or drop off their absentee ballot.So, we're here at Ponce library here in the heart of Atlanta in Fulton County. And this is one of the busiest locations we were told by a poll worker, people will come by, this is where we saw lines and the afternoon, last weekend, but again, a bit too early to have those lines, just some steady foot traffic coming in to the library and coming in to vote. I believe seen record turnout here in the state of Georgia. Let's take a look at those national numbers though. When you look at 46 states in the union, you see more than 17 and a half million people have already cast their ballots. But when you look a bit further at that youthful, the younger folks between the ages of 22 to 29, only about 4% of them make up the ballot count. We were at about 7% this far into the 2020 election. So, we're not seeing that younger population come out. Really, it's people who are 65 and older who are driving that early vote count. And so last night, we went to a concert that was held here in Atlanta to really encourage people, the younger community to get out and vote. And we spoke with a man who explained what he says, people are just not voting at least early voting that younger demographic. Take a listen to what he believes is the disconnect.

So less on a limiting abortion and increasing access to guns, more on those economic and pocketbook issues, and him also touting, you know, how strong the state's economy is, which he credits to him reopening the state during the Coronavirus pandemic.We expect Stacey Abrams to go much harder on the contrast with Brian Kemp. Her message to voters is, yes, Georgia is a great state, I can make it better. And so, she's really, really trying to drill in on those things that she says Governor Kemp has not done such as expanding Medicaid and other things for health care access, better Schools, more opportunities for jobs and affordable housing.

Doctor, appreciate your time. I know you say that your hospital is absolutely packed with children. Give us a sense of what we're seeing, especially when it comes to the emergency department. DR. CHARLES SCHLEIEN, MD, SENIOR VP AND CHAIR, PEDIATRIC SERVICES NORTHWELL HEALTH: Yes. We are really busy. RSV disease is typically the number one cause for admission into children's hospitals really across the country. So this has been very, very early. Typically, we see it a little bit later in terms of the peak, where the emergency rooms, really across the region and across the country are running anywhere from 50 to 100 percent greater in terms of the number of encounters, a number of kids really coming into those emergency departments. And then that's translating into, of course, many more admissions into the hospital with RSV disease, again, which is typically a common diagnosis. But this is really a lot and has been fairly overwhelming to the hospitals.",

And we're doing things, though that are pretty unusual, you know, opening up units that typically don't take inpatients, doubling patients up where it is safe to do so, you know, cohorting patients, particularly babies with the same diagnosis in rooms that typically take one.So our nurses, our physicians, our technicians, respiratory people, you know, are really, you know, everybody's working over time, everybody's doing what they need to do.
