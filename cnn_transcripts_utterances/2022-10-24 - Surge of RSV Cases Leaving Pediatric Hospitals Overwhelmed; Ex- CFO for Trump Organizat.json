It's essentially to remember that refusing to raise the debt limit is about as fiscally responsible as refusing to pay your credit card bill.All this makes it more likely for Democrats to take the debt ceiling off the table once and for all in the post-election lame duck session of Congress, and some proposals are gaining traction. But the broader point is a reminder of how far we've fallen from what were once bipartisan principles on big issues of fiscal and foreign policy. Strengthening NATO, standing up to Russian aggression, defending democracy were deservedly bipartisan issues of support. So is the principle of not holding the full faith and credit of the United States hostage for ideological aims just because the president is from a different party. And that's your Reality Check.",

The judge will begin the screening of prospective juror, those are all residents from Manhattan, until they come up with a pool of 12 jurors and several alternates to hear this case. This trial is starting off this morning despite there being someefforts to reach a kind of plea agreement. According to sources, the Manhattan district attorney's office was insisting that the Trump Organization pleaded guilty to some felonies, and according to these sources, lawyers for the Trump Organization only wanted the company to plead guilty to a misdemeanor. And the sources tell me that the former president himself did not want his organization to take any sort of guilty plea in part because of the concern of how that could potentially play politically. As you said, the prosecution will call several witnesses, among them the former chief financial officer of the Trump Organization, Allen Weisselberg. He pleaded guilty to 15 felonies as part of this same tax fraud scheme. He is expected to cooperate. His lawyers tell me he has been meeting with lawyers for the prosecution and the Trump Organization in preparation for this testimony. And as part of his plea deal, he will be required to testify truthfully, and if he does so, he could face about 100 days in jail. If the prosecution is not satisfied with his testimony, the judge could potentially sentence him to up to 15 years in a New York state prison. Now, Weisselberg is going to testify truthfully according to his attorney, but he is not expected to implicate the former president or any of his adult children. John, Brianna?",

So it will be just interesting to learn a little bit more about how it operates, how much money it makes, is it really the successful business that launched Donald Trump eventually to the presidency.But two, I want to see how they thread this needle with Allen Weisselberg because his plea agreement requires him to plead guilty, of course, and then testify against the company. If he as CFO concocted the scheme, enacted this scheme on behalf of the company, that would be good enough, but apparently the defense is going to be he did it all himself, he's a rogue employee. That to me requires prosecutors to ask him about who else knew, who of the other top executives, including Donald Trump, knew about this? We also know that he, according to basically all sources, knew everything that was going on in the Trump Organization. So to me, how are they going to question him, and how is he going to testify in such a way that he implicates the company but not the other top executives?",

Two S-300 missiles, one landing right behind me, you can see here, the size of that crater, and then the second literally slamming right into that apartment building in the top couple of floors. It's something of a miracle, Brianna, that nobody was killed in this.And what is sort of striking is no one here can seem to work out what the target was. This is a residential area. There are apartment buildings all around. I want to show you over there, this is a children's playground, OK. And you can see what's left of it. Now, the strike happened in the early hours of the morning, as I mentioned, so no children were out playing. But I think it gives you a feel for just how challenging it is for so many Ukrainians, particularly in the sort of embattled southern regions, to go about having any semblance of a normal life. It's also very striking, though, if you can see right behind me, they are already cleaning up, they are welding those pipes, those water pipes, back together. They are clearing debris. They are coming and grabbing whatever personal possessions they can salvage to get out of here, which again, I think it speaks to the sort of broader resilience of the Ukrainian people, and certainly the people of Mykolaiv. But definitely they have not had a break between S-300 missile strike, constant drone strikes, and this place is really bearing the brunt. Electricity is out all the time. Water, you can't get fresh water here now. They have sort of salt water and then they have daily lines across town where you can go and get fresh water.

We actually managed to speak to someone on the ground in the city of Kherson. He said that Russia has pulled out its civilian administrative infrastructure, the passport office, the pension funds, the firefighters, they have all been pulled out of the city along with a lot of the soldiers who had been there for the better part of the last eight months.But they are replacing some of those soldiers, with newer, younger soldiers, who this resident we spoke to believed to be conscripts. And actually today, Ukrainian's head of intelligence, of defense intelligence, came out and said, it doesn't actually look like the Russians are preparing to withdraw, despite there have been some hopes that that might be the case. But it looks instead that they are preparing for some kind of a mission to try to defend the city and to continue to hold on to it. And that, of course, spells misery for many of the residents who are still holding on and holding out in Kherson with the hopes that Ukraine might be able to liberate the city soon.",

And while we haven't seen a lot of RSV in the last two years, we certainly know as pediatricians what RSV does, especially to the youngest, the smallest infants. And the biggest issue -- the biggest thing I want to tell all the parents out there is that the smaller your child is, especially under one year of age, but certainly under the age of two, because they're so small, RSV clogs up the airways. And so that means the smaller you are, the smaller your airways are, the easier it is to clog and the harder time those small infants have to breathe. And so if your child is having problems breathing, they're breathing too fast, or they're struggling too much or they are wheezing, that's the time you need to reach out to your physician for him or her to be seen.",

Now, it's more of a summer. But this is something that we've dealt with and we see how much these infants really struggle or children who have lung problems like asthma or who have heart problems or immune problems, all of them can get sick or very sick at any age. But certainly any child without those can get sick if they're very, very young. If they're having a difficulty breathing, they are coughing so much that they can't eat or drink, then they're going to get dehydrated, and then everything's going to snowball right after that.
