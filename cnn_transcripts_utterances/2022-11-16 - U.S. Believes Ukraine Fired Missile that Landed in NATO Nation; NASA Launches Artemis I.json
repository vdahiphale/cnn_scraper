We are now learning it was not Russia that fired a missile into Poland that killed two people overnight. Obviously, Russia -- Poland is a member of the military alliance known as NATO. But instead, initial U.S. assessments are that it likely came from Ukrainian forces. This development comes as NATO ambassadors are holding an emergency meeting this morning to discuss the deadly explosion.

      "sentences": "Yes, two officials who are familiar with the initial U.S. assessment say -- this assessment says that the missile did not originate in Russia but that it originated in Ukraine.And we do know that Ukraine uses Russian-made missiles in its air defense systems. And it does seem as if this is what President Biden was alluding to when he emerged after crisis talks here at the G20 and said that it was unlikely that this missile originated in Russia. Of course, he wanted to say that -- he wanted to be definitive. He wants to look at all of the intelligence first before he can come out and say with any certainty where this missile originated. And I think that's because of the implications that are at stake here. Poland, of course, is a member of NATO. You have Article V, which is the common defense treaty. An attack against one is an attack against all. And certainly, President Biden and other Western leaders want to be absolutely sure that they know where this missile originated before they come out and say so definitively. Now, we do know that this assessment was a topic of discussion among the leaders when President Biden convened them at his hotel here in Bali, members of the G7, some members of NATO states. We also understand that it will be discussed in Brussels today as NATO members begin talking about a way forward, talking about this analysis. Now, what a National Security Council spokesperson said is that the U.S. will support Poland's ongoing investigation. And this is still being investigated. They're sort of bringing out the pieces of the missile, putting it back together, trying to figure out where it came from. And we also heard from an adviser to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who did not deny reports that this missile originated in Ukraine but essentially said that any casualties in this war are the responsibility of Russia, because it began this conflict -- Kaitlan.",

Was -- very simple question: Was it a mistake? MAJ. GEN. MIKE LYONS (RET.), U.S. ARMY: Yes, it looks like it's a terrible mistake because of the Ukraine air defense platform. So they're deployed in depth across Ukraine in such a way to protect the major cities and the infrastructure. And what happened is, for the past 24 hours., Russia has been firing hundreds of missiles in here. And as one gets close to leave here, for example one of these air defense systems is a chaser; hits it from behind, likely gets it close to the border and then pushes that debris right over the border. It's only 4 kilometers, the target makes no sense from Russia's perspective. Again, you look at what happened on the ground, it looks like it was remnants from air defense systems.",

The other one I want to point out is he talked about Mexico, and he said that the border wall was completed. This one was actually more interesting to me, having been following him around the country, because he has said the border wall isn't done. He has campaigned on that, saying they're going to finish the wall. So that to me was also an interesting one, that he claimed it was done in this speech. And then the last one is something that we've heard him say over and over again. He claimed that Obama had taken several presidential records with him to Chicago, and that, again, is something that has been disproven in a public statement by the National Archives.

And I do think that we do need to move in a new direction. I think that a lot of Republicans, both publicly and privately, have expressed dismay that he announced so early, especially with the Georgia Senate runoff happening.
