Thanks so much.Well, Hunter Biden, the son of Joe Biden, is now the first child of a sitting U.S. president to be found guilty of a crime after his conviction on three federal felony gun charges. The president embraced his son after landing in Delaware hours after Tuesday's verdict. The jury deliberated for less than three hours, concluding that Hunter Biden violated laws meant to prevent those suffering from substance abuse from buying or owning a firearm. And of course, it created an awkward political moment for the U.S. president, who just hours after his son's conviction, was speaking at a previously scheduled gun safety event, heralding his efforts to strengthen gun laws and enhance the penalties for those who violate them. Well, let's discuss this with Areva Martin, an attorney and legal affairs commentator. She joins us from Los Angeles. Good to have you with us.",

Given that he is likely to demonstrate a great deal of remorse, given the types of mitigation letters and testimony I expect that we will see from supporters and friends, I think he'll get the lowest sentence possible. And I think it's so important to note that this case, the case that was brought against Hunter Biden, several former prosecutors who had been in charge of U.S. attorneys' offices said this is not the kind of case that they would have even brought. So I think we can't overlook or gloss over the political aspect of this prosecution. So I don't expect there to be any sentence in the range of what's being reported with respect to the 25 years.

It seemed like the trial was about embarrassing Hunter Biden and therefore embarrassing the entire Biden family more so than seeking justice. I was quite surprised, I should say, at the outcome, the verdict by the jury. I thought there would be jury nullification. I thought the jury would look at this and say, this just doesn't pass the smell test. There's something blatantly unfair about this prosecution. But they looked at the facts and said they put aside the reality that this was the president's son and reached their conclusion.

And that's probably a lot of testimony about his drug use, about his addiction that probably had something to do, played some role in why he did not pay his federal taxes. Again, this is the case, too, Lynda, that ordinarily would have been resolved by plea deal.
