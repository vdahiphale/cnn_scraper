      "sentences": "Hello everyone. Thank you so much for joining me from New York.I'm Fredricka Whitfield. And we begin this hour with a pair of dueling decisions creating a flash point in the fight for abortion rights. In Texas, a federal judge is halting the FDA's more than two decades' old approval of the drug mifepristone, one of the main medications used to provide abortions. But less than an hour later a conflicting court ruling out of Washington State. The federal judge there protecting access to the drug in 17 Democratic led states and the District of Columbia, which sued to protect the medication. The two decisions are the most significant on abortion since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last summer. Here with us now is CNN senior Supreme Court analyst Joan Biskupic. Joan, good to see you. Also, you're the author of the new book, \"Nine Black Robes\". So two rulings now, two very different decisions. What happens next?",

      "sentences": "Well, this puts the abortion issue right back on the path to the Supreme Court. Attorney General Merrick Garland said last night that the government is going to appeal this decision to defend the Food and Drug Administration's review and approval of this abortion drug, saying that it was a very comprehensive review that led to the approval, that it was scientifically, medically sound and that it's safe for use. And the government's, you know, definitely going to put forward that appeal. First step would likely be the Fifth Circuit, a regional court, and then all the way up to the Supreme Court. But let me just give you some context about the Supreme Court. Youknow, everyone is well aware of what the justices did last June. Five justice majority completely rolled back Roe v. Wade nearly half century worth of precedent on women's privacy rights, reproductive rights. But the question now, though, is the authority of the Food and Drug Administration to regulate medicine and drugs and health and, you know, health care. It's a much different question. And as much as the Dobbs decision was a thunderbolt in the constitutional law if this ruling by a lower court judge in Texas the main one that happened last night, Fredricka is allowed to stand, it would really shake the medical and healthcare field. But I do want to mention something about just what the justices said last June when they ruled. Critical justices to that opinion did say that they were not outlawing abortion nationwide, that they wanted to leave it to the states. And Brett Kavanaugh, who apparently was the critical fifth vote, made a very strong declaration in a separate opinion back in June, saying that judges were not going to be in the policy business anymore. They were not going to be making moral judgments. And when the case comes up this time around, I do think there might be some shifting of votes that would allow the Food and Drug Administration to keep this drug on the market.",

You know the process and the process works really well.Now a pharmaceutical company might say, wait a second, I'm going to invest billions of dollars go through this process and then a single judge can say no, we don't think the FDA did its job, we're pulling this drug off the market.

      "sentences": "Yes Fred. Well look, the White House has really been bracing for this moment and frankly worried, given the Trump appointed federal judge's background and past rulings that the outcome could come out like this. And now we are here.So President Biden last night in a statement, he slammed the decision. Now I want to read you a part of it because it is very forceful, Fred. The president, he wrote that the court in this case has substituted its judgment for FDA, the expert agency that approves drugs. If this ruling were to stand then there will be virtually no prescription approved by the FDA that would be safe from these kinds of political ideological attacks. This does not just affect women in Texas. If it stands, it would prevent women in every state from accessing the medication, regardless of whether abortion is legal in a state. It is the next big step toward the national ban on abortion that Republican-elected officials have vowed to make law in America. Now we also heard from Vice President Kamala Harris, someone we know who's been deeply engaged on this issue yesterday in Tennessee. And she said that the Biden administration would stand with women and called this a dangerous precedent. But we can tell from these two statements from the vice president, from the president himself that a couple of things are on the White House's mind when it comes to this appeal. First of all, that the White House does not believe that this judge has the purview to decide whether or not the FDA did its due diligence, did it basically its job in approving this drug for the market 20 years ago. And that also just the impact, the massive impact really, that it would have on women and doctors if this drug that they relied on for 22 years was no longer available. Now, when I've talked to White House officials in the past, both in the West Wing and the vice president's office and asked them what would happen if the judge ruled this way. The White House was very clear to say, look, let's wait for the ruling to come down, and now it has. So all eyes will be on the White House to really lay out beyond the appeal process, which is now underway and beyond their calls for federal legislation, which is unlikely to happen in this current congressional makeup. What else the White House is prepared to do to safeguard access to abortion in this really unprecedented time, Fred.",

Representative Gloria Johnson, who you saw there also raising the fist holding hands, is white. She was among the three who protested but she was not ousted. She helped lead in the demonstration.

So now the focus is really shifting to filling those two new vacancies in the statehouse. So local lawmakers in the districts of Jones and Pearson they are working to figure out these next steps, and that could mean returning those ousted lawmakers back to the house chamber. So Fred, Monday very big meeting happening in Nashville Metropolitan Council holding a special meeting for 30 Central, where they are looking to not only nominate Justin Jones, that's his district but also appoint him within the same meeting. Now the flip side on this is that there is a rule within the council that these two things must not happen within the same meeting. So they're going to hold a vote to suspend the rules and I'm told by Jeff Syracuse, a council member that if just two council members object to suspending the rules, should nominate and appoint within the same meeting. Well, then that will slow down the appointment and we could be looking at a week later, April 18th should Jones have the numbers to then be sent back to the statehouse, Fred.",

The red states are moving very aggressively to lock into law the preferences of their predominantly white, predominantly non urban, predominantly Christian electoral coalition. And as they do that, they are also working very assiduously to block either the federal government from setting -- from interfering with their rules or to preempt local governments that are more diverse and more blue leaning, and you see all elements of that this week. I mean, this mifepristone decision is part of the effort to build a nation within a nation and it reflects the attempt to hobble federal power and then eliminate -- expelling these two young men from office is really the ultimate form of preemption.

The general trend in American life since the 60s has been to nationalize more rights and to reduce the ability of states to constrict those rights. And now what we see is the red states working hand in glove with a Republican majority and a Republican minority in the Senate, a U.S. Senate that uses the filibuster and that conservative majority on the Supreme Court. We are moving back in the opposite direction toward a pre 60s world where your rights and liberties varied much more depending on your zip code. And that is the fundamental trajectory that we are watching, and it is unfolding on both the political, legislative, a legal as you see in the mifepristone case, and it is not clear exactly that there are answers for those who support civil rights and civil liberties to maintain a unified floor across the country in the face of this, um, counter offensive.",

You talked about his, you know, leg and his foot injuries that was in 2021.There have been so many times up to and since that 97 Masters win that he would come from behind and clinch it. So what will it take for him to at this point really stay in the game, and you mentioned how special it is this courses for him to be there. It's a challenging course to walk, let alone play.

He's clearly not at his best physically.You know he's not going to be able to play to win this weekend. He's too far behind. But he has a lot of pride. And you know, I think he's shown that many, many times in his career. You know, a few years ago in 2020 the year after he won the Masters, Tiger made a 10 on the 12th hole. He hit it in the water three times. It was just very uncharacteristic. It happens. And what did he do? He could have just mailed it in. Just got to the clubhouse and steady, birdied five of the last six holes. I mean, he just has this sort of you know, he has a drive that a lot of people don't have. It would be easy to give up at this point. It would be easy for him to just kind of maybe even not drug continue right now, the conditions being as tough as they are, but just not really his style.",

The PGA tour has these university of rankings that help you get status when you're when you come out of college, and he is ranked 6th in that for and that's for among seniors. It kind of shows you how good the young golfers are that he is sixth in that, and he's third in the Masters right now. It's amazing accomplishment. I think what he might be more focused on is just hang in there, you know, get through today. Get through the bad weather. A top 12 finished gets him an invite back next year. That would be huge. And you know, if maybe, somehow he finds himself he's going to be playing in the last group today with Rahm and Koepka. It will be a very, very interesting test for him against those accomplished players, you know, just to see sort of how he holds up it. It's going to be fascinating to watch that.",
