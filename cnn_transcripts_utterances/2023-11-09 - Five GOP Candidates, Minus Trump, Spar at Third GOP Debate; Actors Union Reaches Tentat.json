All four of them continued the same, and the fifth one, ignoring the Republican electorate, ignoring independents at a rally and another place in Florida because he's too much of a coward to get on the stage and defend his record.

And one of the initiatives that they alleged that Zuckerberg vetoed is 2019. It would have disabled those so-called beauty filters on Instagram. If you look at the complaint, Zuckerberg, they say, argued that there was a demand for them and he didn't see any data to suggest they were harmful. And then they also alleged in the suit, Meta executives sounded the alarm on well being concerns. According to the complaint, they recommend the company address issues of addiction, self-harm, bullying. This was the summer of 2021. And months later, these documents say, a response came from Meta's CFO who, quote, tersely responded that staffing was too, quote, constrained to meet the requests. Now, these are the allegations in the suit, but they're significant, are they not, especially given how much control Zuckerberg has of this company? FISCHER:  They're very significant, Poppy, because they're starting to lead to other lawsuits. You saw just a few weeks ago you had over four dozen, you know, U.S. state attorneys general join together and say that they're going to sue Meta for this exact reason. They're also significant because if you think about Facebook's user base or Instagram's user base, even more so, it's extraordinarily young. The future of this company relies on those young users.

      "sentences": "Well, you still see the party trying to sort out whether it needs a national position, which is what Tim Scott was arguing for or Nikki Haley arguing for more of an acceptance of the state-by-state regime, which is what we're seeing putting in place now in some of these elections and the state legislatures across the country.She did have an interesting moment with Scott, I thought. He's calling for this national plan, and she said there's got to be 60 votes for the Senate for anything. I think everybody believes that. But the question is can you run a presidential campaign on not having a national unified position as a party. The Democrats are far more unified on this than the Republicans. So, I think the division is going to continue to exist, honestly. And for the candidates who are running for Iowa, like DeSantis, they've got to be here. I think Haley may be playing more for New Hampshire, gives her a little more latitude here to soften the rhetoric because of where she expects to try to make her stand.",

And they're going to lose voters in places like Ohio where I bet they never thought they were going to lose voters.So, this issue, you're right, I think you need to be unified politically in the primary.

The part of the party that has kind of pushed them to embrace the most ardent anti-abortion stances is clearly out of line with the majority of the electorate. And so I think that's what's playing out here on this stage is you have various degrees of willingness from those candidates to really kind of speak to those activists directly. Speak to some of the evangelicals, as Nikki Haley was doing, to basically say we can't go that far on this issue, and, as I would add, as Donald Trump has done over the last year, is kind of create distance from them.But when I talked to the Susan B. Anthony wing, as we were doing our reporting, they're pushing candidates to try to embrace that national standard because they actually agree that not having a stance is hurting the party. So, they would actually say the kind of evangelical, like the most ardent wing, the group of people who see this as a kind of human rights issue, they would say you need to be talking about a 15-week standard, because not having a kind of clear consensus position is not helping the party also.",
