The Nevada Republican Party didn't like that. They said, we want our party-run caucuses.So, there are going to be a primary on the 6th, the caucuses on the 8th. Sounds all very confusing. The simple point is, you win delegates through the caucuses that Trump is participating in. So, that's one of the reasons Haley is not going to Nevada. Other candidates weren't as well.

And Donald Trump did win in New Hampshire, and the percent he got, that is the highest for any non- incumbent in New Hampshire primary. But here's the question, is that the right way to judge Donald Trump as a non-incumbent? He's unusual. He was president of the United States. Some people look at him and say, he is a quasi-incumbent and if you judge this margin as if he were almost an incumbent, it looks a lot different. Look at what happened in 1992 when George H.W. Bush ran for re-election. Pat Buchanan got 38 percent. Everyone thought this was a disaster for George Herbert Walker Bush, and it really wounded him throughout the entire campaign and into the general election. This looks a lot like this. Keep that in mind. There's some other numbers underneath this which are also of concern to some Republicans. Look at moderates here. And, again, yes, Trump won the election, but he got crushed by Nikki Haley among moderates, some 50 percent moderates vote in a general election. We were talking all along about New Hampshire had undeclared voters. You could vote if you were registered undeclared or Republican. Nikki Haley cleaned up there. She won by 30 points. That's a lot of independents. Yes, Donald Trump certainly crushed among registered Republicans. You can take one quick look at that here. He beat Nikki Haley by 50 points. For Nikki Haley, that's a reminder, it's awfully hard to win a Republican nominating contest if you are losing Republicans by 50 points. Finally, you know, as we look ahead -- and Jeff and Kate really alluded to this -- the calendar. The calendar here is something. We are done now with New Hampshire. That was right here. You've got all these days left in January, and you've got all this time before South Carolina, Nevada notwithstanding and the Virgin Islands -- also a favorite of Kate Bolduan's and mine. That's there also, but this is a ton of real estate. This is a ton of time to have to weather attacks if you're Nikki Haley. A whole lot of things can happen during that time. And a lot of them, they're not great. One other thing I want to point out, too, that's of concern to some Trump supporters is this number right here again. And I put it side by side with this. Yes, he won. But in our exit poll, we asked, if Trump is the nominee, right, would you be dissatisfied but not support? Would you not support him if he was the nominee? Look at this. Republicans, 19 percent of Republican voters said they would not support Donald Trump if he were the nominee. Among independents, it's a giant 66 percent. So, look, if you are the Trump campaign, this is glass half full. If you are maybe the Democrats or Nikki Haley, it's glass half empty. The reality might be it's just, you know, Kate, glass half Trump.",

However, depending on who was on board, that is the big question right now. And that's where the Russians are making the accusation that 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war they say were on the plane meant for an exchange with the Ukrainian military to bring them back to Ukraine. The Ukrainians also not commenting on that. However, what we are hearing from the Ukrainians is they do say that there was a prisoner of war exchange that was supposed to take place today, and that that exchange has now been called off. The Ukrainians, however, are also urging to be careful about any information that is put out there.
