Michael Cohen was saying, well, I can't do it because of the Jewish holidays. I can't do it because Trump's out on the campaign trail. And now what prosecutors are saying there is exactly what I was just noting, that Cohen's hope was to delay the payment until after the election and then ultimately not pay Stormy Daniels at all.Well, Stormy Daniels's team seemed to understand that. That was at least their belief of this. And she was considering going public in the media. Then Michael Cohen said, OK, well, I'm just going to pay it myself. And that's when he drew down that home equity line and was able to pay her the $130,000.",

That's, quote, two weeks before the 2018 election.We also understand later on, Michael Cohen began to worry that he was not going to get paid back. And that became part of the reasoning.

His second wife was his mistress.Instead, here, what you have prosecutors focusing on is they say this was part of a conspiracy to suppress negative stories ahead of the election.

And now the prosecutor is walking the jury through the $430,000 payment that Trump did ultimately make to Michael Cohen.This is important because people may look at that and say, well, that's not $130,000. Why is it so expensive? It's because as they were negotiating, as they were just talking about how Trump would actually reimburse Michael Cohen once Donald Trump had been elected. Michael Cohen was worried about the income tax hit that he was going to take here. And he also wanted, I believe it was $60,000 that Michael Cohen wanted, essentially to be paid for his own services here. So that's why it won't be a check just for $130,000.
