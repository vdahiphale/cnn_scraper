The Israel Defense Forces though denies that insisting the explosion was caused by a rocket that was misfired by the militant group Islamic Jihad. Sources tell CNN the U.S. is currently analyzing intelligence provided by the Israelis. According to the World Health Organization, the hospital was treating not just the wounded Palestinians, but also had been shot of a thousands of people are forced to leave their homes. Global condemnation has been swift. The U.N. human rights chief calls it horrific and unacceptable. President Biden says he's outraged and deeply saddened.

JONATHAN CONRICUS, IDF INTERNATIONAL SPOKESPERSON: It's a complex environment.

We just released a few moments ago, the information the first packet of information, which is aerial footage, showing the scene of the hospital from above, and evidence that clearly supports the fact that it could not have been an Israeli bomb. Because there was no collateral or significant damage to the buildings around it, no crater, and nothing that is similar to other locations where Israeli bombs have struck. And once you'll get the material, you'll be able to see it and you'll be able to have proper analysts have a look at it. But the bottom line is that we stand by the information that we released.

And since then, Republicans have been unable to get behind anyone to lead the House and reopen the chamber.Remember the House cannot act until a speaker is elected. No legislation can move forward, everything essentially paralyzed. And Republicans have been unable to get behind a candidate. And when Jim Jordan put his name up for the first ballot on Tuesday, he lost 20 Republicans, in a party line vote that ultimately, he could only afford to lose three Republicans in that particular vote. A significant deficit that he is now working behind the scenes to try to make up. Next vote scheduled for 11:00 a.m. on Wednesday. Can he close the deficit? The concern amongst some Jordan allies is that perhaps the opposition may grow. Some Republicans who were only with him on the first ballot may not be there with him on the second ballot. And this all is coming as concerns are growing in the ranks. Republicans on the Senate and the House side both saying this dysfunction needs to end and raising serious concern about how it reflects on Republicans. REP. KEVIN CRAMER (R-ND): It's problematic obviously. it's hard to function when you're dysfunctional and we need the house to function. In this case, the disrespect for the majority isn't what's problematic to me. And I think that a lot of people look at it and go, my God, that's chaotic. I don't think it helps the brand. What's alarming to me is it's such a small group, such small minority of the majority wags the dog. When the tail is wagging the dog, I think it can look a little rudderless. Things don't have to be unanimous to be united. And right now, there are neither.",

Talks will intensify about perhaps a bipartisan solution. Democrats are floating the idea of some sort of bipartisan deal, potentially even empowering Patrick McHenry, who is the Interim Speaker of the House. He does not have legislative power, but there is some discussion about trying to give him more authority. We'll see how that plays out.Also there could be other candidates who could emerge. Other Republicans could put their hat in the ring to be the next speaker of the house. But they could run into the same problem as Jim Jordan, unable to win over this badly divided Republican conference. Many members simply are angry still about everything that transpired with Kevin McCarthy and made the hard-liners who pushed out Kevin McCarthy want another hard right conservative to be leading the conference. Something that does not go over well with some swing district Republicans. All of this raising major concerns about whether the House can get out of this state of paralysis, whether it can reopen. Unclear if that can happen and when that can happen, or if this will persist in the days ahead. Manu Raju, CNN -- Capitol Hill. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
