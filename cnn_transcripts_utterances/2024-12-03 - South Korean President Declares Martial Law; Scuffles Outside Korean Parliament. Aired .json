This is in front of the national assembly, which is the heart of government in South Korea, where leaders of theopposition have said they are going to come in the middle of the night to try to undo what is happening right here. So it's a couple miles away from where we are broadcasting from. We're in the center of Seoul, right across from Gwanghwamun Square, which is where so many of these protests have unfolded to call for the impeachment of South Korea's president. So it appears as though we have a couple hundred protesters. We are expecting more. This certainly -- to say that this was unexpected is, I would say, the understatement of this early morning. So we're waiting to see how many people get out of bed, come from all corners of South Korea to try to stop this. We don't have reports of violence yet, as I'm just checking my phone and email and reports from the local authorities. Most local authorities are trying to figure out what to do exactly with this. But the epicenter of what we are seeing will be in front of parliament, the national assembly. That is going to be the nexus point. Interestingly enough, it's a counterbalance to where the president announced this. He announced this from his office in Yongsan, which is the heart of South Korea's Defense Department, the defense apparatus. He moved, President Yoon Suk-yeol, his residence from the historic Blue House, which I can look at from outside our window, to the head of the -- to the center of the Defense Department and made this announcement from there, from that compound. But what we're seeing is not outside the presidential office. This is where government, where the people go. And we can see people who are going at this late hour to try to undo this and make their voices heard in the middle of martial law.",

We're going to see if any clashes happen, if people are arrested without warrants, which is a hallmark of martial law. And we're going to be watching to see if members of parliament can get into the building after activities have been declared suspended over and done with for now at parliament, to see if they can vote to undo this. Across South Korean TV, we have seen people being interviewed who are members of the legislature. We have seen posts on X of members of the legislature, saying that they are going to come back to Yeouido, where you found the neighborhood -- where you find the national assembly to try to overturn this. But this is, in our 21st century, uncharted territory. I can't recall, it's certainly unclear how the legislature undoes a presidential proclamation. So we're waiting to see what happens. And if there are clashes and if there is a vote to bring back democracy as it was here at the national assembly, that's what we should be paying attention to.",

Lee Jae-myung ordered his lawmakers to the national assembly for a meeting to discuss the procedures for lifting those measures. President Yoon declared emergency martial law for no reason, Lee said.

So it's completely new to them. My kids, you know, they don't understand what this is like. So back then it was -- it was, yes. As you said, you know, the martial law was declared because of this massive demonstration. You know, there is a, you know, constant clashes with the police. That's why, you know, the military junta declared the martial law. This time, you know, it's completely different. I mean, yes, there was a weekly demonstration, you know, to impeach; let's impeach the president, blah, blah, blah. But still, you know, people, you know, OK, one element of the society, you know, say this. The other side of the, you know, society can say whatever they want. So, you know, the vast majority of the population, you know. Nevertheless, we enjoy the freedom of speech. We enjoy, you know, full fledged democracy. And all of a sudden the president declares the martial law in order to eradicate these North Korean agents. We understand his frustration, again, because the opposition party has impeached like 18 of his cabinet members, you know, cut down all the budgets and try to, you know, hamper the government and almost, you know, putting the government into a stall. So, you know, the president is frustrated. We all understand that. But I'm not sure whether, you know, declaring a martial law is justifying his motive. So, you know, the good majority of the population, I mean people like me. Yes, we experienced that, you know, unfortunate things back 43 years ago. But most of the young people don't understand what's going on. And I just saw pictures of the massive gridlock in the roads around the parliament area because they blocked the road off. So, you know, there will be a lot of inconvenience. Young people, you know, are just -- you know, don't understand what's happening, you know. And, you know, another thing, another thing that I like to mention is we're not so sure whether the military will back this up. Because, you know, military has been under the civilian control for 43 years. And if, you know, the military decides not to move or mobilize, then there's no way to enforce this martial law. The police, if the police is not moving along, you know, again, you know, they're not, then the martial art is not going to be effective. And, you know, with the cell phones, you know, you can YouTube all over the world any time of the day. So I don't know how you can control the freedom of speech issues as well. So I'm not sure that, you know, the president has thought through all this when he declared the martial law. And, you know, the -- already the president of the national assembly is saying that he will undo this by simply, you know, putting a motion on the floor and, you know, if that happens, then the president has to repeal the martial law. And then what? You know, as, you know, the endgame is not certain. So, yes, we're not sure where this is all heading right now.",

President Biden last saw President Yoon when they were both attending the G20 and the APEC summits in South America. And, in fact, President Biden had held a trilateral meeting with Yoon, the prime minister of Japan, trying to tout the relationships with those two countries. Saying that they believe that the U.S. work with South Korea and Japan will be what would lead to long lasting stability in the Indo-Pacific. So there's no question that the U.S. is going to keep a very close eye on this situation, especially when you also think about the fact there are about 28,500 U.S. troops who are currently stationed in South Korea. They work very closely or very closely with the South Korean government. We're waiting to hear if they're -- U.S. has any word of how this could impact them. But certainly this is something that we anticipate hearing a bit more from the U.S. later on. Now as you noted, President Biden is traveling here in Angola, his first trip to south -- to sub-Saharan Africa as president. We're checking to see whether he has been briefed on the situation and are still waiting to hear back from the White House at this moment. But certainly this is something they will be watching very closely throughout the day, as they are hearing that a key ally of the U.S., in South Korean President Yoon, has declared martial law in his country.",

You'll remember that the president had hosted then prime minister Kishida of Japan and President Yoon at the Camp David summit, the first time he was hosting world leaders there.

The chief of South Korea's -- the president's own party, own political party, has condemned the introduction of martial law. Han Dong-hoon, who previously served as President Yoon Suk-yeol's justice minister, said the move is, and I quote, \"wrong\" and he would, quote, \"block it,\" together with rival lawmakers. That is according to the Yonhap News Agency. We're reporting that on CNN. The chief of the South Korean president's own political party suggesting that this martial law is wrong and that he would block it. And this, these pictures now coming to us, what is it, 20 to 1 in the morning. This is the national assembly. And this is where supporters of the opposition lawmakers have gathered. This is -- these are images of youngsters in support of that opposition party, who have called on its leaders to go to the national assembly. They want to vote down this martial law, which was announced just about two hours ago by the South Korean president. We've seen some scuffles but it has to be said this has been relatively quiet outside the national assembly. As far as we can tell, our team is on its way there now. Obviously this is an emergency martial law instigated, which is going to make things a little bit more difficult as far as the media is concerned in South Korea going forward. These are images coming out of the national assembly here now and you can see that the army has been deployed. We have not heard from the defense minister. So it is unclear at this point whether the defense minister has actually acknowledged, is in agreement, suggested this move to the president of the country.

That declaration from the president came in a late night TV address to the nation just over two hours ago. He accused the main South Korean opposition party of sympathizing with the North. And he said his declaration was necessary to protect the country from what he called the danger of North Korean Communist forces. However, the president did not say what exact measures will be taken. And I want to remind you what has happened since then, because these are now live pictures. And this is in and around the entrance to the national assembly, possibly inside. Now we've seen some pictures of troops outside the national assembly in Seoul shortly after President Yoon declared martial law. In those, we could see clear images of the military moving around in parliament and reportedly blocking people from entering. There were some kerfuffles. This is just moments ago, coming to us from a number of our affiliates, including CNN affiliate JTBC. They were on the ground moments ago as parliamentary members were trying to gather. But soldiers were blocking them from entering.

He talked about Communist sympathizers. He talked about drugs that were coming into the country. There was nothing really specific. He made these blanket accusations and, on one hand, I'm not completely surprised. This is a conservative president who has been influenced by something known as the New Right Movement, which has its streak or its foundations within, you know, strong anti-Communist, anti-North Korean sentiments. Some of his cabinet officials also carry this ideology. And so it's come out from time to time in other speeches. But it's almost as if this language, this rhetoric, has been pushed into overdrive. In the meantime, we also know that President Yoon's popularity is quite low. It's been hovering between 20 percent and 25 percent in the last month. His popularity has never exceeded over 40 percent. And he's having -- he's facing stiff opposition within the national assembly. One of -- his bill for the budget was just rejected. And they were talking about cutting budgets to the presidency, to the prosecutor's office. So I believe that it's more about a domestic play. So you may use anti- Communist forces, North Korean security issues as a reason for martial law but we haven't seen any credible or clear evidence of that yet.

It's not like martial law in the 1980s, when tanks came in to crack down on protesters. There have been some scuffles, as you've been showing, at the national assembly, with riot police. So it's not a total martial law. So I don't -- but we don't know. We don't know if things could escalate, if things could get worse. But right now, it seems like he wants to shut down the government. And again, the motive behind it, we're not sure, other than he had very weak domestic political standing.
