But the right answer could get you on the wrong side of Donald Trump. Also, the former President is holding a raucous campaign rally, this evening, in New York City, in a deep blue state that frankly is not in play for him, in the White House. But he is hoping to make inroads with Black and Latino voters. My source is a Congressman, who represents the Bronx, where that rally was held. Also tonight, the hottest ticket in America is not a Taylor Swift concert. It's the White House State Dinner, a who's who of stars, dignitaries, and four presidents wining and dining, as we speak. We've got the inside scoop, and we'll go inside THE SOURCE. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Election meet litmus test. As we draw closer and closer to November, top Republicans aren't just falling in line. They're also falling over themselves to appease the party's presumptive nominee. A new trend is taking place, to not only cast doubt about the last election, but to also raise questions about the next one in 2024. We are watching, as top Republicans are declining to answer, a straightforward question, or at least twisting themselves into pretzels, when they are asked about committing to accepting the election results. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL): No matter what happens? No. If it's an unfair election, I think it's going to be contested by each side. KRISTEN WELKER, \"MEET THE PRESS\" MODERATOR, NBC NEWS: No matter who wins. SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): Yes, I'll accept them, if I think, you know, if there's no massive cheating. SEN.

He added $8 trillion worth of debt, when he said he wouldn't. He built a selfie station at the wall instead of actually building a wall. He acted like a clown around the world.

Unfortunately, my husband and I did not make it till 12 weeks. I miscarried, right around 11. Unfortunately, went to several different medical providers, in my city, to be able to get care. I knew that I was miscarrying, at the time. But unfortunately, no one would tell me that, right? No one would write it on paper, or explain what was happening with my body. And ultimately, the first hospital that I went to, sent me home, with prayers.

As you can see here, as we always watch to see, who was invited to the state dinner, there are some big names that we noted, walked across that carpet, and into the White House. Actor and director, Sean Penn. Former President Bill Clinton, and former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton. The NFL Commissioner, Roger Goodell. Also, NBA Commissioner, Adam Silver. Plus, there was a brief cameo appearance, from former President Barack Obama. My inside source tonight is all too familiar with what it's like to plan a state dinner, given it was his job, as Social Secretary to President Obama. And Jeremy Bernard is back with us. And it's great to have you, because this is an interesting -- all state dinners, in my view, are interesting. But this one's also notable because it's the first state visit that--",
