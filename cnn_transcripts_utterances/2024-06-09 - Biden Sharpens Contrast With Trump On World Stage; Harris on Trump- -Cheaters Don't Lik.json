(END VIDEOTAPE) RAJU (on camera):  Good morning and welcome to INSIDE POLITICS SUNDAY. I'm Manu Raju. President Biden woke up in France this morning after he spent the last several days warning about the risks to democracy and marking the 80th anniversary of D-Day. Yet as he tries to assure American allies about the U.S. commitment to the world order, Biden has not mentioned Donald Trump much by name, not once during his pair of major speeches, but the contrast he's trying to draw is clear as he seeks to reframe the race and take on his major vulnerabilities. New this morning on that front, CNN has breaking news on how the president is trying to address one big weakness with a major policy move. More on that in just a moment. But first, he and his team are dealing with the aftermath of that Israeli operation in Gaza that rescued four hostages, as Gazan officials say, at least 274 Palestinians were killed. CNN's senior White House correspondent Kayla Tausche is live from Paris. So, Kayla, how is the president's team addressing the fallout of this rescue operation?",

There are the -- Biden has been making the case about democracy, that's his major selling point. This is how voters view how the issues that are important to them. Economy number one, 31 percent. Immigration, number two, we'll talk about that in a second. Preserving democracy, 16. But still, the issues about Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war ranking lower down. Seung Min, you cover the White House for \"The Associated Press\".

They believe that that is something that could attract them to their side. And that's why you saw -- that's one of the reasons why you saw Biden speak so forcefully in these issues over the last several days. You know, he never really said the words Donald Trump. But you see the political subtext, you can't help but see that contrast that President Biden and his aides are trying to implicitly make against, you know, someone like Donald Trump who disparages the NATO alliance, who has said, who has kind of given the green light to Putin to do whatever he wants. And Biden says that is not the way. And he really invokes the memory of D-Day, invokes the honor of these Army Rangers to say, you know what would they ask us to do? They would ask us to -- one quote was, vanquish hateful ideologies, and you can't help but think that President Biden was thinking about Donald Trump in that moment.",

If he can conflate them, I think that can help him.And what really struck me about the president in Europe, the things he said could have been said by any president. In other words, of course, we're going to defend democracy in our allies. But because he's running against someone on a pretty openly authoritarian platform who said, nice things about Putin, disparaged NATO allies, said, you know, we don't really belong in Ukraine.

And with on both the border and I think in foreign policy you've seen the difficulties on that.I think that Biden, you know, came in obviously with this as a strength that has flipped to a political liability. And I think it's because Democrats have not had an affirmative position on a lot of these issues. They have been able to criticize Donald Trump and Republican actions, but there has not been a unified view from both top of the party to the base on what to do about immigration, on what to do a look abroad. But I think it's important that we don't see these issues as completely separate. You know, when people talk about the economy, they often bring up the fact that we're bringing that we're giving a lot of money to Ukraine and Israel. When people talk about foreign policy, they'll bring up, preserving democracy. These things are working together. And also Biden's perception, even things like age, the perception of him is not in the driver's seat of kind of events. But reacting to events is something that happens on the foreign policy stage that is contributing to his perception of unpopularity domestically. So these things are all kind of all working together to create a really difficult picture for this president. But I think what we're seeing now is the is the White House trying to take a more active role in shaping ahead of this debate so that by the time Donald Trump makes these arguments, he can point to very specific things that he has done recently, specifically on the issues he has the most.",

And now I'm sure Biden's team -- I'm sure Biden's lawyers are trying to make sure to craft this proposal in a way that they feel could withstand scrutiny. But first of all, the Supreme Court is a lot more conservative now than it was in 2014.

You know, we were following \"The New York Times\" polling about what actually moved people after the conviction. And you saw all the kind of two points moving away from, from kind of Trump to Biden. But some of that was drop off, just the interest in third party. Some of that was, you know, the landscape is really messy around this conviction, but it's not telling the sea change.

While new polling shows there are some small-sized shifts, broadly-speaking, it has not made much of a dent in Trump's standing, at least not yet. New poll from Fox News shows the former president still ahead in several key states, except notably in Virginia, where the poll shows the race is tied. And of course, President Biden won Virginia in 2020 by about ten points. Our panel is back. Just a little bit deeper in that Fox News poll about how Independents, what they view, this has an impact in these swing-states, the hush money verdict here, the guilty verdict. There are 29 percent of voters in Virginia say it matters, up to 44 percent in Florida, then you have it doesn't matter, 68 percent in Virginia, all the way down to 52 percent say it doesn't matter. Now we don't know that that means whether they're going to actually vote or how they will vote but it doesn't seem to be -- a game changer.",

Donald Trump is a weak general election candidate, partially because of these things. All that the polling would tell us that Republicans will be better served if someone else was at the top of the ticket. However because he's going up against another weak candidate and Joe Biden relative to each other, he's still retaining that level of support. So that's what really came through in this polling. And it's not that people did not care about Donald Trump's baggage, it's that it wasn't enough to overcome some of the unpopularity of Joe Biden. That's what we're seeing.
