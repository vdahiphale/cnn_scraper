His funeral took place earlier today. It is 5 pm there. It's 6 pm here in Abu Dhabi. I'm Becky Anderson. You are watching, Connect the World. Your other headlines this hour. Israel facing calls for an investigation from the United Nations and United Arab Emirates after at least 112 people died when Israeli troops fired around an aid convoy yesterday. We're just an hour away from hearing - a hearing to decide the court date for Donald Trump's classified documents trial. It could have far-reaching consequences for the former U.S. president. Iran goes to the polls today in the first election since massive anti-government protests in 2022. Parliamentary elections come as distrust of the political system there grows. And the market in New York will open in about 30 minutes from now. Futures indicating a mixed and pretty flat open. More on that as we get it. We are watching an incredible show of bravery in Moscow, as thousands of mourners gathered to say goodbye to Alexei Navalny. You can see a line of people en route to the cemetery. The late opposition leader was laid to rest around an hour ago, exactly two weeks after his death at an Arctic penal colony. We are hearing reports of at least one arrest at the funeral earlier according to monitoring group OVD-Info which says 22 People were also detained when they tried to leave their homes. CNN has experienced signal issues out of Moscow today. Our signal was blocked earlier during Alexei Navalny's funeral. Matthew Chance, however, has been on the scene all morning and was at the church where the funeral was held. This is his report filed a little earlier. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

We heard from his team that as his coffin was lowered into the ground Becky, they actually played the song by Frank Sinatra \"My Way.\" That is pure Alexei Navalny. And that is a big part, I think of what his appeal was to many people. That compared to Putin, who was this sort of distant, lofty, formal, isolated figure, he was down to earth. He was humorous, he was hip, he was cool. He had this great love story with his wife, Yulia Navalnaya and perhaps most importantly, he understood how to reach out to people, how to expose corruption, how to talk to a younger generation.

And inBangladesh, the death toll has risen to at least 46 people killed and dozens more injured after a massive blaze engulfed a six storey building in Dhaka, late on Thursday. Fire crews used cranes to rescue people. The Prime Minister says the lack of safety exits is partly to blame. Investigators believe the fire started inside a restaurant and it may have been sparked by a faulty stove or a gas leak. In Haiti, heavy gunfire was reported across multiple areas of Port-au-Prince on Thursday, at least four people were killed at a police station and shootings near the airport forced flight cancellations. Haiti continues to be gripped by a wave of unrest and gang violence. And a critical warning and as large wildfires in Texas continue to burn, strong wind gusts and high temperatures this weekend could make the situation even more dangerous. The Smokehouse Creek Fire is now the state's largest on record. That has burned more than 400,000 hectares of land and it's only 5% contained.

      "sentences": "Hi there, Becky. Well, I would say that the mood is one that is probably a little lessenthusiastic than the parliamentary elections that we last covered in 2020. Right now I'm standing in front of the mains polling stations here in Tehran inside the (inaudible) mosque. And I would say that the crowds of people, the amount of people that we've seen going in and casting their ballots is less than we saw last time in 2020. Now, the polling station and the other polling stations are supposed to close in about 10 minutes. And you'll recall that in the past, they've stayed open longer because more people wanted to cast their ballots. I'm not sure whether or not that is going to happen this time. Now, of course, one of the things that the leadership of this country has said the Supreme Leader certainly said that this morning when he cast his own ballot is he wants many people to participate in this election. It's unclear whether or not that is going to happen. I think that we're probably going to get the numbers of voter participation, voter turnout, about an hour, maybe two hours after the polling stations closed. So that's definitely going to be something that this country's leadership is going to take a look at. But one of the things that we have seen, even on the streets of Tehran, we've been in some events as well is that it's mostly political conservatives, who I think right now are going to the polls who feel more inclined to go and vote certainly. So the moderates that we've been speaking to on the street say that they don't wants to vote, that they are not going to vote this time, because they don't believe that they are being represented adequately. It's been interesting to see in the run up to this election, there have, of course, been a lot of candidates who have been disqualified. At the same time, the government here says that 15,000, more than 15,000 candidates are actually participating and are running for the 250 seat or 290 seats in Iranian parliament. So they say that's more than ever before. Nevertheless, you're absolutely right. With all the problems that this country has right now, a lot of them of course, induced by sanctions, but then also with a massive inflation that Iran is facing, certainly a lot of people here want answers from their politicians going forward, Becky.",

It's very difficult to see right now, I think one of the things that you will probably seeafter this election is that the conservatives here in this country will certainly strengthen their grip on power here, certainly in the run up to what we've seen so far. We saw very little in the way of events by moderate candidates, we saw some events, though, by conservative candidates. So it looks as though it could be the case that conservatives could get stronger here in this country and whether or not that means anything for political consequences, and especially as far as economic policies are concerned. But of course, also, as far as Iran's foreign policy and the policy in the region, are concerned as well. Whether or not there's going to be any real consequences is definitely something that is - that is very unclear at this point in time. And certainly also something where there do seem to be, at least among younger voters, the belief that they don't believe that there's going to be massive change coming after these elections, or at least change that would see the economy of this country are getting a lot better. It is something that some conservative candidates have promised that they said they want to tackle some of the economic issues here in this country. Whether or not they're going to manage to do that is of course very much still up in the air. The other big thing, by the way, that people here are looking towards as well as not just the parliamentary election here, but one that also could have massive consequences on their life is, of course, the U.S. presidential election coming up and whether or not potentially Donald Trump could be the president again, because Iranians of course, remember all too well, what happened in the Trump administration from 2016 until 2020, when of course you had those massive sanctions and the U.S. and Iran on the brink of war. So there is a certain concern here that things between the U.S. and Iran could deteriorate even further if there is another Trump presidency, something that people looking at. The parliamentary elections. I think, right now, if anything will strengthen the leadership that the country currently has, and whether or not that means big changes for the electorate and for the people in this country right now is very difficult to see.
