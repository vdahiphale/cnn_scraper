So, per yourreporting, the U.S. has agreed to this vote, though we don't yet know how the U.S. will vote, whether they'll agree to this or just abstain. But softened language is one part of it. Another is who will actually oversee the aid going into Gaza. Give us more details. ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, Bianna, that's a very important distinction. These have been very contentious negotiations, evidenced by the fact that this vote has been delayed throughout the course of the week. It does appear to finally be happening this morning. The bigger picture from Washington's perspective is that the Biden administration wanted to get this resolution to a place where they did not vote no, where they didn't veto this resolution. They are keenly aware of the global outrage that has arisen because of previous vetoes for votes on immediate ceasefire. So the goal here for Washington was to get this resolution to a place where they could either vote yes or to abstain. And we don't know which way the U.S. is going to vote. It was not just a question of how to describe an end to the fighting. But I'm told the major sticking point was about a U.N. monitored mechanism for aid going into Gaza. This is something that Egypt and the UAE had pushed for that the U.S. felt would be too complicated, too cumbersome, would actually slow aid down. But last night, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas- Greenfield, said that they had gotten the resolution to a place where the U.S. could support it. This is what she had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LINDA THOMAS-GREENFIELD, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS: We have worked hard and diligently over the course of the past week with the Emiratis, with others, with Egypt to come up with a resolution that we can support. And we do have that resolution now. We're ready to vote on it. It's a resolution that will bring humanitarian assistance to those in need. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So there are still a lot of outlying questions, including which way the U.S. will vote.

      "sentences": "Well, they have taken some steps to accommodate U.S. demands that they increase the flow ofhumanitarian aid, but international organizations say that it is still simply not enough. You know, earlier today I was at the Kerem Shalom border crossing, which until last week was not open to aid deliveries going from Egypt into Israel and then directly into Gaza. Until last week, those trucks of aid had to then turn back from Israel, go into Egypt again and cross into the heavily bottlenecked Rafah crossing. But today we saw dozens of aid trucks going directly into Gaza from Israel. But aid organizations say that it is still not enough. And this U.N. resolution is certainly a watermark moment in terms of the kind of significant international pressure that Israel has been coming under, mounting international pressure in recent weeks. And this resolution will indeed establish a senior U.N. representative to effectively oversee the delivery of aid into Gaza and try and expedite that process. But it was also very clear to me while being on the ground today at Kerem Shalom that there is still a significant disconnect in terms of how Israeli officials see the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and how the rest of the world sees it. When I was there today we had a briefing from Colonel Moshe Tetra who is the senior official from the Israeli military charged with facilitating delivery of aid into Gaza. And with a straight face, he looked at me and he said that there is no food shortage in Gaza. That is despite the fact that we have now heard from multiple international organizations, including the U.N. World Food Program, saying that about half of Gaza's population is currently facing severe or extreme hunger. 90 percent of people in Gaza have had to go for at least a day without having a single meal. And we know that there certainly is a food shortage in Gaza. And so, just a fact that there isn't an acknowledgement of that reality. Kind of speaks to the broader disconnect. And it also helps to explain why the United States ultimately felt compelled to get this resolution to a place where they could at least, if not vote for it, at least abstain, which is exactly what we saw today. And just on the specifics of this resolution and the words that we heard from Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, she also made clear why the United States ultimately chose to abstain. She said that it was because this resolution lacked any condemnation of Hamas' October 7 terrorist attacks that killed 1,200 people here in Israel. She said, I will never understand why some members on the council refused to include that language. And she said she was disappointed and appalled. But the rest of her words in this speech that she gave after this vote happened, you know, it almost sounded like the United States supported this resolution. And it's clear that if not for that language, it seems that the United States indeed would have supported it. She said that this resolution will be critical to scaling up aid and working to achieve a lasting peace. And she said it is hard to overstate how urgent that very task is.",

David, thank you so much for taking the time.So I wanna pick up on what we just heard there in that conversation with Jeremy, because it is notable that the United Nations Security Council has yet to condemn Hamas for the October 7th attack. They have been condemning the actions of Israel subsequently. Linda Thomas- Greenfield and others made note of the acute, dire humanitarian crisis on the ground now. She said the words famine have entered the vocabulary. So no one's denying that fact and the horrific images that we have seen since that attack of October 7th. But is it not low-hanging fruit for Israel to really have difficulty in taking the Security Council in this resolution and anything that it passes going forward objectively if you don't have a condemnation of the terror attack itself? Can you talk to us about the politics behind that?",

Security Council have worked tirelessly behind the scenes to bring it to this point. But in terms of what changes now, In terms of what happens on the ground, Linda Thomas-Greenfield said, look, you know, the ball is in Hamas' court at this point in time. How is this going to be enforced? When are we going to see pauses in the fighting to allow urgent aid to get in? I mean, 20,000 people have been killed. There's no functioning hospitals in the northern part of the enclave. Disease is spreading. Linda Thomas-Greenfield talked about, as Bianna just mentioned here, that famine, the word famine is now being used. What changes on the ground at this point?",

The bad news here is that you're still not going to be able to get aid into areas where Israeli bombing is underway, and you're only going to get that if there's a pause. And the Israelis have said there's only going to be a pause if we get back to hostage releases. And, of course, that runs directly against Hamas' interests. They may have some interest in one more level of hostage releases. But in the end, they're probably going to want to hold on to 75 or 100 hostages, because if they let them all go, they think the Israelis would have no restraint whatsoever. So the key question of how you get pauses and then how you turn those pauses into a lasting ceasefire, that's completely unresolved from this. It is much better progress to be getting aid trucks in than not. And we're in a better place than we were in that regard three weeks ago, but the situation on the ground is also far more dire than it was three weeks ago.",
