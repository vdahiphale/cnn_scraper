      "sentences": "Welcome back to CONNECT THE WORLD, live from New York.This hour we are following two of the world's biggest news stories. The wars happening on two continents reverberating across the globe. Ukraine's President Zelenskyy is in the United States today with President Biden and Congress in an effort to reinstate his country's paused aid package. We will take you to Ukraine and Washington. First, we start with the war in Gaza where catastrophe and destruction continues unabated. This comes as the U.N. General Assembly is expected to vote later on a draft resolution demanding an immediate cease-fire in Gaza. The humanitarian crisis worsens each day. Doctors in Gaza say hospitals in the north remain under siege and under fire as the Israeli military steps up its campaign to defeat Hamas. The Israeli military says it only carried out operations in and around hospitals where they are being used by Hamas and other armed groups. The impact, of course, on civilians is punishing. Meanwhile, Israel says it started conducting security checks on humanitarian aid for Gaza at the Kerem Shalom crossing. What is clear is whether the aid will then be handed over to international organizations through the rough crossing between Gaza and Egypt. There is no current plan to allow aid to enter Gaza directly from Israel. Let's bring in Jeremy Diamond in Sderot, Israel, and Alex Marquardt, who is in Kerem Shalom for us now. Let's start there. What is actually taking place with this analysis of aid? As I mentioned there, the Israelis are saying this is not going to be a crossing point for humanitarian aid into Gaza. But the hope and the belief is that this will at least facilitate the speed upon which the humanitarian aid can get through the crossing.",

      "sentences": "That's, right Julia. Until now there has been only one inspection point that Israel hashad to take a look at this aid before it goes into Gaza. That is much farther south, in a place called midsauna (ph). What Israel is doing now is adding a second inspection point which could in theory double the amount of aid that would be allowed into Gaza. Although it does not necessarily mean that all of that aid can get into Gaza. What we are seeing and what we see throughout the course of the day, although it has slowed down a little bit, as the evening has started, the long line of trucks coming from the Egyptian side to here, to Kerem Shalom and then we see them being expected. They used dogs; we've seen people looking inside. There has been a truck from World Central Kitchen, the aid group; boxes from the World Food Programme. Once the trucks are approved by the Israeli side they go back into Egypt to be driven up to the Rafah crossing. The good news is double the amount of aid could go in. It does not mean that Rafah can actually handle it. Rafah is a much smaller crossing and not built to handle hundreds and hundreds of trucks every single day. But perhaps more importantly, Julia, because of the intense bombardment, the intense fighting taking place inside the Gaza Strip and the hundreds of thousands of people who have fled south, that makes distribution extremely difficult. Even if the number of trucks can go up, it does not necessarily mean that it can get into Gaza. We have seen desperate people, who need food, who need water, who need medicine, swarming those trucks. So it is a very, very desperate situation. And for now, as you mentioned, Israel has said that aid cannot flow into Gaza from this point, which would be very welcome by humanitarian officials.",

They are certainly not laying out a timetable in terms of exactly by when they hope to achieve that goal. In part because they don't want to miss that target if they say it publicly. There is no question that we have watched the fighting intensify in northern Gaza over the last few days. Some very, very heavy explosions that we have witnessed from our point of view where we can really feel the shock waves of some of those heavy bombs that are being dropped on northern Gaza. And also, notable that we have watched in recent days, the death toll for Israeli soldiers has also risen. Another sign of intensifying fighting with many of those deaths happening in northern Gaza rather than Southern Gaza. That will also generate additional pressure on the Israeli government, the Israeli public is very sensitive to the deaths of Israeli soldiers. It is something that certainly factors into the political calculus and military decision-making in Israel.",

For the Ukrainians, if you don't do more of the same, it is life and death situation. There is a palpable sense of anger amongst those troops. On the face of it, they say they will fight until the end. They have no choice. Frankly, they are acutely aware from the very first days of the war it was U.S. weaponry, it was the speedy delivery of antitank weapons that held Russian invasion back. Since they've been able to push Russians out of some areas. We saw ourselves, on the ground near Kherson, a city that epitomizes what life under so-called hot peace with Russian occupying forces close by might be like for ordinary Ukrainians. Kherson a ghostly city and one whose far outskirts Ukrainian soldiers are showing they can find ingenuity. They can find ways of making up the gap if they don't have U.S. aid. It is not necessarily going to be enough for a decisive victory. Here is what we saw. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WALSH (voice-over):  Out of Kherson City, past the bridge the Russians invaded and left on, you reach a new phase of hope and anxiety in this war. Down on the edge of the Dnipro River, on whose isolated right bank, lone groups of Ukrainians are making rare advances into Russian occupied land. But it's tiny tools, handrigged, donated drones and small gains. The U.S. is stalling on the big money Ukraine needs to make the breakthrough the West wants. And you can feel the anger at that here. It is relentless work. \"I think it'll be very difficult without American help,\" he says. \"Our supplies are also ending, so we need theirs.\" \"We've had days so busy, we launched 15 to 20.

They are too repeatedly under missile attack, eight missiles fired at Kyiv yesterday. And nationwide now, cell phone disruption after an intense hacking attack, which Ukraine security services are pointing the finger toward Russia about. That is disrupting cell phone service on a main provider for many here called Kyiv Star. Other services having issues as well, perhaps a knockon from that. And a real fear, I think, amongst Ukrainians, who might be seeing infrastructure being targeted again heavily as winter sets in. Knock out cell phones, knock out the air raid sirens, you knock out even the street lights where we are. We are going to have to be turned on by hand because the cell phones appear to be damaged as well. So Russia, clearly on their front foot in some areas; Ukraine, really trying to digest what this wavering by the United States, their Western backers steadfast until this point, what that wavering might mean.

The Houthis warn they'll continue to prevent ships heading to Israeli ports from traveling the Arab and Red Seas, until food and medicine is provided to Gaza.

And he outlined in some great detail, A, the kind of help he needs and how it will help him win. Even as many of our Republican colleagues talked about, we are winning this war. And if we get the help that, if he gets the help he needs, he will win. On the other hand, he made it clear and we all made it clear, that if we lose, Putin wins. And this will be very, very dangerous for the United States. We cannot let Putin influence, through any surrogate, what is -- what we need to do for Ukraine. He also made one other point. He needs the aid quickly. If we don't give the aid quickly, several things will happen. First, the military means but, second, Europe and many other allies will say, what is going on here?

And just how much they are going to let go, whether they're going to let go of any of that profit power in the near term, could be the difference between living on a planet with coral reefs and mountain ice or one without.
