Yet nine days after the disaster, we're still seeing astonishing stories of survival.Moments ago, a 77-year-old woman in southern Turkey was saved. She survived 212 hours trapped under rubble in bitterly cold conditions. Turkish media report that she was hugged by family members waiting at the scene of her rescue. And on Tuesday, a handful of people were found alive after being buried some 200 hours. And during all those aftershocks, three of them pulled from the debris in the Kahramanmaras region of Turkey. Another woman was rescued from a collapsed building in Hatay according to Turkish state media. As many tried to process the scope of the disaster, the Turkish president explained why the magnitude 7.8 quake and its aftermath has been so awful. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN, TURKISH PRESIDENT (through translator): The disaster that occurred in an area larger than many countries territorial integrity happened in an area closer to the surface compared to other earthquakes in the history. And this increased the effect of the destruction which brought an energy equal to hundreds of powerful atomic bombs. The biggest earthquakes in the world occur in the oceans and affect the lands, but the earthquakes in Kahramanmaras happened directly under the residences. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And the Russians will be looking for a moment where they could revive their hopes of taking the whole country. We think that's a reach too far for them right now. So, the question is, does this become somewhat frozen conflict, an accelerated version of what happened after the invasion of Crimea in 2014.

We're in a very different situation now. The war has moved to what is essentially more of an artillery conflict in the flatlands as the south and the east. They run through a huge amount of ammunition. And it's clearly not possible right now for the United States to continue to keep up. The easy stores of older weapons have been exhausted. And so, now the U.S. when it promises weapons, is basically putting them out order in the factory. That's what they did with the Abrams tanks. And that means it could be months, could be more than a year before they get delivered.

One is he says we'll support the Ukrainians. The second is he says, we will not get into World War III. Well, Putin has sense the vulnerability that that second criteria creates. And that's why episodically you hear him threatened to use nuclear weapons and so forth. He's clearly trying to say to Biden, there are some parameters here.
