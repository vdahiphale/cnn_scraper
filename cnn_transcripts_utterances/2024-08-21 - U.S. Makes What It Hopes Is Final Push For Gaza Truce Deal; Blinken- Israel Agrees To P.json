IDF officials claim the facility was being used as a Hamas control and command center.Meantime, the U.S. is making what it hopes will be a final push for a truce. U.S. talks are set to resume this week in Cairo. But an Israeli official tells CNN that President Biden will be speaking with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today. Let's get the latest from Tel Aviv with CNN chief national security analyst, Jim Sciutto. Jim, obviously, this is a crucial moment for these negotiations. Where do things stand?",

And saying quite publicly that they want a ceasefire in Gaza. They want the fighting to stop there.But, in effect, saying, if we don't strike now, we could strike at a later date. I will say that, last week, you would hear from U.S. officials going back to the beginning of last week that this war could expand at any moment, right? That a strike from Iran and perhaps Hezbollah as well was imminent. I haven't heard that for a week. It appears those parties giving time for these negotiations to work -- to work out. But as these negotiations perhaps get to a point where we're there not moving forward, that raises that risk again. The risk has always been there. The thread has been there. An Israeli official told me that today. But of course, the concern is, if those talks so aren't moving forward, there will be heightened alert here and elsewhere in the region about the potential for an Iranian strike, a potential for a broader Hezbollah strike. But keep in mind, Boris, Hezbollah is flying across Israels northern border every day, multiple times, and Israel is firing back. So that's a low-grade conflict up there. Of course, the concern is it becomes a higher grade one.",

He's now a member of the Harris campaign advisory board.I'm very excited to speak with you. You spoke on Monday night during the first night of the convention. And I wanted to talk to you specifically about Latino men because it's not like they're going en mass to Donald Trump. But the margins here matter, and he is getting them in numbers that are concerning to Democrats. How should Kamala Harris address this? REP. ROBERT GARCIA (D-CA): Well, I think, first, look, I think if you're looking at undecided voters and some of the polls, certainly a lot of undecided voters within the Latino community are moving over to Kamala Harris. I think she's consolidating a lot of that support. But there's no question that we have work to do in the party. I think Vice President Harris understands this. I think you saw, for example, her proposal around homeownership, around housing for all around, making sure that we're building affordable housing, providing tax credits for first-time homebuyers. Those are the kind of policy proposals that are going to speak to the Latino community, to Latino men, in particular. I think you're going to hear more about issues around health care, around access to affordable health care for their families. One thing you hear a lot from the Latino community is making sure that we have strong public school systems. Let's not forget, Donald Trump wants to destroy the Department of Education. So those are the contrasts that will be made. And I think that Vice President Harris and Governor Walz will continue to reach out to the Latino community, especially in those swing-states.",

People believe that women should have access to make those choices about their bodies. And that includes the Latino community. And you see that again in survey after survey.So we've got to lean in even in those swing states with a lot of Latino voters, Pennsylvania and North Carolina, Georgia, Nevada, Arizona, and talk about abortion. I think it helps the ticket. It also helps to reach out to Latino community in the language that they speak. And you're going to see a lot of that in the ads that are out today and wins in the future.",

We've had a number of polls that have been taken since he was selected as the Democratic V.P. nominee. And you know what? He's actually liked by more Americans than disliked, which is such an odd thing in today's America, where basically politicians are almost always in the red. [14:55:07] And it's such a difference from J.D. Vance, right? He has been consistently in the red across all of the polls. And Walz, Tim Walz has actually been a pretty good pick, at least according to the American public, J.D. Vance, going back over the last 40 years, is the least popular V.P. nominee a month out from his party's convention. He's less liked than Paul Ryan. He's less liked than Dan Quayle. And of course, a sort of infamous in terms of his unlikability. The bottom line is this, J.D. Vance is not helping the Republican ticket at this particular point. Tim Walz, if nothing else, is probably at least helping a little bit on the Democratic side. She made a good selection. Donald Trump didn't. Will it ultimately make a difference in the outcome of this election? Maybe not. But the bottom line is that Donald Trump has been having to answer for J.D. Vance, and Kamala Harris hasn't had to do any real answering for Tim Walz.",
