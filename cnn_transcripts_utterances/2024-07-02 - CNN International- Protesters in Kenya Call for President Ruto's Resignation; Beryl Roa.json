What we are about to see is police trying to break up these protesters with tear gas. They've had this running battles the whole day, police threw a tear gas at them and they respond by throwing stones, throwing back the tear gas canisters whenever they can. They've managed to bring in parts of the country (ph) into a complete standstill because of these back-and-forth between the protesters and the police.They now have moved their mission from just being about the finance bill which is withdrawn to anti-government protests. They say Ruto must go. They do not want President William Ruto in charge. So what you are seeing here, behind the cops we are a little safe here except from the tear gas, but what you are seeing is these protesters constantly on the streets, getting their voices heard, throwing rocks directly at the police that are trying to break them up. We have to move back just for our own safety as we watch that scene unfold, Omar. I think what we have seen in some parts of the city today is definitely a more violent streak of these protesters and some of the gen z protesters who have been active for three weeks tell us these are not their own people. These are agitators who are taking advantage of the situation to lure, to vandalize, and they are the ones who are engaging the police throughout this time. And one of the things that has happened is when we are here with the police, taking this live, they tend to be a bit more careful in how they respond to these protesters, even when they are throwing rocks at them, Omar.",

What do you see here? (Inaudible) over that side is more police reinforcements coming in, trying to break up these protesters, who are not really getting broken up just by a bunch of cops coming with tear gas. They are used to it. Sometimes, they even dare them to do so.But the big picture here is there is young people who are still angry at President Ruto's government, who want him to handle corruption in his government, who are upset about the extravagant lifestyles or some of his ministers, senior government officials, and who want a radical change in how the country is run, and they don't feel that just withdrawing the finance bill achieved that, Omar.",

But certainly, by the end of today, getting into tomorrow, they will start feeling the effects of the storm. So, government there is telling people that now there are sort of in the final day where they can make preparations because -- I've been in Category 5 hurricanes and you simply cannot go outside and you need to find shelters that are away from the water and much more solid than typically you would, because when the National Hurricane Center, when forecasters talk about a Category 5 storm, the use or catastrophic and that really sums it up, that even if you are inside sort of a normal home or normal dwelling, that might not be enough. You'll lose your roof. There could be mudslides. Of course, Jamaica is a mountainous island, so that can lead to flash flooding, and that can lead to mudslides, and when you deal with a storm of this power, you know, 160 miles an hour, if you remember, driving a car going 80 miles an hour and put your hand out the window, you know that feels like, double it. When you are in a Category 5 hurricane, you cannot go outside. You'll get knocked down by the wind.

They have to be allowed to do their job. PAULA REID CNN CHIEF LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The supreme court partially siding with former president Donald Trump in his ongoing January 6 case, ruling that former presidents are entitled to some immunity from prosecution for official actions but not for private conduct. In the 6-3 opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts writing for the majority at least with respect to the president's exercise of his core constitutional powers, this immunity must be absolute. The president enjoys no immunity for his unofficial acts and not everything the president does is official. The president is not above the law. The high court though, leaving it up to lower courts to determine which actions are official and therefore immune. Roberts writing other allegations such as those involving Trump's interactions with the vice president, state officials, and certain private parties and his comments to the general public present more difficult questions, meaning District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan, who is overseeing Trump's January 6 case, will need to decide whether Trump's pressure campaign to get Vice President Pence --",

It looks that way on the surface, but we'll see in practice. Smart lawyers can find ways around almost anything. So it is a shock to the system, meaning the governmental system we have had since the founding of the American Republic.

And when you hit convergence of jet streams, it is like falling in off a cliff. It is a trough. So it can be a pretty severe event. But given that there have been a number of these -- now, also there were 777 -- Boeing 777 events and other aircraft as well. So it is not limited to Boeing, but that's something the investigators should be looking at. Is there something about the autopilot that cause it not to respond right? And they will also ask did the pilots respond right?

This is a massive project valued at $500 million for a five-star hotel, a nightclub, a golf club. This one is set to open at the end of 2028 and they would be licensing the Trump name, the Trump Organization wouldn't own the property. That's how they typically do deals like this.

Remember, President Trump -- former President Trump, he had a pretty cozy relationship with the Saudis when he was in the White House. He visited the kingdom and he was celebrated when he was there. He worked many deals with the Saudis and he certainly had a better relationship, warmer relations than President Biden does currently with the Saudis.And also, former President Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has an investment firm and that investment firm reportedly secured a $2 billion investment from the Saudi Royal Fund. That investment is under scrutiny from some Democrats in Congress and if he is returned to the White House, former President Trump would, of course, be dealing with the Saudis and other countries in the Middle East regularly. So, this is why we have already heard some concerns from some ethics watchdogs. I talked to the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and they told me that the Trump Organization's \"continued pursuit of foreign business projects raises perilous national security, corruption and constitutional concerns.\" Now, the Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment. We should note that the Trump Organization is not currently run day-to-day by former President Donald Trump. It is run by his sons, Eric and Don Jr. But the Trump Organization is owned by a private trust and the ultimate beneficiary of that trust is former President Donald Trump. Listen, I think at the end of the day, Omar, all this is another reminder of how if former President Trump does get returned to the White House, there's going to be these sort of messy and awkward deals where his business has properties in others countries, overseas, in the Middle East and elsewhere, and he is going be simultaneously dealing with those countries and it could quit create some potential, at least appearances of conflicts of interests, if not actual conflicts.
