You're doing it because you think it is -- you think that it is going to advance your topic and someone is going to advance your campaign.You got an idea, so it is important to see that she is doing this camp -- she is doing this event while she is in Georgia, right?

And then also, they're talking about housing and creating 3 million more housing units over the course of her administration. So she's got an idea to push, so I think as long as she's talking about that, that is going to give that interview some punch that I think the campaign will benefit from because she's moving it forward.",

She hasn't really set down with anyone since become the top of the ticket for Democrats. You want to get her sort of comfortable back into the swing of things.So I methodically get it. But it is going to give Republicans the ammunition to say, well, wait a minute here. When is she going to do what our guy is doing, which is taking a ton of questions from adversarial journalists who are constantly attacking him on every single issue, to showcase that she can lead the country forward. And I suspect that that will come. I want to touch on something quickly though. I think Jamal had an excellent analysis on why the vice president is focusing on Georgia, particularly the rural parts of Georgia. We oftentimes dismiss the fact that there are a lot of people of color who live in those rural areas. And if you can get those low propensity rural area black voters to turn out, it certainly makes a difference marginally speaking. Does it mean she'll win the state? Maybe not, but it does make the state more competitive, which means you make your opponent have to spend more resources there.",

I think you're going to see him sit down with some journalists, maybe at CNN for a town hall, something we typically do here as you get closer to the race.However, I think the reason Republicans keep jumping on that particular interview is because what it suggests is that the vice president doesn't necessarily have a good enough command over certain topics that are critical for the American people, such as immigration and such as the economy. One of the reasons why this interview tomorrow with Dana Bash is going to be so important for so many voters, does the vice president answer why she's had this transformation on critical issues from fracking, from wanting to provide healthcare to illegal immigrants to (inaudible) wait a minute here, maybe we should look at something different, from supporting the police to wanting to defund the police.
