I'm Fredricka Whitfield.And we begin this hour with President-elect Donald Trump making more moves to fill out his administration. He's tapping campaign staff members Steven Cheung, Karoline Leavitt, and Sergio Gor for key White House roles. He has also selected North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum as his Interior Secretary. While Trump's cabinet is taking shape, there are still eight major cabinet positions open and some of his picks are already facing an uphill climb for Capitol Hill confirmation. His choice for Attorney General, former Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz, is facing increasing scrutiny as the House Ethics Committee weighs whether to release its report on allegations Gaetz may have engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use. On Friday, a lawyer representing two witnesses said one of those clients testified to the committee that she saw Gaetz having sex with a minor. But House Speaker Mike Johnson says he is requesting the committee not release the report, citing Gaetz's resignation from U.S. Congress. And Gaetz isn't the only Trump pick facing scrutiny. Sources tell CNN Trump's transition team was caught off guard after hearing of an alleged sexual assault investigation involving his Defense Secretary pick Pete Hegseth. Here's CNN's Kyung Lah.",

The city of Monterey says that his police department became involved in a, quote, \"alleged sexual assault involving Pete Hegseth,\" that it took place allegedly on October 8th, 2017 in the early morning hours at the Hyatt Regency in Monterey. And that the police department became involved four days after this alleged incident when it was notified that something may have happened.Now, I want you to take a look at this picture from Facebook. It comes from the California Federation of Republican Women, and it shows Hegseth speaking at a podium. He was a speaker at their conference, according to these photos. Now, the city statement, while not being specific in identifying Hegseth as an alleged assailant, does say that he was involved. It also talks about an unnamed victim and injuries, and the injury being described as, quote, \"contusions to right thigh.\" The city says that it would not be releasing the full police report, and a check of the court shows that Hegseth has not been charged in the county since 2017 up until today. We did reach out to Hegseth's lawyer, who issued a denial saying that, yes, an allegation was made, but no charges were filed. And we also reached out to Trump's spokesman, who says that Hegseth has vigorously denied any and all accusations, and, quote, \"we look forward to his confirmation.\" Kyung Lah, CNN, San Francisco.",

And it really comes down to two things. Number one, he was going to set fire to every aspect of the government. He didn't believe in any of it. What we've built in this country over almost 250 years now, you know, top to bottom, he didn't care about any of it. He was going to tear it all down as quickly and as effectively as he possibly could, number one. And number two, he was going to rebuild it so that it served his ego and his interests, period, full stop. He told us that. For like four years, and now everyone's like, oh, my God, Matt Gaetz and, you know, Tulsi Gabbard and Peter Hegseth, who are these people? What is he thinking? He told you what he was thinking.

And you get that with almost the perfect essence of what Matt Gaetz is, is somebody who will likely do Trump's bidding. That's why he's picked. That's why Trump probably would use some power to get him through, likely on a recess appointment. And that would be true for almost all his appointees, because he does not believe necessarily.

President Biden, as you mentioned, will be meeting later this afternoon with President Xi Jinping, a leader he's known for more than a decade. But the stakes are incredibly high, as the two leaders with the most consequential bilateral relationship in the world reflect on what progress, if any, has been made over the last four years to try to keep the competition between the two nations from spilling over into conflict. Now, just a year ago, they tried to establish some areas of shared interest on artificial intelligence, on curbing illicit fentanyl, and on establishing military communication to try to de-conflict in the South China Sea and in the broader Indo-Pacific. But there are also going to be several warnings that President Biden is expected to issue to President Xi on his support for Russia's war in Ukraine, on the deployment of North Korean troops to Russia to train, to potentially deploy in Ukraine. And then there's going to be warnings on cyber activity as well, and of course, on economic competition. Now, that one is going to loom large with President-elect Donald Trump returning to office in January. He has threatened a wide ranging and very costly trade war against China. And he's installed several China hawks that are going to be executing this mission. Certainly Chinese officials are trying to figure out how to posture in preparation for that. But considering how much President Xi is going to need to reserve to negotiate with President-elect Trump once he takes office, senior U.S. officials are advising reporters that there are not going to be many outcomes or deliverables from this meeting.

International law says that an occupying power, and Israel is an occupying power in Gaza, when it orders the evacuation of the population, this order must be temporary and it must be issued for the population's security or for an imperative military reason. Also, Israel must ensure the safety of civilians during the evacuation and in the areas where people have moved to and preserve the right to return. This is what the law says.We have found that none of these conditions apply in this case. First, much of this is not temporary. The destruction in some areas and some statements by Israeli officials such as that the territory of Gaza will decrease the blowing up and flattening Gaza is beautiful and that land will be handed to settlers. And invitations by Prime Minister Netanyahu to Palestinian civilians to emigrate voluntarily and request to third countries to welcome them, they show the clear intention to permanently and not temporarily displace these -- these civilians. As for the military objective, this needs to be proven in every case. There have been hundreds and hundreds of cases. Israel has not provided detailed explanations on the military objectives. And certainly these orders are not for the security of the civilians. We have found in our research that civilians have been attacked on evacuation routes and in areas where Israel moved them ordered them to move to. The orders were often confusing to people. Some were issued even after the bombing had started or minutes before it started, not giving people enough time to evacuate. And the areas where people moved to often there was no food, no water, no electricity, no toilets. So the security of civilians was not the reason for this displacement. And finally, with the destruction of the majority of Gaza's water, sanitation, communications, energy and transport infrastructure, schools, hospital, everything, this proves that this is inconsistent with Israel's obligation to ensure the return of civilians.",
