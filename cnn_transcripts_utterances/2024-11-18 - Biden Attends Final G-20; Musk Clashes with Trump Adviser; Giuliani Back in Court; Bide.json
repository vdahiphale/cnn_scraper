President-elect Donald Trump looming over every critical conversation. Trump had promised to end the war in Ukraine in one day. He has vowed tariffs across the board on U.S. imports, has threatened to end climate change action and close the U.S. border.Let's get straight to CNN's Kayla Tausche, who is traveling with President Biden today. Kayla, Biden already in those meetings after walking in. We're seeing that video there in Rio de Janeiro. What are you hearing is going to occur today in these meetings?",

And President Biden is expected to support billions of dollars in new funding for the World Bank to help some of those efforts get a new financial push.But certainly, the backdrop to all of this is the step change that the U.S. has pursued in Ukraine to try to bring about a closer end to that conflict. U.S. officials defending any change in strategy by suggesting that it was Russia who lit the fire of this conflict by invading Ukraine and then upping the ante by enlisting some thousands of North Korean troops to help them potentially fight in Ukraine, and that the green lighting of allowing Ukraine to use U.S. made long range missiles that could strike up to 190 miles into Russian territory as simply was a response to Russia's own expanding of that conflict. Now, after the U.S. makes this decision, there is an expectation that the U.K. and France could allow Ukraine to use long range weapons that they have manufactured to the same effect, which would certainly represent a significant policy change on behalf of western allies as this protracted war continues and faces the potential of a change in approach from the U.S. once Donald Trump takes office. Now, President Biden and his officials believe that going into this G- 20 summit, his fourth and final of his presidency, that the U.S. is on stronger footing on the world stage than four years ago. But they acknowledge that there is a new administration coming in January, and that that could bring some significant change of its own.",

But he said no one can reverse the clean energy revolution that is underway. But certainly, Sara, there are conversations among every world leader here at the G-20 on exactly what their relationship with the incoming administration is going to look like, what policies could be put forth, and how they could strengthen their position in dealing and negotiating with Trump himself once he takes office, Sara.",

He said it would be more interesting to hear people weigh in on this for Donald Trump to consider feedback. My view is that Bessent is a business as usual choice, whereas Lutnick will actually enact change. Business as usual is driving America bankrupt, so we need change one way or another.So, Christine, like Trump's behind closed doors, but he's also lobbying in public. How is this supposed to work?",

I think that all of us are talking about the Treasury secretary in a way we probably otherwise wouldn't. We're knowing the differences on where he's focused, we're talking about whether or not this is going to be a crypto focus, if the person's going to support tariffs, if they're going to support regulation. There's so much more conversation about a Treasury secretary pick than we otherwise would have.And this is what Donald Trump does. He does a weekend drop of all kinds of things that on Monday we're all picking up and talking about and here we go again.

They investigated Gaetz for - for the sexual abuse allegations, trafficking and drug use allegations, all of which Gaetz has denied.But there is this report out there and also new reporting on the information that House members got.

But they also need to make sure they don't just blanket oppose all of them because then it will seem way too political and just reactionary.But that there is a report that Speaker Johnson won't release really makes you think there's something terrible in the report. So, if there's nothing that's going to unfairly add information out there about this appointment, why not just put it out? Why did he resign seemingly early, before he's even confirmed, if he isn't trying to hide something? It's one of those situations where if there is smoke, there is probably fire, and that report should be released for the good of the office and the good of the country.",

Just about every time there's about one of the appointees that doesn't go through, I think this is a very smart move by Donald Trump, if that's what this is, because, you know what,  he's out of the House, he's out of his hair, and he could be out of the spotlight for a while.

So, Giuliani is trying to get the case thrown out. He will be before a judge today.

So, on Friday, Giuliani's lawyer said that he did turn those items over. He's in the process of turning over his Manhattan penthouse apartmentvalued at around $6 million to these women, but he says now that he wants the refrigerator that is in it. So, he's trying to kind of claw that back. And that's because under the rules you can have certain materials that are necessary to live. And that score, his lawyers are also trying to prevent some sports memorabilia from being turned over. That was also expected to be turned over on Friday. That was the deadline. He did not turn over the contents of this storage locker in Long Island that has the sports memorabilia.
