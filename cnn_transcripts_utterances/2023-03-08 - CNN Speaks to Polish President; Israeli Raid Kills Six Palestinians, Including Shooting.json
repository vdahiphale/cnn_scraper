This is Moscow claims control over the city's east despite Ukrainian defiance. Thousands take to the streets in Georgia to protest a Russian style law - police please use tear gas to disperse the crowds and detained almost 70 people. Weeks of large-scale demonstrations across Israel have failed to hold Benjamin Netanyahu's plans for a judicial overhaul. A group of combat pilots is joining the protest by refusing to train ratcheting up the pressure on the government. Well, the Israeli military raid in the West Bank and start that again for you. The U.N. envoy for Middle East peace says he is alarmed by another deadly Israeli military raid in the West Bank. Israeli forces entered a refugee camp in Jenin and killed a Hamas militant suspected of killing two Jewish settler brothers. Five other Palestinians were killed. Raid coming as some Israeli pilot's boycott training exercises to protest the government judicial overhaul ban. There have been widespread protests across Israel over that ban. Elliott Gotkine is back with us this hour from Jerusalem, while these protests continue this raid on Jenin and is being responded to and responded to in kind across the board.

Now we've seen these people, hundreds of thousands in aggregate on the streets of Tel Aviv, or Jerusalem and other cities across Israel. But things seem to be ratcheting up in terms of the pressure on the government because now a particular Squadron, an elite squadron of Israeli air force pilots 37 of its 40 members of his squadron 69 skipped training today. A kind of yellow card, if you like for the government to warn that look, they're not saying they're not going to serve on missions at this point. But if this judicial overhaul is rammed through, then there could be severe consequences. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) GOTKINE (voice over): They bombed Iraq's nuclear reactor in 1981 and regularly hit Iranian targets in Syria. And even some of Israel's revered combat pilots are now firing warning shots with reservists from one squadron skipping a training session, and suggesting they may not heed the call of duty if the government ramps through its judicial overhaul. In this country, that's a very big deal. COLONEL NERI YARKONI (RET.), FORMER IAF PILOT: No existence of Israel is based on the Israeli Air Force simple as that. GOTKINE (voice over): Neri Yarconi was an Israeli combat pilot for 30 years.

This has been important they say because their strategic objectives have now been reached not only managing to wear down the Russian ability to continue to wage war. And this is something that Western official's backup saying that they doubt now that Russians have either with regular soldiers or mercenaries large reserves in either Donetsk or Luhansk province with which to mount further large offensives like they did around Bakhmut. The other point of the Ukrainians they say has been to gain time. Again, Western officials saying that they understand that to be the case that Ukrainians they say have chosen in Bakhmut to trade space for time.

Protest against Russia style bill that would require certain organizations to register as foreign agents. Opponents say that move would move the country away from democracy towards authoritarianism.

So, this was the discussion in Stockholm, I think there was a press conference ended few minutes ago, where all this was explained. So, we will get it probably in other feeds. But to summarize it very shortly, Ukraine needs any help any assistance it can get, especially from the European allies, but also from the U.S. from Canada and others. The European Union is committed; we are providing a lot of military supplies to Ukraine. At this stage, the discussion is about the ammunition because this is crucially needed. And the one million was one billion was just a proposal. Of course, the overall amount of military help to Ukraine is reaching more than 12 billion euros at this stage, and will probably increase because we are determined to help Ukraine for as long as needed and the discussions about one billion for ammunition or whatever other amounts, and whatever other forms of military support. This is just the expression how committed we are because Ukraine in our eyes is fighting a legitimate war of defense against the brutal aggressor, which aims to destroy the country and erase the Ukrainian nation from the earth.

Female boxers in Cuba are finally allowed to compete in the league after decades of restrictions. Now, many are making history by getting into the ring. CNN's Patrick Oppmann has this report from Havana. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): For years this is how women in Cuba have boxed, sparring in rudimentary gyms with whatever equipment they could scrounge. Well, men's boxing is a sport the island has long dominated; women's boxing did not bear the government's stamp of approval, meaning women boxers had to train on their own and were unable to compete in tournaments at home or abroad. It was a missed opportunity to show how formidable Cuban women can be in the ring says trainer Namibia. From the time we were in our mother's wombs, we are fighters, she says. We are always fighting for something to raise our kids to help our families to be independent. Whether it was sexism or simply the slow pace of progress they were up against and long last Cuba's female boxers are getting their title shot. In December, Cuban boxing officials said a new league for women would be created and that they hoped female boxers could represent the island in the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris. We took this step when we were sure really convinced, he says, that it was the moment and we didn't have any concerns because our women would be protected. Weeks later, 12 women made history as they competed for a spot on the team. OPPMANN (on camera): Cuba has long produced some of the world's best mailboxes or women were prevented from taking part in the sport here. Now that that glass ceiling has finally been broken. At last, the moment for Cuba's women boxers has arrived for them to shine. OPPMANN (voice over): And he doubts about the women's fighting abilities were quickly put to rest, as they came out swinging. These athletes know they will still need to change the minds about whether they belong in the ring. But say it long last attitudes are shifting. In my case, all the comments I have received have been positive, she says that if I make an effort, I can achieve it. The Cuban women have the potential for this. It took years for this moment to arrive. And while Cuba's women boxers are only just beginning to fight, simply being in the ring means they've already won the first round.

The World Bank says that for the past 20 years, Middle East and North Africa has the highest youth unemployment rate in the world. Today, nearly one in every three people aged between 15 to 24, did not have a professional or academic occupation. This is in part a result of political instability in some countries, such as Syria and Yemen, which disrupted access to formal education and training. Heightened with school closures during the COVID 19 pandemic and with a spike in skilled job openings in the region, and a widening skills gap, there is a divergence of skills acquired by youth compared to the skills that are actually required.",

So, it's introduced or called for an opportunity for us to really build the programs and are the well-being. GIOKOS (voice over): Over the past few decades in Morocco, the share of the population completing secondary school and university has increased significantly according to the World Economic Forum. In 2015, the government set an ambitious task to tackle some of the challenges in the education sector. Their program focuses on ensuring equal opportunities among its use and forming more proactive and driven professionals. Today, the kingdom is reaping the rewards of these efforts with an increase in the number of students in tertiary education, but over 30 percent between 2017 and 2022 according to national data.

So, we have a loss of qualified young people, well-educated young people. We are losing a lot of engineers too. So we are in this situation, we have to respond to our internal demand on the socio-economic level. But at the same time, we have a brain drain which is significant, which we live obviously as a challenge, and as a constraint for the years ahead.
