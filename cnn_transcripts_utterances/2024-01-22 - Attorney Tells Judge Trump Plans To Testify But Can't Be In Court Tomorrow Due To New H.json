And once the judge got on the bench just around 10 a.m., he informed everyone that a juror on his way into the court had told the judge she wasn't feeling well. The judge said the jurors should go home and test for any potential COVID exposure. So then he raised us to the parties and asked them if they wanted to continue with just eight jurors, Carroll's attorneys said that they would. Trump's lawyer, Alina Habba, said that they didn't want to.She also had already informed the judge that she was exposed to COVID three days ago when she had dinner with her parents one of them had tested positive. So she had tested negative today and was in court. But she was arguing that they wanted to delay, they wanted to come back tomorrow and continue with the court proceeding. E. Jean Carroll is still putting on some of her case, but she is expected to rest and then Donald Trump is expected to take the stand. It was at that point that Trump leaned over to Habba whispered to her. And then Habba said, your honor, my client just reminded me that tomorrow is the New Hampshire primaries. He wants to testify in this case. So can we come back to court on Wednesday. So the judge would not rule on that right now. Instead, he said he wanted to have all the jurors test him, the party's test for any potential COVID exposure. He also told them that he wanted them to keep evidence of their test, because the court would want to check for any potential positive cases. And he said that they would look and see where things stood tomorrow morning with the jurors testing the party's testing. But he said to them that he was not willing to delay the trial another day. Even if Trump wanted to be in New Hampshire, he can testify here and go to New Hampshire as well. But the judge saying that he wasn't going to rule that circumstances, may give Trump what he wants with another day off but he said they also may not. Kate?",

And someone in the Sununu camp just told us that she doesn't even need to get necessarily, well, he said if they can keep Donald Trump below 60 percent or 50 percent. That would be good for Nikki Haley. You will see the highest margins in competitive Republican primaries before, Ronald Reagan was the only one to get over 50. So how do you judge success?",

I think anything short of that, John, is her campaign, her allies and others putting their best spin forward to try and set expectations for everyone else. She -- if she over performs where most of the polling has her and I let's say she's within five points of Donald Trump, do I think that she might be able to get some momentum, some continued funding and rationale for moving forward? Sure, I'm not sure how long lasting that will be looking into the rest of the calendar.But I -- here for Nikki Haley, where we are because of Donald Trump's overwhelming victory in Iowa because everyone else has dropped out because of the coalescing around him because of the math in the upcoming events, an outright victory here is really what will define success for her. BERMAN: Let's talk about what happens after tomorrow. I'm going to put up the schedule here, roughly. This is the primary calendar people can see it right here. Let me pull out so they can see the whole map here. There are a smattering of early contests. Nikki Haley is not competing in the Nevada caucuses. South Carolina is on the 24th of February, Michigan's on the 27th. And then everything in green here is Super Tuesday on March 5th. So what is this mean, as we look at this for Nikki Haley?",

So about half of them, I think, are going to be contests where either there's no registration in the state and the election could be open to independents, as well, or half of them are close to just Republicans only, which has not been her strong suit if you look at the Iowa entrance polls, if you look at the pre- election polling here in New Hampshire.So if you start looking at the delegate math, and what will Nikki Haley need to do to be truly in a viable position for the nomination, she would have to start showing strength in areas of the electorate conservatives, Republicans, that she hasn't yet shown. That's number one. And then number two is I think the question for the Haley campaign is, what does this look like as a campaign going forward? If much of the party is coalescing around Donald Trump, assuming he has a substantial victory tomorrow night here for the purposes of this conversation? Is this a bit of a zombie campaign? Is she just sort of waiting it out to see if something happens in court in the month ahead with Donald Trump and so that she's just sort of standing there as a vehicle for all the Never Trump or somewhat anti-Trump or I'm open to moving away from Trump Republicans in the party, which by the way, do not seem to be the largest share of the party thus far.",

Joining with her former lieutenant governor, joining with the two U.S. senators from the state, Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott, Nikki Haley, may have served and was twice elected as governor in South Carolina, that doesn't necessarily mean she has a leg up in a Republican primary there. And so I do think you noted there's like a month now, before that South Carolina primary. The reason those favorable and unfavorable numbers are what they are, John, is because of the pummeling that Nikki Haley has been taking in the last couple of months since she started having some momentum from Trump and his allies. That is only going to continue.And so she's going to have to find a way to tell donors and explain to voters that there is a viable path for her to the nomination. Once nobody in the donor class or voters start believing that and buying into that, she's going to be left on an island. And that is no place that a candidate wants to be especially if they're trying to avoid an embarrassing loss in their home state.",

That's a lot of empty real estate for a campaign that may not have momentum after tomorrow might. But if she doesn't have the momentum, hard, those are four hard brutal weeks to stay in.

She may come in underwater to Trump but with the independents there. I think they can make a significant difference in New Hampshire likes that. They like to be able to say that they're more than just kind of your typical, we're stuck in only Democrats or only Republicans, we'd like to do things differently.So we can make a difference. I think she's suffering a little from expectations, which is everybody is kind of expecting she's going to win. And if she doesn't win, it's going to be seen as a disappointment.

This should be Ron DeSantis and New Hampshire. And I think it could have been. He made a lot of mistakes. But I think maybe one of the fundamental mistakes was that Ron DeSantis, didn't try to get me and Adam, on his part -- as part of this coalition.I mean, there's a scenario where Ron DeSantis runs against Donald Trump. And he basically tries to become a hybrid who brings in Republicans who don't like Donald Trump, and also Republicans who voted for Trump, but are ready to move on that he could have tried to be a hybrid candidate. That would have essentially, I think boxed out Nikki Haley, there's no reason for Nikki Haley to run if Ron DeSantis becomes a candidate who is at least minimally acceptable to non-Trump Republicans. Instead, DeSantis tried to become Trump light. Now, if you're already voting for Trump, why would you vote for Trump light? So I think he started off with this fundamental, flawed strategy. And then when it didn't work, what did he do? He decided, let's go after the Elon Musk vote. Let's go after the even like rarer, weirder, kind of, you know, right wing edge lord Twitter very online vote. And so, look, yes, I think that there's a scenario where Ron DeSantis could have, in fact, gotten in this race early, gotten in January, instead of waiting till the summer, he could have run aggressively.

I do want to ask you, Matt, you know, DeSantis is out. Where do those votes go? I mean, you said he's trying to out Trump, Trump. That's kind of what's his pitfall, his downfall.

It will hurt Nikki Haley. What she needed was Chris Christie to get out. She needed Vivek and DeSantis to stay and that would have been very helpful.If we're looking for a silver lining, I would say I think that anything that shakes things up right now because I don't think Nikki has provided enough excitement, you know, we didn't have the debates in New Hampshire that we normally have. So anything that shakes things up, maybe that helps her in some sort of weird vibe way. But if we're looking at the numbers, if we're looking at math, I think it's a net loss for her.",
