Alfred Hagan visited the Thailand -- Titanic wreckage and went on two missions both times with Paul Nargeolet. There's video from last summer. You can hear the French explore in the background.

I know you have been following this all week long, hoping that there would be different results.Talk a little bit, if you can, about Paul-Henri Nargeolet. What was he like? ALFRED HAGAN, FRIEND OF PAUL-HENRI NARGEOLET: As I've said before, P.H. was this wonderfully, warm human being. An incredibly talented, iconic, legendary, the greatest deep diver that the world has ever known. But at the same time, with the humility and the grace to sit down and to speak to anyone as an equal. And as someone said a couple days ago, the man equally at ease on the deck of the ship in a hurricane or sitting conversing in a Parisian Cafe. Just a wonderful, wonderful individual. And it's truly broke my heart that a man of his dynamism (ph) will no longer, you know, shine his light on this -- in this world.",

And P.H. and I would just be conversing with the other people on board.And when you actually got to the bottom, and we began flying, and you have to understand that GPS doesn't penetrated that deep into the ocean. So, when you get to the bottom, you actually have to find the Titanic. And the bow and the stern are a considerable distance apart. So you're - you're flying a few feet -- several feet above the ocean floor and you're - you're searching. And you've got a sonar the reaches out maybe 100 yards, 150 yards. So you're flying almost blind in a world far beyond the reach of light. So it's a world of perpetual midnight. And then suddenly, if you're lucky, you see the ship appear out of the darkness. And it's a - it was a phenomenal experience. I don't regret going. I do regret that I won't be able to go again with P.H. But when we got to the ship, that is when P.H. would take over -",

They told Congress that IRS investigators recommended far more serious felony charges. This hours after House Republicans release the transcripts of the whistleblower testimony. Hunter Biden, as we can see here, was seen at the White House mingling with guests at the state dinner for India's prime minister, Narendra Modi. CNN's Evan Perez joins us now with the details. So, Evan, what exactly are these whistleblowers alleging against the DOJ?",

This - they say this is a five-year investigation and that the IRS, at one point, recommended a total of 11 counts against Hunter Biden, including felonies for federal tax evasion, filing false tax returns, false statements going back to 2014. In the end, they say - in the end, what we know is that the Justice Department, the Trump-appointed prosecutor there, David Weiss, agreed to a plea deal with Hunter Biden for only two misdemeanors. They say that their recommendation actually had the backing of some of the prosecutors who are working this case more closely.And so here's what Gary Shapley, who is the supervisor, the IRS supervisor who came forward, this is what he says. I am alleging, with evidence, that the DOJ provided preferential treatment, slow-walked the investigation, did nothing to avoid obvious conflicts of interest in this investigation. Of course this means that Congress is going to spend more time investigated what exactly happened behind-the-scenes at the Justice Department and at the U.S. attorney's office in Delaware.",

Again, these are two agents who were very seasoned, and they've been following this investigation very closely for years, and they say they were not allowed to investigate very thoroughly some parts of this investigation - some parts of the evidence that they say pointing fingers at the sitting president, Joe Biden.And here's what Shapley said in this - there's a 2017 message that is purported to come from Hunter Biden to a Chinese partner that he's trying to get to pay him. And so this is what it says. It says, I am sitting here with my father and we would like to understand why the commitment has not been fulfilled. He says - he goes on to say that essentially he's - he holds - he will hold a grudge against whoever is not paying. And then he ended it by saying, I am sitting here waiting for the call with my father. Now, the importance of that is that, you know, Joe Biden has repeatedly said that, you know, he's never talked business, his son's business issues, with his son. And, again, this is a message from 2017. Joe Biden was not president at the time. But the question is, you know, where was this message and where -- was evidence like this thoroughly investigated by the FBI and the IRS? Phil. Rahel.",

We knew every detail of it intimately. I was involved in every phase of the testing. So, you know, I assessed the risk. I understood them very well. And those were risks I was willing to take.I would never take it upon myself to ask someone else to take that type of risk. And if I were designing a multi-see vehicle where I intended to be the pilot, we'd go through all of the rigorous testing protocols and review protocols that you have with, let's say, ABC, which is the American Bureau of Shipping, or DNV, or German Lloyd's, who are the major, you know, bureaus, that class A sub.
