Europe meantime continues its strong 2023 advance, but new pain and tech Alphabet now the latest firm to announce a major round of layoffs, thousands of workers being cut globally. We will discuss in just a moment. And it's also the last day of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \"First Move\" closing out the week in style with an array of important guests from the conference we'll hear from Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez on the fight to alleviate inequality. U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres on the immediate steps needed to combat climate change. Plus, the Prime Minister of Greece on the importance of standing united with Ukraine. And the conflict in Ukraine is where we begin today's program. We begin on the sidelines of a high stakes defense meeting, where the German Defense Minister has just told reporters, no decision has been made yet on whether to send Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine. Right now Ministers from dozens of countries are debating how to boost Ukrainian Military capabilities? Ukraine's President Zelenskyy opened the meeting calling for more assistance without delay.

But as you pointed out, we just heard from Germany's very new Defense Minister Boris Pistorius that no decision has yet been made. This is Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says, look, Time is not on our side. It's on Russia side pushing the U.S. and other countries to move faster. The question is what will cause Germany to make a decision and that's what the U.S. and others are trying to figure out. As you point out Poland has been very vocal about this, they've been frustrated and that, as we've just seen, has boiled over there. Now threatening just to send tanks normally, because these are German made Leopard tanks, you would need Germany's approval before exporting them to another country. Finland has also expressed its willingness to send Leopard tanks, and about a dozen other countries in Europe have these. So these are not in short supply. But Germany is just too timid right now and has not yet made a decision. Up until now, it appeared to be - for that, Germany was waiting for the U.S. to announce its own sending of tanks. But the U.S. has made clear that the main U.S. tech known as the Abrams is simply too complex and too much of a maintenance nightmare too heavy to send to Ukraine and saying, look, that's not the issue here. The issue is Germany needs to approve this and we're held that's what we're watching. Now, does Germany shift on this one? Or for example, does Poland just do what it's threatening to do send its tanks and wait to see what the consequences are from Germany?",

So help me put this in context 12,000 workers, I mean, how much of a cut is that percentage wise Alphabet as a huge company, obviously? But also how much of this is a correction perhaps if you can call it that from the massive expansion the company saw during the pandemic? PAUL R. LA MONICA, CNN REPORTER: Yes, that's a great point. Well, it's about 6 percent of the global headcount at Alphabet. So that is pretty significant, I think that what you have going on here is that Alphabet, which owns Google, YouTube, of course, really ramped up aggressively and now realizes like many other tech companies, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, that they have to scale back. And Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai even admitted saying, over the past two years, we've seen periods of dramatic growth. To match and fuel that growth, we hired for a different economic reality than the one we face today. And, you know, if you didn't know who that was saying that you could have thought that it was Mark Zuckerberg, that it was Satya Nadella, that it was someone you know, at pretty much any tech company right now.

And the company did admit on the conference call, which I think is reassuring some investors today that the growth they saw is new customers, they didn't have as many paying premium subscribers going down to the ad tier even though it cost less money. So I think that's reassuring that people at Netflix that already had more expensive plans, didn't look to cut costs. But you know, Netflix and streaming, what we've really quickly learned, Rahel, is it's all about hits. Remember this time a year ago, it was all about squid game and how that was saving Netflix. Now it's Wednesday, it was such a phenomenal hit for the company. And it really just goes to show that when you're in streaming media, if you have a property like Wednesday at Netflix like the Mandalorian at Disney.

Well, after a three year COVID ban, China says that it will allow tour operators to resume overseas package holidays for Chinese vacationers to certain countries. Right now, China is also facing one of the busiest travel days of the year for travel with millions heading home to celebrate the Lunar New Year holiday this weekend. Let's bring in Marc Stewart in Hong Kong. Marc, so help me understand put this in context for me.

So the stage is set for what is described as the largest human migration on Earth, or at least that's what past history as shown. If you look at the broader picture, 1.4 billion people living in China, but there may be as many as 2 billion individual trips. And today, if we look across China, people are traveling by air, by sea, they are driving they are flying a very busy scene at travel hubs all across the country. With that said, of course, there is some concern about the spread of COVID. While health officials do again, feel there has been this peak, the question is whether or not rural areas are perhaps in as strong shape as city centers, if anything because of health resources that are available. But this is a much cherished time of the year; this is a time of year that people across Asia really look forward to. And historically speaking, this has been something that's been on hold for about two to three years in many parts of the world, because of COVID. So people are trying to make that effort to see their loved ones to see their family and friends. You did mention that some of the tour operators in China will be able to resume travel again. And that is significant because it will open up China to places such as Singapore. I'm looking at the list here South Africa, Russia, Switzerland, Argentina, all different directions where travel has been put on hold. With that said in some parts of the world, Chinese travelers are being met with restrictions, whether it be testing or some kind of a waiting period. So that's also in play here, but as far as here in Hong Kong, Rahel, where I am, there are rabbits everywhere it is the year the rabbit people are very excited even in conversations with colleagues and with sources. They're just looking forward to slowing down and spending time with family and friends.",

But the fear here has been for some time now that Russia is planning a major spring offensive. The logic behind that is that 300,000 troops were mobilized. 150,000 of them were sent onto the battlefield; the remaining 150,000 have been in training and will basically be finishing their training in the coming weeks. And so the idea is that they will then be part of some kind of a spring offensive. What you heard also from Lloyd Austin, the U.S. Secretary of Defense was, this is a key moment, because right now Russia is running out of ammunition, but they are trying to regroup they are trying to recruit. And they are trying to basically build up production internally in terms of their military industrial production. And so the fear is that the longer you leave it, the law, the greater the chances that Russia will be sort of successful in some kind of an offensive.
