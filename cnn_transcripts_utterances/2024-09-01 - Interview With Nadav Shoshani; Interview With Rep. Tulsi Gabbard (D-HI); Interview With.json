Israelis are on the streets protesting, demanding a cease-fire agreement after defense officials said they recovered the bodies of six Israeli hostages murdered by Hamas, including Israeli American Hersh Goldberg-Polin, who was 23 years old. An IDF spokesman said Hamas brutally killed the six young adults in an underground tunnel near Rafah a short time before Israeli forces arrived. Three of them would have been released in the early stages of a cease- fire agreement to Israeli officials, told CNN, an agreement President Biden said last night was on the verge of happening, while Vice President Harris released a statement that reads in part: \"The threat Hamas poses to the people of Israel and American citizens in Israel must be eliminated and Hamas cannot control Gaza. The Palestinian people too have suffered under Hamas rule for nearly two decades.\" Here with me now is IDF spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Nadav Shoshani. Thank you so much for being here. We are so incredibly devastated for Israel, for all of the families. It's just hard to even imagine how much pain everybody is in. And as a spokesperson for the IDF, I'd like for you to explain exactly what happened when these six bodies were found. LT. COL. NADAV SHOSHANI, IDF INTERNATIONAL SPOKESPERSON:  Thank you, Dana. Thank you for having me. This is a very sad morning in Israel, very sad news coming out of the Gaza Strip announcing today after we were able to talk to the families and inform them about finding the bodies of their loved ones. These were six people that were taken on October 7. And in our operations in Rafah, in an underground tunnel, we found their bodies and we brought them back to Israel. We examined them and we found that they were murdered by Hamas recently. We were able to inform the families about it and share the news today, the very, very sad news about them. And...",

I think President Biden and Vice President Harris are turning over every stone in their efforts to secure the release of the hostages and protect the lives of the hostages and achieve a cease-fire. I don't think they go a waking moment without focusing on this. We're not putting boots on the ground in these tunnels under Gaza, so it is a very difficult situation in terms of our own ability to rescue these hostages.

But, look, let's compare a situation where someone changed their position four years ago to Donald Trump, who's changed his position four times on abortion in the last 48 hours. That, to me, is a much more significant question, particularly as, when you're talking about abortion and you're talking about a right and freedom of the American people to be so pandering, wishy-washy, flip-flopping so disrespectful to the rights and freedoms of millions of American women, and do all that in a single day.

And you can point to that on issues related to the economy, issues related to freedom of speech. She says she stands for freedom of speech. And yet, as we have seen time and time again, her and Joe Biden have taken actions both directly and indirectly to censor free speech. Most recently, I can point to my own experience of this of how the Harris/Biden administration have added me to a secret domestic terror watch list the very day after Kamala Harris was endorsed by Joe Biden and I was on TV and warning the American people about what I saw as the dangers of a Kamala Harris presidency, taking action that was clearly political retaliation.

Probably not. And that is an issue he's going to have to solve with them, although he does have a record of being a pro-life president. And is he more conservative on it than Democrats want him to be? Yes, I actually think his position that he's running on is pretty moderate and has been pretty successful for Republican for a long time, going all the way back to Ronald Reagan. I think, if I were in his shoes, I would just say, I am generally pro- life. My administration would be directionally pro-life. The Democrats would be directionally the other way.

So that's what was going on this week with this back-and-forth aboutthe Florida bill, where he said one thing and then his team walked it back and then he had to clarify. So -- but to Scott's point, he does have a record, and we should pay very close attention. He put justices who are hostile to IVF on the court, Amy Coney Barrett and a federal judge in Ohio. He also has a record of making it harder for women to get access to the health care that they need. I mean, when he says he's going to have this government mandate around IVF, is that before after he takes away the Affordable Care Act, not to mention his record of making it harder for poor women to access Medicaid, which is both important for the full range of reproductive health care services, including pregnancy for poor women. So the record does matter. He is anti-choice. He has appointed the justices that overturned Roe v. Wade. Three times, Republicans have tried to put forward legislation for a national abortion ban.

I mean, as a black man, you look at the number of people who get abortions, ethnically speaking, the demographic breakdown, and I am concerned about the fact that you see a lot of people of color getting abortions as a conservative. Then my question becomes for Republicans, then what do we need to do to support policies to prohibit this? We need to support families. We need to increase child tax credit. We need to do whatever is necessary, I would argue, to not have that as an ultimate choice or the first choice, I should say, for struggling people out there. And so that's something that I think about. And if my Democratic friends want to support allowing people to get abortions whenever they want, then more power to them. But the Republican Party and conservatives need to be the party that supports families, that are pro-families, that are support and pro-sex education in schools again, so that this isn't the immediate choice for people, that they have alternatives.
