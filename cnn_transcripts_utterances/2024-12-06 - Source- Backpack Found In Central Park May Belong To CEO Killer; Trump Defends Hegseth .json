But Kaitlan, they are not yet at a point where they can say that this person is the suspect, that this person is the one that they want to bring in and question. But based on two sources, what we're told is that they have been homing in on an individual, trying to learn that individual's identity, more information about that person.

Thank you for that. We're going to show you much of that interview tonight. Because right now, police in New York City, in addition to what Shimon just reported there, as they are appearing to get closer to identifying this potential suspect here, they have also discovered what they believe to be is the backpack that that gunman was wearing, when he executed the UnitedHealthcare CEO, Brian Thompson, outside the Hilton hotel, in the heart of Manhattan. Here is the bag that was found on the left, and a look at what the shooter was wearing during the crime, on your right. Now, that bag on the left, right now, is undergoing forensic testing right this minute. And here's what we know so far. A law enforcement source tells CNN, that backpack was found during a second sweep, tonight, in Central Park, between some of the boulders close to where that famous carousel is, that many of the tourists will recognize. Shimon got the first interview with the top NYPD officials, earlier today. And here's why, the Chief of Detectives said, an item like that backpack is so crucial. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He made a left and went for an alleyway. The bike was right on the next corner. He keeps, you know, he's told us something about himself that he doesn't realize he told us. He goes left, then he ends up right. He's done that a number of times. Biked into the park, got out 75th Street, 85th Street. But his destination was 104. He keeps going one way and ends up going the other way. He's told us that about himself. We need to listen to him. I doubt he left anything in that backpack that's going to help us to identify him, other than prints or DNA. That bus terminal. Now, I almost jumped out of my car on the way down here because it was breaking news, this afternoon. That bus terminal, they've said they saw him in a video going in, but he's not on the video coming out. I worked patrol up there, many years ago. There's a tunnel that goes for the basement, to that bus tunnel, to the New York City subway system on the 175th Street. He could have went in. This is that -- he's told us that he does things like this. He made a left, went to an alleyway. We didn't have to. The bike was on the very next corner. He went in the park, came out at 75th Street. He's going to 104th Street. He keeps doing these different things. He went into that bus terminal. I'm sure he left the city. But maybe, he could have doubled back the Port Authority. And if he's to Greyhound, you know, he took the Greyhound in here from Atlanta. Greyhound only goes to three cities out of that bus terminal, George Washington Bridge. Boston, Philly and D.C. There are other bus terminal -- companies working out of that terminal. He could be anywhere, that's true. But the backpack, I don't think that there's going to be a lot in there, other than DNA.

And you see what she referred to there, as the money shot. It's that picture of the suspect smiling, for a brief moment, as he was checking into the hostel, as John Miller was told yesterday, because he was flirting with the woman at the front desk. Now that we've learned, he kept his mask -- he was so meticulous about keeping his mask on, that he had it on even when he was eating meals at the hostel. What stands out to you, as you look at this suspect? MARY ELLEN O'TOOLE, FORMER SENIOR FBI PROFILER &amp; SPECIAL AGENT: Well, I think for me, as I follow this case, the thing that is really important, at least for me to understand, and I've seen it in so many other cases, is you never have a perfect offender. Never. No matter how well prepared they are, or how practiced they are, or how well they thought it out. If he was perfect, NYPD would not have all the evidence that they have, right now. And when he took down that mask, to have a conversation, with the woman at the hostel, that was indicative of him letting his guard down. And then, on top of it, again, we see him going into Starbucks, possibly touching a water -- water bottle and two candy bars, and possibly leaving forensic evidence. And then, of course, finding the bag that he wore on his back. So, these offenders can look like they are almost perfect, in how they carry out a crime, but they're really not. They do make mistakes.

They're trying to rule out that he fled via a plane. They saw him going into that bus terminal, earlier. As the Captain was raising earlier, that doesn't necessarily mean he got on one. We're still looking at that. From previous suspects you studied. How did they craft a getaway plane? Is it something that kind of happens as they're going? Or is it something that's typically premeditated? ELLEN O'TOOLE: It can be either, and it really depends on -- for me, it usually depends on how well the crime is put together in its totality. So, people that plan well might tend to have a better plan at the end. Those who don't plan at all don't have a good plan at the end. But I think here's what's important. There's so much media attention to this case that even though he may have planned out the perfect ending, he's also under a lot of pressure right now. The enormity, when you think about it, the enormity of having nearly the entire NYPD looking for you, is going to interfere and is going to compromise the best of plans, which means he's going to be have increased paranoia. It means that his ability to think critically, and decide step by step what to do next, that is going to be very much hampered. His decision-making is going to decrease, in terms of what -- what is the best thing for me to do next. And that also is going to be complicated by the fact that people who do know him, at least some of them, are going to say, Don't call me for help, because I don't want you to get me in trouble.
