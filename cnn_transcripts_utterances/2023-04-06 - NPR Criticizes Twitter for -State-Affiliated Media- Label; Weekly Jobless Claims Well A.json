Elon Musk's social media platform is now grouping NPR and with foreign propaganda outlets like the Russian government owned and run RT and Sputnik, and the Chinese Communist Party's People's Daily newspaper.The CEO of NPR is calling the decision unacceptable, adding quote, \"NPR and our member stations are supported by millions of listeners who depend on us for the independent fact-based journalism that we provide.\" NPR says, it receives less than 1 percent of its annual funding from federal sources the vast majority of it come from -- comes from sources like corporate sponsorships, NPR membership fees. Joining us now is CNN Media Analyst and Axios Media Reporter Sara Fischer. Sara, I know when NPR first saw this label, they thought it was just a mistake by Twitter. It's not.",

That's obviously not NPR.NPR does great journalism. They cover the White House, they cover the Hill, they cover everything. They do great work.

I found almost a dozen mainstream news outlets, including \"The Athletic\" which is owned by \"The New York Times\", days after Elon Musk removed their verified checkmark.And so I think media outlets are in this really difficult position where they, of course, feel frustrated by being singled out or their peers being singled out. But Twitter continues to be a huge platform for them to reach new audiences and to promote new products.

It's catered to Gen- Z. But we're watching it, Don, because so many national security concerns about the sister app TikTok.

So this is a look at how many Americans are filing for unemployment benefits for the first time. So this is a proxy for layoffs. Right. So what we see is that the number of initial claims was 228,000. And the level from the week prior -- that is for the week ending April 1st, I should say -- the level for the week prior was actually revised up by 48,000 from 198,000 to 246,000. I want to put this in context based on what we're seeing here. And you can see that we have been sort of hovering in the 200,000 level for quite some time. So this is a bit of a jump. But Goldman Sachs actually put out a research note yesterday saying, don't be surprised if we see a jump because of some seasonal factors, saying that this is really the end of a technical distortion. If we do see a jump, which we now have, rather than a sharp jump and the true pace of claims. Let me tell you why this is so important. In this environment where we've, honestly, all been waiting for the shoe to drop in terms of when are we going to start to see some weakness in the labor market. The weekly jobless claims is the first look, right, because all of the other data that we get from the government about the labor market, it's monthly. This is a weekly look at how many people are filing for unemployment benefits. And so this would be the first place that you would start to see some weakness. I want to show you also all of the companies. I mean, how often have we talked about all of the companies announcing layoffs, right? There have been a lot.",
