More on the Clinton-Obama-Biden trifecta tonight. Also, the Port of Baltimore still paralyzed, tonight, as a massive recovery effort, to dismantle the twisted wreckage, of the Key Bridge, is now underway. The largest crane, on the East Coast, is arriving there shortly, so are federal dollars that are now pouring in. Transportation Secretary, Pete Buttigieg, will join me. And the Republican official, who went public with a sinister discovery, photo evidence of busses at the airport, loaded with what he referred to as quote, \"Illegal invaders.\" Wait until you find out who was really on board. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. If it's December, in New York, at Radio City it is the world-famous Rockettes. If it's March, at Radio City, in the middle of an election year, its political rockstars, and some actual ones as well. Former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, joining President Biden, in a who's who of special guests, tonight, reportedly raising $25 million, for Biden's reelection campaign, against Donald Trump. That's a record, for the biggest political fundraising event ever. Perhaps, they came out to see royalty. Queen Latifah is among the many performers taking part. Lizzo, also on stage, to get 5,000 Biden supporters on their feet. But the main focus on those three presidents, have one mission, defeating Donald Trump. Sources tell CNN that Obama, in particular, views this as an all-hands-on-deck election, and plans to step up his own public support for Biden. And the dollar signs really do matter here. Biden is raising more money, in one night tonight, than Trump did in the entire month of February. While Trump has been running slightly ahead in the polls, he's far behind Biden, in the money race, which Trump himself has been privately worried about. Tonight also creates quite a contrast. Trump has never been in the so- called Presidents Club. The only living former Republican President, George W. Bush, has never supported him. But Trump doesn't even have the support of his own Vice President, or a string of former big name cabinet secretaries, like John Kelly and Jim Mattis. Tonight, Trump team is saying, essentially, to President Biden, anything that he can do, they can do better, claiming that they are going to outraise the President, to the tune of $33 million, in one night, next week, at Mar-a-Lago. As Trump would often say, we'll see what happens there. Joining me tonight, David Axelrod, the chief strategist for the Obama presidential campaigns, and a senior adviser to him, in the White House. And, David, I know, you've been critical of some of President Biden's campaign choices, the reelection efforts so far. But for a big event, like this, with this kind of energy, three presidents there in one room, what kind of impact do you think it has?",

That's a good night's take for you.I mean, the advantage that Joe Biden has, in cash, and his ability to raise money, has -- is a tremendous advantage. And as you know, and as you've reported, he's not having to hive off money for legal expenses, as Trump is, in dealing with his campaign. So, this gives him a chance to raise money for the seven -- six or seven battleground states, where they have to run full-out campaigns to run -- to develop the kinds of organizations they need there, to run the media that they need there, and to run all the other operations that are necessary, in order to be competitive. That's a big deal. And the show of unity and support, among the hierarchy of the -- of the Democratic Party, is a great contrast with Trump and the Republican Party. And it comes at a time when Democrats have been worried about the race. So, just as the State of the Union gave some of those folks, who were concerned, a shot in the arm, this will as well.",

But for Donald Trump, to go to this situation, this wake, where this police officer was tragically shot, by someone, who had been arrested so many times and let out of jail, it does drive home, the point that he, and the rest of the Republican Party, is constantly making. And that is with Joe Biden as President, with Democrats in charge, you just don't have people, who were serious about putting and keeping violent criminals in jail.

And this is the response, from Trump, as I should note, right now, we're also getting pictures, of this fundraiser. You can see the three presidents there, on stage, at Radio City Music Hall. (GRAPHIC IS SHOWN OF FIRST PICTURES FROM BIDEN, OBAMA, CLINTON FUNDRAISER) COLLINS: It's still just a remarkable moment for anyone, who cares about politics, to see three presidents on stage. But Ash, I wonder what you make of that comment comparing the two of these. ASHLEY ALLISON, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, FORMER WHITE HOUSE SENIOR POLICY ADVISER, NATIONAL COALITIONS DIRECTOR FOR BIDEN-HARRIS 2020: Well, look, I think that it's interesting to hear Republicans constantly say that Democrats are soft on crime, when the reality is since Joe Biden has been a president, the statistics show that crime is going down, across all major cities. So, whether or not President Trump goes to the funeral or not, the rhetoric that they are spewing after it just is not factual. I also would point out that much to some folks', in the progressive movements, chagrin, Joe Biden is one of the most pro-police presidents that we have had, in a very long time, contrast to how Donald Trump treated law enforcement, on January 6th. In regards to how Democrats and what this means for tonight, I think it is an interesting contrast. So, your point, Kaitlan, you started the show saying, Donald Trump doesn't have his vice president, most of his cabinet secretaries are not supporting him. These are the people that he chose to work with him, for four years. And yet, Joe Biden doesn't just have the person, who selected him to be his vice president, President Barack Obama. But he also has a former President, Bill Clinton, sitting on stage, talking about how important this election is, how people need to get engaged now, all hands on deck. And that's the contrast that I think will come out of tonight that the Democratic Party, yes, the coalition might not be as strong as it is now, as it was in 2020. But we have work to do. These three folks can do it together. And when the campaign really gets out, and hits the streets, some with this $25 million they're raising tonight, that the voters will understand why in the fall, they need to vote for Joe Biden.",

So, I think all Republican strategists have been anticipating thatDemocrats are going to have all the money, the money you can see and the money that you can't see or can't track. But I think Trump will have enough. And I have long wondered about this election, with Biden being so fully defined, and Trump being so fully defined, if there will be some diminishing returns, on massive amounts of money here. I think both will have plenty to do what they want to do and get out their message. But at some point, the voters know both of these people. They also know how they feel about the results of both presidencies.

But it can't reopen until the collapsed bridge and the ship stuck underneath it are removed from the water. And let's get straight to THE SOURCE, tonight, with Transportation Secretary, Pete Buttigieg, who met, today, with officials from ports, and labor groups to talk about these supply chain concerns. Secretary, thank you, for your time, tonight. Obviously, you know how vital this port is, to national supply chains, which has been a big concern for everyone. Do you have a better idea, tonight, of how soon that port could reopen? PETE BUTTIGIEG, TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY: It's too soon to say exactly how long it will be, to clear the channel. That's going to depend on assessments, by the Army Corps of Engineers and others, as they work to understand the extent of the debris that's in there. What I do know is that there are three heavy lift vessels, on their way in, the first of them should arrive tomorrow. What we were able to learn today, when I gathered about 100 players, from across supply chains, is what to expect until that port can be reopened, which of course, we're seeking to have happen as soon as possible. But we know it's not going to be overnight. And, in the meantime, there're going to be some real impacts. This is a significant container port, around a 10th in the U.S., depending how you count it. The good news is containers can be accommodated in a lot of other ports, up and down the Eastern Seaboard. It is specialized though, in vehicles, it's actually the biggest vehicle handling port, in the U.S., as well as certain other bulk products like sugar. So, there's a lot of coordination going on right now. That's part of what we're working to help support today, when we brought these players together. You got shippers, terminal operators, ports, cargo owners, even the rail and the trucking sector getting involved, because some of their plans have to change, all to figure out how to accommodate, reroute and plan for what's next.",

And those ports are already gearing up, to try to temporarily accommodate that extra traffic. For example, the port in New York and New Jersey, they indicated they have about 20 percent more capacity than they're using right now. So again, for those temporary changes, they should be pretty well- positioned to absorb that. We just need to make sure that whether it's vehicles or other bulk products, that there are plans for things that are -- that are a little more specialized. Now, the other thing we're really concerned about, right now, is, of course, the workers on those ports. These workers have been through so much, from COVID to more recent disruptions. They need the cargo to be moving, in order for them to have an income. There's a lot of work going on, right now, including with the State Department of Labor, under the leadership of Governor Wes Moore, my colleague, Julie Su, at the U.S. Department of Labor.

She's not party to this case. I should note that the gag order that the judge did put in place, earlier this week, doesn't apply to himself nor to his family. Tonight, I want to bring in senior U.S. District Judge, Reggie Walton, who was nominated for judgeships, by both Presidents Bush 41 and 43. And it's great to have you here, Judge, tonight. And I just want to say thank you, for joining us. And I think, to a lot of people, the dangers of attacking a judge and his family and their family is clear. I wonder how you would respond to something like this. JUDGE REGGIE WALTON, U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA: Well, it's very disconcerting, to have someone making comments, about a judge. And it's particularly problematic when those comments are in the form of a threat, especially if they're directed at one's family. I mean, we do these jobs, because we're committed to the rule of law, and we believe in the rule of law. And the rule of law can only function effectively, when we have judges, who are prepared to carry out their duties, without the threat of potential physical harm.",
