Now this does nothing to our investigation.

One thing that we're looking for next is to see when the judge, which judge is going to be getting this case and when the judge sets date for the arraignment.That will be when Hunter Biden will come to the courthouse to enter his guilty plea and allocute to the crimes he has committed. His attorney's statement said that \"I know Hunter believes it is important to take responsibility for these mistakes he made during a period of turmoil and addiction in his life. \"He looks forward to continuing his recovery and moving forward.\" That's part of what we'll hear from the Biden team if they have any more statements, that this is part of Hunter Biden's recovery. These crimes were committed when he was addicted to drugs, the gun charges specifically. He is avoiding having to plead guilty or be sentenced on the felony, the gun possession charge, because he is getting into this diversion program, which is going to require him to undergo certain conditions for a set period of time, which I am told by one source is 24 months. And if he does that, then the charge will go away. Certainly this reaction coming from the Republicans, including the former president Trump, who has been critical of this deal, because, as we have been reporting, the tax-related misdemeanor charges will result in a recommendation from the U.S. attorney's office here to a judge of probation with no jail time. This misdemeanor itself carries no more of a maximum of one year in prison anyway under the statute. But the U.S. attorney's office, as part of the plea deal, has agreed to recommend probation. It is ultimately up to the judge to decide if that is suitable and that is going to be coming further down the line in the process. But we're continuing to watch the docket for additional information and we will be sure to bring it back to you, John.",

And as you noted, this is a years-long investigation.But in recent months this whole issue has heated up once again, as CNN reported last summer that the prosecutors had narrowed down potential charges to a few possible tax charges and the prosecution of this gun charge. Then seven months passed with nothing. As we reported, Biden's lawyers asked for a meeting with the Justice Department officials. And they were granted that meeting with the Trump-appointed attorney and some career officials and they made their pitch, for why Hunger Biden should not be charged. And they said, look, he has paid these taxes back. And on the gun charge, a recent Supreme Court case would make it more difficult to prove a case beyond a reasonable doubt after the Supreme Court sort of expanded the Second Amendment rights. But over the last few weeks, calls back and forth, multiple exchanges and possible deals put on the table between Hunter Biden's team and the Justice Department, which resulted finally after years in this agreement. Now I will note that this is just the proposal that has been agreed upon by the defense attorneys and prosecutors. And it is up to the judge whether they want to approve this or make some modifications. But right now, we are just waiting to find out when Hunter Biden might have the first appearance for that arraignment in court. It is interesting that, over the past few weeks, it has really ramped up and finally, finally resulted in this plea deal.",

And in addition to that, the Solar (sic) Prince and also the R/V Deep Energy is conducting surface searches. They have searched an area about 10,000 square miles. It is a remote area of the Atlantic Ocean and a massive area. And we are told that there are between 54 to 80 hours of oxygen left. When we hear this briefing from the Coast Guard, we are hoping to get an update on that figure as well. It is a massive effort underway.

And we have heard from Jason there are P-3s, serve a similar mission, essentially anti- submersible aircraft. The challenge is this submersible is much smaller than an enemy submarine. The advantage is that this submersible wants to be found. One of the ways that the P-8 searches is by using sonobuoys, dropping them in the water at different locations. And because sounds can travel so easily underwater, they can pick up acoustic signatures or different sounds and then try to triangulate or figure out where the sound is coming from, to allow them to zero in.
