I'm Kasie Hunt in Washington, where the state of our union is thinking, I have seen this film before.The political world begins a new week, as we have so many times over the past seven years, under the pull of Donald Trump, the far-and-away front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, whose legal peril worsened this week. On Saturday in Pennsylvania, the former president took on Republicans who he felt didn't back him strongly enough, arguing that any GOP lawmaker who didn't prioritize investigating his Democratic rival, Joe Biden, should face a primary challenge. Hanging over the former president, the potential for more indictments this month over his efforts to try to overturn the 2020 presidential election and new charges in the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case accusing him of trying to have incriminating surveillance footage deleted. This weekend, Trump punched down at his competitors for the presidential nomination, even as most of them shy away from returning fire. But, on Saturday, he had nothing but praise for my next guest. He is running against Trump, and he is at third place in a new national poll. He received a warm welcome in Iowa this weekend. Joining me now is GOP presidential candidate the entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy. Sir, thanks very much for being on the program this morning.",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. TIM SCOTT (R-SC), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  What slavery was, was really about separating families, about mutilating humans, and even raping their wives.

I don't see it that way. I stand on the side of truth. Obviously, we should be teaching kids about the awful legacy of slavery, but, even more importantly, we're not teaching them enough about the ideals that actually do define this country. Personally, I think the deeper problem in our schools today is many of them teaching young black kids, students and minorities that they're oppressed based on the color of their skin or their genetic attributes. That's the real psychological slavery in the present, and that's what I have the biggest problem with. But I do think that some of these issues and spats can be distractions from what should Governor DeSantis or Tim Scott or myself or others actually be debating. How do we grow an economy? How do we actually lift all people up, revive self-confidence and pride in the next generation of Americans? That's what I think we need to be focused on.",

This was the withholding of confidential classified information from the government. After 18 months of asking Donald Trump to return it voluntarily, not only did he not return it. He lied about having it. This is not the kind of thing we could do. I want you to think, Kasie, for a second about the potential effect on our troops and our intelligence officers by having this stuff just laying around and him willy-nilly showing it to whoever he feels like to be a showoff on the back deck at Mar-a-Lago.

So there are no defenses in that regard here. Look, he's presumed innocent. But the bottom line is, the government has made a very, very compelling case. And remember something. Usually, the government only includes, at the most, about half of the evidence they have. And what's clear on the latest obstruction charges are, they have a cooperating witness. You know, witness -- Trump Employee Number 4 looks like a very, very important cooperating witness.

This guy is the Jimmy Carter of the 2020s. And his inflation that he created -- and don't take my word for it. Democratic economist, former Treasury Secretary to Bill Clinton Larry Summers has said that Joe Biden created this inflation through his ridiculous spending. I dealt with this in New Jersey, Kasie, after coming after Jon Corzine. We had an $11 billion deficit on a $29 billion budget. We balanced the budget by cutting 836 individual programs and did not raise taxes. This stuff can be done, but you need someone who knows how to execute and knows how to do it. What the Republican Party voters and all American voters deserve are two things, the truth. The truth is not negotiable. And I'm not going to say something different on your program than I will anywhere else in this country.
