The United Nations is warning Israel's overnight raids in the West Bank, which left ten people dead, risks seriously deepening the already catastrophic situation. In what it calls its most expansive offensive in the West Bank in years, Israel's foreign minister said the operation was to thwart Islamic-Iranian terrorist infrastructure. Hamas has issued a call for a general mobilization and escalation of all forms of resistance and confrontation. Video obtained by CNN shows Israeli bulldozers tearing up the streets. The Palestinian ministry of health reported Israeli forces obstructed ambulances and blocked roads to hospitals. Since October, clashes in the West Bank become more frequent, including recent incidents of settler violence. Two weeks ago, more than 70 armed settlers invaded the town in the north, firing live ammunition and tear gas at residents and set fire to several homes, cars as well. The IDF today called it a serious terror incident and said they failed by not arriving earlier. CNN's Jeremy Diamond joins me now. Tell us what is the state tonight, Jeremy, of the IDF operation in the West Bank. Is it ongoing?",

      "sentences": "Well, Jim, it certainly does appear to be and its not clear how much longer it will go on for, but earlier today, the Israeli military said that this operation was only in its first phase, suggesting that we could be looking at a multi-day operation in what has already appeared to be one of the largest Israeli military incursions into the West Bank in years. We have seen since October 7, the Israeli military nearly every day conducting raids in the West Bank on a Palestinian in militants.But this is taking on a different scale and that's because were seeing Israeli troops, Israeli border police officers, many times lead in front by those Israeli D9 bulldozers, which are tearing up the streets, trying to prevent IEDs from harming their troops, going into the key cities of Jenin, as well as Tulkarem and the surrounding area. So far, ten Palestinians have already been killed. It's not clear exactly how many of those are civilians versus combatants because the Palestinian ministry of health doesn't distinguish between the two. And we know that this is just the latest cycle of violence that we have seen in the West Bank, more than 600 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since October 7. And the Israeli military says that they have gone in this time to these two cities because they say one Iran is flooding the West Bank with weapons, that's an assessment that's also been shared by the United States, and they also say that militants from these two cities have been carrying out attacks against Israeli troops, as well as civilians. So we don't know how much longer this operation is going to last and what the final death toll will ultimately be. But it does appear to be relatively significant operation and one that we should note comes not long after that was there was that failed suicide bombing in Tel Aviv, which could have of course been much worse. That has been raised in the context of this operation as well -- Jim.",

And by the way, we're standing up here on this roof, if the West Bank is right there and we won't be in rocket range, we'll be in rocket -- we'll be in rifle range if they take over that area.

MICHELLE BARUCHMAN, POLITICS REPORTER, THE ATLANTA JOURNAL- CONSTITUTION:  I think since Harris took over as the top of the ticket, there are certainly enthusiasm among top Democratic leaders that it is back in play.

The dispute is seemingly over political photography at a military burials site. Trump was there marking the anniversary of 13 U.S. service members killed at Kabul airports Abbey Gate during the Afghanistan withdrawal.CNN's Alayna Treene has more details for us.

      "sentences": "We can. Well, first of all, yes. NPR had reported that the Trump campaign has pushed back heavily on that, saying that that is not true. We've also, of course, reached out and that have received a statement from Arlington National Cemetery. They did not go into the type of nature of the incident that is the term that both sides have used, but they had both said that there was an incident that had occurred.That is one of the things they can agree on. But from there, that's where it gets a little bit dicey and it becomes a he said/she said type of situation. I'm going to break down for you what we know. So Donald Trump, on Monday, had participated in the third anniversary marking, you know, the troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, as well as the attack on service members at Abbey Gate at Kabul Airport. And so that was what he was there for. Now, the wreath laying ceremony, I'm told hold was not necessarily where the incident happened or what is in question around this controversy. Instead, it was when Donald Trump later visited the burial site of some of these recent fallen soldiers and had laid flowers down there, and that was caught on film. You actually saw Chris LaCivita, one of Donald Trumps co-campaign managers, share some of that video. That is where I'm told from my conversations with the Trump campaign and also from what we have heard from the cemetery staff. That is apparently where the incident had happened and someone had tried to block members of Donald Trump's team for moving forward with their plans. We have heard from both sides. I'm going to read from you first what we have heard from Chris LaCivita and then I'll share what the Arlington Cemetery has said. Chris LaCivita had written, quote, President Trump was there on the invitation of the Abbey Gate Gold Star families to honor their loved ones who gave the ultimate sacrifice for their country, for despicable individual to physically prevent President Trump's team from accompanying him to this solace -- solemn event is a disgrace and does not deserve to represent the hallowed grounds of Arlington National Cemetery. So really strong words there I will say from Chris LaCivita, heavily pushing back on what had happened. This is what we have heard from Arlington National Cemetery. They share this in a statement. We have obtained it. They wrote, quote, federal law prohibits political campaign or election-related activities within Army National Military Cemeteries, to include photographers, content creators, or any other persons attending for purposes or in direct support of a partisan political candidate's campaign. So, again, we're hearing different things. I think a lot is still unclear. We do know that this staffer who had approached the Trump campaign on Monday has filed what were -- what were -- they're calling an incident report. We're still waiting to learn more information about this. But what is clear is that the Arlington National Cemetery is backing up their staffer. They're saying that photography is not allowed particularly at that site. It's known as Section 60 at that burial site. The Trump campaign saying, you know, we -- they're arguing that they didn't know this or that they believed that they had permission and that it was wrong or inappropriate for staffer to try and interrupt them and block some of Donald Trump's staff from being with him for that moment. So we don't have a lot of answers right now. I do think this is something we're going to learn more about.",

This was a different type of event where Donald Trump went to lay those flowers and I think that is really what is in question here. So, look, I recognize -- I think we're going to learn more when this report comes out.

And they have other capabilities such as Storm Shadows, SCALP capabilities provided by other countries that have to knit together and work together on the battlefield.

But we're learning that Iranian hackers also used eerily similar tactics to target a former Trump administration official back two years ago.Now this is -- I want to take you inside this operation because these are details that have not been disclosed publicly before, but this operation in 2020 targeting a former Trump official that was close to former national security adviser, John Bolton, and Jim, as you know, John Bolton is not Iran's favorite former U.S. official. He's actually on that list of assassination targets because of his role in the killing of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani. But Iranian hackers penetrating and a personal email account of one of John Bolton's former confidence back two years ago, then impersonating that former official in an attempt to further -- cast a further net and hack other accounts of hard line D.C.-based think tankers. And this all speaks to a broader intelligence, collecting operation using cyber tools that the intelligence community is now warning. Iran is trying to use to influence the 2024 presidential election. And we're learning too that back in just this April, a former Biden administration official who specializes in Middle East issues and has particular insight on issues related to Israel, was also successfully targeted by Iran -- this Iranian hacking group as well with a similar spear phishing email. And I want to go back and read just one of the emails that this hacking group sent out from the former Trump official. It said, I am -- they were posing as them trying to get feedback on manuscripts as I am close to finishing the manuscript and have begun asking experts like yourselves to review the chapters. The email did contain a link that purported to take someone to those chapters. It actually had malware in it that would have given the hackers access to further email accounts.",

How sophisticated were these -- were these hacks? KRISHNAMOORTHI:  They're pretty sophisticated. They would basically implant kind of malware in Internet service providers that would initiate a DNC attack, a domain names save service attack which basically means it would redirect people away from the website that they otherwise thought they were going to other fake websites, which would then capture personal identifiable information, passwords, and other really important information so that they could then access other networks that these people are on.
