At least two people were killed and 68 injured when a car drove through the crowd. This video appears to show police arresting the suspected driver on the scene. Officials say he's a 50-year-old man from Saudi Arabia, who is a permanent resident of Germany. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REINER HASELOFF, PRIME MINISTER, SAXONY-ANHALT (through translator): The state of Saxony-Anhalt as a whole is in mourning. And that is why, in consultation with the federal government, which will do the same, we will fly the flags at half staff to express that a tragedy has taken place here and that we all share in the suffering that has been inflicted on people.

I'm going to get out of your way and you can see behind me is the actual Christmas market.And one of the things that's really interesting about all this is that there are actually barriers here to try and prevent something like this, exactly like this, from happening. We can see those green and red barriers that were put up here. And they're all around the perimeter of this Christmas market. So it's unclear where there might have been a gap in all this for the suspect and the car to get through and then plow through that market, because it must have driven in there for hundreds of yards, through that market, injuring obviously a lot of people. Very difficult for the people to get out of the way because the stalls there are pretty tight and the space is very small between them. So a jam packed area, lots of people. Of course, all this happened at 7:00 p.m. on a Friday night, the last Friday before Christmas. And that's also one of the reasons the authorities believe why there's so many casualties, because obviously this place would have been highly frequented at that time. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Of course, here, across the region, Christmas markets and big gatherings, certainly here in Rome, with the Vatican Christmas affairs, things going on. There are going to be big crowds.

We don't know yet what went wrong here. We also have to realize that, even though we're looking at this already as a security failure of sorts. We don't know yet the extent to which this threat is also elsewhere, meaning we've had incidents at Christmas markets involving people with knives, with swords and with firearms.

And that's a realization of what authorities have been warning us about, which is a threat both from the extreme right to a lesser extent and from the extremist ideologies coming forth from some areas around IS, Al Qaeda and sort of the well-known, well-trodden path of terrorism.

That is the impact crater that has now been filled in from that missile fired by the Houthis. You can see right behind it the damage that has been done to the buildings all around this area, where windows were blown out by the force of that blast. If you wrap around here with me, you can see some of that damage a little bit closer up as well. All of these windows that have been broken out, these letter boxes as well. And this is kind of the scene all around this area and the area surrounding this park where this missile hit. You can see the windows have been blown out and cleanup efforts are underway. You may be hearing the sound of glass being swept up right now. And these efforts to kind of restore the situation are already underway; 16 people suffered minor injuries as a result of glass shattering and hitting them. Another 14 people were -- suffered minor injuries rushing toward shelter. But really, people did not have much warning. Those sirens rang out. And then, very shortly after, residents tell us that that missile then struck. A lot of people didn't have time to get to their shelters. And that, of course, reflects some of those minor injuries that were suffered as a result of the glass. And we should note that it is quite rare for these Houthi missiles to actually make impact. They are usually intercepted. But in video that we've seen from overnight, when this happened, you can see at least two interceptor missiles going up into the air and missing their target, missing that Houthi missile that was coming in. And instead, it struck right here behind us. The Israeli military, just a few days ago, struck Houthi targets in Yemen in retaliation for a number of other missile and drone attacks that the Houthis have fired at Israel, both here in Tel Aviv as well as Israel's southern city of Eilat. I think you can likely expect that there will be a response from the Israeli military to this attack as well, as well as investigations internally inside the Israeli military about why they failed to intercept that missile.

The government is avoiding a shutdown of many of its operations after the Senate and House passed a stopgap funding bill. President Biden is expected to sign the bill later today. The so-called Plan C extends government funding into March and includes disaster relief and farming provisions. But it doesn't include a debt limit suspension, a key Donald Trump demand. That piece was stripped after a bipartisan revolt on Thursday. The president-elect and his tech billionaire adviser Elon Musk torpedoed the initial bipartisan deal, creating more trouble for the Republican House Speaker. And now, apparently, frustrated yet resigned, Trump lamented to one lawmaker he was disappointed the deal couldn't include a debt ceiling hike. But the Speaker did say he kept in touch with the president-elect on Friday as he worked to regain Democrat support. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA), HOUSE SPEAKER:  I was in constant contact with president Trump throughout this process. He knew exactly what we were doing and why. And this is a good outcome for the country. I think he certainly is happy about this outcome as well. Elon Musk and I talked within about an hour ago and we talked about the extraordinary challenges of this job. And I said, hey, you want to be Speaker of the House? I don't know. He said, this may be the hardest job in the world. I think it is. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), MAJORITY LEADER:  This was a compromise. We got some major things we wanted in the bill, particularly the disaster relief, which was bigger. President asked for 117. We got 100. We got -- we kept the government open and we didn't get the debt ceiling. So there were three major victories. We didn't get everything we wanted. But I think if you look at the vote in the House, people felt pretty good. It was virtually unanimous. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Earlier, there was a bipartisan deal that had been, you know, months and months in the works and negotiations and going on. But Elon Musk, with his the power that he has with Twitter or X and over 207 million followers that he's able to reach, he was putting out all kinds of information, some of it false, about this bill and urging lawmakers not to pass it, claiming that some of the bill included aid to Ukraine, which wasn't true. And Trump was also trying to get his, you know, Republicans in the House not to support the bill. And so that bill didn't pass. But then the Trump-backed bill also didn't pass because 38 lawmakers in the House refused to support it. And these were actually more conservative lawmakers that didn't like the idea that the debt ceiling was going to be raised. So now, where we are, they come up with a solution.

And we can say definitively that House Republicans, once again, have the majority, barely. And what do I mean by barely? I mean, to a historic degree, barely because when you pull up what the actual numbers are, 220 Republicans, 215 Democrats. That is a five-seat majority in the balance of power. And that means House Republican leaders can only afford to lose two of their members in a party line vote and still win that vote. And yet, that's actually a lot easier than how it's going to be. What do I mean by that? Well, House Republicans can thank the guy that many of them credit for helping them win the House majority, for making it even harder because Donald Trump is taking House Republicans to be in his administration. He started with Matt Gaetz, picked him to be his attorney general. That nomination or effort failed catastrophically, as was expected. But Gaetz, Gaetz resigned. That's minus one Republican. What about Elise Stefanik, close ally, New York Republican, Donald Trump's pick to be U.N. ambassador? She's expected to be confirmed by the Senate. That's minus two Republicans. And Michael Waltz, National Security Advisor for Trump, he doesn't have to be confirmed at all. He will start on day one with the administration. That means three House Republicans won't be there for a period of months likely, which means, if you do the math, take 220 minus 3 and this is where you end up, 217-215. If you thought losing two votes was the maximum and that would be complicated, try losing barely one. That would be borderline suffocation for any Republican leader at a historically difficult moment for House Republican leaders. What do I mean by that? Put this away for a minute because I want to pull up some context here. If you take a look at majorities at every scale over the course of the last five decades, like right here, you'll see after decades of Democratic dominance. Post Watergate, you got 149 seat majority at one point, back in 1977. You can track that down -- 100s, 100s, 80s, 70s, back to 182. That flipped when the chamber flipped, of course, when House Republicans took over in 1994. They didn't have a huge majority but 26 seats, not bad; 19-12. Narrow at nine, but then starting to pop back up. And we saw that toggle back and forth as both sides took majorities over a period of years until the most recent period, where a new trend started, right about there: 10 Democratic seat majority, then nine Republican seat majority, then five Republican seat majority. So let's take this away and go back to where we are right now because, again, was 220-215; at some point during this process, it's going to be 217-215. And that makes it really, really hard on one person in particular, this guy, Speaker Mike Johnson. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
