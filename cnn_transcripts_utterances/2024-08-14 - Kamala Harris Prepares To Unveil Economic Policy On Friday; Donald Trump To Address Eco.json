Trump is set to speak at a rally in the critical state of North Carolina, just as the new inflation report comes out showing significant cooling and inflation despite that good news for Americans, Trump's campaign has blasted Kamalanomics. Vice President Kamala Harris plans to hit back with a campaign event in the same state Friday laying out her economic policy with details on how she plans to fight inflation.CNN's Kristen Holmes is live at the Trump rally in Ashville, North Carolina. And Kristen, delivering an effective speech on the economy is seen as critical for Trump to stay on message and explain it to voters. The question is, will he and can he do that? KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, that's right, Jessica, and talk to anyone around him. They believe Donald Trump can win this election in November if he focuses on three things, one of them being the economy, the other one being immigration, and the third being crime. These were all things that when you saw the polling against President Joe Biden, he was leading in his handling of those things, and now they believe that he would lead Kamala Harris on the same issues. But Donald Trump, as we have seen time and time again, has had a very hard time staying on message. Particularly since Kamala Harris entered the race, we have seen him latch onto these conspiracy fringe theories from the internet, particularly talking about her crowd size, saying that photos of the crowd were A.I. generated, something that today when Kate Sullivan CNN zone caught up with him before he came to North Carolina, he reiterated that he didn't know how many people were at that rally. Now, obviously it has been disproven time and time again that those photos were altered and there was no crowd there. We know that there was a significant crowd, but it's obviously something that's gotten under his skin, and his allies would rather see him focused on things like the economy. So, what we're told right now, we're in a venue that is not your traditional rally venue. It is seated. This is being billed as a speech, not a rally, and that he is going to focus on the economy. He also said he'd focus on crime. Again, two of the issues, as I just mentioned, that his allies are really trying to double down are the most important. And this is the beginning in a series of these kind of events that are going to focus on policy specifically. But as you mentioned, it is just unclear what's going to happen when Donald Trump takes the stage. They can write whatever speech they want for him. He obviously will say what it is that he wants to say. And even when we go to these rallies often, we get his remarks ahead of time, and they are very different from what we hear from him on the stage. But he right now is at a point where we are starting to see those polls getting better for Kamala Harris. We are seeing the enthusiasm around Kamala Harris getting better, and those around him believe something has to change. We'll see if it starts today.",

But on the campaign trail, you hear them talk about going after corporate, landlords, raising the federal minimum wage, which Democrats do pledge to do cycle after cycle, but it evades them when they actually get into office. But they'll also be on a bus tour on Sunday in the critical battleground state of Pennsylvania, beginning the bus tour in Pittsburgh, and then they have $90 million coming in the weeks ahead in an ad buy to really help them boost this argument. They're going to be up on the airwaves in these critical battleground states and in small communities where people might not necessarily be used to seeing these ads, including Erie and Marquette, Wisconsin, so Nevada, Arizona, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Georgia. The next couple of weeks, the airwaves will just be blanketed with these ads where you're really going to hear a lot about the personal biography of the vice president as they try to make their case. We've heard the former president say that he's really going to kick into high gear in the fall. And what we're hearing from the Harris campaign is that they don't have any time to waste.",

SANCHEZ: Let's dig deeper now with CNN senior data reporter Harry Enten and CNN senior political analyst and senior editor for The Atlantic Ron Brownstein. Thank you both for being with us.

      "sentences": "Yes, all right, Boris, let's take a look at this. You know that this election so tight right now. So so tight.So, I want to look at undecided voters in those key battleground states, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. What is their top issue when it comes to their vote for president? Look what's number one right here, the economy and inflation at 21 percent, you can see on your board here. There's no other issue that's anywhere close. Abortion is number two, and that comes in at just seven percent. So, economy and inflation three times as important as the second most important issue, abortion. So economy, inflation, number one. Now, you also asked me about how they view Kamala Harris on the issue, and how does she -- how is she viewed in comparison to Donald Trump? I think that this kind of gets at what is so frustrating to the Donald Trump campaign, they trust more on the economy in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, among likely voters. Look, Donald Trump still has an advantage over Kamala Harris, but that advantage right now is six points. You go back to May when Joe Biden was going to be the Democratic nominee, you see right here, Trump had a 14 point lead on this particular very important issue in the vines of the voters. So, what essentially has happened is Kamala Harris has gone into Donald Trump's core issue into his house and has taken supporters away from him on the basis of the economy. And it's going to be very interesting to see over the days and weeks and months to come. Can Kamala Harris slice this advantage that Trump has even more, or will Trump be able to -- be able to reinvigorate his advantage on this particular issue? If you can answer me that question, I can probably tell you who's going to win this campaign come November.",

      "sentences": "Yes, and Boris, this is what I think is really significant about the trend of Harris narrowing the gap with Trump on the economy in multiple polls, the most dramatic of which was the Financial Times University of Michigan poll that actually showed basically a dead heat, slightly more voters trusting her than Trump on the economy.What I think is especially ominous for the Trump campaign in those findings is that assessments of the economy itself have not really improved. You know, some Republicans say, well, it's vibes, or, you know, media coverage that is causing people to have more faith in Harris. It's not that the -- it's not that people are more confident about where the economy is now, in fact, in that FT poll, half of voters said they were worse off under the Biden administration. So, what could explain her gains? What explains her gains I think it is a broader confidence in her to provide more energetic and less divisive leadership. It's kind of -- it's kind of a faith in her to solve the problem, rather than Biden going forward to solve the problem. And I think that applies to a lot of issues. I mean, we've seen in a number of polls, including some today out from Monmouth and others, that she has gained substantially relative to Biden when compared to Trump on all sorts of personal attributes, and I think that is the key to her improvement on the economy, and it makes it more difficult, I think, to just push back by arguing that, for example, she hasn't put out enough specifics.",

You can see that in the favorable ratings. Look at this. He was at 33 percent in 2016 a campaign and he went on a win. In 2020 he was at 41 percent and now he's at 44 percent. And this, I think, is going to be the key question for both the Harris campaign and the Trump campaign. For the Trump campaign, the question is, wait a minute, our guy is more popular, basically, than he's ever been, and yet he seems to be falling behind in the polls. How do we change that? Is it possible to change that? And then the question for the Harris campaign is, wait a minute, maybe we shouldn't take things for granted, because Trump has won when he has been so unpopular in the past, and now he's more popular than he's basically ever been. Maybe this guy really is going to be tough to put away, and I think that is going to be the very interesting question going down, the sort of finale of this campaign is, can Harris not being Trump enough, or is she going to have to maintain her high favorable ratings that she's been seeing? And again, I don't know the answer to that question, because this campaign has been absolute lunacy over the last month to two months, Boris.",

I don't think it would fundamentally change the dynamic here.I mean, we had -- during Trump's presidency, most Americans were satisfied with the economy, and yet a majority did not approve of his performance in office, and that was before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. I think the core question in this election remains, do you -- with Biden out, the core question reverts to, do you or don't you want to live in the America that Trump is sketching out? I don't know if Harris has to be more acceptable than Trump on all of these issues, she has to cross a threshold of acceptability for voters who are resistant to live in the kind of society that Trump is offering with mass deportation and, you know, mass firings in the civil service and all the other polarizing elements of his agenda. Don't forget, in 2022 Democrats did better than we have seen in modern times. As I'm sure Harry would agree, among voters who are dissatisfied with the economy and dissatisfied with the president's performance, precisely because they were so resistant to moving in a Trumpian direction. There's a big audience for the you know, the America that Trump has on offer. I think the evidence of the last three elections is a slightly bigger audience against it. And the question for Harris is, can she bring that coalition back together, which it clearly splintered under Biden over concerns both about his age and inflation.",
