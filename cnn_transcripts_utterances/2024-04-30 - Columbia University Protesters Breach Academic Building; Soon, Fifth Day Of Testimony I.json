      "sentences": "Wolf, over 12 hours now since a group of individuals actually occupied the building that you see behind me. And we are now beginning to get a better idea of who likely may still be in that building.That's according to what we just heard from a member of Columbia University, Apartheid Divest speaking to my colleague, Jeff Winter, who confirms that, among some of the occupants still of that building, are members of that organization, commonly known as Quad. Now if this sounds familiar, Wolf, if you remember, is that this is the organization that had a couple of their representatives that were actively engaged in days-long negotiations with members of Columbia University. Negotiations that basically stalled, that led to yesterday's deadline, and eventually led to escalating tensions. And of course, those dramatic pictures of Hamilton Hall, an historic building that has served as a stage for previous protests, being occupied by these students. Now Macklin Kalio (ph), in his conversation with CNN, adding that he has been informed that he has also been suspended. He said that he had already previously left the university campus when this took place. And he, at this point, according to Kalio (ph), that it is up to the university to determine exactly what will happen next. And calling on the university to, once again, resume negotiations. So this is the first time that we are essentially hearing from one of the people who were at the negotiating table with Columbia diversity trying to resolve the issue of divestment. This is now one of those negotiators calling for those negotiations to pick back up again. Now, in terms of what we have heard from Columbia, just in the last few minutes, they have reached -- they have issued a statement right now threatening anybody who is currently occupying, especially their students so obviously, occupying the building that you see behind me, threatening them with expulsion. So you certainly do get a sense the university also taking a different position here as they continue to restrict access on campus. All morning long, we have seen numbers of the university community walk up to that gate with a majority of them being denied access. Only those essential personnel and students who live on campus are being allowed on it this morning.",

But I will say Keith Davidson, obviously, a crucial witness, came to the stand, Stormy Daniel's attorney. And at the very end, some really crucial points. They're showing all these text messages back-and-forth between Stormy Daniel's attorney and AMI Dylan Howard, the editor-in-chief. And the point-blank question asked by Mr. Steinglass, if you were to close this deal, basically paying Karen McDougal for her story from Ami, did you have an understanding that this would help Candidate Trump, question mark. Keith Davidson, one word answer, yes. And that's what they're trying to establish again and again.

He's texting someone, sort of joking about that, if Karen McDougal does this deal at AMI, her story is suppressed and not told, that he would be interested in an ambassadorship.

It wouldn't be a graduated step beyond the fine. Because he has to first, in most cases, give notice to the defendant of what you're -- you heard from a judge talking earlier about this continuum or the force continuum, meaning I'm going to begin here, and as you begin to violate my now order, I'm going to accelerate and heightened what your exposure is. These are already in the past, already having been stayed, which gives pause to understand why the judge would have taken even this long to decide, which clearly had not been an issue in contention. Except for the one post. That was about what the judge is saying, you're able to respond to political attacks. All of them are not. But if it's a political attack, you're able to respond.
