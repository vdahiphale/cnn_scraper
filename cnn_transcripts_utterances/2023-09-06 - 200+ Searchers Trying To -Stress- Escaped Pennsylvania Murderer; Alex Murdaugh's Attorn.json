He added that the goal right now is to, quote, \"stress\" him out of hiding.Now, two school districts are still closed today and about 200 law enforcement officers are assisting in the search. The manhunt -- remember, it's entering its seventh day. CNN's Danny Freeman is outside the prison where the convicted killer made his escape. Danny, you have been covering this throughout the course of the last week. Some developments yesterday. What's your sense of where things stand this morning?",

      "sentences": "Well, Phil, frankly, we're still trying to read some of the tea leaves in this early hour of the morning to see where police are devoting most of their attention as this manhunt continues into its seventh day. We have reason to believe this manhunt may be expanding but I'll get to that in a moment.I just want to go back for a second and explain to viewers how we got to this point. Remember, yesterday, police told us that after they had already established, really, a two-mile radius just south of the prison, it turns out that Cavalcante was able to slip that perimeter. And he was caught on trail cameras in Longwood Gardens. It's a popular, sprawling, large tourist attraction -- botanical gardens -- a little further south of not just the prison but also that two-mile radius. And the picture was very eerie, Phil. We saw it yesterday. He was pictured shirtless. He had a duffel bag. He had a backpack. Police believe that means that he's been really scavenging and trying to perhaps burglarize homes or gather supplies from, say, cars in order to extend him being on the run. But then the perimeter extended south. Well, I want to describe what we've been seeing this morning, Phil. At this same time yesterday, we drove around Longwood Gardens -- that area -- and I'll tell you, there was a Pennsylvania State Police trooper on basically every corner. Their lights were on. There were troopers standing outside with long guns. Today we drove around that same area and there weren't almost any troopers in that specific area. Instead, we've seen troopers move east towards Chadds Ford searching the area along Baltimore Pike, Route 1, and Brandywine Creek. We still haven't had an official confirmation that manhunt has expanded but that's what we're seeing this morning. And, of course, Phil, all of this is extremely stressful for neighbors as we enter day seven. Take a listen to what one had to say just yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JO-ANN SHILEY, KENNETT TOWNSHIP, PENNSYLVANIA:  Everyone in this area just hasn't slept. I can't even imagine the people in (INAUDIBLE) and what they went through now that he's gotten out. Now it's just -- now we get a little bit more sense of how they were feeling for the last three days. It's just tiring, it's exhausting, and just -- your nerves are on edge and you just second guess everything. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And as you said, at the center of it all is this court clerk, Becky Hill. And here are some of the allegations that the defense if alleging.They say that she instructed jurors not to be fooled by Murdaugh's testimony. Also, that she allegedly had frequent conversations -- private conversations with the jury foreperson in the bathroom in the jury room. That she asked jurors their opinions about their guilt -- the guilt or innocence of Alex Murdaugh. And also, that she came up with this fake Facebook post in order to get a juror removed who she believed was going to vote not guilty. And sure enough, that juror was removed on the last day of the trial. The defense is also alleging that she pressured the jurors to come up with a quick verdict, telling them they were going to have to stay in a hotel and they wouldn't be able to take smoking breaks. Six of those jurors were smokers. Now, the defense did hold a brief press conference yesterday and here is how they explained Alex Murdaugh's reaction to these allegations. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "We're continuing to follow the breaking news this morning. You see Sec. Antony Blinken just moments ago taking a seat at his surprise visit to Kyiv. He's set to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and also meeting with top Ukrainian officials. And it comes at a critical moment in the war during Ukraine's grinding counteroffensive.Joining us now is Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut. He serves and is a critical voice for Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Senator, I appreciate your time. The timing here of the visit -- Blinken has gone, I think, two or three times up to this point. But it seems notable given the fact that there is an administration request to Congress for more funding. The counteroffensive is grinding on. Do you think that's the intent here -- to send a message both publicly, at home, and internationally? SEN. CHRIS MURPHY (D-CT):  Well, listen, I think it's really important for Sec. Blinken to be directly engaged with his colleagues in Ukraine, so these visits are often intelligence-gathering efforts. But no doubt, this is part of the administration's attempt to convince Republicans not to abandon Ukraine at a moment where I would argue this offensive is no longer grinding on but actually breaking through. Reports in the last four days suggest that for the, really, first time since the offensive began the Ukrainians are making some significant progress. And this would be the worst possible time for Congress to get involved in a debate as to whether or not we are going to stick with the Ukrainian people. Ukraine has a lot of needs. First and foremost, they need continued military aid. We have this global artillery shortage and we've got to be creative to get them more help. But I think Sec. Blinken is going to be announcing today, in part, economic and humanitarian assistance because we still need to help the Ukrainian people survive and the government stay afloat. Our aid needs to be nimble in order to help them win this war. So, no doubt, part of this trip is going to be an attempt to explain why this aid is so important and why we can't really leave any doubt in the Ukrainians' mind or the Russians' mind as to whether we're committed here.",

Pulling the plug on Ukraine and allowing Putin to get away with this is Afghanistan on steroids.\"I think he's talking to Republicans -- and Republicans in the House, specifically -- and the American public, who a majority of them no longer favor more aid to Ukraine.

Why not try it?Clearly, every red line that I think this administration was concerned about related to Russia and what it may trigger, they have crossed over time and have not suffered consequences that they were concerned about.

And, of course, we're transferring weapons systems to them on a schedule that allows them to use those weapons systems.Many of these systems are really complicated and it would, frankly, just be irresponsible for us to hand those systems to the Ukrainians without proper training or security procedures, right? We want to make sure that they know how to use these weapons systems and that they don't fall into the wrong hands. And so, we've got to do this on the right schedule. I think the Biden administration has taken some real risks in transferring to the Ukrainians some really serious systems -- systems that potentially can be used in offensive operations inside Russia. Systems that potentially risk escalating the war. But Biden wants Ukraine to win and I think that that's been his North Star from the beginning.",

I think he's been bad for this country.But at the same time, what I see is someone who has had a couple of isolated incidences. What I've seen is someone who generally is pretty in control of his caucus. Obviously, I worked very closely with him just a year ago on passing the first major anti-gun violence measure through the Senate -- a measure that he ended up supporting. And so, while it's in the end up to the Republicans as to whether they want Mitch McConnell leading them or someone else. This does seem to be likely a result of the concussion and with the exception of those kind of embarrassing moments that he has endured, he seems very much the old Mitch McConnell that a lot of us are used to and used to battling.

How soulless existence feels for a lot of Americans.And I just think that there is a real potential for progressives who actually have the answers for people who are crushed by low-wage work to reach out to folks like that and invite them to be part of our coalition. I saw a lot of my friends on the left just simply ridicule that song. And listen, there's a lot to ridicule in that song. But we'd be better off inviting people who respond to that song, especially the parts of that song that complain about how difficult it is to be a working person in America today, and explain to them it's the Democratic Party that is going to control the excesses of corporations. It's the progressive movement that has been fighting for higher minimum wages.
