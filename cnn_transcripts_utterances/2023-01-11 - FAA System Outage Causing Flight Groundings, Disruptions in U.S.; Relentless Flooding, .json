We'll get back to that.But we are going to begin with this breaking news that's happening right now, the FAA experiencing a system outage. You're looking at live pictures. This is at Atlanta, this is at Hartsfield International Airport there. You see the two planes. Many flights across the country grounded right now. I want to take you to the scene now, this is in Las Vegas. And now, keep in mind, okay, this is a system that pilots use for any kind of notification. Not clear how many flights are affected or which locations. We want to get straight now to CNN's Pete Muntean but we're also being told the new information, Pete, as we get to you, perhaps you have information on this, but United has delayed all flights temporarily as well. What is going on here?",

      "sentences": "So far, Don, we've heard from two airlines here, American Airlines and United Airlines. United Airlines says it is holding all flights on the ground right now because of this major system outage. It is called the NOTAM system, the notice to air missions system. That means that pilots cannot receive the critical information that they need to take off. These are things that had to do with whether or not runways are open, whether or not certain navigational aids are available to pilots. This is really critical stuff essentially absolving the FAA of some responsibility, making sure the pilots know that these things are not available or things may not be working.So, we are hearing that the cancelations and delays are going up. So far, the delays have doubled in the last hour. It was 400 earlier today, now, just check FlightAware, we've seen more than 1,100 delays nationwide today. This comes after a really tough winter for air travel. We saw the Southwest cancelations of the late last month over the holidays. We saw briefly an issue with their computer system. The air transportation system can be so fragile at times. It relies on some of these critical systems. And the FAA tells us in a statement it is doing final validation checks right now to make sure that the system will get back online sometime soon. We have a statement from them. They say they're repopulating the system right now but this is affecting operations across the national airspace system. That has a huge impact on air travel. We don't know the full scope of this just yet. This could have a trickledown effect throughout the day. We will see how quickly the FAA gets to fixing the system. They have known about this issue at least since late last night. And so they have put on a few notices behind the scenes that we've been able to access, in which the FAA says they've known about this since about maybe as early as 3:00 P.M. yesterday. And so they've been fixing it overnight. We will see if this affects flights throughout the day, but it's not just the morning. We could have a resolution here sometime soon, although the FAA not officially saying that just yet.",

The fact there has been such a meltdown here of the system. So many things can be a lynchpin. And the FAA is working on modernizing these systems. We have seen what happens when there is a local outage, like in Jacksonville at one of the big air traffic control centers and there, and how that has a ripple effect throughout the system causing flight cancelations and delays. This system is a nationwide system. This goes out to pretty every airplane that is trying to take off.

      "sentences": "We have this new statement, Don, from the FAA, in which it says the FAA is still working to fully restore the notice to air mission system following an outage. While some functions are beginning to come back online, the national airspace systems operations remain limited.So, it seems that the FAA is on this, they're attacking this, they are trying to get it fixed. We are seeing the delays go up by the moment. That graphic, when we first checked in at the top of the hour, it was in the 1,110 range. We just hit 1,230 delays nationwide. So far, we're seeing mostly delays, not necessarily cancelations. Airlines are really trying to stem this off hoping that there may be a resolution sometime soon and that they can get their airplanes in the air. Let's back up and reiterate from where we were at the top of the hour. United Airlines holding all of its flights on the ground right now because of this critical outage of the notice to air missions system. That means pilots cannot get information that they need before they take off. American Airlines also tells us that it's delaying some of its flights and monitoring this by the moment. So, we will see as this continues as this outage still lingers and the FAA tries to fix this problem. We know that a lynchpin in the system, it failing can have a really big, widespread effect on aviation nationwide. So far, there has not been a ground stop issued by the FAA for flights nationwide. So, people can -- pilots can still get some of this information, it seems, and some flights are still taking off, but out of an abundance of caution, some of these airlines are delaying and canceling flights. So, this is the information that pilots need that they can take off. These are things like whether or not a runway is in use. Peter Goelz mentioned whether or not a localizer is in or out. You need that to get down to a runway in bad weather so pilots can essentially fly blind. And only in reference to the instruments, if that NOTAM system is out, pilots cannot get the up-to-date information that they need to make sure that they have that critical knowledge. So, this is a really big outage here. That cannot be understated. And the fact that this is still getting worked on by the FAA and they're still putting out updates is a good thing but we do not have an official estimate just yet on when this will be over.

There could be hackers who are looking for money, this is the ransomware category. There could be foreign governments where they are testing their capability to infiltrate a system and affect it and may back out knowing that they have that capability. And then, of course, there's the regular technical failure about did something get into the system because of an update or things that we've seen in other large compromises. Now, to be clear, we're very early in this game and there's absolutely no indication of anything criminal or internationally driven by a foreign power in here and yet those are the wheels that are turning already because it's the kind of thing they have to assess immediately from the beginning.",

I do want to get back to our breaking news, a major update in just the last minute from the FAA. They're ordering all airlines, all domestic U.S. airlines to pause departures until 9:00 A.M. Eastern Time. Let me read you in full what the FAA says. The FAA is still working to fully restore the notice to air mission system following the outage. The FAA has ordered airlines to pause all domestic departures to 9:00 A.M. Eastern Time to allow the agency to validate the integrity of flight and safety information.",

If this goes down, the whole system comes to a halt and it cascades throughout the day.Pilots have to have this information. They need to know whether the approach patterns that they're using are fully functional. They need to know what's going on at individual airports, whether taxi ways are closed, whether runways are closed. I mean, this is essential flight information that every pilot has to receive and check before they go on a mission and fly passengers. So, this is a pretty big deal.",

Every airport has multiple approach patterns from the north and the south, and on occasion, some of these approach patterns have more precise landing navigational equipment. If some of that equipment is not functioning or is offline for maintenance, pilots need to know that so that they're not coming -- using those approaches during heavy weather.
