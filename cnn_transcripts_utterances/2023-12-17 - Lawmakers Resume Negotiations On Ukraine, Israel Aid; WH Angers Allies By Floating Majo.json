And the White House will still have to convince House Democrats to get on board with some of the concessions they have made on immigration policies. And there are some things floating around that they're willing to just compromise on, such as making it a little bit harder for migrants to seek asylum and other concessions that they're making.

Joining me now is the Washington correspondent for the Atlanta Journal Constitution, Tia Mitchell. Tia, it's always great to have you in studio. Thank you so much. So we're hearing from Senate negotiators that they've made progress. Obviously, no deal yet, but when they're talking about an immigration bill, I mean, that's going to be complex and difficult. And they're up against a really tight timeline. TIA MITCHELL, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, ATLANTA JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION: Right. It's the timeline that's difficult, but it's also the fact that there are so many competing factions within Congress. What can pass in the Senate, where Democrats have a slim majority is not necessarily something that can pass in the House, where Republicans have a slim majority. And Republicans in the House have this very vocal but influential far- right conservative contingent of lawmakers that really want strict new border policies. That's not something that senators are willing to embrace. So where is compromise that can pass both chambers?",

Also, more rules to make -- stricter rules on who can seek asylum where they seek asylum, for example, requiring them to first seek asylum in another country, not come to a U.S. soil as they seek asylum.So again, but in the House, they want to go much further. They've passed a very strict border policy bill already in the House. That's not something the Senate wants to embrace.

That seems unlikely, but it's possible. Anything can happen if Speaker Mike Johnson makes it happen.But at the end of the day, the goal is at least to get something passed in the Senate. So at least legislation is pending with the House, something that the White House can send a message to Ukraine, to President Zelenskyy saying, we're making progress, there is money on the way that we've coupled with this border policy.

      "sentences": "So while negotiators on the Hill are discussing immigration, so is the Republican frontrunner, Donald Trump. Let's listen to some really alarming rhetoric from him. Once again -- we don't have the sound.OK. Well, we heard it several times, and I think it's worth listening to because it's not just alarming, but we know that words can turn into actions. Let's just focus on the fact that he's parroting Adolf Hitler, as the Biden campaign is saying, saying that immigrants are poisoning the blood of our country and focusing on his intentions and the impact that another presidency, a Donald Trump presidency, can have on our democracy. MITCHELL: Right. So when you say poisoning the blood, it's often interpreted as saying, you know, that people from other countries are going to make existing countries impure. That's what we heard from Adolf Hitler about Jewish people. It's kind of interesting because in America, we're already kind of a melting pot. But what he's saying is that if he is elected president again, he will make it much tougher for immigrants to come in and that's -- it's hard to make a delineation between legal and illegal immigration when you're talking about immigrants poisoning the blood. So I think that's why people find it so troubling. I know that President Trump would argue he's talking about illegal immigration, particularly at the southern border, but immigrants are immigrants. People from other countries are people from other countries, no matter how they arrive, on what circumstances, which is why the words he uses to talk about immigration at the southern border are so problematic.",

I've noticed over the previous holiday periods in the last few years, and American Airlines touched on it briefly. Basically, that the holiday travel period is longer than it used to be. And I see that as a reflection, in some cases, with work from home flexibilities and things like that. But how does a longer travel period impact the flying experience at airports?",

So, trips are getting longer.People are going home for more amount of time, that actually helps, sort of, like even out the distribution of passengers going through, but I will say there's still those days that are just insanely busy. I think the 21st of December is going to be one of those. We saw record breaking crowds over Thanksgiving, so everyone has their hands full, but it is helping distribute the crowds a bit.",

If you don't have experienced people in ATC towers, unfortunately, they can't handle all the changes they need to make and keep things moving. And so, you sort of see a chain reaction, a domino effect. This year has been much better on that front, but in Europe, we're seeing that issue crop up at times.I will say the federal government's gotten involved and has opened up military airspace and stuff. So, that's helped a little bit with, sort of, controlling the amount of planes and where they're coming in and going out from. So, I think that's helping a bit. But, you know, if there's some major event, a major snowstorm, that's when things start to fall apart. So, that's where we're really going to be watching. And I know Pete Buttigieg and the whole federal government are going to be watching that carefully, too, because they're increasingly holding the airlines feet to the fire. JIMENEZ: Yes -- I mean, look, the bar was set pretty low based on last year's meltdown, and that I think stranded a lot of people. So, let's hope that we can, at the very least, improve from there.

With eyes closed, she slowly inhales. Her skeletal frame rises slightly, an action causing pain and an enormous amount of effort. Don't worry, you'll be fine, says her brother, kissing her hand. We are with you always. Her older siblings, who asked not to be identified for security reasons, smuggled her in from neighboring Afghanistan five months ago, following a series of events that would irrevocably change the course of their lives. We don't try to force her to remember what happened, he says. But once I asked her and she replied crying that she was tired and had given up all hope. But Arzo didn't always feel this way. Seen here in pink, dancing on cell phone footage, the teenager was happy, studious, and had big dreams to one day become a doctor. But that all changed in August 2021 when the Taliban retook control of Afghanistan after the U.S. withdrawal following its 20-year rule. And one of the first edicts the Taliban enforced was a ban on female secondary education. She would say, I hope we move from this place, explains her sister. I don't want to be here. There is no education. Over the following months, her mood darkened. But nothing that alarmed her family until one day in July this year. She came into the room and I saw her eyes were abnormal, she says. I asked her what had happened and she said she'd drunk acid. I didn't believe her, so I put my fingers in her mouth and she vomited up blood. Arzo's (ph) sister says she had drunk battery acid in their home in an attempted suicide. A trend that is spiking amongst teenage girls across Afghanistan, according to health professionals and human rights groups.",

Now, the Department of Housing and Urban Development does this count every single year on one day. It's what they call a point in time count, and it was done in January.But the expert that I talked to told me that even though that's data from January, it does reflect what we're seeing today. And unfortunately, what that data found was the largest number of homeless individuals ever recorded since the agency started keeping track in 2007. And the agency also points to the housing market, to the rising prices in rent and also the end of pandemic aid as some of the possible causes of this increase. The expert that I talked to agreed.
