And I think it's unlike anything we've seen in American history to have this many lawyers, associates, advisors of a president or former president be in some cases indicted and others convicted and as you say, and others in prison. And I think it's -- really underscores the stakes of the Trump trial, which starts next week because I think the question a lot of people naturally are wondering as well.All these people have been punished to varying extents for things they did with, for, and around Donald Trump. Well, how about Donald Trump himself? We will get at least the beginnings of an answer as we see that hush money trial play out in Manhattan starting on Monday.",

Those are the words of the attorney for the victims of six former Mississippi law enforcement officers who just received state prison sentences ranging between 15 and 45 years for the torture and abuse of two black men.The officers who call themselves \"The Goon Squad\" pleaded guilty to torturing and sexually assaulting the men they were sworn to protect in their community. One of them -- one of those men was actually shot in the mouth. The case has garnered national attention for the racism and the inhumane acts committed back in this 2023 incident. Last month, all six were sentenced to federal prison terms ranging from 10 to 40 years. CNN Senior National Correspondent Ryan Young is joining us right now.

You said today, this really meant something because it's never happened in Rankin County that officers will be charged and face penalty. MALIK SHABAZZ, ATTORNEY FOR TWO MEN ASSAULTED BY \"GOON SQUAD\" DEPUTIES: Yes, history has been made. The Goon Squad here in Rankin County, who have never been held accountable for all of their crimes had to appear and to be sentenced for their terrorism and torture of Michael Jenkins, Eddie Parker, and many others in Rankin County.

The 160-year-old law predates Arizona's own statehood by nearly half a century and bans abortions except whereas is necessary \"to save a pregnant woman's life.\" The law is on hold for 14 days to allow all parties to raise additional issues at a lower court. But if allowed to go forward, it would put Arizona among the states with the strictest abortion laws in the country.Joining us now to discuss this and more, is Democratic Congressman James Clyburn of South Carolina. He's also a national co-chair for the Biden-Harris campaign. Congressman, thanks so much for joining us. As you know, President Biden is slamming this ruling in Arizona allowing a near-total ban on abortion rights for women to go into effect. The Vice President, Kamala Harris, will travel to Arizona this week. What kind of impact do you expect that this will all have come November? REP. JAMES CLYBURN (D-SC): Well, thank you very much for having me, Wolf. I would hope that this decision there in Arizona will wake people up to exactly what's going on by the Republican Party at this particular juncture in our history. In 1864, certain (ph) law being adhered to a state's rights law. Let me just say. Once the camel gets his nose under the tent, the hump will soon follow. And that's what's happening here. We got to look at the fact that a lot of laws that we have put behind us are now being placed in front of us. This is just one of them. We see what -- we saw what happened back in 1876 another law bringing in states right. This is a state's right issue. And if the Supreme Court of Arizona has its holding, adopted by the Supreme Court of these United States, we will see a revisit of state rights laws all across the board. It has already happened with the Voting Rights Act of 1965. It has happened with women's reproductive rights. Though that was not a civil rights law, but it was a state's rights issue. The president is now saying he wants to see this issue of women's reproductive rights given on a state-by-state basis. So, one person can have a set of rights in one state and not have the same set of rights in another state. That's not the way to keep our country together.",

I do know that people who see these pants being put in their districts, like the Scout plant in Richmond County, South Carolina, the Volvo plant in Berkeley County, South Carolina, these battery plants are providing jobs for people that never had a good-paying job before. Those are things we need to talk about.So, I do believe you have to do things on balance. But to say you've got -- you can talk about one because you talk about the other, I'm not there too, that's the way to do things. So, when I hear people talk about the economy and stop talking about the stock market and stop talking about the field, one day, I ask them about the people that I represent, who don't have free or 401Ks, but they're looking for jobs, and now they've got jobs.

Very sharp comments about Netanyahu himself, clear that his patience is running out. We should note that these comments came just a few days after the bombing of these World Central Kitchen staffers.
