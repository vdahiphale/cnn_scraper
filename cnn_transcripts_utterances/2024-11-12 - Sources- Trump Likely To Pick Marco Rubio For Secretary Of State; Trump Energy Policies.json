Trump tapping South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem for Homeland Security Secretary, two people familiar with the selection tell CNN. Noem is just the latest Trump loyalist he's chosen for his next administration to help carry out ambitious policy goals she will work alongside two immigration hardliners that Trump has slated to serve in senior roles, Stephen Miller and Tom Homan, both served in Trump's first White House. Two people familiar with Trump's thinking also tell CNN he's likely to pick Florida Senator Marco Rubio for secretary of state. As of last night, it wasn't clear if Trump had offered Rubio the role, but Rubio was a staunch supporter of Trump throughout his 2024 campaign. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And now he's one of Trump's biggest supporters. I mean, Marco has had kind of the same kind of transition to where being a Trump critic realized that he couldn't get anywhere in the party without kind of supporting Trump. So then he became kind of like an informal adviser to Trump during the first term, while he was senator. And then also then became the shortlist for a running mate. He was one of the last three names to kind of help Donald Trump on the on the top of the ticket there. And so, now, you're seeing that he's being rewarded with the secretary of state job and he is kind of a more -- he is very hawkish. But he also has kind of a more mainstream Republican when it comes to some -- it comes to national security ideas. He's not as kind of isolationist as Trump is. He is a supporter of NATO.

I mean, they're called -- we typically shorthand them as czars, right? These are people. And the reason they exist is because they don't need to be confirmed by the Senate, which is a process that can really trip up people who are perhaps more controversial.This was my colleague Kayla Tausche writes, quote, the president-elect has elevated a new class of candidates, the czars, a role that operates in the sphere between the agencies and the president. A bid to skirt bureaucratic processes, exert more power over the portfolio. It also means these candidates not burdened by the lengthy Senate confirmation process, can launch their work on day one. There are people who aren't kidding around. They'll just go straight in and execute the president's agenda because -- I mean, some of these nominees could be tied up for months in a process.

Czars, obviously I mean, they don't have the kind of overwhelming power as a cabinet secretary, but they do have the power of being like they're appointed, but they're still appointed by Trump.And they still have the authority to kind of go and kind of -- they can't force cabinet secretaries. They can't force government employees to kind of do what they say in these agencies, but they do have the power to kind of advise and talk to and kind of give ideas. And they're going to be very powerful, especially with Trump, because you're looking at the people he's appointing are people that he trusts, people that he wants in this office. And cabinet secretaries -- I mean, well see how long they take. If the Senate actually follows Trump's recess appointments, they could not take that very long. But that seems pretty difficult to do.

      "sentences": "So, Max, obviously, one of the other big picture things here, the Paris Climate Accords and \"Politico\" recently wrote about this. They say this, quote, the world is bracing for president elect Donald Trump to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate -- climate agreement for the second time, only this time he could move faster and with less restraint. The United States absence from the deal would put other countries on the hook to make bigger reductions to their climate pollution. It would also raise inevitable questions from some countries about how much more effort they should put in, when the worlds second largest greenhouse gas polluter is walking away.And, obviously, the effects of the change in climate are starting to show up in people's everyday lives, in bigger and bigger ways. Whether it's right now, there's a wildfire burning here in the U.S. in New Jersey, a place that you know, rarely sees things like that. Hurricanes have gotten more intense and difficult to deal with. Insurance in Florida is getting to be impossible to get, and yet these sort of big picture things that are required to actually do something about it remain politically as outlined here, politically, very difficult. FOSTER:  Well, it certainly needs the big industrialized countries to work together to reduce global emissions. It doesn't work if everyone doesn't work together. And actually, the COP conference is set up in that way there has to be a unanimous decision about what they actually decide at these meetings but that's also undermine the meetings in the past, because countries like Saudi Arabia would veto any big decisions. So, you know, Donald Trump could legitimately look at the cop conference and say well, it hasn't been working anyway but certainly the U.S. pulling out of the Paris climate agreement does leave everyone questioning, you know, they certainly couldn't make up for all of the pollution that America puts into the world but they cant afford it either. At the moment with economies slumping, its just not seen at the same priority. And I think you really see that actually with the world leaders that have turned up to this conference, a lot of the smaller countries who are desperate to get some aid from the developing countries, but Germany is not there. France isn't there. Russia and crucially, China and the U.S., the leaders of those countries, aren't there. So it's losing a lot of its emphasis.",
