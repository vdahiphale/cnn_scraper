We don't think that, you know, there is any blame to be put on anyone else but Hamas. The situation on the ground is very complex. And we just have to make sure that, you know, negotiation comes back and the hostages will be freed.

We are hoping that those efforts are going to bear fruits sooner, rather than later, because we know the situation is bad. It's 83 days. We're close to three months. Some of the hostages are wounded, bad medical conditions. Even those that are not, under those conditions of starvation, lack of oxygen, what have you, it's a really tough situation. And we are hoping that the remaining six American hostages will be brought back as well as all the other 130 hostages. The families are craving to see them. And of course, we do, too.

He said he's concerned he's not going to see his parents who are in their 80s alive again. He has already lost friends. He's lost beloved pets. And he is concerned that his plight continues to go on. He said it's surreal that he's marking five years in that Russian prison and that he is struggling with depression. However, he says he starts every day singing the national anthems of the four countries to whom he has citizenship, and he tries to keep his spirits high. But he's urging the U.S. to keep fighting to bring him home. U.S. officials, of course, have said that they are working every day to try to get Whelan home. Secretary of State Antony Blinken put out a statement last night saying they would not rest until they do so. The special envoy for hostage affairs, Roger Carstens, said this isn't something that they sat down and -- a couple weeks later. This is something they're working on diligently to bring back both Whelan and the \"Wall Street Journal\" reporter, Evan Gershkovich. We know that a serious proposal was put forward to Russia to bring both of them home and that proposal was denied by Russia -- Boris, Brianna?",

But now they are down nine weeks in a row to 6.6 percent. This is really more of a plunge than a drop. Now, rates are, of course, not low. They were much lower three years ago. But this is a big step in the right direction. Remember, rates spiked when the Fed launched this war against inflation. But now, the Fed is preparing to cut interest rates as soon as March because inflation has cooled off. So, this is very important. Let me show you what it means for the typical home buyers. Say you're in the market to buy a $500,000 home. You plan on putting 20 percent down. Your monthly payments are $319 less now, at current rates, than they would've been if you bought in the peak back in October. That's per month. That is really helpful. Less money on interest means you can spend more money on childcare or saving for college. And this really adds up. Over the lifetime of a loan, we're talking about saving over $100,000 just because rates have dropped.",
