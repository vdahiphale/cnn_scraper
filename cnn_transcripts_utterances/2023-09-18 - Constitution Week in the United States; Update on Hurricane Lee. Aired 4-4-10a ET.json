      "sentences": "Yeah, this is going to come down to time, ultimately. How economically costly this ultimately is, willreally hinge on how long the strike continues. Now, if it is an extended strike while analysts warn the economic costs will add up. One estimate from the Anderson Economic Group, estimates that the strike could cost the economy $5 billion if it lasts 10 days. Now, one thing to consider with that estimate is that, that would`ve been a full strike of UAW 143,000 workers at this point about a 10th of that figure is actually striking. So keep that in mind, but that estimate does include things like lost pay, losses to manufacturers, but also suppliers. Now guys, if it feels like there have been more strikes than usual. Yeah, it`s not just your imagination. So what`s behind the increased strike activity, both here in the U.S. and around the world, to be honest, while I asked our wheat in that he runs the labor program at Cornell and he says high inflation, a tight labor market, which has workers feeling like they have the upper hand. They can ask for the things that they want. Also public support has steadily increased for Unions. And also COVID-19 as workers continue to think about the type of work life balance that they want. Now, in terms of wages, Auto Workers fall behind the average worker. This is average. According to government data, the average hourly worker for an Auto Worker is about $27.99. Whereas the average worker around the country makes about $33.82. Now we should say for the automaker`s part, you know, they say, wait a minute, we have to worry about prices as well, because we have to compete with the non-union competitors. And so they have to be conscious of prices as well. I mean, that`s what the automakers are saying. Clearly the two sides are still pretty far apart. It seems at least from what we can tell. But ultimately the damage that could be caused in terms of the economy will really just depend on how long this strike ultimately takes. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Leehit Canada`s east coast on Saturday with strong wind, heavy rain and flooding. Tens of thousands of people lost power in the storm. It`s the eighth time since 2016 that a storm in the North Atlantic has reached Category 5 or the highest category for hurricanes. There have been 10 named storms in the Atlantic since August 20th, breaking the old record for most name storms in the Atlantic between August 20th and September 16th. Experts say this kind of severe weather could continue to happen more often as oceans warm up and it`s keeping hurricane hunters busy. CNN`s Gary Tuchman joined a team of these scientists on a flight to document the storm last week. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

PAUL FLAHERTY, FLIGHT DIRECTOR &amp; FLIGHT METEOROLOGIST: We want to make sure we`re collecting data in data sparse areas in which there`s currently no data available, very little data available for the weather models to use, to make forecasts. TUCHMAN (on camera): For this mission, this aircraft flies an altitude between 41,000 and 45,000 feet. It travels around 500 miles per hour. This is essentially a flying weather station, a weather station that goes to the weather. (Voice-over): For the next eight hours, the men and women of the NOAA Corps will fly in this high-altitude reconnaissance jet above, below, around and in front of Hurricane Lee.",
