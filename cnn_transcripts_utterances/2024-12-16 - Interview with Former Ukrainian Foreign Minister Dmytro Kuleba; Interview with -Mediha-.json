Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. The defense of Ukraine is top of the agenda for European foreign ministers meeting in Brussels today. Russian forces are reportedly just three kilometers, that's under two miles, from the key Ukrainian City of Pokrovsk in the east. Meantime, Kyiv says this graphic video shows dead Russian and North Korean soldiers in Russia's Kursk region, where they are still trying to repel Ukraine's summer incursion. With a new year ahead and a new American administration too, the urgent question is how to end the war in Ukraine soon. Few know better what those negotiations would look like and the cost of such a deal than former Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba. And he's joining me now from Kyiv, the capital.

But, you know, that -- anyway, we'll talk about that.

But as I said before, and as you just confirmed with the examples that you brought up, when people -- when leaders are saying we want peace, that's easy. When you get to defining the terms of this peace and the specific solutions that have to be implemented, it gets really difficult. Like, take the NATO issue. We hear different opposite views on that. Take the land issue, no leader of Ukraine can legally concede territory of Ukraine enshrined in its constitution. So, we cannot speak about any transfer. Diplomats will have to find a Delphic language to describe this territorial status quo. But it's very difficult to do because both Russia and Ukraine believe that this land is legally theirs. The difference is that Ukraine does that in a rightful way, and Russia is unrightful in this. But it will be a very challenging exercise. And most importantly, you know, you can ask hundreds of questions of what Ukraine should do, but the key to peace is in Moscow.

On the other hand, I assume you believe that Russia's relative weakness was demonstrated when it refused, or didn't, or couldn't come to the help of its client in Syria, Hafez Assad.

It will be the end of our identity. And most importantly there will be Buchas, Mariupol, and all other places where heinous massacres were committed by Russian forces all over Ukraine. This is something that people should not forget what the Russians were doing in the occupied cities, all the acts of genocide and massacres that they committed. So, this was -- this is what keeps us fighting. But don't forget that Russia is also tired. And we started this war with Russia being capable to fight this war on its own. But today, it cannot uphold the effort. It cannot keep up the fire without the support of its partners, primarily North Korea and Iran. So, we are in a completely changed environment now. You know, it's conventional to speak about Ukraine not being able to fight without its partners. But Russia cannot fight without its partners either. So, this is not -- this should not be underestimated. The one who blinks today, loses the war. So, we have to keep strong and we have to keep fighting.",

This has -- this is very, very weird and unfortunate to observe that. But what is important is that today, I'm pretty certain Putin is -- has instructed his people, his intelligence and his diplomacy to double down on sowing divisions and hesitation and fear in among Ukraine's partners, because he knows how weak he is and he needs to push our partners to the edge to make them falter, and this is what we should not allow.",

There have been suggestions, and you know that NATO is speaking with President Zelenskyy this week and European leaders, and there's a thought that maybe European forces, you know, I don't know whether Trump would agree to U.S. forces, but peacekeepers along the line of conflict.

The moment our western friends and partners, whom I support and appreciate very much, will stop inventing the will for Ukraine, the security will for Ukraine, and will offer to Ukraine what guarantees their security, which is NATO membership, then we will have strong and streamlined security architecture in Europe and Euro-Atlantic space as a whole. Trust me, the conversation on security guarantees will end up with nothing really serious, nothing that Ukraine has not seen or received yet.

So, now it seems to be fixed. We are -- our comeback to Europe has taken place. This is the good news. The bad news is that there is one big fundamental outstanding issue, which is NATO membership. And exactly in the same way as Ukraine was proposed alternatives to future -- to membership in the European Union some years ago, we are now being proposed alternatives to membership in NATO.

So, by 2030, we will have cut just because of the two basic laws that were passed during the Biden administration, the Inflation Reduction Act and the bipartisan infrastructure law, those two bills will mean that we are on a path to cut by 40 percent our greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and we will be at 80 percent clean electricity by 2030 on our electric grid. That doesn't account for, of course, what the private sector is doing separate from that, what governments, local and state governments are doing.

And this is -- obviously, this happens, this -- the announcements continue to happen and continue to roll out. So, the Trump administration -- under the Trump administration, they will see a huge number of ribbon cuttings of people being hired because of the laws that were passed.

It's good for the planet because those particular investments, 81 percent are going to communities that have below average weekly wages, and 86 percent are going to communities that have below average college graduation rates.

So -- and that's going to continue because, first, all of these data centers that are coming online, which will require a huge amount of energy from our grid. Second, the transportation system is being electrified, and that means more electricity demand from the grid. Third, all those factories I'm talking about, all that economic activity, is going to cause the demand for electricity to rise. So, this is the question is how can we keep up with that? So, the good news is that, again, these laws have created a huge amount of incentive for the build out of clean electricity. So, this year alone, we will be adding 60 gigawatts, which is effectively 30 Hoover dam's worth of clean power to our electricity grid because of those incentives. That's more than double what we have ever added to the grid. That trajectory will still go up. Clean power is the cheapest form of power. You don't have to pay for the fuel of the sun or the wind. And therefore, we get more clean energy, prices will begin to stabilize. But it is true that the demand will cause upward pressure on pricing. It's one of the reasons why we've asked the hyperscalers who will be building out these data centers to BYOP, bring your own power. If you're going to build out a big data center, bring the power and bring clean power with it so that the rest of the world -- the rest of the country doesn't have to pay for your power needs.",

We also have technologies to reduce the carbon emissions from fossil fuels, and that's part of what the Inflation Reduction Act and the bipartisan infrastructure law have been incentivizing as well. But as I said, we're going to get to 80 percent clean electricity on our grid by 2030, and then 100 percent by 2035. That's because, again, of these incentives. So, we're -- we are moving in this direction, and these laws, which were the biggest and the most -- I don't know the most comprehensive energy -- clean energy laws in the world, certainly in the U.S. history, but in the world, to cause all of this investment and all of this generation to come online. So, people should feel comfortable that we're moving in the right direction. And I don't think we're going to see Congress pull back on them because of these 950 some odd factories, 80 percent of them are in red districts.

I've read that he has done some work in solar as well. So, if the Republican strategy is really -- as many Republicans will say, and all of the above strategy, then that would -- and one would expect that both the opportunities that have been built around renewable energies as well as what they will continue to do on fossil fuels, both sides may coexist. I will say I do have optimism about this. I think that there are certain areas where we do have this bipartisan support, and that tells me that a lot of the work that the department has been doing and a lot of the support that the department has in the Republican Party. We have a huge -- you know, we -- the National Nuclear Security Administration is under the Department of Energy. And that means all of the nuclear stockpile occurs under the DOE's ambit. There's support for that on both sides of the aisle. There's support for our labs on both sides of the aisle. There is support for a lot of the clean energy technologies on both sides of the aisle.
