The Madison, Wisconsin police chief will be joining us, will be a guest in just a moment.And before that, we are also standing by to learn more about the victims here. Two victims killed at this K-12 school. So far, we know one was a teacher and one was a student. At least six other people were injured, two of them students who were in critical condition with life threatening injuries, as of the last update. We're standing by for more of that this morning. Also this morning, police say that the shooter's parents are cooperating and that they are, of course, still searching for a motive, a possible but unverified manifesto out there and surfacing. And we are hearing heartbreaking and heart wrenching stories from the children who survived this tragedy, some seen fleeing the scene just in Christmas pajamas. Police say it was a second grader who first called 911. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
