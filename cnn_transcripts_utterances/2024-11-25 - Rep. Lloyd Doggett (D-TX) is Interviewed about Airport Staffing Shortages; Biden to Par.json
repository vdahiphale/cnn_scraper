This is also just as the busy holiday travel season is beginning. This includes, in this strike, several hundred workers, like the people who clean the cabins, work the ramps and wheelchair attendants.And this strike comes as the FAA is warning it also may need to slow down air traffic during this holiday season because of a different shortage, the ongoing and almost chronic shortage, it seems, of air traffic controllers. Those shortages have already caused serious issues and delays at airports across the country, including in Austin, Texas. That airport now operating with - reports are about half of the 60 air traffic controllers that are recommended for that airport. And joining us right now is one member of Congress who has been sounding the alarm on this issue for more than a year now, Democratic Congressman Lloyd Doggett from Texas. Congressman, thanks for coming in. You've been asking the FAA to do something about Austin's staffing shortage for more than a year. What answers have you gotten? REP. LLOYD DOGGETT (D-TX): Not enough answers. There's a real safety issue here. We've had, since really about two years, we've had five near catastrophes here. The most recent one in October when a small plane got within 350 feet of a packed American Airlines flight coming into Austin. We need additional controllers. It was about a year ago, just about a year and a week today, that the FAA administrator, Whitaker, was in my office in Washington telling me that Austin was as bad as it gets, which I agree it is, and yet we have fewer controllers today than we had when he was in my office, despite repeated requests to prioritize Austin, to give us additional tools. I fly in and out of this airport, often twice a week, and I'm really concerned about an inadequate margin of safety that we have there, and in many other parts of the country.",

One, from our Pete Muntean telling me, it's burnout in the workforce, looking at these mandatory 12-hour shifts and six days a week, backlogged FAA training process, retirements and - but some of the latest figures from May from the agency is that they're about 3,000 controllers short. In September they announced 1,800 hires for the year. But that doesn't detail how many losses came in the very same time. How bad is this, Congressman, and how dangerous is this?",

Never has that been raised as a reason why they could not prioritize this airport as bad as it gets, why they could not do better than 50 percent of their target level.There were some improvements. There was slight increase in funding. We need to move quicker on that in a Congress that's too often stalemated.

Two lucky turkeys are going to be spared from your Thanksgiving table, groomed, instead, for a future at petting zoos and perhaps Disney parades, all thanks to the presidential pardon power.Peaches and Blossom of Northfield, Minnesota, arrived here at the White House in a Volvo earlier today after staying at the Willard Intercontinental for a luxury sleepover just down the road from the White House. It's a collective 81 pounds of bird born in July. And for their four short months of life so far, they've been listening to a steady stream of polka music and AC/DC, according to the chair of the National Turkey Federation. Now, this is a presidential tradition that goes back centuries. It has folklore dating back to the time of Abraham Lincoln, when reportedly his young son asked the president to spare a pet turkey from their Thanksgiving dinner that year. And then President George H.W. Bush, the first president to officially use his pardon power in this way. For President Biden, it's the fourth and final time he is going to be participating in the turkey pardon? It's always a moment of levity, especially now after a bruising campaign cycle and against a landscape of rising geopolitical tensions. We are told that the birds this year were chosen because of their calm temperaments, their ability to withstand a raucous event on the White House South Lawn with big crowds, bright flashbulbs and, of course, always a lot of laughs.

They're like, why would I want to sell them? (INAUDIBLE) starting to unwind a little bit. Now people are getting to the end of their term or things are happening in their lives, like divorce or death, things like that. So, more houses are coming on.Also, builders are getting very busy. They're getting after it because we do have a massive shortage of homes in the United States. So, yes, we are starting to see this come back. There's more properties. And, you know, what we've seen is millennials are getting creative. Any first-time homeowner can get creative. We have an employee at Real Wealth, and she lived in California. She ended up moving to Cleveland, Ohio. She bought a duplex. And then that way she can live in the upstairs with her husband and their new baby, and they can rent out the lower level. And that really helps them with their mortgage payments. So, there's ways to get creative. My wife and I, back in 1997, bought our first property. It was in the San Francisco Bay area. Way more mortgage than we could afford. So, we house hacked. Basically, a house hack is when you take some of the rooms and you rent those out. We took the lower level of that home and we rented them out and we got - that's when we became landlords. That's how we became real estate investors. And it helped us huge with our mortgage. So, there's ways to get creative. There's ways that you can get in. And I think one of the most important things you can do, what we told our 24 year old daughter, our millennial, is to go out and see what you qualify for. Just speak to a mortgage broker and find out what could you qualify. And people don't realize that you can get into an FHA loan for 3 percent down.",
