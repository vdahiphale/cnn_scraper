Biden laying a wreath inside Ukraine, which is an active war zone, where the U.S. military has no control.

It's never happened before. And yet those were the stakes. That was the rationale behind President Biden's visit, a visit he'd been basically pleading with aides to try and set up for the series of months that led to an intensive background effort by a small circle of aides to put it together. And if you want to know how this was received, well, this was how President Zelenskyy framed it: (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  This is really the most important visit for the whole history of Ukraine- U.S. relationship.

And they're going to get victory, they believe, through the kinds of weapons that the West and the U.S. have been offering. Right now, there is a bit of a difference between what President Zelenskyy and the Ukrainians have been asking for and what they have been getting. We heard today from a top member of the National Security Council, who said what was in that aid package today is for the near-term fight. The U.S. wants Ukraine to focus on a counteroffensive in the south in the coming weeks using some new training methods, new tactical methods that they have been taught in their training in Germany, new weaponry that they're being offered, including armored vehicles. And, at the same time, Ukraine is facing the beginning stages, we believe, of what is a Russian offensive that is also due to grow in the coming weeks, so far, Pam, Ukrainians doing a very good job of pushing them back -- Pamela.",

First of all, at the visit itself, the Russians making a big thing of the fact that, apparently, the White House notified the Russians before President Biden took this trip. And some of the reactions there are is that the Russians are essentially saying, look, he's here or he was in Kyiv at the mercy of Vladimir Putin, that Vladimir Putin essentially allowed the U.S. president to come to Kyiv. However, there's some others, really hard-line military bloggers who become quite prominent here in Russia as the war has gone on, who said that this is absolutely a defeat for Russia, that President Biden can just go there without facing any difficulties from the Russian Federation. And they see it as a sort of sign of weakness from President Putin that this was allowed to happen in the first place. But that's sort of part of it. But, essentially, what the Russians are also saying is that they believe that the fact that President Biden was there in Kyiv today shows that the U.S. is very much part of this conflict, some Russians even saying party to this conflict. And it's really one of the narratives, Pamela, that the Russians have been trying to build over the past couple of months, especially as things have been quite difficult for them on the battlefield, is, they're saying, look, we're not just fighting against the Ukrainians, but we're also fighting against all these Western weapons that are pouring in, especially from the U.S. So they're essentially trying to frame this as not Russia against Ukraine, but Russia against the West, and specifically NATO, and, of course, the United States. Looking to hear more from that when President Putin has his speech tomorrow, Pamela.",

Talk to us a little bit more about the significance and the optics of this visit coming right now, at this time. KIMBERLY DOZIER, CNN GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST:  Well, it sends signals to a number of different audiences. Of course, first of all, you get the two presidents meeting together, and Zelenskyy gets an opportunity to make his argument in person: Here's why we want the F-16s. Yes, if you give us long-range weapons, we promise not to use them in an offensive way against Russia, things like that. But it also rallies the Ukrainian people and troops, who, according to some reports, are suffering middling to low morale, because they see this Russian war machine just going on and on. Russia, according to the U.K. Ministry of Defense, is taking up to 800 casualties a day right now, but shows no sign of flagging. And it seems like President Putin may simply double down in this speech that we're anticipating tomorrow. It also rallies Americans who might be feeling lukewarm about Ukraine that, look, I am aligning my presidency with someone considered a world hero, and we have to keep supporting them. That makes an argument to some of the Democrats, at least, that might feel cold feet",

He's also answered GOP complaints that he is weak, a flagging, elderly president by doing something that, yes, while presidents have gone to war zones before, he went to a place where U.S. troops weren't in control.
