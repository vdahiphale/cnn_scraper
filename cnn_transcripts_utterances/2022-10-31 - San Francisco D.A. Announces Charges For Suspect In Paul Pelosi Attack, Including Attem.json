Russia launching dozens of missiles, knocking out water and power. And we're getting new video in tonight of Russian soldiers chaotically fleeing Ukraine's counteroffensive. And Obama's closing argument. The former president crisscrossing the country, telling Democrats that now is not the time to mope. But what impact will Obama have on these razor tight races? Let's go OUTFRONT. Good evening, everyone. I'm Kate Bolduan, in for Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, we have breaking news. The San Francisco district attorney just charging the man who's accused of attacking Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband with attempted murder, residential burglary, assault with a deadly weapon, elder abuse, false imprisonment of an elder, as well as threats to a public official and their family. If convicted, he could face up to life in prison. The D.A. was also crystal clear this evening on the suspect's motive. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Federal officials are so detailing Depape's terrifying intentions. According to court documents released today, Depape told police that he ultimately intended to hold Speaker Nancy Pelosi hostage, saying that if Pelosi were to tell him the, quote/unquote, truth, he would later go. And if she lied, he told police that he said he was going to break your kneecaps. And it comes as we are also learning more, even more about the attack. Police say Depape entered the Pelosi home Friday with zip ties, tape, rope, and two hammers just before 2:30 in the morning. He woke up Paul Pelosi who was eventually able to call 911. The suspect though, telling police that he did not leave after that call to 911. The reason being, quote, much like the American Founding Fathers with the British, he was fighting against tyranny without the option of surrender. That's in the criminal complaint. When police arrived, Depape is accused of attacking Pelosi, smashing him in the head of the hammer. And now, we are getting new details about Pelosi's condition. Whitney Wild is OUTFRONT covering this for us. Whitney, the path is expected to be in court tomorrow for his arraignment. What new information are you learning about the attack and what police found at the scene?",

He claimed that he wanted to talk to Nancy. Somehow, through all of this, Paul Pelosi was able to talk him down, keep him calm enough that he was able to slip into the bathroom and call 911. When police got there, Pelosi open the door and moments later, Depape hit him so hard with that hammer that he fell to the ground unconscious. Here's a quote from that complaint that lays out exactly why Depape told investigators he did this. He said he viewed Nancy as the leader of the pack of lies told by the Democratic Party. Depape also later explained that by breaking Nancy's kneecap, she would then have to wield into Congress which would show other members of Congress that there were consequences to actions. Depape also explained generally that he wanted to use Nancy to lore another individual to Depape. Kate, investigators found Depape's backpack at the Pelosi residence. They've gotten among other things, as you mentioned, a roll of tape, white rope, a hammer, a pair of rubber gloves, a pair of cloth gloves, and the journal. And then further, Kate, this affidavit makes clear he had more -- at least one other weapon, where he was living in basically a garage, it was a search warrant where they found more gloves and a sword, Kate.",

Would you want him to come to other state and possibly embarrass you when your Republicans all already really fired up? I don't think so. Comparably, Obama is campaigning because Biden can't. He is a liability, too. Interestingly, both Biden and Trump are the two biggest vote anchors on the parties. Obama floats at a different plane.

MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Of course. It's been happening from the beginning, Kate, and it's just accelerating. Nick just mentioned about the hundreds of millions of dollars it takes to repair this infrastructure. Russia is also spending millions of dollars on a strategy of attacking civilian infrastructure, forcing Zelensky government to move in two directions. They want to continue the military assault on the Russians that are occupying their country, but they are faced with the dynamic of how do we take care of our civilians at the same time? So it causes that government to look two ways and this is unfortunately more continuation of an illegal strategy by Mr. Putin, which is based on committing war crimes. You can't say it any other way.

There's no wingman to this, there's the helmet that just went off, there's no wingman for this vehicle. They suddenly go off in a ditch probably because some of the soldiers on top of the vehicle are blocking the driver's view. It is just a comity of error, Kate. I mean, These are the kind of things soldiers look for in an undisciplined, chaotic mob, not a group soldiers. And this is just representative of what we have seen in an untrained force from the very beginning where in this case, I'm sure there were some soldiers either badly injured or perhaps even killed when that vehicle rolled over. And it was just because they don't know how to perform the kind of skills that are expected of soldiers on the battlefield. And, thankfully, the Ukrainian force is much more disciplined. They have an NCO corps that enforces standards and the key thing is winter is coming as we talked about. Right now, it's 38 degrees in Kyiv. It's getting cold, and we are still in November. The kind of discipline that's needed in a force right now has got to be applied by NCOs.
