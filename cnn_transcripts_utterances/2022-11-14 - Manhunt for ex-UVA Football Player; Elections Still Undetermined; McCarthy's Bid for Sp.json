But that's what we know about him. His name is Christopher Darnell Jones Jr. And the search continues for him.Authorities just -- the last communication we got from them texted out to people in the UVA community said this, the law enforcement search on and around UVA grounds continues. Remain sheltered in place. Expect increased law enforcement presence. And that is certainly what we have seen here on the campus as the search continues. It all happened around 10:30 last night right very close to where I am standing. The university president putting out a statement saying essentially that he is heartbroken to report these three fatalities and the two people who were injured. Now, what we have at the moment in that search is people being told to shelter in place. They are told not to leave their homes. And we're also told that classes are canceled for the day while that search continues. The names of the victims have not been released by authorities and we continue to wait for the university police department to release more information. Jim, back to you.",

And so if he's going to give it - if he's going to get the gravel, he's going to have to give away the farm. And that means really weakening his own speakership.

People like Larry Hogan. I mean Chris Christie was pretty forceful on this. But you're not hearing that from Kevin McCarthy, for instance, or from a lot of senior leadership in Congress. And, in fact, on The Hill, Republican officials are mostly pointingthe finger who are -- Republican officials who are out there blaming someone are blaming McConnell. These are Trump allies.
