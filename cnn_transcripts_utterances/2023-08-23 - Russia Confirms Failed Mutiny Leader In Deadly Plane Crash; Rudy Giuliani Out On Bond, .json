President Biden suggesting that the crash may have been ordered by Vladimir Putin.Also breaking, new arrests in the Georgia election subversion case, including former Trump Lawyer Rudy Giuliani, this as a judge is now rejecting efforts by two other Trump co-defendants to avoid arrest. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. We begin this hour with new indications from multiple sources that the man who tried and failed to rebel against Vladimir Putin's military is now dead, apparently killed in a fiery plane crash two months after the failed mutiny. Two of our top international correspondents, Clarissa Ward and Matthew Chance, are following this breaking story for us. Matthew, first of all, what can you tell us about the crash that has killed the infamous Wagner chief?",

      "sentences": "Yes, absolutely shocking developments taking place in Russia, but not all together surprising given that it's been two months to the day since Yevgeny Prigozhin led that attempted coup in Russia and threatened the Russian capital itself.You can see that fireball, that fiery devastation on the ground just 60 miles north of Moscow, near a small village there, where Yevgeny Prigozhin's private jet, an Embraer 600, can be seen in other video, spiraling out of the sky with one of its wings very badly damaged, if not missing, before plunging into the ground in those scenes you can see there that are coming to us from television. There's the video of the plane hurtling downwards. It was filmed by an eyewitness on the ground. It was on a flight between Moscow and the Russian city of St. Petersburg and crashed shortly after takeoff at about 6:00 local time. That's about 11:00 in the morning Eastern Time, just after about 11 minutes past that hour. At the same time, Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, was elsewhere in the country giving a speech marking the 80th anniversary of a famous tank battle, an infamous tank battle during the Second World War, in which he talked about loyalty to the motherland and how the oath of office to the military service was important then as it is now in the war in Ukraine. He also held a minute's silence for warriors who had fallen, Russian fighters who had fallen in battle in both the Second World War and in the war in Ukraine. That taking place as the person who has done more than anyone else to challenge his grip on power in the course of the past 20 years, Yevgeny Prigozhin, as the head of that uprising plunged to Earth in that fireball, Wolf.",

We saw him greeting African leaders in St. Petersburg. We saw him as recently as last week traveling, reportedly, to Africa.And while he was certainly a bit more muted and subdued in his tone, we didn't see the kind of bluster and criticism, of course, that we had seen before, I think it was still shocking to people that he was seemingly moving about very freely with no sense of being fearful for his life, and everyone was wondering how it was possible that he was still alive and how much longer he would stay alive for. The theory that some have is that, essentially, this time period would have been necessarily for the Kremlin to effectively go about dismantling Wagner and coming up with some kind of a succession plan for when, ultimately, Prigozhin would be killed.",

And even on the ground, we know now General Sergey Surovokin, who was the sort of the general in charge of Russia's war efforts in Ukraine, he had disappeared for weeks. Now, he has been officially fired. Another senior general, Ivan Popov, similarly disappeared and then dismissed from his duties. So, it is clear that there is some kind of a purge going on. The ultimate goal of which is to totally stop any of this sort of mutiny or any further mutiny in its tracks. The question is, does it have the reverse effect? Does it ignite outrage? Does it ignite further protests? I think given the sort of conditions on the ground right now, this is a very clear and direct threat to anyone who might be having any ideas about following in Prigozhin's footsteps. And you know, this is speculation, but I would say it's probably unlikely that you're going to see protests or anything like that breaking out as a result of this.",

And you had, as everyone has been saying, the fury that Putin has when somebody crosses him and is a traitor.And then what could be the result? I think that this is really destabilizing, as if things are not destabilized enough. Because another question is, what about Wagner people themselves, the fighters who actually were supporters of Prigozhin? They thought of him as their hero. Will they rise up again? Could something like that happen? Regular people, of course, won't go into the streets. But I'm wondering about those fighters who are now in Belarus and some other places.",

That's pretty quick compared to the other defendants. But the sheriff's office tells CNN that he was treated just like anyone else. Now, before he went to surrender, his legal team came here to the Fulton County courthouse to negotiate the terms of his release. There's a $150,000 bond. He'll have to post a portion of that in cash. And he's also subject to certain restrictions, including limits on how much he can discuss with his co-defendants, including former President Trump. He cannot discuss this case with any of his co-defendants, and, Wolf, in a couple of weeks the former president will be hosting a fundraiser for Giuliani to help him come up with money to pay his legal bills and possibly get a lawyer in this case.

Now, they did not do a mug shot of the former president for either one of his federal cases or the Manhattan case. But here, at this point, we do expect that.

There's also some clarity around who was on that plane. Prigozhin was the owner of this Wagner private military corporation, the military commander, Dmitry Utkin, was on there (INAUDIBLE) leaders inside the organization. But, fundamentally (INAUDIBLE) frankly decapitated Wagner. I mean, it is the two-month anniversary of Prigozhin's march on Rostov and Moscow.

This is a well-established pattern to dispose of opponents, but also send messages to other challengers that they would be dealt with summarily. So, I don't know if this really means that much.

Now, I don't have any unique intelligence or insights into what happened, but considering that Prigozhin tried to create a mutiny two months ago, I don't think this was luck. I think this was something that Vladimir Putin did on purpose and was trying to not only target him but let everybody else know he doesn't -- he's not going to play.And, unfortunately, though, this is one of the issues that I hope the candidates on the debate stage get asked about, because, unfortunately, there's too many of those candidates that are willing to engage and, to be frank, want to kiss the butt of Vladimir Putin. Vladimir Putin is a war criminal. And his actions and likely actions today is just a further indication of that.",

As we previously reported, it is a pre-recorded interview with the former Fox News host, part of this counter programming measure. It is likely to be at about an hour and released on Twitter just about the time of the debate. Again, it is prerecorded so don't expect a lot of breaking news in it but we are told that there is some interesting and new conversations between the former Fox host and Donald Trump. Now, I am told by people of spoken to the former president in recent days to have talked extensively about his decision to skip the debate, saying he believes he made the right decision. He believes nobody is going to really step into the spotlight. However, I will tell you, Wolf, I've spoken to a number of Republican operatives who say they are just not so sure. They are waiting to see if this is an opportunity for some of these candidates to actually seize the spotlight, particularly watching Ron DeSantis -- Wolf.",
