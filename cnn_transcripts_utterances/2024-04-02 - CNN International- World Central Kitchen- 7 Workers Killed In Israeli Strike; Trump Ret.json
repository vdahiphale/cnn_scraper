An Israeli airstrike has killed seven aid workers from a World Central Kitchen team which was delivering desperately needed food to civilians in Gaza, civilians already starving and facing an imminent famine, according to aid groups. One of those killed was Palestinian. The others came from around the world, a U.S.-Canadian dual national, one Australian, three British citizens, one Polish citizen. Just yesterday, the IDF spokesperson, Daniel Hagari, told me when pressed about the thousands of civilians already killed by Israeli airstrikes that the IDF acts more cautiously than any military in the world.

And so far, they haven't shared it, but what they are trying to convey is the seriousness with which they are taking this incidents, noting that the Herzi Halevi, the top Israeli general, the chief of staff of the Israeli military, will be overseeing and reviewing the findings of that initial investigation before it is kicked over to an independent fact-finding body.But what is also clear, Jim, is the fact that these three vehicles were two of which were very clearly marked with World Central Kitchen logos, one of which was on the roof, which is where one of these missiles that appears to have been fired from a drone according to arms experts, went right through that logo on the roof. And so these vehicles were clearly marked as aid belonging to an aid organization. The people traveling in the vehicle had patches of the aid organizations on them and beyond that, the World Central Kitchen said that they conveyed their plans for this convoy's movements to the Israeli military ahead of time. And despite all of that, it appears that these three vehicles were targeted in perhaps what were separate drone strikes, one, after the other. We know that six of the seven aid workers, as you've said, are foreign nationals. One of them is in American Canadian dual citizen. The others are British, Australian, and Polish. One of the seven was a Palestinian, a driver and translator working with that aid organization. Now, the Israeli prime minister for his part, he was just on the phone with the prime minister of the United Kingdom, who we understand conveyed his serious concerns about the situation to the Israeli prime minister and interestingly, the prime minister himself in a video statement earlier today, spoke about this directly, which was quite rare for him to admit that the Israel -- Israeli forces actually carried out this strike, calling it a tragic incidents, saying that it unintentionally struck innocent people. Now, in terms of the intention here, once again, we come back to the fact that these were clearly marked vehicles that the Israeli military knew of their plans and yet still somehow the Israeli military intentions only targeted these vehicles.

But here's how Kirby responded when he was asked whether the fact that some of these strikes against civilians keep happening unintentionally or otherwise, whether that would mean that the military aid should be paused or withheld.

And if whoever was firing at them thought that this was a legitimate target, what does that mean for other Palestinians driving around Gaza?If you are an Arab or Muslim world right now and you're looking at this, you're saying, oh finally, the West is paying attention when its aid workers got hit and not when we saw and reported indiscriminate airstrike after indiscriminate airstrike. From the Israeli point of view, they could ignore a lot of that agro that was coming out of the Arab and Muslim world. They can't ignore it when it's the British prime minister, the Australian prime minister, and the White House saying, you've told us you were being careful.

Israelis say they do the same thing. It doesn't look like they did it this time. And now, the Biden White House will be able to say, if you don't straighten up your act, there will be consequences.",

Now, they are trying to court back voters and the way that Donald Trump is doing that is by really campaigning these next been these two speeches on his anti-immigration rhetoric, they believe that this is going health carry him back to the White House.We heard part of that speech in Michigan there. I was just listening to some of it, blaming Joe Biden for recent crimes, blaming immigrants for recent crime, bringing up some of those high-profile cases. I know as we have mentioned, time and time again, again, data shows that migrants and immigrants actually less likely to commit crimes than citizens. However, there have been these high profile crimes that Donald Trump is continuing to push with this rhetoric, that it is unsafe out there because of former pre -- or excuse me, because of current President Joe Biden. So that's what's here to do. He's here to try and actually just make his mark on both of these states. Jim, he has not been here in Wisconsin since 2022. Joe Biden on the other hand, has spent an extensive amount of time here, as well as put his surrogates in the state. So they were trying to get their ground game going.

Look, I mean, at this moment. He is winning. [15:25:00] He is ahead in most of these swing states. He is ahead in the national polls. So, he is facing these legal setbacks, which he has tried to use as fodder for his campaign. And I think the question now that we're in the general election phase is number one, does he continue that tactic? Does he continue to believe that the voters are with him when he describes this victimization, this witch hunt, that he believes that judicial system has undertaken against him, or does he abandon that argument, understanding that maybe general election voters are not as open to it as Republican primary voters were. So, I'm going to be interested to hear whether and how he continues to talk about the legal situation. And then as you say, whether, whether the voters respond to it, whether it improves his standing in some of these swing states, or whether, you know, as we've seen for so long, he continues to sort of defy the rules of political gravity.",

So we'll see if that turnout increases as well. And it's not only in Florida, it's in Arizona. There are other states that are considered these ballot initiatives that Democrats are looking. And they also have, you know, they have blueprints in other states where they've been able to push these ballot initiatives and to help Democrats.

I think he's facing a lot of pressure from both sides.I think we know from comments like what he said about the DeSantis six-week ban that he understands the politics of this are very dangerous for Republicans at the same time, the Republican Party is a pro-life party. There's a huge amount of passion behind these activists on the right who so -- who were so powerful in helping Trump get elected in 2016. And they want to hear him take their side in a forceful way and say that he would continue to be good on their issue. So I think he may at some point have to take a position, but one of the tactics that Trump often employees is he sort of talks on all sides of an issue lets people here, whatever they want. So I think its certainly possible we didn't use to do that. And people who want to hear, oh, he doesn't want six weeks. We'll hear that comment.

I understand that democracy needs time, thereby it needs time, but half a year. And you, every day Ukrainians are losing their lives in this fight for democracy and our common values and against Russian tyranny, which aids United States of America.
