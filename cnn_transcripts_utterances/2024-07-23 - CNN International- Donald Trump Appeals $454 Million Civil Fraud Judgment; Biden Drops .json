Thank you so much. A new hour of \"CNN News Central\" starts now. MAX FOSTER, CNN ANCHOR OF \"CNN NEWSROOM\": Hello and welcome to our viewers around the world. I am Max Foster; this is \"CNN Newsroom.\" Just ahead, getting behind Harris, Democratic delegates show support for the vice president as she prepares to hit the campaign trail, with our full coverage this hour. Plus, rival Palestinian factions signed a deal brokered by Beijing. What does the agreement between Hamas and Fatah mean for the Middle East? And CNN finds that young women around the world feel unsafe online. We'll bring you the shocking findings from our new survey. Now, if there was ever any doubt about who the Democratic Party would turn to, if Joe Biden exited the presidential race, there isn't any now. Vice President Kamala Harris is it. She has already got the support of enough party delegates to ensure that she'll win the nomination in next month's Democratic Convention. Harris visited what had been a 'Biden For President' campaign office on Monday evening. It's now covered with 'Harris For President' signs. She travels to Wisconsin in just a few hours where she'll hold her first campaign rally. And we're already getting hints of how the former prosecutor plans to go after Donald Trump.

Certainly, a turning point in internal Palestinian relations, 14 factions coming together crucially among them, Hamas and Fatah, bitter rivals as they have been for years now, coming together to sign what is being described as a National Unity Agreement, essentially trying to ensure Palestinian control over the Gaza Strip in any sort of post-war governance structure that we might see, once and hopefully if the war in Gaza comes to an end. Now again, this is a significant in development. Fatah maintains significant control over the Palestinian authority in the Gaza Strip, that PA essentially lost control -- sorry, in the West Bank, the PA essentially lost control of the Gaza Strip back in 2007 following legislative elections just a year before when Hamas took control and since then there hasn't been a PA presence in the Gaza Strip. So this is a significant turning point.It's unclear at this stage what sort of role Hamas would play in any sort of post-war structure, unclear what role they would play in this agreement with Fatah, of course, maintaining majority control over the Palestinian Authority. But we have heard from delegate representatives of Hamas describing this as a turning point, saying that we are at a historic junction, our people and his words are rising up in their efforts to struggle. But as you can imagine, this has drawn criticism from some Israeli officials. We have heard from the Israeli foreign minister rejecting any sort of idea that Hamas would have a role in Gaza's post-war governance. We know that this is something that Israel is vehemently against, in fact Israeli officials have in the past suggested that there would be Israeli security control over the Gaza Strip in any sort of post-war governance. That has drawn backlash from members of the international community, including the United States, and there has been criticism from Israel now over the Palestinian Authority's decision to cooperate with Hamas in signing this deal. But certainly, a turning point in those internal relations. Clearly, a move towards trying to maintain Palestinian control over the Gaza Strip. And of course, we know that those discussions are ongoing. Continued calls for some sort of Palestine State to be established in any sort of notion of a two-state solution.

This is across Africa, Asia. This was a really big survey that CNN and Plan International did. What was interesting was what they said in terms of who is responsible for your own online safety. Now 67 percent, the vast majority said online safety is their own responsibility and actually only 11 percent think that tech companies are responsible. I found that slightly surprising. We also asked which platforms they are finding sort of the worst in terms of online harm, you'll see that Facebook has 72 percent -- Meta- owned Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram. CNN reached out to TikTok and Meta about the results of this survey, both pointed to all sorts of things they are doing already to try and reduce the harm for teenagers specifically, I think we had a direct comment from Meta as well saying they are working with experts like Plan International, the NGO which works on the survey, to try and reduce harm further.",
