      "sentences": "It is 8At this hour, we continue to follow developments inside Gaza as Israel now controls the key Rafah crossing with Egypt, as well as the ongoing diplomatic efforts to secure a ceasefire. We're going to more on that in just a moment. We do begin in that courthouse just behind me on the 15th floor with one of the most anticipated days of this trial well underway. Stormy Daniels, the woman at the center of Trump's criminal hush money trial, is now on the stand. In over two hours of testimony, she has gone into great detail about her meeting and alleged affair with Donald Trump in 2006, which he still denies. Now, she is laying out the specifics of the hush money deal when she was paid $130,000 to keep quiet paid by Trump's fixer, Michael Cohen, right before, and this is key, before the 2016 presidential election. Those payments are at the heart of these 34 felony charges of falsifying business records, those charges against Trump. Less than an hour ago, the judge denied a defense motion for a mistrial. The defense had argued that Stormy Daniels testimony went too far. Joining me now, Jessica Schneider, with the very latest from the courtroom. And, Jessica, some quite contentious moments in there, quite detailed testimony from Stormy Daniels and objections from the defense. Tell us what we heard.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, objections to the from the defense about just how detailed Stormy Daniels was getting. The judge actually warned her a few times to just stick to the questions that were asked and not really to expand upon it as she tended to do during her testimony. And what we've seen after Trump's defense team made that motion for mistrial around 2on the witness stand still being questioned by prosecutors, they have been moving things along a bit more. Her answers are a bit shorter, just sticking to the necessary details, if you will. And what Stormy Daniels has been talking about in the past hour or so is really the aftermath of this hush money deal, how in January 2018, \"The Wall Street Journal\" actually came out with a story about her affair with Donald Trump. And that's sort of opened the floodgates for, you know, the questions to come in, the media requests for Stormy Daniels. She issued a few denials, but she later said that those denials were actually false. She went on Jimmy Kimmel and then she said eventually she was released from her non-disclosure agreement that she had with the Trump team, and she was able to tell her story. She went on \"60 Minutes\" where she talked with our Anderson Cooper, told her story. She said that she also wrote a book and she said she wrote that book because she wants her daughter to really understand why she did the thing she did. And of course, now, just recently, she has a documentary deal that she wasn't paid for, but she says she's getting some of the licensing fees for. So now Stormy Daniels is really getting into more of the present day, how all of this has affected her, how it is shaped her. Again, Jim, you know, these aren't necessarily details that will go to the core of the prosecutions case, but they are really, as we've seen today, trying to get out Stormy Daniels story in full, maybe to make her an appealing witness to the jury, a credible witness to the jury, so the jury will believe everything that they've heard from Stormy Daniels today, including what we heard before the lunch break, which were perhaps the most detailed and lurid testimony that we've heard from any witness so far, just about the details of her sexual encounter with Donald Trump at that Lake Tahoe golf event, and in the fallout from it. So we will continue to follow along with what she says --",

So let's talk about the legal outcomes from today's testimony, Janet Johnson, criminal defense attorney, Joey Jackson, CNN legal analyst, former prosecutor, both joining us. Joey, first to you, the level of detail we heard this morning was clearly uncomfortable, not just for folks like us watching from outside, but for the judge himself and I understand that the prosecutors have to establish that this relationship is sexual relationship to place. In other words, there was an affair to be covered up by these payments. Do you believe that the questions from prosecutors and the answers from Stormy Daniels went too far in terms of the details?",

The reality is, is that its not about what I believe the prosecutors should have done. It's about what they felt was most appropriate here and what they felt that was most appropriate is to lay a firm foundation to establish that this indeed did occur. What's this? This being the dynamic of an interaction between her and Mr. Trump. He's denied it multiple times. I think either she has an incredibly, you know, imagination is just running wild or she's extraordinarily credible and she's recall -- you know, recalling everything down to the satin pajamas. And so, the reality is, is that prosecutors felt that she was important because she provides a face to why we're here. What was the impetus and motivation with respect to why there would have been a bribe here, not so much a bribe, but the issue in terms of falsifying records, the issue in terms of falsifying invoices, writing checks, ledgers, et cetera? Why? Because of the fact he wanted to cover this up. And the only way you do that, Jim, is to establish that it happened number one. Number two, that had happened in the manner in which he said and number three, that would have been so sensational that it would heat clearly wouldn't have wanted this out there. So, yes, there was a lot there I certainly do believe that defense should have moved for mistrial. They absolutely did. It was denied, but this is the manner in which they felt they should handle it. I would've perhaps potentially handled it a little differently, not been as vivid and colorful, but I don't think it rose to the level of mistrial. It's certainly will rise to the level of an appealable issue should Mr. Trump be convicted.",

She said that Trump was not concerned about it going public, was not then concerned about his family finding out, which is central to the defense's claim here that his true motivation for paying her off, in effect, was to protect his family as opposed to influence the election.How essential what was that testimony from her to the prosecution's case?

So I think you can go as far as you can go to your objected to.But to say that his wife, one of the things that he said to her is Melania and I don't even share a bedroom. So you don't have to worry about her and that he was not at all concerned about that relationship. And that's key because there was a famous trial of John Edwards, another presidential candidate, and he was acquitted. And essentially that defense was -- yeah, I wanted to pay her off because it was embarrassing to me -- to my family, but I didn't care about the elections. So they really do have to thread that needle that this happened right before the election. And as Mitt Romney said, you don't pay someone $130,000 because you did not have sex with them.",

They believed all along that success is dependent on keeping the pressure on.Also have to remember that Netanyahu's political career hangs in the balance. And there are a number of military commanders who have this battle right now, who will surely resign right afterwards when there are investigations as to how October 7th happened.

The key difference, of course, being the fact that Hamas is still pushing for this ceasefire agreement to explicitly call for and for Israel to agree to an end of the war, that withdrawal of all Israeli troops from the Gaza strip in the second phase of this agreement. Meanwhile, though the Israeli military carrying out this quite significant operation in Rafah, taking control of that Rafah border crossing, something that the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier today described as not only a military objective, but also an effort to apply further military pressure on these negotiations. And so these to your original question here, this military operation and these negotiations, they are happening on different tracks. But they're very much interconnected, at least as far as the Israeli government sees, that they believe that the increase military pressure on Hamas could perhaps shift Hamas's position.

I don't think anybody realistically thinks that Putin wants to start a nuclear war with the United States, I hope.But when it comes to tactical weapons, smaller ones, very powerful, that can be used in on the battlefield. That's something that there's a possibility that it could happen. So I think part of this is sending a message is no question about that. But there this is the possibility that let's say Russia were really at a state where it was losing the war, there are people who definitely believe that that is a possibility that Putin might do that. It wouldn't -- you know, it would be a place the West in a difficult situation because you would you have to answer that and nobody wants to answer it with nuclear weapons because then that could spin out of control. Obviously, the West, the United States, already have worked at game plans for what potentially could happen. But I think this is really -- you know, the phrase, of course, playing with fire.",

Cross-examination of the adult film actress Stormy Daniels remains underway. Her testimony, of course, central to the case against the former president, establishing that relationship existed and that therefore the president had incentive to hide it by paying her off.Katelyn Polantz joins me now. Katelyn, the cross-examination continues here. There have been some tense moments. I think we can say between the defense attorney and Stormy Daniels. Tell us what the defense is trying to establish now with their cross-examination.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Jim, what it appears to be doing, what Susan Necheles, the attorney for Donald Trump, as she's cross-examining Stormy Daniels, a very delicate moment on the stand. Susan Necheles is asking her about her financial history and motivation. That is what much of the day is about where the prosecutors are trying to use Stormy Daniels to show to the jury that Donald Trump had a motivation to hide something when he was sending her money through Michael Cohen years ago, when he was running for president.And now, the defense is trying to highlight Stormy Daniels own motivations here that in in many aspects, Stormy Daniels has made money from claiming to have had sex with Donald Trump over the past several years, that her story had value, especially once he was running for president. And since then, as Stormy Daniels has said, she is now very unhappy with him and wants him to have some sort of fallout here. So, Jim, all of this is coming together in this defense across examination, but much of it will be subtle suggestions that the defense team is making things where Stormy Daniels is being asked about hiding assets and then denying that she has tried to do that on the stand. But those are the sorts of things that the defense is able to try and suggest, or have the jury think about as they continue to ask her questions about what has happened since her story was buried and then became public about her alleged affair with Donald Trump.",

Janet, the testimony from Stormy Daniels clearly consequential to this case, gets at what essential here. There was an affair, an alleged affair and that that was what Trump prosecutors argue had the intent to cover up with this payment during the election in 2016? Now, the defense is trying to poke holes in her credibility and, Janet, I wonder if you think they're having some success.",

I mean, just from what I'm following along, what's happening in the courtroom.They've already gotten two things that the judge will tell the jury at the end of the trial that they can consider and weighing her credibility. One is a bias against Donald Trump. They actually got Stormy Daniels to say she hates him, and she hopes he goes to prison. I mean, it doesn't really get more biased than that. And that is one of the things that can basically undermine your credibility. The other is prior inconsistent statements. And as we discussed in an earlier segment, there's a lot of them. She denied having sex. She apparently initially told Gloria Allred that there wasn't sex. There's also the motivation for the money and they're basically telling the jury she's made a lot of money by claiming -- because they're saying it's just a claim to have had sex with Donald Trump. She did push back and she did say it's also cost me a lot of money, but it's been very effective and I don't think they're treating her with kid gloves at all.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Jim, so that's the whole essence of redirect, right? As you want to rehabilitate your witness.And I think that there are clear issues with respect to the rehabilitation, like what, did you have a relationship with Donald Trump? Yes. Was there an affair? Yes. Was that on the dates that were noted by you? Yes. Does the hatred that you might have for him impair the realities here of what took place between you and him? No. Was there a time that you got a payoff from Donald Trump? Yes. Was that orchestrated by Michael Cohen? Yes. What am I getting at? I'm getting at that we can talk all day and all night about hatred. We could talk all day and all night about inconsistent statement, but the realities are is that doesn't or should not otherwise undermine the realities and the facts. And that's what prosecutors will do. They will ask the jurors to keep their eye on the prize, the prize of there being an affair between the two, the prize of there being a payoff between the two. The reality that that was to otherwise influence the election, why would Mr. Trump spent so much money to hide this if there was not some teeth to it? And again, those are all jury questions but the reality is, is that's the focus of the prosecution that notwithstanding credibility, notwithstanding what you say to her, notwithstanding not the kid gloves, keep your eye on the prize. Did it happen? And the jury will have to make those decisions. Ultimately, jury to decide who and what they find more credible. Janet, I -- Stormy Daniels, I think you can call a star witness of this -- of this case here for the prosecution. Given that she is on the stand today, and I think somewhat earlier than some had expected, are we closer to the end of the prosecutions case than perhaps we expected? Specifically given the prosecution said just yesterday they needed a couple more weeks?",

      "sentences": "Well, I think Michael Cohen is going to take quite a lot of time and obviously he's really the pivotal witness. But I want to piggyback also on something that Joe we just said. He's correct. They will rehabilitate her, but as far as the places where they can't rehabilitate her, I think that the prosecution can also embrace this in closing and say, which is what prosecutors always say, we didn't pick Stormy Daniels. You know who picked her? Donald Trump.And if you find her unsavory, that's the kind of company Donald Trump was keeping. Same with Michael Cohen. If you find him unsavory, he was the lawyer hired by Donald Trump. So if there are pitfalls, I think they can turn around and turn those on the defense. But as far as the trial going faster, I think it is, but I think Cohen could be two or three solid days of testimony. I think that's going to be very extensive cross-examination based on what we're seeing today. They're going to have a lot of questions. There's a lot of interviews, there's a lot of books written by all these witnesses. It's going to take awhile.",
