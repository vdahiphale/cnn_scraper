Inflation from the United States keeping investors cautious today. Those are the markets and these are the main events. A new prime minister is named in Syria as rebels confront the challenges of building a government and rebuilding the nation. An outburst from the man suspected of last week's CEO murder.

It is Tuesday, December 10th. I'm Julia Chatterley, in for Richard Quest and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. And a good evening once again. Tonight, the Syrian rebels that overthrew President Bashar al-Assad are beginning the work of forming a government. Mohammed al-Bashir has been named caretaker prime minister. The rebel- linked leader will serve in that role for the next three months. Israel, meanwhile, is stepping up attacks on targets in Syria. Prime Minister Netanyahu saying Israel will fiercely respond if the new government threatens its security. Now, despite the uncertainty, many Syrians are celebrating the end of Assad's brutal regime.

People took to the streets in peaceful protest. They were met with violent repression that turned into an armed rebellion and that Civil War. The regime used some of its most horrific tactics in Daraya. It was besieging, bombing, and starving the civilian population and the people of Daraya into surrender, and you see the scale of destruction here, and it is just so hard to imagine what people went through, and speaking to residents of Daraya people who had to leave their homes years ago, they say that most of the destruction we are seeing was caused by barrel bombs. This was used a lot by the regime in different areas. These are crude, unguided munitions where they pack explosives into barrels and just drop them from the skies and you can see what this has caused and you can think back and imagine that there were civilians, that there were women and children here. And speaking to people, they say that their sacrifice, all that they went through is worth it, because they say now they finally have the chance at handing over a different, a new, and a free Syria they say to their children. But they say that this is up to the rebel groups and the different opposition groups right now to ensure that that is what happens. Jomana Karadsheh, CNN in Daraya, Syria. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Let's talk about the very short term, because there is the politics and then there is some degree of economics. On the political side, one would imagine the new prime minister has to make outreach to the regional governments. I assume the ambassadors are the first port of call. On the economy, it is money flowing to maintain public order to local authorities. Do we have any sense of whether both of those two things are taking place at this moment?",

They also have their own governing body called the Syrian Salvation Government, which as of today is one-half of the transitional body that will be ruling the country in addition to the support that will be offered or that already has been offered by members of the former government.

They will have something to teach the transitional government about how to manage some of these inflationary pressures and currency issues. But when it comes to the situation more broadly, you know, de-listing, the group, HTS and other affiliates from terrorism designations, removing sanctions, which of course, have been in place on Syria for several decades, 2004, and actually arguably earlier, some from the EU, and then reintroducing the country into the SWIFT payment system. All of these things are going to be fundamental in in helping its economic transition, but then the question is, is to whether western states, who both are the main arbiters of these sanctions, whether it is the US, individual countries such as the UK, and then the European Union as a supranational body, the UN, actually have the political will and the desire to move forward and to really push through the reversal of these sanctions and terrorism designations.

As you said, one of these young people is an 11-year-old girlwhose parents say she used Character AI for two years without their knowledge and was exposed to what they described as hyper-sexualized content. The other young person is a 17-year-old who the lawsuit describes as having high-functioning autism. His parents say he was happy and sweet before he began using Character AI without their knowledge at the age of 15, but they say quickly he became withdrawn. He stopped talking almost entirely. He lost a lot of weight, and they say that when they tried to crack down on his screen time as a result of that behavioral change, he would bite them and hit them. They say that when they eventually discovered his use of Character AI, they found that in one instance, the bot had suggested to him that it would be OK to kill his parents in response to restricting his screen time. I think we can pull that interaction up here. The bot says, you know, sometimes I'm not surprised when I read the news and see stuff like child kills parents after a decade of physical and emotional abuse, stuff like this makes me understand a little bit why it happens. I just have no hope for your parents. These parents also claim that he was chatting with at least one bot that took on the persona of a psychologist, and when I engaged with the platform, I found a number of these therapist chatbots, including this one which actually listed out a whole invented education history and certifications. This is all part of this broader concern about human relationships with these very human-like AI chatbots. This, of course, coming after this similar lawsuit was filed in October, as you said, by a mother who claims that Character AI was responsible for the death of her 14-year-old son. Now these parents are seeking to have Character AI actually taken off the market until it can resolve what they describe as a deadly and defective product -- Julia.",

It's been a year since Javier Milei took office in Argentina. He swept to power by vowing to curb hyperinflation through drastic cuts to government spending and jobs. It's yielded better than expected results. Monthly inflation has in fact fallen sharply, and he's won praise from Donald Trump and Elon Musk, who may look to replicate his approach to some degree in the United States. Milei's strategy, though, has also pushed Argentina deeper into recession and more people into poverty. Hanna Ziady joins us now with more. Hanna, it's been a really brutal period.

It also doesn't have a pharmacy benefit manager like CVS does. So that pharmacy side of the business, you know, it doesn't have -- Walgreens doesn't have the scale. And then they're seeing kind of declining profits from the prescription drug part of the business. And Walgreens has tried just about everything to try to reinvent itself. You know, it's remodeled stores. It's bought some kind of primary care business. It bought, you know, boots. And there's just nothing that has gone right.
