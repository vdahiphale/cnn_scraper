That relationship is built on the foundations set in place by Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger. Henry Kissinger loved the lime light.

Blinken meeting with a number of senior Israeli leaders today, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, to discuss, among other things, not only the ongoing negotiations over the release of hostages still held by Hamas inside Gaza, but the need to try to extend this fragile truce now in its seventh day for as long as possible.This truce agreed to one more day, one more extension, just in the final moments before it expired last night under the same terms that we have seen for the past week, 24 hours of a pause in fighting in exchange for every 10 living hostages released by Hamas. This comes as Israeli negotiators believe that there are still 245 hostages still held by Hamas inside Gaza, with just enough women and children hostages remaining to allow for perhaps one or two more days of a truce at best before the discussions have to turn necessarily to the potential release of Israeli civilian men and even Israeli soldiers. Obviously, a much more difficult discussion, a much more difficult proposition, and so I think at this point there's a looming sense that it's a question of not if the fighting will resume, but when.

Sources are telling CNN one solution that's being put on the table is saying, look, have the residents move back to the north.An area, by the way, that was evacuated at the beginning of the war, because Israel said they were going to have heavy military operations there. If you look on the map there, all of that red that you see up there marks damage in Gaza. Most of it you see is there in the north, huge swaths of damage. So, that leaves it basically uninhabitable in many, many places. As much as 50 percent of all structures in the north are said to be damaged. CNN's M.J. Lee brings us this reporting from the White House. M.J., is Israel being receptive at all to this idea of sending people back to the north while they do operations in the south? M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Sara, what we know is that those discussions are very active right now between U.S. and Israeli officials really just about what the military operations by Israel would look like once this truce ends. President Biden and his top aides have been stressing to their Israeli counterparts that what they do not want to see once the war picks back up again is the kind of sort of massive air campaign that we saw in Northern Gaza to be directed in Southern Gaza. Now, one of the ideas, we are told, that is being deliberated is this idea you mentioned of the civilians that had initially fled south eventually moving back up north once military operations have concluded there. But as you noted and as you showed on that map, this would be a very significant undertaking given just the reality that so much of Northern Gaza has been completely decimated and this is a big part of the reason why we are seeing U.S. officials talk so much about the importance of surging that humanitarian aid not just generally into Gaza but specifically to Northern Gaza. Now Israel has, of course, made clear that they are not done in northern Gaza but that they will eventually turn its focus to Southern Gaza. And one of the reasons, we are told, is that there is intelligence that shows that Hamas leadership had fled south.",
