Protests against the war in Gaza, the IDF activities in Gaza are up. Universities are cracking down. Many schools bringing in law enforcement officials to curb the demonstrations, which the students insist are peaceful, though as a factual matter they have at times been disruptive. Some have been anti-Semitic.CNN's Ed Lavandera is watching all of this unfold on one particular campus, University of Texas, Austin, where Texas State Police moved in on protesters earlier and made some arrests. Ed, what is the latest there now?",

      "sentences": "Hey Jake, well the camp just moments ago has essentially been cleared out of all of the protesters. I'll let our photographer kind of step in here through the crowd and kind of get a shot of what is left. There were dozens of protesters inside this circle that has been cordoned off by state troopers, UT police, as well as Austin police.And over the last two hours, Jake, we have seen several dozen people taken into custody. We don't have an exact number on the amount of people who have been arrested, but UT officials in a statement saying a short while ago that over the weekend, they started receiving threats from the group, which they did not specify, that was organizing the protests here on the UT campus. They also said that they believe that the majority of the people who have been taken into custody here at this protest are not students. But regardless, it has garnered and created a great deal of attention here on the campus, on the South Mall of the University of Texas campus, where now that the protesters have been cleared out of what they had described as a camp-liberated zone. Now the question becomes, what do the officers do now? Because there's a relatively large group of people who have been supporting the protesters, encircling the officers who were encircling the encampment. So, the question now becomes, what happens to this particular area? How do they clear out everyone else who is still here? University officials have made clear over the last week that they were not going to tolerate anybody trying to set up a campsite inside this area. So, if you look inside that camp area, you see a number of tents, and many of the protesters were able to set up camp areas or tents. And once university officials say they saw that, that's when they called in law enforcement, because as they said, they were not going to tolerate any kind of long-term encampment here. Many of the protesters here believe that the protesters who were here, were doing it peacefully, simply sitting on the grass on this lawn, and didn't deserve to be arrested. But that is the tension that we're seeing unfold here, and have seen unfold here this afternoon for several hours now, Jake.",

On Friday, the president of Columbia, Minouche Shafik, released a statement that said in part, quote, \"We have our demands, they have theirs.\" And I heard from other folks in the world of university authorities that were surprised by that statement.

We're all in favor of free speech until somebody says something we don't like. My personal conviction is the best way to fight a bad idea is with a better idea. And the best way to overcome bad speech is more speech. So, I stand as a free speech absolutist.But I certainly agree with you that calls to violence and incitement, there has to be a line. And she gets paid the big bucks to find out where that line is. And I'm going to defer to the lawyers and the experts on helping her back that up. My role as a negotiation, from the negotiation perspective, is how is she going to get out of this very difficult problem. And what she needs to do is find who are the key stakeholders. And let's not lose sight of these are very high stakes. There are many millions of dollars riding on these decisions. Donations from alumni, the economic impact of USC canceling their graduation, airfare, hotels, restaurants. These are very significant financial costs. And any negotiation analysis has to include both the institutional cost as well as the personal cost. Let's not lose sight of the fact that in 1968, a former president of Columbia, Grayson Kirk, lost his job because he called the police onto campus to deal with demonstrators. In that case, it was against the Vietnam War. So, there's a very rich legacy here, and this is all on her shoulders.",

So it gives the Biden campaign a roadmap. I think there are a couple of things here. One, to Alex's point, obviously, this is not a simple issue. This is not one where, you know, an immediate pivot one way or the other is going to change hearts and minds. This is an issue on which there are incredibly passionate emotional feelings on both sides. But let's think about what the alternative to Joe Biden is, right?The alternative to Joe Biden in this race is Donald Trump, who is saying things like, the IDF should go in and finish the problem in Gaza. So if you're a young person who is motivated by this issue, then you can look at what Joe Biden is doing. You can look at the alternative in Donald Trump. You can look at the alternative of not voting, but in many ways, that's effectively a vote for Donald Trump. And so I think the Biden campaign has to really make that case. But remember, there are also numerous other issues that are going to be on people's minds, including on young people's minds, like abortion, for example.

And in that range, Trump was leading that ballot 62 to 30 nationally. That's a really tough place to climb out of for incumbent president. And if it's a roadmap, they got to get to work quickly.",

Vitel'Homme Innocent is wanted by Haitian police for rape, for murder, for kidnapping, for ransom, and more crimes. And yet Innocent, that's his name, declares the lawless Haitian gangs who have been running the country into the ground over the last two months. They are the actually -- they are actually the ones who are liberating Haiti. CNN's David Culver spoke with this Haitian gang leader in Haiti and just returned to the U.S. David, to start, why interview a gang leader and why someone like Vitel'Homme Innocent?",

And it's always different, even over the course of just the past few months. But even on this show, we have shared the destruction that's been caused by the gangs, the many deaths. We've interviewed the victims who have, many of them lost loved ones, they've been raped, they've been forced from their homes.To answer your question, then why speak to a gang leader? One thing, like it or not, you cannot deny, is that the power right now rests in the hands of these gangs. That's where the power dynamic is so important and crucial to look at. And if you see just at what even the U.N. estimates, in the Port-au-Prince alone, more than 80 percent of the capital city is controlled by gangs. So Vitel'Homme Innocent, that's the man who we decided to reach out to. And the reason we did is because of a few things. One is the territory that he controls. It's vast and it's strategic. It includes the U.S. embassy. Also, he's said to have the largest number of gang members. Those numbers are constantly fluctuating, but as of our meeting with him, he seems to have a strong number. And lastly, he's also one who has really not sought the limelight. He's kept rather quiet in recent years. And so we wanted to know what his motivations were, what his life is like as he's making these very rash decisions at times, and also what can be seen as very aggressive moves. And we got a sense of just his environment touring his territory. Take a look.

He's incredibly intelligent, and yet he's saying that he wants dialogue and a seat at the table for deciding Haiti's future.Now, when you look at the range of atrocities that gangs are accused of having committed, and we've met many of the victims of that, it's tough to see how they're going to be given that seat at the table. That said, given that they hold the power, it may be the only thing that through, at least in conversation with folks who are at the decision making level, would bring some sort of healing to Haiti. All in all, though, it's going to probably, you know, end up with them trying to get some sort of amnesty, which it does not seem realistic when you talk to some of the politicians who are looking to take more control in Haiti because they feel like that would just empower these gangs even more. So, it's a very dicey situation, but one that's directly related to this country, Jake. And I'm constantly reminding folks of that. I mean, a few days before went into Haiti for this most recent trip, I was down at the U.S. southern border and met several groups from Haiti fleeing that crisis, trying to enter the U.S. It just shows you how interconnected all of this is.",

One of those was used to reimburse Stormy Daniels, of course, at the heart of this trust Trump hush money trial, he also was helped Michael Cohen get that home equity line of credit in order to make that reimbursement.So listen, this is a very document heavy witness. And prosecutors even said this is going to be a document heavy case, right? Because at the heart of it, Trump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records, so that's what we're starting to get into. The key here, though, is that it's important for jurors to hear this, to hear these paper trails, because it's going to lay the groundwork for these witnesses that you just mentioned that are coming up in these trials, these big sort of blockbuster witnesses, so that when prosecutors present their case, jurors can say, oh, yes, I heard that before with that witness prior. So that's what we're starting to see this week. But certainly it's going to be a busy next couple of weeks as this trial really is just getting started.",
