And local leaders expect the death toll is going to rise as crews conduct more welfare checks. CNN's Miguel Marquez joins us from Western New York. Miguel, you are surrounded by snow.

So, they are going through methodically street by street, going through cars, going through homes, where people have not been heard from, trying to figure out if there are any others out there. Today, the death toll went up by three. But then they reduced it by two because two that had died earlier on were deemed to be dead from natural causes. But they are continuing to search throughout the city to figure out if there are more people who may be buried in some of these very, very large snow drifts. You know they got about over 50 inches in this storm alone. They've had about 100 inches this year so far. And there's just a massive amount of snow -- amount of snow that we're trying to get into.

He's only spoken to the conservative press in the wake of this scandal.But truly, no, he has not really detailed the why. I think he's sort of maybe leaving an opening to say that this was sort of the family history that was told to him. That seems to be what he's suggesting to give him an opening to say that he didn't actually lie here. But you know, Sara, this just not -- does not make a whole lot of sense.

Look, he has repeatedly lied to the people that elected him to serve in Congress. And if so, how can he be trusted to be a member of Congress? How can he be sworn in and trusted with national security issues and issues that are so critical to our country? Those are valid questions.Sara, says he's not a fraud. Look at the definition of fraud. A person who knowingly deceives others by over-inflating their accomplishments and their qualities. That's what he's done time and time again. And in my view, it's up to the people of his district what happens. But I think it's going to be extremely impossible to trust him as a member of Congress given these repeated lies. And look, he says he wants to be seated in Congress. He says that he wants to serve the people of this district. Well, I would highly recommend that the real George Santos stand up, run again in two years on his real record, his real name, his real accomplishments, and not this Leonardo DiCaprio starring as Catch Me If You Can character who no one really knows exactly who he is and what he stands for.",
