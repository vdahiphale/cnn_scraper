The grand jury approved every indictment presented by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis on Monday.The former U.S. president has been charged with 13 counts in the indictment, including a racketeering charge. 18 others have also been charged under the state's racketeering laws for allegedly joining \"a conspiracy to unlawfully change the outcome in favor of Donald Trump.\" Now those names include several high-profile individuals from Trump's time in office, including former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, former Trump attorneys Rudy Giuliani and John Eastman and top Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark, among others.

The defendant here is the Hawaiian Electric Company and subsidiaries spokesperson told CNN specific to a formal power shut off program we like most utilities do not have one.

We hear Donald Trump actually making, putting the pressure, twisting the arm of Brad Raffensperger, who is the chief elections official in Georgia, looking for nearly 12,000 extra votes, if you can find them, that kind of thing.And the nature of the indictment will open some opportunities for the Trump legal team, I think. Because it is a racketeering indictment and, in the United States, often these were devised to go after the Mafia. The American organized crime syndicates. Ironically, earlier in my career, way back when, I actually covered a very large racketeering case against the Lucchese family which was brought, in part, by Rudy Giuliani, who was then the U.S. attorney, and whose earlier career involved prosecuting the Mafia, so he knows Rico, the statue that is behind the racketeering charges, very well. It is a very complicated thing, you have to create a very sophisticated case that involves conspiracy, knowing, malfeasance, and then the actual crimes themselves. The Trump legal strategy, from what we can tell, will be to deny that he ever thought he lost the election. He always believed that he actually did win and that it was stolen from him. So in some ways there is a very high bar on this. Having said that, going back to the political aspect, I think it is a tough sell for the American public that Donald Trump was not trying to influence the outcome of the election, given the recorded tape that everyone has heard at this point.",

So unfortunately, in a political sphere, an indictment like this will become a political football. The people who don't want to hear that tape ever again or believe, for some reason, it was doctored or whatever, or it was perfect, as Donald Trump likes to characterize it, will believe that. The numbers in the United States suggest that that continues to be 40 to 45 percent of the Republican Party, but that does not, in any way, represent a majority of the United States. In fact, his loss in the 2020 election reflects the fact that, while he has a lock on the base, the conservative and right-wing base of the Republican Party, he does not win the independent vote and he does not win Democrats, obviously. So that is his great challenge, I think this, of all of the four indictments, is definitely the one that creates the greatest problems for him because it puts, once again, out in front of people, this really stunning arm twisting, political, it's not my place to say it is corruption, but it smells of corruption when you listen to that tape.",

The Taliban swept to power after the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan following its 20-year war. Handing back control to the same group of Islamic extremists who ruled in the 1990s. While the Taliban promised to be more moderate and honor women's rights within Islamic law, the past two years have brought only a hard line stance towards women. The closure of secondary schools for girls, the forced implementation of the burqa, the restriction on travel without a male chaperone, the banning of women from universities and working at NGOs, including the United Nations. And, just last month, the Taliban closed all beauty salons that employed roughly 60,000 women, many of them the sole breadwinners of their homes. MAHBOUBA SERAJ, AFGHAN WOMEN'S RIGHTS ACTIVIST: Women's freedom doesn't exist. There is no such thing as women's freedom anymore. COREN (voice-over): women's rights activist Mahbouba Seraj, who stayed in Kabul while more than a million Afghans fled, says the Taliban government is erasing women from society. Seraj: Even the rights that we had in Islam, even the rights that we had in Sharia, we are losing all of that. So if it's not annihilation, what is it? COREN (voice-over): For Zahra, an aspiring designer, it is very clear what the Taliban demands of her.",

And this is your life, this is what women are made for.COREN (voice-over): While the international community repudiates the Taliban's treatment of women and girls, the Taliban is refusing to listen, saying it will not be pressured. BILAL KARIMI, TALIBAN DEPUTY SPOKESPERSON (through translator): Afghanistan was freed from occupation. Afghans were able to regain their country, freedom, government, and will. The only way to solve the problem is understanding and dialogue, pressure and force are not logical. COREN (voice-over): But human rights activists fear that international condemnation is waning and that the Taliban, desperate for international recognition, is gradually being normalized. HEATHER BARR, ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR, WOMEN'S RIGHTS DIVISION, HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH: They are posing in photographs with smiling diplomats. They're getting on private jets to fly off to important, high-level meetings where people roll out red carpets for them. They are being permitted to take control of embassies in a growing number of countries. So I think, you know, from their perspective it is going pretty well. COREN (voice-over): A terrifying assessment for the women of this country. Protests have all but disappeared, apart from a small group who face the threat of arrest as they try to get the world's attention. For most, they suffer in silence. Convinced that the world no longer cares.",
