And the reason for that, Anderson, is because this is an issue that her campaign officials believe, reproductive freedoms, in particular is one that will galvanize voters to the polls. [20:05:10]   They saw it in 2022 and they expect to see it again, particularly again with women. So when in the former president makes remarks like this, they are happy to seize on it and recently, we've seen the campaign deploy a strategy of rapidly responding to the former president especially when he makes comments like this. So, certainly here in Las Vegas, we are anticipating that the vice president is going to mention it again, and continue to do so over the next several days.

They are crucial, of course, in a state like Nevada and also in Arizona. But in Nevada, the vice president is pretty evenly split with former President Donald Trump in the polls among Latinos. She is trying to gain an edge here, especially a day before early in-person voting ends, that ends tomorrow. Mail-in ballots will continue and then in- person voting will commence again on Tuesday. But the timing here is no coincidence. Jennifer Lopez in particular has been very outspoken since the former president's rally. So we may hear more from her today on that but certainly this stop here as much as she has been trying to appeal to women by criticizing the former president's comments.

The majority of women in this country not want that to happen. Number two, more than a dozen women have accused him of sexually assaulting them in some way. I'm sure they did not want that to happen. Number three, he said that because he was a powerful man, he could grab women by the pussy, excuse my French, and that they probably wouldn't care. And number four, he was convicted of sexual assault of E. Jean Carroll. And is going to owe her millions of dollars.

You're voting for your candidate, or are you voting against your candidate? Lot of Democrats early in this campaign were saying they were voting against Trump more than they were voting even for President Biden when he was the candidate. Look, the Trump base is for Trump, we've known that since 2016. You see those high numbers, but this is interesting. These are better numbers for the vice president that we have seen in other battleground states. Essentially 70 percent or more than two-thirds of her supporters say it's about for her not a vote against Trump. Now why is that? North Carolina and Georgia have two of the largest Black voting populations. That is the Democratic base. They were energized by the switch to Kamala Harris.

I would just point something out and one of the reasons that we're optimistic is let's say your poll, our poll we think our race is 48-47; 47-47. That's not a hundred percent of the vote. So the question is, the people who have not yet decided who to vote for, who are actually going to vote. In our census in the last week, the people who made up their mind last week, we're doing quite well with and we like the people who've yet to make a decision in terms of who they look like from a data perspective and what they saw of report in terms of who they're more likely to vote for. So that's important. In the early vote that we're seeing so far, we are on pace in all seven states to reach the number we think we need combined with election day turnout but it's very important to look at who those undecideds are. Obviously, a campaign like ours has a lot of sophisticated data. We look at its every day. We do quantitative research, qualitative research.

He gets briefed that he has real trouble with women voters. We saw this in '20, we're seeing it now.

We also do a lot of qualitative research. We're listening to these undecided voters every hour of every day. And the Madison Square Garden thing really broke through because what I've learned in politics is when something is consistent with what people think about you, they think that he's about chaos and division. So, that doubles down.   The other thing we are picking up on CNN and I spent some time on this in some of our discussions with undecided voters, this notion that not notion, Trump said he's going to put RFK, Jr. in charge of all the health care in the country. That greatly worries this few percent of voters who haven't yet decided to vote. A, because they don't think RFK should be in charge of our health care. But a driving part of this race, Anderson is people are concerned that all the people that tried to check Trump last time are now speaking out against him, warning the country that it would be dangerous and he's going to be surrounded by the RFKs of the world and that very much concerns these voters who are still making their decision in these closing days.",
