The striking scenes of January 6th, four years apart.Also tonight, a former member of the January 6th congressional committee will join me. Would he take a preemptive pardon from President Biden? And how will Democrats respond, when Republicans control everything here? And after Canada's Prime Minister announced plans to step down, President-elect Trump needled the neighbor to the north. Make Canada the 51st state? I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. We're live in Washington, this evening, and you're looking at the United States Capitol tonight, where the most stunning political comeback, in modern American history, has now been certified by Congress, paving the way for Donald Trump to take back power, exactly two weeks from now. It's an inauguration that many, including Republicans, felt was unthinkable, on the January 6th, four years ago. That's when this Capitol that you're looking at, on a snowy day, was a crime scene, under attack by a mob of Trump supporters. Contrast today, with the sitting President in January 2021, publicly berating his own vice president, who was later rushed into hiding by the Secret Service, while rioters were threatening to hang him. And U.S. Capitol Police who had their guns drawn, as rioters were trying to break into the House chamber. Members of Congress, nearby, crouching in fear for their lives. Those images are nearly the complete opposite of what we witnessed today. The person who lost the presidential election, this time, Vice President Harris, certified her own loss without any objections. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS (D), U.S. VICE PRESIDENT: Donald J. Trump of the State of Florida has received 312 votes. Kamala D. Harris-- (CHEERING) (APPLAUSE)",

But how did you feel, watching today play out? REP. PETE AGUILAR (D-CA): It's very personal. And there's a lot of emotions, for many of us, who were on the House floor that day. I not only served on the January 6 committee with Jamie Raskin, but I stood right behind him on the House floor when all of this happened, which, by the way, was a couple days after he'd buried his son. So, I think a lot of us just have reflections and thoughts about that day, and how it transpired, and how unfortunate it is. But the American public saw that today, how normal it should be.

And he pushed back strongly against that, saying, he's not going to roll that back. In other words, leaving open the option that he's going to tariff every country, every goods, or at least not just critical goods. And the point here is, Well, this is going to A, trigger a trade war. The Canadians have been very clear that they'll retaliate. They did last time. They targeted things like bourbon, to put pressure on Mitch McConnell. They will -- they will retaliate here. Tariffs are also, of course, a tax paid by the importer. So, Trump's tariffs are paid by American companies. They're absorbed a little bit by the companies that are selling them in other countries. But then reciprocal ones, the Canadians are even reportedly looking at tariffing oil on the way out, if Trump exempts it, in other words, making it so Americans pay more at the pump, even if Trump tries not to make that the case.

But slowly, over time, Matt Gaetz, Marjorie Taylor Greene, others, gave them a little bit more credibility. And now, they feel like they're truly stepping into power. I mean, I went to the home, where they had a poster of this logo of Ashli Babbitt, when she been killed, with a red drop of blood on her neck.

And they also feel that they'll be able to pressure the Trump administration to enact that. O'SULLIVAN: And there's a ton of organizations set up, over the past few years, just to support the J6ers and their families. I mean, I was down at the jail, a few weeks ago, and somebody had called in from one of these organizations. Many of which are, by the way, are raising hundreds of thousands of dollars.
