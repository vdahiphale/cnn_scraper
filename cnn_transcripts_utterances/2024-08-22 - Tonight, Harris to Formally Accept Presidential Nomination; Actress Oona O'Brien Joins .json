Her there, marrying those couples, then began that movement that spread through California, went to the courts, spread across the country, that ended up, of course, with same sex marriage legalized in the United States. But that's the kind of person she was. She was doing it at a time when it wasn't popular, not even in our own party. But she's got character and she's got conviction and she's always been a huge supporter of our community.

I know that he went to the Harris campaign and sort of shopped around an endorsement over there too in exchange for something.What's your reaction to all this and could this be a problem for the Harris campaign?

Kennedy's little support he has will splinter off.We're about consolidating and building a better big tent for America. We're bringing in undecided voters every single day.

And I remember the first time I voted. I mean, it was like -- it felt like such an honor to walk into the polling location and go in the booth and flip that switch. But, Oona, let me ask you this. I mean, did you pick up on, as the kids call it, the vibe shift in this race when Joe Biden announced he was going to step aside and Kamala Harris decided to step in?
