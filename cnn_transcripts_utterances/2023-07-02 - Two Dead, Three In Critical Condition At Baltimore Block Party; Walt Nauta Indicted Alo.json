The first is that the police have told us they are looking for more than one shooter. They believe there were at least two people involved in last night's shooting, and they say that they have not ruled out that more people have -- were involved in the violence last night.Now the second piece of information that we've learned is that those injuries, 28 people suffering gunshot wounds, two people were killed, an 18-year-old woman and a 20-year-old man. So you can just imagine the amount of chaos that was unfolding here last night as gunshots rang out. Now we are in the Brooklyn homes section of Baltimore and people were gathered here to celebrate the holiday weekend, just like so many other communities across the country are doing right now. They had gathered to celebrate. There were families, even children here. And police say it was shortly after midnight that gunshots rang out. We spoke to people here who said they ran for cover and it was absolute mayhem as they tried to take shelter. Now the mayor and local police officials were here earlier asking this community to step up, to come forward, and share any information they might have that may help police find the people that were behind last night's shooting. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR BRANDON M. SCOTT, BALTIMORE: We are asking again that anyone that knows anything about this mass shooting, and that's what I wanted to call it, it's a mass shooting. We want this shooting to be treated just as it happened in rural America. We want everyone to come forward and say, treat this as if it was your daughter, your son, your brother, your cousin that was out here shot at this event. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And it came on the evening news and the phone rang and where we lived, we always kept our front door open. We lived in a neighborhood, you know, that we all kind of knew each other, and so it was very safe back then. And my dad said, \"The phone is ringing. Go grab it,\" you know? And I ran in and it was Alan Walden and he said, \"Hey, this is Alan Walden. Have you heard about what happened with Skynyrd?\" And I looked up at the TV and it was on the TV and I hollered for my dad. And after that, you kind of go blank. You know when things bad happen, you know, I think your mind has a way of just kind of making it fuzzy. A very long night; very sad night. Days after was very sad, and you know, just unbelievable.

The Fed's preferred inflation gauge cooled last month, hitting its lowest level in more than two years and the US economy also grew faster than estimates expanding at an annual pace of two percent in the first quarter. The job market is still resilient with unemployment claims recording the biggest drop in 20 months despite all this optimistic news.

Police say at least two suspects opened fire and shot at least 30 people. Nearly half of them children. Two people died including a teenager. The mayor is calling it an unspeakable tragedy, and it's not known whether it was a targeted attack. Meantime, major flash flooding wreaking havoc in Chicago. Floodwaters stranding people in their cars and temporarily shutting down major expressways. It comes after torrential rains swamped the city this morning. The National Weather Service calling it Chicago's heaviest rain event in over 40 years. And on the lighter side, are you willing to shell out $70.00 for your must-have condiment? Normally, sriracha sauce sells for about $5.00, but a shortage of raw materials has prices soaring. In some cases it's $70.00 a bottle. One person on Amazon was selling two bottles for $124.00. The company behind the fan favorite sauce has been dealing with a shortage of chili peppers for three years. The company says it's not sure when that shortage might end.
