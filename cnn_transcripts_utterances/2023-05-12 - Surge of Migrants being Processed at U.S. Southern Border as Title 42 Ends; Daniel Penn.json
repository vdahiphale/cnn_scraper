Tens of thousands of migrants have been waiting near the border for this very moment as the clock ran out on the immigration rule. Overnight, a judge blocked the Biden administration from quickly releasing migrants without giving them a court date, and U.S. officials are raising the alarm that it will lead to dangerous overcrowding at border facilities. We are live on both sides of the southern border at the same border gate. Rosa Flores, you'll see there in El Paso, and our David Culver is on the other side of that wall in Juarez, Mexico.

What he is mentioning are the individuals who are just behind the border wall that you see behind me. And according to the Border Patrol chief, within 48 hours there is about 2,500 migrants, and yesterday afternoon he was here. He spoke to the media about how about 1,500 of those had been processed and that about 1,000 were remaining. And if you remember those -- that video that David Culver was just showing us moments ago, that's exactly what the Border Patrol chief had explained, that in the next 24 hours that they were planning on processing all of those individuals as quickly as they could and that they were going to prioritize families to make sure that those individuals were processed first, vetted first. I can tell you it gets very cold here overnight. That was one of the reasons they wanted to prioritize families and vulnerable individuals.Now, Secretary Mayorkas just telling our own Phil Mattingly that individual are arriving, migrants are arriving. They are being vetted under Title 8. That's the decades-old protocol, and that the Biden administration has been preparing for this moment for a very long time and that they are focusing on implementing policies that have legal consequences and built-in legal consequences, but also that they have legal pathways for migrants to come into the United States. Now, one of the policies that has been most criticized is the ban on asylum for individuals who cross over countries and don't seek protections in those countries. And Poppy and Phil, I should mention the ACLU overnight filed a lawsuit challenging the Biden administration, saying that that's very dangerous for migrants because a lot of them would be likely deported or removed immediately under Title 8.",
