He had faced, as well as his co-defendants, a list of charges, including conspiracy. And a number of other charges causing bodily harm as well as intentionally causing serious bodily injury, destruction of property and violation of the law of war. So, there were a number of charges he was facing. The Defense Department does not say or give many details about the agreement that had been reached. But \"The New York Times\" is reporting that KSM, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, had agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy charges in exchange for the life sentence instead of, as you pointed out, the Defense Department in the U.S. pursuing the death penalty against KSM for his alleged involvement in the 9/11 attacks. Two other co-defendants who face charges for their alleged involvement in planning the 9/11 attacks have also reached pretrial agreements. According to DOD, those two are Walid Muhammad Salih Mubarak bin Attash and Mustafa Ahmed Adam al-Hawsawi. So, this had been under -- in the works for several years now. We reported back in March of 2022 that the U.S. was looking to see if there was a possibility for reaching pretrial agreements, but it's worth noting that this whole case has been drawn out and long stalled. It was years between his capture in Pakistan and his arraignment back in 2008. It was many years more before his trial was set to begin. And now, this, this pretrial agreement, this plea deal with KSM here that has been announced. We will wait to see when there are more official statements about what's in the plea deal itself. It is worth noting that had been -- it had been a major effort of the Biden administration to try to close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility in Cuba. They had repatriated a number of those held there back to their home countries as part of determining that they were no longer a national security risk. Still, there were nearly 40 detainees still left at Gitmo and it didn't look like there was much progress there until this announcement just a short time ago that plea agreements had been reached in these three defendants, including, of course, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.

Their favoriteinflation indicator is now rising 2.6 percent on a year over year basis, which is not that far from their 2 percent inflation objective. And two, there's signs of weakness in various parts of the economy. Small businesses are suffering from higher interest rates. And low- and moderate- income households, you know, they don't get the benefit of a soaring stock market to make them feel better. They're paying more on auto loans and credit card debt. So, you're actually seen some signs of slowing on the economy. You've seen the unemployment rate, you know, drift up quite a bit over the last six months. Wage trends are also coming down. We saw that earlier today. So, I think, you know, the risk reward of waiting now seems to be pretty low in my opinion. If you -- if you're basically telling people you're -- you plan to cut in September, it begs the question of, well, if that's so obvious, then why don't you just do it today?",

Number one, I think that they were burned by the bad inflation dataearly in the year when we got the three bad inflation reports in a row. So, they sort of don't want to go down that path again, you know, sort of declaring victory prematurely. Number two, I think Powell wants to maintain a consensus on the FOMC, in the Federal Open Market Committee. And one way to do that is to basically tell the doves that cuts are coming, but tell the hawks, look, we're actually being a little bit more patient. And, then finally, the (INAUDIBLE) is what you're referencing. Every time the unemployment rate goes up by more than a half a percent on a three- month moving average basis, U.S. ends up in recession. That indicator right now is at 0.43 percent. So, not very far away. The Fed's view of that is, yes, it's a nice indicator. He was asked about it at his press conference, but he basically said, you know, maybe this time it's different because the unemployment rate is going up because of strong labor force growth, not because of a lot of job layoffs.

And the Fed Reserve is poised to cut rates. So, if the economy shows signs of weaknesses, then the Federal Reserve will respond, you know, pretty quickly. You know, and the fact is that it looks like the economy is still growing. It looks like, you know, the economy is growing at about a 2 percent annual rate. Job gains are still positive.

And because of his Rockwell Collins experience, there's a feeling that he also knows how to run a very large organization with difficult supply chains across a wide range of different types of aircraft.

Certainly, things were moving in a positive direction. We saw meetings in Rome on Sunday with the key mediators, including the CIA director, Bill Burns. But this has now come to a crashing halt because the main Hamas interlocutor, the main Hamas member at the negotiating table was Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in this strike in Tehran believed to have been carried out by Israel. Now, the White House is not confirming, no U.S. officials are confirming that Israel was behind this, but we did hear from the White House's John Kirby earlier today who did say that this does complicate the nature of what they're trying to get done and this does obviously turn up the temperature in the region. So, we'll have to see where the ceasefire talks go. In terms of a potential response, we have heard throughout the course of the day, Iranian officials threatening a response against Israel for the attack that took place in Tehran that killed the Hamas leader who was there for the inauguration ceremony of the new president. Now, that could come in a number of different ways. Now, you'll remember, as well, our viewers back in April, there was that massive barrage of crews and ballistic missiles as well as drones that were fired at Israel. They were largely stopped by Israel and a number of allies, including the United States. So, we could see another direct strike from the Iranians, but of course, we could see the proxies in the region really stepping up as well. We've seen proxies in Iraq and Syria attacking Israel and U.S. forces across the region. Of course, Hezbollah from Lebanon that has been in a low-level war with Israel since October 8th. And then the, Houthis who have also recently attacked Israel with a drone and saw a response from the Israeli Air Force. So, it could come in a number of different ways. But I think, Julia, without question today, we have had a serious escalation and a serious raise of the temperature in the region with not just one, but these back-to-back strikes believed to have been carried out by Israel yesterday in Beirut against the top Hezbollah commander, and then, today, the one that Israel has not admitted to, but is believed to be behind against the political leader of Hamas taking place in Tehran.

Then fast forward to July, an Air Europa flight was struck over the Atlantic, some passengers thrown into the ceiling. Now, one solution, as you heard Richard say there, buckle up perhaps for the entire trip. But perhaps technology too has a solution. Turbulent Solutions is a start-up aiming to predict volatility before it hits and then correct it using aircraft controls. They hope to knock out up to 80 percent of the movement, if not more. Andres Galffy is the CEO of Turbulent Solutions, and he joins us now. Welcome to the show. You boldly claimed your aim is to create a turbulence free industry.

Imagine you're sitting in aircraft in stronger turbulence. So, the cabin is shaking. You're feeling all these bumps. With turbulence cancelling technology, we just don't feel this turbulence anymore. How does it work? We measure the turbulence ahead of the wing and then, at the right moment, we just produce the right counter motion of the wing. So, we have small flaps that change the deflection just like birds do with the feathers and you don't feel the turbulence anymore.",

So, because of climatechange, we have more heating in the atmosphere, higher weather phenomena, and even for jet aircraft, we are now experiencing more and more of these turbulence encounters. For light aircraft in low atmosphere, so they're not reaching this jet age top levels above the weather, not anymore above the weather, it's even more troubling down there. So, this a reason why you need to have heavier aircraft. So, you need to reinforce the wings. It's a lot of added mass. Then you also are not very efficient in the operation and also in the logistics. So, you have flight delays. You're not routing directly, but you're avoiding the turbulence. And now, if the turbulence is getting higher and higher and stronger and stronger, we will need to even more avoid the turbulence having even longer routes and 10 percent more routing means 10 percent more flight time means 10 percent more emissions. And this 10 percent is also from mass, from flight logistics, from inefficiency in the actual design. So, with canceling turbulence and not avoiding anymore, we really capture a lot of this emission reduction that we can achieve.",

It looks pretty promising that we get very fastresults in the market with just keeping complexity low for the beginning. So, it's for 30 years already, a lot of academic research with like the maximum solution. So, having the big airliner aircraft to start with, with a lot of counter turbulence, all the surfaces on the aircraft you can imagine, countering turbulence with a lot of deflection what is hard to certify and you're guaranteeing this function. We starting with like a minimum approach where we have light aircraft for the first product to fast get into the market, have just limited deflection. So, it's additional small surfaces, so-called flat plates (ph) that can introduce big problems into normal operation. And we don't guarantee the function for the beginning. It's just an assistant system for flight comfort, and then, step by step ramped it up. So, larger aircraft, more deflection and up to guaranteeing the function.",

So, in principle, it's even possible to really cancel also even this turbulence out, but this would be like this maximum solution thatwe will see maybe in 15, 20, 25 years at this extent. But already, with now the maturity that we have now, so like the assisting (ph) system with limited deflection, we can still largely reduce the effect. So, it's not about guaranteeing the function, but if you have 99.9 percent of availability, that's too little to change the aircraft design and the windbreaks, but it's still sufficient to really have a high availability, even in these cases. So, with very high probability, 99.9 percent, we would have been active at this Singapore flight and we wouldn't cancel out all this 2G on extra force, but at least we cancel out, for instance, 0.5G.",

She's the first French athlete in history to win gold in the triathlon. And it was a home game for her. The 27-year-old grew up in the Paris suburbs, securing what, at the time, was a sixth gold medal for the host nation. France now have eight gold medals. And after that came a sensational sprint finish in the men's. And what a moment for Team GB's Alex Yee, who won silver in Tokyo.
