The National Hurricane Center says tropical storm Ernesto will strengthen and become a hurricane in the coming hours. Right now, it's just shy of a hurricane with 70 miles per hour winds and located about 40 miles north of San Juan. More than 100,000 customers in Puerto Rico are already in the dark and nearly all customers across the U.S. Virgin Islands are without power. Flash flood warnings have been issued across the area. Now, Ernesto won't make a direct landfall in Puerto Rico, but heavy rainfall and strong winds are lashing the island. The storm could become a major hurricane in a few days and could potentially impact Bermuda. Here's what we know right now. A tropical storm warning is in effect for all of Puerto Rico. Public schools are closed and dozens of shelters have been opened. People are preparing for widespread power outages, floods and mudslides. This comes as the island's electrical grid is still being repaired after it was severely damaged by Hurricane Maria seven years ago and the National Guard has been activated. The National Weather Service is warning that flush flooding is expected to begin shortly in Puerto Rico. People there have been stocking up on bottled water and gasoline and other suppliers as they prepare for the storm. CNN's Chad Myers has the storm forecast. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

In places, could see four to six inches of rain.And with the wind, even in Puerto Rico, with even a 40 or 50 mile per hour wind, we can lose an awful lot of power here. We know that from history. Maybe four to six inches even over the British Virgin Islands as the tails, the outer bands still come over parts of the U.S. Virgin Islands, the British Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico proper. Temperatures in the ocean are one to two degrees, even three to four degrees Fahrenheit above normal for this time of year. And this storm is going to make a run to Bermuda. It's going to be left or going to be right. The American model is on the west side. The European model is on the right side. What you need to know is that this thing could be 110 mile per hour hurricane as it makes its way toward Bermuda. That's only one, two miles per hour, less than a category three hurricane. And with the waters being so warm, there's no way to know whether it's going to be a two or a three. But then where does it possibly go? Well, if you're in Nova Scotia or in Newfoundland, I want you to pay attention because some of the models are trying to turn this back toward the west, not into the U.S. or into Boston at this point, but still could be a brush with Nova Scotia and there at Newfoundland.

And what is undeniable is that for White House officials close to the president, they will all acknowledge that getting a ceasefire deal is one of the biggest outstanding pieces of a part of his foreign policy legacy that is really top of mind for President Biden as he has just a number of months left of his first and last term at the White House. But as the president himself made clear on Tuesday, those talks, those ceasefire talks that he has been so closely engaged in for a number of months, they do appear to be back in limbo at this moment in time.

So they're doing everything they can, but the fact is Hamas has said that they have already agreed to a proposal. It's the one that was flagged last month and approved by the U.N. Security Council. It's been supported by the U.S. president, and they don't want to go back to these talks. They don't feel the need to go back and rehash.

It's not going to influence anything on the ground at the moment.But of course, the time is going to be looked at very closely. You've got, for example, 50 F-15 fighter jets. That's about $18 billion, potentially the biggest weapons deal that the U.S. and Israel have done. So it is very significant. We have heard in the past that the Biden administration has said that they are going to withhold certain weapons from Israel because of what they're doing in Gaza. But then at the same time, you have this very significant weapons deal that they are announcing as well. So depending on which analyst you speak to, it's the carrot or the stick.
