This year, though, those drills include launching intercontinental ballistic and cruise missiles. According to Russia's defense minister, the training exercise is simulating a nuclear strike in response to an enemy nuclear attack.CNN's Nic Robertson is joining us live from Kyiv this morning. So, Nic, the Pentagon has stressed here these exercises are routine. The U.S. though, of course, keeping an eye on them. What is, though, different about these routine exercises this year?",

      "sentences": "I think one of the things that is different is Russia is really posturing around these exercises. This explicit announcement by Sergei Shoigu, the minister of defense, to say that, essentially, this is how we would respond if there was a nuclear attack really plays into Russia and President Putin's allegations that Ukraine is preparing some kind of dirty bomb. I sat down with the Ukraine's head of military intelligence earlier today and I asked him that flat out, do you have a dirty bomb.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GEN. KYRYLO BUDANOV, CHIEF OF THE DEFENSE INTELLIGENCE UKRAINE:  This is a question that became something of a joke. And my answer is direct. We are not getting prepared. We are not working on a dirty bomb.",

And he said he just wants them to come in and publish their results quickly to prove that Ukraine is not preparing some kind of dirty bomb. His assessment is interesting in what President Putin is doing right now. He believes that Putin is posturing, that Putin doesn't want to escalate this to a level of nuclear attack on Ukraine. He thinks that what Putin is trying to do is put pressure on Ukraine's western allies and partners, NATO, to pressure Ukraine for Ukraine to get into peace talks with Putin. He says that is just an absolute nonstarter until Russia gets out of Ukraine and withdraws to its positions in 1991. That will be back to pre-2014 invasion, not just pre-2022 invasion. So, the sense here is Russia is posturing but they do want the IAEA to give them a clean bill of health but they also want the IAEA to inspect what Russia is doing at Ukraine's nuclear power plants, particularly in Zaporizhzhia, where they are concerned that Russia itself might be preparing some spent nuclear fuel rods for some kind of dirty bomb.",

You represent your hometown of Houston. So, we know what happened yesterday, right, in terms of her legal options there in Russia. Just a couple of weeks ago, President Biden sat down with Jake Tapper and he told Jake he would meet with Putin at the G20 next month if Putin said he wanted to talk about Griner's release.

I'm going to find that the witness, Mark Meadows, as you were talking about, is material and necessary to the investigation. He points out the state of Georgia is assuring this is now going to cause any undue hardship for Meadows to show up.Now, the reason this has to go through a South Carolina judge is because the Georgia prosecutor is looking for an out of state witness. Meadows lives in South Carolina, so the South Carolina judge needs to sign off on this subpoena. It is a big deal because Meadows' attorneys were trying to argue he shouldn't have to appear, that there are executive privilege issues at play. They were taking issue with whether this really is a criminal proceeding. The judge didn't buy in to that. He said, look, some of these arguments, if you want to make them, you are going to have to make them in Georgia. Now, Meadows' attorney already spoke to folks on the ground, including our CNN producer who attended this hearing in person, and said that he does plan to appeal this ruling. So, I doubt this will be the final word, as far as Mark Meadows is concerned. We've seen with other subpoenas he received, particularly with the January 6 committee subpoena, he has been trying to fight that, again, on the grounds of executive privilege. So, I suspect this fight is going to carry on.",

There are also sanctions going after those who work at Iranian prisons.There are also sanctions going after those who are involved in what they call the censorship of the Iranian people. We have talked a lot about how the Iranians are trying to get on the internet and the Iranian regime is making that tough. So, the Biden administration is also going after folks in that group. The secretary of state saying that the United States stands with the Iranian people and is committed to making sure that those who are responsible for these violent crackdowns on the Iranian protestors are held accountable. Now, we should also note that this comes on the day that marks 40 days since the death of 22-year-old Iranian protestor Mahsa Amini that really set off this spark with these protestors first beginning among Iranian women and then spreading to other parts and other sectors of the country.",

Some 500 or so people are still at one hurricane shelter here in Lee County. We caught up with one woman who has been there since the very beginning. She's been there with her two kids after Hurricane Ian damaged the apartment she lived in. Now, here in Fort Myers Beach, there are several parts of this barrier island that are still without power and still without water. And now homeowners, while they are having to deal with the difficult process of not only dealing with their insurance provider, but if they didn't have insurance to begin with, they're now having to rely on FEMA for some assistance. We caught up with one woman who had flood insurance but some of the damage happened to her roof. That was brought on by the wind. And so now she is still waiting to hear back from her insurance to see exactly how much of the damage at her house is going to be covered. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
