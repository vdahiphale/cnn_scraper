But when the judge and the jury come back, direct examination is going to resume for the second witness today. It is a paralegal for the prosecution. The unanswered question is if or when. We'll see some of those brand name witnesses who we know were in the trenches of an alleged scheme that could potentially send Donald Trump to prison if he's convicted here, a big if.

The witnesses are giving them a passageway to introduce evidence against Trump recordings and now social media posts. And we're seeing the former president transport his delay strategy from outside the courtroom to inside the courtroom, giving not a single inch to the prosecution's rush to put the facts on the record. My panel is here with me. So now that the court is in a break, I think we expect them back momentarily. Elie, can you just give our viewers an idea of what happened this morning in court?",

Now he's an investigator, works for the Manhattan D.A. And his specialty is digital forensics. He had gone through two of Michael Cohen's cell phones, and they're using him as a vehicle, as a foundation to introduce evidence found on those cell phones, which will include texts, could include e-mails and includes a very important recording, the recording that Michael Cohen made of his conversation with Donald Trump back in September 2016, where they're discussing the Karen McDougal payout. The jury has heard that once. I think we are going to hear it again throughout the trial.Now, on the stand is a paralegal with the Manhattan D.A.'s office named Georgia Longstreet. Not a name anyone should be expected to know. And it seems like what she is doing is authenticating, laying the foundation for certain social media posts that Donald Trump put up. She -- earlier, we had a note, she was explaining Twitter to the jury. Good luck with that. And she also apparently has gone through thousands of Donald Trump's tweets in Truth Social. She won't be commenting on them. She'll just be saying, yes, this is a post he put up. And to the point you were making before, Dana, the reason we're hearing from these witnesses is because Donald Trump's legal team, as is their right, has refused to stipulate. Usually, not always, but 80, 90 percent of the time, the defense will say, yes, we agree, those tweets are in fact, his tweets. You don't have to call the paralegal. Donald Trump is giving no quarter. Therefore, all these witnesses are having to take the stand.",

We know that she was in and out of that meeting that David Pecker talked about in August of 2015. She is somebody that you would say knows where the bodies are buried.Now, she does not have an ongoing relationship with Donald Trump. They are not in touch. Their relationship kind of soured. And by that, I mean they don't speak, but they both hold a lot of affection for each other. Donald Trump still speaks very highly of Hope Hicks. Hope Hicks still speaks very highly of Donald Trump. There was just a moment after she was called to testify in January 6th, and they read her text messages out loud that some in his orbit thought she went a little bit too far in insulting the former president, which caused a little bit of a rift.

Keith Davidson was a notable in one yesterday. He had not been in the same room as Donald Trump ever, I believe, until they were in the same courtroom together. LAURA COATES, CNN ANCHOR AND CHIEF LEGAL ANALYST: You know, you wonder how this is all going to play out. Because if the prosecution strategy is to suggest that he has minions, he has people who he's delegating things to do, and you really -- he wants to have his hands and fingerprints off of everything, well, then it might make sense to jury. You haven't heard people immediately connect the dots. What would you expect to be the case? The person who's the head honcho, the one to actually delegate to be in every room where it happens or would you expect the person to have their legion of fans or employees who are doing something on their behalf.

That's what's significant. Now, the judge is saying, jurors, the stipulation is information. The parties have agreed to without the need to call a witness. And as you said, we've seen so many witnesses who only had to come and testify because they couldn't agree to this.Now, a couple moments ago, the judge allowed in many social media posts and the reason they're bringing a lot of those in is to show Trump's pattern of alleged intimidation of several of the witnesses in this case, especially Stormy Daniels and Michael Cohen. Now, the judge right now is telling the jury that this stipulation should be considered as any other evidence.

So this new Trump tweet reads, the very foul mouthed Senator John McCain begged for my support during his primary, I gave, he won, then dropped me over locker room remarks. So they're just showing how Trump was responding in the wake of the fallout from the Access Hollywood tape. But the reason that tape matters is because it put so much pressure on the Trump campaign. And what prosecutors would argue is that is part of why he had to quickly pay this hush money to Stormy Daniels to suppress her story to help his chances of getting elected. COLLINS: We also have former Manhattan district attorney Karen Friedman Agnifilo here with us, who I should note, is of counsel to a firm that represents Michael Cohen, and she has no contact with him, doesn't work on his case, no restrictions on what she can say. Karen, there seems to be something that the prosecution is doing here, which is they just played the video of Trump in response to the dropping of that Access Hollywood tape where he acknowledged those were his words and then apologized for them. And now they're showing posts from him on social media denying it, saying nothing ever happened with any of these women, totally made up nonsense to steal the election. Nobody has more respect for women than me. He's defending his behavior on women. He also was criticizing the late Senator John McCain for essentially not supporting him because of the comments he made on that Access Hollywood tape.

I mean, this seems to me like they are potentially setting up her because she was someone who was right there with the Trump campaign when this was happening. She was very involved in the efforts to respond to it publicly and to talk to reporters. \"The Washington Post,\" I believe, reached out to Hope Hicks when they were publishing the Access Hollywood tape to see if Donald Trump was going to comment while he was in the middle of debate prep at the time.",
