As Elie (ph) just pointed out, the crimes that are alleged in this indictment, these are paperwork crimes. Now, I will tell you that one thing that former President Trump would not do is go into a scrum of reporters where he is surrounded by people asking him detailed questions. He was pressed on the specific allegations in this indictment, for example, whether he applied for unemployment benefits while he was indeed employed. He didn't really have a good answer for any of that. He just deflected, said this will be part of his defense. I was pretty surprised at the length of this gaggle. I even sent our Mark Morales over to his attorney to ask if this attorney thought this was a good idea.

He said, I expect to be judged by my work done in the body.I do want to bring in criminal defense attorney and former prosecutor Bernarda Villalona to talk with us as well. Let's talk about the biggest charges here, the potentially most perilous ones for George Santos, which are wire fraud, these seven counts of wire fraud and the potential sentence that they could bring if he is found guilty, Bernarda. BERNARDA VILLALONA, CRIMINAL DEFENSE &amp; FORMER PROSECUTOR: Exactly. So when we're talking about wire fraud, the maximum sentence that he's facing is 20 years incarceration. That is the max and that's for each count of wire fraud that can run consecutive. Of course, let's be clear when it comes to federal sentences, unless there's a mandatory minimum, you can get anywhere from probation all up until the 20 years. But this - in George Santos, he's facing a lot of time if he is convicted, so I'm not sure why would you speak to the public right after being arraigned, knowing that anything you say can be used against you.

They have all the documents they need.

In fact, George Santos has raised, one, that actually Democrats did not really spend a ton of money and a lot of effort to try to knock him off, because they had seen the polls, George Santos is actually doing fairly well in that race.They focused on other races in New York where the Democrats fell short. Ultimately, those seats were central to McCarthy getting back into majority, which is why a number of the New York Republicans themselves have called on Santos to resign, including Mike Lawler of New York, one member, Nick LaLota, another one also calling on him to resign. Several other freshmen members in the same class of George Santos, same Republicans as well, saying they don't want the liabilities of having George Santos on the ticket, which is why if he does decide to run and he could still run, despite facing indictment, there will be a furious effort to try to defeat him in the primary. We'll see how that ultimately shakes out if George Santos decides to do it again. Brianna.",

And that is the standard in which McCarthy is currently abiding by. But he also said that the Ethics Committee finds that he breaks the law, that could be enough for him.So that's why the House Ethics Committee investigation, a separate probe could be determinative to determine whether or not the Republicans will start to break ranks in mass and actually vote to expel him from Congress. That is a next potential big shoe to drop, because that ethics probe is still ongoing, unclear when it will be wrapped up and unclear of the ultimate findings here, but there will be a lot of focus on that on the Hill and that'll put a lot of pressure on the Speaker if they do, in fact, find that he allegedly broke the law.",

Important to point out in the context of George Santos running for re-election that some of these charges stem from him allegedly using campaign funds for his campaign, allegedly, right? For personal expenses, like a car payment and fancy stuff.I want to go to Bernarda, because I'm wondering, he joins quite a collection of lawmakers who have been indicted while in office, at least two dozen since 1980.

But the facts and the evidence will speak for themselves at the time that there is a trial and by the release of the statement by the U.S. attorney in regards to this case.Also, another challenge is that you have the challenge of witnesses coming forward, because they are scared of retaliation. So that's one big issue when you're dealing with people that are in office and prosecuting them while they're in office. But here's the thing in this case, this is a paper case. So your main star witness in this case is going to be the documents, so you don't have that fear.",
