And happening today, President Biden's latest move to stop the surge of migrants at the U.S. southern border. Just a short time ago, his top officials landed in Mexico City. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas are now en route to a meeting with the Mexican president.The U.S. is about to make some major requests of Mexico to help reduce the number of people reaching the southern border. Yesterday, there was a drop of 6000 apprehensions. That follows a huge influx of arrivals this month, which had a seven day average of 9600 apprehensions a day.",

      "sentences": "Well, residents here in Eagle Pass, Texas, are definitely very aware of the conversations and the talks that are happening in Mexico City today. And they're hoping that something positive comes out of that. As for what we're seeing today, I talked to a law enforcement source who tells me that so far there's been a thousand migrant apprehensions in the Del Rio sector, which includes Eagle Pass here where I am. Now, I want you to look behind me because last week there were thousands of migrants waiting. And today, if you take a look, you'll see that this is an empty, empty field. There are no migrants here right now.And if you're wondering, OK, Rosa, you just told me that there's about a thousand apprehensions. Why are we not seeing anybody? The federal government has gotten very good at something called decompression. And that means that they move migrants from areas that are overwhelmed, that are over capacity, to areas that have capacity. And the federal government has gotten a lot of practice at this, too, because there's been surges for years now. So that's why when we talk about these large numbers, these large encounters on the U.S. southern border and then you see the images behind me, that's why they don't match, because this is the federal government actually doing something about it to try to process these migrants in a swift fashion. Now, about the impact to Americans, to border communities like Eagle Pass, I can tell you from talking to people in this community, there is frustration because one of the things that the Biden administration has done to deal with this surge is they've closed one of two bridges that connect to Mexico. Now, if you're in a border town, you know that you cross the border to see family in Mexico, to go to restaurants, to run errands, and then you come back to the United States and you go home, you eat with your family, have dinner with your family. People here in Eagle Pass, Texas, can't do that. These are American citizens who don't have access to this bridge. And here's why. The wait to cross from Mexico into the United States in Eagle Pass is 15 hours. Now, people here in Eagle Pass tell me that on a bad day, it might be two, three hours, but not 15. I talked to Texas State Representative Eddie Morales about this. He says that there's a lot of frustration. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

More than 34,000 migrants have arrived in Denver at a cost of $36 million to the city. Denver's Mayor Mike Johnson is joining us now. Mayor, thanks so much for coming on with us. We know your city has what you call a migrant, a migrant dashboard. It tracks Denver's support given to migrants. And it shows as of yesterday there are more than 4,100 people who are being sheltered at non-city facilities. That's just one way this appears to be impacting your city and the residents that live there. How else is this impacting Denver and its residents?",

But I've talked to a migrant last week and looked at his court papers. His court date is set for April 23rd, 2027. That's four years away. And in the four years that he's here waiting for that asylum case, he can't get work authorization to be able to support himself, pay for rent, pay for food. And so that leaves cities carrying that cost. And so that's why we think that whatever the federal government decides in terms of what the border admission policy should be, there has to be a direct match between the folks that are admitted and then the number of people that get work authorization.If folks arrive to our city and are able to work, we can put them to work. We have open jobs. We have people who want to hire them. But right now we have people that are new migrants to the city who want to work. We have employers who want to hire them. We have a federal government who stands in the way and says that they can't be hired by those employers. And that's the biggest challenge for us. We need them to decide on whatever the admission policy is, make sure every person that enters has the chance to work when they arrive and then they can support themselves, which is what they've been asking to do.",

How do you tackle both of those issues?

We've housed almost 900 of them with just a week to go. And so that's going to transform the opportunities for those people in Denver and transform how Denver looks and feels. We won't have any outdoor camping in all of our downtown city centers. It'll be a historic success for us. But at the same time, we now have more than 4,000 migrants who are in shelter in our hotel system any given night in Denver.That's more than 10 times the number that we had just six months ago when I took the oath of office. And so we are seeing more and more of those folks now that arrive and can't find work and can't find a place to live can also end up homeless. And that's going to be a huge impact on the city's budget. It could be up to about $160 million we're projecting across next year. That's a massive amount for a city to be the size of ours. And so we both want this to be a welcoming city and a welcoming country. We also want to set people up for success. And to do that, we have to make sure that they have a path to work and a path to be able to accelerate these asylum claims and to be able to get the resources we need to help them find homes and jobs.",

That decision went really deep and looked at the question of whether he could be qualified as an insurrectionist. There was a trial about it. In Michigan, they didn't even get to that question, and they said, you know, come back to us in the general election.That might be a time where we could potentially look at this issue, and so there's a lot of different ways that this can go in the coming months.

It's set for March, and they're listening very closely to what Donald Trump says on the campaign trail and saying to the judge, when this gets to trial, he shouldn't be allowed to call himself a political victim of the Biden administration.That shouldn't be part of the case. He shouldn't be able. To spread disinformation about the election, say that he still believes or believed at the time that he won the election. It wasn't true. There wasn't the fraud. That shouldn't be part of the case. And then the other thing is that he should not be able to blame law enforcement for what happened on January 6th for failures to protect the Capitol.

The other part of this to keep in mind is that when you see that word dictator up there, one of the conversations around Donald Trump, he has used it in tongue and cheek form, using it kind of to troll liberals and critics. However, one of the conversations around Donald Trump's second termwould be he and his allies essentially working already to try and consolidate and figure out how to do that under the executive branch, an enormous amount of power that would really be radical and unprecedented. But these are things, again, that he is just out there communicating. The third part of that, again, Boris, as you said, this is about appealing to his base. He believes that this is a message that they like to hear, particularly when it comes to revenge, economy, power.
