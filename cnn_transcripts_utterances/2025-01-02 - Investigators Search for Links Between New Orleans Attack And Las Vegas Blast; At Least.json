I'm Paula Newton and we begin with breaking news in two separate attacks here in the United States on New Year's Day.U.S. President Joe Biden says investigators are looking into whether there is any possible link between a ramming attack that killed dozens of people in New Orleans by a suspect with apparent ties to ISIS and a Tesla truck explosion outside the Trump Hotel in Las Vegas. Multiple law enforcement sources tell CNN the suspects in both incidents had military backgrounds. Now first to New Orleans where the FBI is investigating the ramming attack in the historic French Quarter and investigating it as an act of terrorism. Police say at least 15 people were killed when the suspect drove his truck down Bourbon Street at a high rate of speed at about 3:00 a.m. local time. He's been identified as 42-year-old Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a U.S. citizen and army veteran. They say he made recordings on the drive from Texas to Louisiana about joining ISIS and killing his family. Now we want to warn viewers, much of the video from the scene is graphic. Police say they found an ISIS flag on Jabbar's truck along with improvised explosive devices which they believe were made at an Airbnb rental. According to the FBI, a search is underway at a property linked to Jabbar in Houston, Texas. Video shows the white Ford F150 making a sharp turn onto Bourbon Street, past police barricades and onto the sidewalk. The driver continued down the street for several blocks, mowing down pedestrians. Now two officers were wounded in the shootout that killed the suspect. More than 30 people were injured in that ramming attack. Authorities say they do not believe Jabbar acted alone. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, law enforcement officials say they know the name of this driver who died in the explosion, but they are not going to be releasing the identity of that driver until they notify the next of kin.We understand that this driver was in Las Vegas for about an hour, driving around the Strip before pulling. Pulling up to Trump Tower before that explosion happened. And authorities say the driver rented the cybertruck in Colorado via the Turo app before driving down to Las Vegas. Video released by law enforcement shows explosives that were contained inside the truck, which included fireworks, gas tanks, and camping fuel. And all of that was connected to a detonation system that was controlled by the driver. And the sheriff pointed out, which is really incredible, how the cybertruck actually contained the explosion. The way that it was built forced the explosion to go upwards instead of outwards, which meant that the glass from Trump Tower was not broken. And seven people nearby were injured, but with minor injuries. All of them are OK. They've all been released from the hospital. The driver did die. And Las Vegas police believe that this was an isolated incident. They are not yet willing to say if this was, in fact, connected to what happened in New Orleans. But it is quite unusual that both the drivers in these incidents rented their cars from Turo. We do have a statement from Turo, and they said they're cooperating with these investigations, but they also said that neither of the drivers had criminal backgrounds, which would have flagged them as security threats.

So we don't know if there was other people.I tend to think there might have been because of those devices being placed at separate places around the French Quarter. I don't see him planting them and then going back and getting in his car. I could be wrong. He could have done just that. But it's unusual to me if he did that because he would have had to leave those devices on the sidewalk for a long time. In other words, plant them somewhere where no one's going to find them and then go and get in the car and pull off the attack. May have done that. I would find that unusual.

In other words, in New Orleans, that guy was hell bent on having a body count. He drove through a crowd. He got out of his car when he couldn't drive it anymore and started shooting at people, including police officers. He was intent on killing as many people as possible.In Vegas, he didn't want to kill people because he was going to detonate that thing in front of the Trump Tower. And if you see the video, there's nobody even standing near the truck when he detonates it. And in Vegas, there's plenty of places if you wanted to kill people, to drive up on a sidewalk, say, in front of the Bellagio when people are looking at the fountains or somewhere else where there's a crowd, so that when that fireball went up, you would have killed a lot more people. Any of the hotels that have a queue for taxis after a big show or something like that would have been a place he could have taken out a lot of people if that was his intent. So the intent of the killer in New Orleans was not the same, almost opposite of the intent of the person who killed themselves in that Tesla truck in Vegas. Because I think it seems like, you know, the Tesla truck with Elon Musk's name and Trump Tower is much more of a political type statement to me. And the fact that he didn't want a big body count because if he wanted it in Vegas, he could have gotten it.",

He went to college. He went to Georgia State University. The university confirms that he did graduate with a bachelor's degree. He worked in real estate in Texas for four years. And then things started to change. There are divorce records that show in 2012 from his first wife. She sued him to try to get child support. And then in his second marriage, there was a filing that the suspect, the would be suspect, would eventually file, saying that he was tens of thousands of dollars in debt from his business, that he was at risk of foreclosure and that he had credit card debt.

And I think we still don't know the answer to this question. I believe in the last couple hours, it is more likely that he is someone who got radicalized or may have been people online or elsewhere.

This evidence, along with recordings he is believed to have made recently indicated allegiance to ISIS, according to investigators. Authorities also detonated several suspected improvised explosives in the truck and nearby. Investigators spent the day at the large crime scene in the French Quarter, as well as working to conduct searches at other locations associated with the suspect. This includes a rental home nearby, where the suspect is believed to have spent the recent days before carrying out the attack, as well as another home in the Houston area where the suspect is thought to have lived. They've also spent the day talking to people who knew the suspect. And so far haven't identified anyone who helped him or who knew of his plans to carry out the attack. The FBI is still continuing to ask the public for help to share video or tips if they've seen the suspect in recent days and weeks. Evan Perez, CNN -- Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

What were you interviewing him about and what was he like? SEAN KEENAN, FREELANCE JOURNALIST, \"NEW YORK TIMES\": Yes. Thank you for having me, Paula. I mean, this began like any other story, which was just, you know, somebody whispers in my ear, I'm having difficulty navigating, you know, whatever government system it may be. In this case, it was students reaching out saying, we're having trouble getting our Veterans Affairs benefits that we are owed through the GI bill. And admittedly, you know, ten years later, I don't fully remember how I got connected to Shamsud-din Jabbar. I believe it may have been through the Georgia State Student Government Association. But we just discussed what it was like for him acclimating to civilian life and to college life, no less after military service. So I've gone through all my notes. I've been desperately trying to find the original recording of the interview, but frankly, my entire relationship with the New Orleans attack suspect was limited to probably a 30-minute interview.",

I think a lot of military service people, they, you know, learn a certain jargon, they adopt a lexicon that is pretty exclusive to the environments that they're in, whether it's in basic training or combat zones or anywhere else. And he found it difficult to not only go through college speaking with his professors, but also he worried about trying to get a job after college and just still having these communicative issues. The other thing that frustrated him was this sort of labyrinthine nature of the VA programs, and how you're supposed to, you know, file different pieces of paperwork in order to collect benefits. And, you know, he was fortunate that he had some help from Georgia State University. They have an office over there that is specifically dedicated to helping students work through that labyrinth. But he lamented that a single missing piece of paperwork or a missed signature could just have you slip through the cracks. Have you missing a check that you may direly depend on.",

What does it matter?He said that that could be the suspect, and my head was spinning. And I, you know, what little I remember about that interview was a very cool, calm and collected guy. Like he -- nothing about his character threw any red flags, which I think is reflective of what a lot of us are hearing while we're covering this story. I mean, a lot of my colleagues at \"The New York Times\" talked to family and friends, and they're telling you, this was a wild 180. So no, what I remember about the interview with him was his pretty reserved demeanor. He was a little bit distant in the way that, you know, you sometimes see from veterans who, you know, have had difficult deployments. And I, interestingly enough, remember his eyes, which is actually how we confirmed the story, confirmed that this was the same guy after the FBI published the photograph of him. I realized, like, yes, that's the guy I sat down with. And I've been getting a lot of calls from family and friends today asking like, you know, how does it feel?

In New Orleans, officials say at least 15 people were killed after a man drove a pickup into a crowd celebrating the New Year Wednesday morning. Dozens of others were injured. Officials say the suspect is a U.S. Army veteran who was killed at the scene in a firefight with police. They say the posted videos say he joined ISIS. And in Las Vegas, one person was found dead inside the cyber truck that blew up Wednesday morning. Seven people were injured. Officials believe the driver also had a military background. Now, the vehicles used in both the New Orleans and Las Vegas attacks were rented from the same online platform. Now, the attacker used a truck as a weapon against people on a crowded street that's very popular with tourists in New Orleans. As CNN's Brian Todd reports, using vehicles in terror attacks have become common in recent years. And a warning, some of the video you're about to see is disturbing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

It's right up in here. So many people have visited that. That's merely blocks away. Preservation Hall, a great tourist attraction. Pat O'Brien's bar. So many young people go through there. Canal Street over here, we mentioned, huge. A lot of Mardi Gras parades there. They had a parade for the Sugar Bowl in this area just before this all happened. And of course, the Superdome right over here. You could walk from here all the way over here to Jackson Square in 30 minutes easily in a very relaxed fashion. And this is a town that has lots and lots of people around it, and they've taken security seriously. They've been aware of threats. There are very serious questions now as to what maybe wasn't done right here. First of all, we have the Sugar Bowl. That's happening right now. 75,000 people may be inside the Superdome, maybe more. Watch parties all over town. Mardi gras technically starts next Monday with the first parade that will go on for about two months. About a million people will come to town for that jazz fest will get a half million or more in town. That's coming up a little bit later this spring. The Super Bowl, in just a little over a month. These are huge events, all of which, if there is a threat out there, are all in a position of having to be concerned about it. And in fact, the NFL put out a tweet saying deeply saddened by the news of this devastating event in New Orleans. Thoughts are with the victims, the community and all those involved. And the NFL and the local host committee have been working collaboratively with local, state and federal agencies the past two years to develop a comprehensive security plan.
