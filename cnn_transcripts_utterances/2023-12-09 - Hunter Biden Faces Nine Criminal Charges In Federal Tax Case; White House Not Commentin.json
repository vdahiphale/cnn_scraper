We begin this hour with both leading presidential candidates dealing with major legal distractions as they prepare to head into the first contest of the 2024 election season.On Friday, a federal appeals court upheld most of a gag order barring former President Donald Trump from attacking certain witnesses, prosecutors, and court staff. Trump is vowing to appeal the ruling, which centers on his federal election subversion case. And this comes as President Biden hits the campaign trail just hours after his son was indicted again. Hunter Biden is now facing new federal tax evasion charges. Prosecutors accuse him of a four-year tax evasion scheme and spending millions of dollars on things like drugs, escorts, and exotic cars. If convicted on all nine criminal counts, he could face up to 17 years in prison. The charges come as House Republicans continue to pressure Hunter Biden to testify in a congressional hearing and prepare to vote on a resolution to authorize an impeachment inquiry into President Biden. CNN chief legal affairs correspondent Paula Reid has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA REID, CNN SENIOR LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice over): President Biden ignored questions Friday about the latest criminal charges filed against his son.",

He did eventually repay taxes he owed along with hundreds of thousands of dollars in penalties and fees. But prosecutors say that when he did finally file his returns, he included false business deductions in order to reduce his tax liability. His lawyers claim prosecutors have bowed to political pressure to bring charges against the president's son. In a statement, his attorney Abbe Lowell said, \"If Hunter's last name was anything other than Biden, the charges in Delaware, and now California, would not have been brought.\" In a newly released podcast recorded before the indictment.

And it's certainly true that there is no more sensitive issue inside the White House than Hunter Biden's legal problems. It's not issue that aids like to race with the president very often.And when you talk to them, there really aren't that many who really have a firsthand knowledge of how the president is processing all of this. But it is certainly true that it does weigh on him heavily. And certainly, these latest charges, just given the personal nature of what's laid out in that indictment, are an embarrassment, in some ways, for Hunter Biden, and for the president. Now, when you talk to President Biden's aides, they don't necessarily believe that this will be an issue that voters will make their decision on next year. They think they're focused in other areas like the economy, like the prospect of President Trump returning to the White House, but there's no question that this is a political headache for President Biden. And already you've seen Republicans try and conflate the legal issues facing Hunter Biden and President Trump's own legal issues. But certainly, there is no comparison there because President Trump was president and is running for president. Hunter Biden was not president and will not run for president. So, they are two separate issues. But certainly, it is a political issue for President Biden as he gears up for next year's reelection. And certainly, the challenge for the president will be to start framing this election as a choice between him, and his most likely rival, President Trump. And you did hear him start to do that yesterday in Las Vegas, taking the rare step of mentioning his predecessor by name. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

What is clear is Hunter Biden didn't pay his taxes. What is clear is that Hunter Biden earned $7 million that he would have probably not been able to earn, were he not his father's son, and therefore, he has this problem of being a politically exposed person, a person who is in the public domain, and prosecutors look at those people more seriously than regular private citizens.",

If he goes there, I think it really is a matter of political show.

Israel has thanked the U.S. for using their veto. This was a resolution that was sponsored by the United Arab Emirates. It had 97 co-sponsors, all saying that there should be this immediate ceasefire.There was an emergency meeting called at the U.N. Security Council. This was after the U.N. Secretary General invoked what is known as Article 99, which is a very rarely used tool at times of international crisis. The Security Council voted. These 15 members voted. 13 voted in favor of an immediate ceasefire, the U.K. abstained and the U.S. voted against it, thereby, vetoing this resolution. The reaction came fast and furious. I want to show you a little bit of it. The prime -- the prime minister of the Palestinian Authority, he said that \"The failure of the Security Council to stop the aggression is a disgrace and a new license for continued killing, destruction, and displacement. The use of the veto exposes the hypocrisy of claiming to care about the lives of civilians.\" Fred, we also heard from the aid group, Medecins Sans Frontieres, the Doctors Without Borders. They wrote, \"By vetoing this resolution, the U.S. stands alone in casting its vote against humanity.\" And then, finally, there was this message of thanks from the Israeli ambassador to the United Nations, Gilad Erdan.

And Congress couldn't hold that up, but the administration is willing to take the risk and say, we need to get them approved. And this fits into what we were just discussing, which is, there is not unlimited time. Israel is in a moment right now, where it is engaged in aggressive actions against Hamas. And to pause that to slow that down, paradoxically, could slow down the whole process and make finishing this military activity longer. And so, I think the administration, they made the right choice to tell Congress, they're not going to observe the informal hold, if there is one, they're going to pass that. There is a cost in the relationship between the two -- the two -- the two bodies, but this will then mean that these funds go straight into Israel.

And right, it seems like an eternity ago, doesn't it? That collapse. I mean, to get that confidence back after that test failed, where there was a good process underway that all sides thought was working, that's going to be really hard. And I think this is why we see the renewed activity from Israel, so actively a lack of confidence in decision to try to go after Hamas leadership. But without a doubt, our allies in particular, Egypt, is feeling extreme pressure, very much worried about a refugee crisis, potentially coming over the border into Sinai and then into Egypt itself that they do not want. And so, I think we have to be extra super active in terms of working with our allies to get another commitment out of Hamas. But absent that, we're going to likely see this war going until Israel feels it's achieved its military objectives, which is to completely take away Hamas's military capacity and its leadership capabilities.
