Now, Michigan itself has 15 electoral votes, and it's really the center of the so called blue wall states. And I'll tell you, you know, from my conversations with Trump senior advisers, that out of all three of them, that includes not just Michigan, but also Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, that they actually feel the most confident about Michigan, and that's why you're seeing him spend so much time in this state, really trying to shore up that support here.Now you did mention but he was also in this state just a week ago. I was here as well, covering him his remarks at the Detroit Economic Club. And it was really interesting, because at one point during those remarks, he actually insulted Detroit while being in Detroit. He talked about, you know, reinvigorating the U.S. auto industry. He said he wanted to renegotiate a trade deal that he had first negotiated, actually, with Mexico and Canada, but then he started to criticize Detroit, saying it was a once great city, saying that it's more of a developing city than places like China. And so he got a lot of backlash for that. I'm curious to see whether or not he tries to clean up some of those remarks when he's back here tonight. But before he comes to Detroit, Alex and Brianna, he's actually going to be in Oakland County. That's where you're going to see that split screen of Harris and Donald Trump both in the same county that I note that it's actually just north of Detroit. It is in the suburbs, and it's been very clear that the suburbs is really an area that Donald Trump's team has been targeting, particularly suburban women. And so I think that's going to be a key part of what he talks about when he's there just later this afternoon,",

There have been reports of that, but he's saying now that he hadn't talked to him. Obviously, Jack Smith stuff, there's nothing new there. That is just how he has continued to rail against all of these legal cases, essentially saying that they're all political. In terms of the health exams, I believe he's including some of the post shooting in Butler assassination attempt letters that we saw from Ronny Jackson, who is not his physician, but is - was - when he was in the White House. Again, he has not released any sort of comprehensive medical records here. And to be clear, in August of last - of this year, he said he was going to release more medical records, and then went on to not do that. Now he's saying he's already released enough. But again, that was in August, and he said he was going to. So clearly, there's been a disconnect in between there.",

President Biden won them by wider margins, and that is what the Harris campaign wants to emulate and build on.So they're doing that today with a message on labor. Shortly ago, we heard the Vice President in Grand Rapids, where she talked about manufacturing and labor. She is trying to make inroads with union voters, knowing that some rank and file members have been leaning toward former President Donald Trump. So her remarks today in Michigan have been centered on that. But also, when talking to campaign officials, they tell me that where they see opportunities is also in the suburbs. This is an area that both Trump and Harris are competing for, but what the Harris campaign sees is that they have potentially an opportunity with the white college educated voters. In other words, perhaps, Republicans who are tired of Trump and may be willing to vote for the Vice President. Now the way they're trying to capitalize on this as well is with early voting. This is the first presidential election in Michigan where there will be early voting in person. And so that is something that the Harris campaign is very focused on. In fact, she will stay in Michigan until tomorrow. She'll be in Detroit for a \"Get Out the Vote\" event where they're bringing in some star power. Lizzo will be with her for that. And later, she'll be in Georgia with Usher where early voting has already begun. So you can see this strategy is starting to come to fruition, where they are trying to fortify their coalition, bring in those voters, perhaps those disaffected Republicans, that is an area they've been keenly focused on. While also bring those folks to the polls early and take advantage of the early voting where they can. But certainly Michigan a key part of the Harris campaign strategy as well.",

That, of course, are events targeted at black voters, the faith-based community. And the message to those voters is that this is not a performative exercise for her, that she grew up in the black faith tradition, and that it informs her values and her leadership style. But listen, the campaign thinks that they have a lot of voters to reach in this state, not only black voters, Asian and Latino voters, the diverse parts of the Democratic coalition, but also conservative voters in this state as well. We have seen in past election cycles, in the midterms that there are a sizable number of Republicans in this state, non-Trump Republican split ticket voters.

But if you then look at what Joe Biden did in 2020, he completely over performed what Hillary Clinton did. He won the state by more than 154,000 votes.We have not seen Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin not vote together since 1988 you heard Kristen talking about how they - the Trump team believes they can pick off Michigan.

And this is what is so critical, Oakland County is not what we would call a swing County. It hasn't voted Republicans since 1992 but this is - when we - you hear us say all the time, margins matter. This is what we mean.So look at the results in Oakland County when Hillary Clinton, who won the county but lost the state overall in 2016 was running against Trump. She won Oakland County by 53,000 votes, eight percentage points, okay? And that was not enough in a Democratic performing county. That was not enough of a margin to help her win the state. Look at what Joe Biden did four years later in Oakland County. He won it by 14 percentage points. He wanted by 108,000. In fact, 70 percent of his statewide margin that we showed before comes from his victory margin here in Oakland County. So this is precisely why are we seeing both candidates there, because this is precisely the kind of place where Harris needs to perform at Biden levels in the suburbs, right, and where Trump says, I'm coming back to narrow those margins, because that's how I won this state in 2016 that's why we see them both in Oakland County today.",

First of all, the IDF has been publishing on a routine basis, multiple times during the day, footage of what they are doing. In other words, not only do they have a narrative, here's proof of what we're doing. They are opening themselves up to the world for evaluation and criticism as it comes after him, but they - the key thing here, I think, you could flip this and say, look, is this gloating? Are we, in fact, trying to put a focus on this incredibly bad guy? And we terminated him as quickly as we could, and you saw him suffering, you know, sitting down in this chair, in this rubble, and this is what, this is what your leader is all about. That's another way to look at it.And the comparison with what happened with Osama bin Laden and very quietly, the United States dumped him in the ocean before anybody could really celebrate him, is, I think, a false narrative at this point. Israel has been incredibly open about what they're doing and allowing others to evaluate it.",
