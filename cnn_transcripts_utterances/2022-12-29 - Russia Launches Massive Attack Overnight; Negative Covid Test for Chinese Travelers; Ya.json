Overnight, Ukraine rocked by a barrage of Russian missiles. The defense minister saying it's the most massive missile attack since the invasion began in February. We know power is out in several regions, including parts of the capital Kyiv. We are going to be live on the ground ahead. Plus, the U.S. reinstating Covid tests for travelers coming from China as Beijing drops its own restrictions despite an overwhelming surge in cases. And a fresh apology from Southwest Airlines today. Plus, new steps the airline is taking to reimburse passengers whose holiday travel was ruined. Still, more than 2,300 Southwest flights canceled today. But we are told the scheduling nightmare could end as soon as tomorrow. Let's begin this morning on the ground in Ukraine. CNN senior international correspondent Ben Wedeman is in Kyiv, where air defense systems have been activated. Ben, you saw firsthand some of this damage. Tell us what the last few hours have been like.",

But in being intercepted, debris from those missiles fell to the ground, and there were several locations where that falling debris has caused serious damage.First, we went to one house where there's a huge crater right next to it, and several of the walls were just completely destroyed, all the windows shattered. There were two men living inside. One aged father and his adult son. They were sleeping on the other side of the house. But the impact caused, for instance, their car to set on fire. In another location, more debris fell near a house where there was a 14-year-old girl who was caught under the rubble. Her -- we spoke to her grandmother, who spoke to her on the phone while she was still cause under the rubble, hysterical, desperate to - for help. Nearby, her mother was injured in that falling debris, as well as a man nearby. Now, we saw that the rescue services, cleanup crews were already on the scene taking care of it. But we understand that in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city in the eastern part of the country, as a result of those missile barrages, one man was killed, four of the missiles hit targets inside Kharkiv itself. We understand these are described as critical infrastructure. What we know is, for instance, here in Kyiv, 40 percent of the power is no longer functioning. The mayor has told people to stock up on water and, if possible, charge their cell phones. In the far west of the country, the city of Lviv, 90 percent of the electricity has been knocked out. So, it appears that this is, indeed, one of the largest missile barrages the country has experienced. Now, the commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian armed forces says 69 missiles were fired at Ukraine, 54 were brought down by the air defenses, as well as 11 of those Shahed Iranian-supplied cruise missiles.

A regional health chief says almost 50 percent of passengers arriving at Italy's Milan airport from China tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday. And you've said that the pace at which they're unwinding their zero Covid strategy is alarming. That number seems alarming. What do you expect to see happen? DR. YANZHONG HUANG, DIRECTOR, CENTER FOR GLOBAL HEALTH STUDIES AT SETON HALL UNIVERSITY: Well, I'm not surprised if you have 50 percent of passengers arriving in Milan are testing positive because now we're seeing the unbridled spread of Covid in China that the very likely 40 percent of the population are going to - have already been infected.

This comes after CNN's K-file uncovered more falsehoods from Santos, including claims he was forced to leave a New York City private school when his family's finances took a hit, and that he berated Goldman Sachs while representing the company at a top financial conference. CNN Washington correspondent Sunlen Serfaty is joining me now. And, Sunlen, we're learning a lot. It seems like there's just more every day.

The first one is that Santos claimed that he attended and went to this very elite private school in New York, and he said it was only then that he had to leave because his family fell on hard times financially. Well, there is no record, according to the school, of him ever having attended that private school. Also, Santos says that he attended a financial conference as an employee from -- by Goldman Sachs. And while he was there, he said he spoke out against the company and they're plan on investing in renewables. Well, we previously knew that he never worked at Goldman Sachs. But the new part of this hear is that, according to the event planners, there's no record of him appearing at that panel, nor appearing at the conference at all. He was never registered. Also, additional new family claims that he made about his family background. First that he claimed his mother immigrated from Europe to Brazil. But CNN's review of this found that she was actually born in Brazil. Also questions about claims that he made over his family name, claims that his mother had used a historically Jewish name. That is something that genealogists working with CNN found there is no evidence of. No evidence of Jewish or Ukrainian heritage in his family tree. Now, Santos has not responded to these new allegations yet, Jessica, but it's notable that this is all coming as federal prosecutors, as you noted at the top, are investigating his finances. And we also know from the county that they are looking into it as well. They are looking into these fabrications and they say, quote, the numerous fabrications and inconsistencies associated with Congressman-elect Santos are nothing short of stunning.

So what he's going to do is, even if this goes to two or three rounds of voting, really try to present himself as the best possible scenario to keep the Republican caucus in line. It will be nothing short of a disaster if the Republican caucus cannot come up with someone to be a speaker leading them into this new Congress. And so that's going to be McCarthy's pitch.
