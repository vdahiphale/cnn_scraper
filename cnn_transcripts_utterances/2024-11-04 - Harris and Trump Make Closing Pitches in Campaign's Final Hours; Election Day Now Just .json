The first polling places begin closing just 24 hours from now. And tonight, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are making a last-minute push for every undecided voter with dueling rallies in the all important battleground state of Pennsylvania.Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. Right now, we're on the cusp of one of the most consequential elections in American history with the first polls closing in just 24 hours. Both candidates laser focused on seven key battleground states, a collection of Electoral College votes that will either send Donald Trump back to the White House or choose the first ever female president in Kamala Harris. Tonight, CNN journalists are covering the final hours of this truly historic contest from locations across the United States. Let's go first to CNN's Jeff Zeleny. He's following the Harris campaign in Philadelphia for us right now. Jeff, the vice president is spending election eve in Pennsylvania with two more star-studded events.",

But only twice in the last half century have Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin voted differently. So, the Harris campaign believes that these three states are their most straightforward path to the White House. But as she's campaigning earlier today in Allentown, Pennsylvania, she said, it's time to turn the page.

Of course, both she and former President Donald Trump have been crisscrossing one another. But she is really putting it all on the line in Pennsylvania.But, Wolf, she's closing in a far different way than even she's been doing in the last couple days. She was drawing a sharp contrast with the former president, calling him a fascist. No more. She is focusing on trying to have an optimistic, hopeful message for the future. But, Wolf, there is a sense of optimism in her candidacy, but there also are still ghosts of the 2016 campaign hanging over all of this. Of course, Hillary Clinton lost Pennsylvania. She had her final rally right here in Philadelphia as well. But the Harris campaign says they have a stronger ground game and they are not going to repeat that. Wolf, there is no question, anticipation is building here on the cusp of history. One person not talking about that history is Vice President Harris. She said she still has work to do. Wolf?",

It was a place that offered him the narrowest victory he had in 2020. But, clearly, they saw something in the polls there that made them decide to go back all weekend long, then two rallies in Pennsylvania today.[18:05:03] As Jeff said, both sides believe Pennsylvania is the key to the White House this time around. Donald Trump's team says they feel cautiously optimistic, but they, again, aren't leaving anything on the line, so about two rallies there, and then ending here in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Notably, both Pennsylvania and Michigan States, he won in 2016 and then ended up losing in 2020. Now, one of the most interesting things about where he's ending tonight, this is the exact same city and the exact same arena that he finished out his 2016 campaign in. And Donald Trump is known for being superstitious, and that is certainly part of the reason that they are trying to replicate the results of 2016, part of the reason they are here tonight. Wolf?",

And he also said that he wouldn't mind if someone shot through reporters in order to get to him.Now, what we just heard is his messaging today. While it might sound out there for some, that is actually Donald Trump sticking to his own messaging. His team says that they heard that he heard from allies that he understood what was at stakes and so they have kept him focused for the last several rallies. We'll see, of course, what happens when he gets on the ground here in Grand Rapids.

You know, based on their data, they say that if a third of the remaining registered black voters in the state show up and vote, they'll meet Biden's 2020 number. And if 40 percent of them show up, they'll surpass Biden's number with black voters in North Carolina. So, I think there's a lot of votes still outstanding. I think the gender split that we've seen in a lot of the early vote would suggest that Harris is on a path.

We still sometimes get a person or two in a group that might be going back to Donald Trump, but, generally speaking, she has made her case to a lot of these voters.

But the lower you go down by age group, the more dramatic you're seeing the gap between men and women, where women are breaking for Kamala Harris, young women are breaking for Kamala Harris at just historic levels. And Donald Trump is trying to make that up by really turning out these low propensity male voters. That's why he's spent so much time doing this sort of male-dominated podcast.I just think that when it comes down to it, if you were going to stake your election on a group of people, I might be generally more comfortable with women actually showing up to vote. And also the fact is there are just more women and they make up a bigger share of the electorate. And so we're already seeing in some of the early voting numbers, just an incredibly high turnout among women in that Selzer poll we saw out of Iowa.

The Republican Party has also badly fumbled this issue since the Dobbs decision came down in the summer of 2022, they, you know, are consistently messaging to women that, you know, they're not going to protect their rights.And I think that the Harris campaign has been really smart about how she has jumped on this because she hasn't made this about the fact that she herself is a woman. And she has really kept the focus of the messaging on here's what me, as president of the United States, here's what my administration will mean for you. Not here's what you voting for me will mean for me. And it would have been very easy, I think, in an election where a big driver is going to be this question of how women turn out to do that.

But beyond these cars, there is that metal fence. It is an iron fence. There is a tent for media. Media will not be able to easily access the interior of the building, and that's for security reasons. And then ringing the top of this building are cameras. There will also be drones in the air, and this entire building will be protected by law enforcement. All of this is because of the real threat and concern about any violence on the very place. This is where the ballots are being counted. So, this is what it looks like on the outside. I want you to take a look at what it looks like on the inside. This is video that is being produced by the county. It is a live picture. There are 21 cameras at the various spots where ballots are being tabulated, a couple of drop box throughout this county, and this is all for the purpose of transparency. The other warning we got from the county is that voters need to know tomorrow on Election Day that this is a long ballot and there will be lines. I want you to listen to a county official.

There's going to be a police officer in place. When the polls close for the day, they have to take those memory sticks, which had the ballot images. They have the ballot tallies and bring them here to this warehouse. They are going to have a police escort to bring them here to the warehouse and here at this warehouse, they are going to be a police presence 24/7 for as long as this vote counting takes. And, of course, that's to keep election workers. That's to keep the process safe and secure. And we have seen conservative criticism ramping up of the county even before any of this counting gets under way. Part of it is Republicans up concerns that illegal ballots have been cast over the weekend. And they have been challenging these absentee ballots that voters are taking to election offices like the hub, hand delivering, hand returning. Now, there's ongoing litigation about this, but officials here in the state of Georgia believe that is a completely legal process. A judge agreed with them over the weekend. Again, that hasn't stopped the flood of concerns we've seen from Republicans. And everyone is hoping for a safe, secure and fast election day tomorrow. But again, a number of security provisions in place in the event that anything does pop up at a polling location or at a vote counting center like this one, Wolf.",
