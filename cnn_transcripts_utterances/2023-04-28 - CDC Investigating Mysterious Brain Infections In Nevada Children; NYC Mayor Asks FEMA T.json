Elizabeth, walk us through these symptoms. What are they seeing? DR. ELIZABETH COHEN, CNN SENIOR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Doctors in Clark County, Nevada, Boris, were seeing more children than they're used to seeing. This is an unusual event. But they were seeing more. Let's take a look at what the numbers say. Before Covid, they were seeing about four cases of brain abscesses, infections in the brain in children. And then when they looked in 2022, it was 18. So they saw the numbers go up and up during the pandemic. And those numbers, again, still very strong. There is no other documentation of this happening in other places in the U.S. But doctors do, in other places, are telling CNN sort of anecdotally they're seeing more of these. These are infections that can often start, say, in the mouth. Maybe sort of the child has a cavity or something like that or a sinus infection and that can sometimes travel into the brain -- Boris?",

That is in June. Well, Bethany Funke got an attorney and she didn't want to do that. So Bethany Funke, we do know, was in the house. She was on the first floor.
