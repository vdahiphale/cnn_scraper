Ahead this hour, facing arrest, Israel's Prime Minister rejects the decision by the world's top court, but many countries say they will comply.Donald Trump hit with his first political loss of the transition. He has to find a quick replacement in another key MAGA loyalist. And mystery solved, the missing Wisconsin kayaker who faked his own death has been found. We begin with the arrest warrants issued for the Israeli Prime Minister and former defense minister. Key countries in Europe, the Middle East, even Canada are all agreeing to comply with the International Criminal Court's ruling, which would mean arresting Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant if given the opportunity. The ICC has accused the Israeli leaders of war crimes and crimes against humanity, including starvation as a method of warfare, and murder, persecution and other inhumane acts. Here's what the ICC's chief prosecutor told CNN's Christiane Amanpour back in May for the decision to issue those arrest warrants. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

At least 10 people were brought to hospital in a critical condition. The attack took place in the Kurram District, where clashes between Sunni and Shiites have killed dozens in recent months. And it comes just a week after authorities reopened a highway that had been closed due to violence. No one has claimed responsibility so far.Donald Trump has a new choice for U.S. Attorney General after his first pick stepped aside. She is former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. A long-time Trump supporter recently worked for the America First Policy Institute, a right-leaning think tank. Trump's original pick, former Congressman Matt Gaetz, withdrew from consideration earlier Thursday. Sources telling CNN exclusively that the House Ethics Committee learned of a second sexual encounter between Gaetz and an underage minor. Gaetz has denied any wrongdoing. Trump posted on social media that \"Gaetz was doing very well, but did not want to be a distraction for the administration. Matt has a wonderful future, and I look forward to watching all the great things he would do.\" With Gaetz out of the running for attorney general, critics are likely to turn up the heat on a number of other controversial picks. CNN's Brian Todd has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Matt Gaetz is gone, but Donald Trump's headaches with troubled cabinet picks persist. DAVID MARCHICK, CO-AUTHOR, THE PEACEFUL TRANSFER OF POWER:  It's really not just one nominee. This is like the Star Wars bar scene of nominees. There's a whole host of problems with the entire slate. TODD (voice-over):  There's Pete Hegseth, the president-elect's choice for defense secretary. CNN has obtained a police report with details from a female accuser, where she alleges that, in 2017, Hegseth blocked her from leaving a hotel room, took her cell phone from her and sexually assaulted her. Hegseth denies the allegations, says the encounter was consensual, and he was not charged with a crime in connection with the incident. Tulsi Gabbard, Trump's pick to be the director of National Intelligence, wrote bills while she was a congresswoman supporting two of the most notorious intelligence leakers in history, Julian Assange and Edward Snowden, according to new reporting from CNN. Gabbard did not respond to CNN's request for an interview. She's already been blistered for her past support of Syria's brutal dictator Bashar al- Assad and for supporting Russia's invasion of Ukraine, including criticism from fellow Republican and former presidential candidate Nikki Haley. NIKKI HALEY, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N. UNDER TRUMP:  DNI, Department of National Intelligence, this is not a place for a Russian, Iranian, Syrian, Chinese sympathizer. TODD (voice-over):  Linda McMahon, Trump's selection to be education secretary is accused in a recent lawsuit of knowingly enabling the sexual exploitation of children by an employee of World Wrestling Entertainment, which she used to head. McMahon denies the allegations. Then there's Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump's pick for Health and Human Services secretary. Health experts have sounded multiple alarms over Kennedy's stance against vaccinations and his false conspiracy theories about the COVID virus. This past summer, \"Vanity Fair\" magazine published allegations that Kennedy had sexually assaulted a former nanny for his family. Kennedy sidestepped the accusations. ROBERT F. KENNEDY, JR., FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I am not a church boy. TODD (voice-over):  What do all these picks say about Trump's transition process overall?",

She is obviously a MAGA acolyte. She was involved in, you know, the defense on his first impeachment in lawsuits about the 2020 election. But she is someone who comes out of a mainstream legal tradition to a much greater degree than Matt Gaetz. She was a local prosecutor. She was an elected attorney general. And you've got to think that there are lines for her as well in the same way that we're talking about with regards to the Senate that are going to be firmer than they would have been for Matt Gaetz.

China is the world's top manufacturing country, making about 30 percent of all of the stuff used around the world.

No surprise, China is also the world's top exporter, shipping almost $3.4 trillion worth of goods globally.

Everything that's needed to make anything the entire supply chain, it's already here. And once things are made, China has the means to move merchandise quickly.
