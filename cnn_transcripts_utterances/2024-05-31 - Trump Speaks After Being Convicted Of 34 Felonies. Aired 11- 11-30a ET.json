That that sentence wouldn't happen until after the election if he if he loses. So it would seem that the worse the sentence, the better for him in terms of his martyr rhetoric.",

And in fact, a prison sentence, maybe he gets a sentence, but they expect they hope that it would be stayed immediately, and that it would not go into effect.And so this is all like a short term political strategy. I still think that we should just be aware that there is also a very good possibility that he does not get a prison sentence here.",

And they think that this is going to be the motivating factor.We heard one Republican Hugh Hewitt, a commentator say this is almost like the Dobbs decision for Democrats.

And I'm told that they believe they still have an act of appeal. On Wednesday, they filed a request for expedited review of the gag order with the Court of Appeal. So they believe that is still in progress. As we know, they've been very aggressive about litigating this gag order.All of his gag order violations can be used in the eventual sentencing calculus. So I am sure that they are concerned about that, the lawyers again. But really, it appears that the political concerns are taking are sort of taking center stage here.",

And now again, a candidate who behaves very differently when he is not using a teleprompter than when he is. And his aides have gone out of their way to try to make sure that they control what does happen. And oftentimes, some of the moments that stand out to us the most from his rallies or from other events are times when he's not using the teleprompter.So I think it says a lot about the tone and tenor of what we are likely to hear, I suppose we'll see. I have to say, I'm just -- I am struck by the venue. I mean, I was at the event when he came down the golden escalator and announced he was running for president back in 2015 at Trump Tower, which we are now looking at the outside of. And it is hard not to be struck by just how far we have come as a country over the course of that time that we are now here covering an ex- president current Republican nominee, who has been found guilty on 34 counts.",

He says he would have loved to have testified. He could have testified. It was his decision not to testify. He said, quote, I would have loved to have testified. And then he went over, he went after some of the witnesses, including Michael Cohen, for example, potentially a violation to the gag order that has been imposed by the judge against him.Erin, we're going to continue to listen to what the former president has to say.

      "sentences": "A whole bunch of lies here, Wolf, so he repeated the one I think he's repeated most frequently throughout the course of the trial. And now after seeing this was all done by Biden and his people, the case was in conjunction with the White House and DOJ not a shred of evidence of that. This case was brought by a locally elected, yes, Democratic prosecutor, no evidence whatsoever of any communication with Joe Biden or his aides about it. He also repeated his claim from earlier this week that he said the judge wouldn't let them use an election expert under any circumstances. The judge knocked him out.Now he did sort of clarify this after but here's the real clarification. The judge did not bar the testimony of this expert Brad Smith. Trump's defense was permitted to call him but didn't. The judge did limit the scope of the testimony saying he couldn't opine on whether Trump broke the law or not, couldn't analyze federal election law but did not say the expert could not be used. And Trump also repeated his claim, Wolf, that crime in New York is at levels nobody's ever seen before. As anyone who lived through the early 1990s in New York knows that is not remotely true. For example, murders in New York, there are 391 last year, well, there were 2,262 in 1990. So not even close, and it's further come down this year. And lastly, Wolf, former President Trump said that Michael Cohen got in trouble with the law for stuff that had nothing to do with him, Trump, he said, oh, it's Cohen's taxi medallion business and so on. Well, that is misleading at best because, yes, Cohen did get in trouble for lying about his taxes, lying about things related to the taxi medallion business, but also got in trouble for campaign finance offenses related to the very same hush money scheme that Trump got in trouble for, so directly related to Trump. And his prison sentence, Wolf, was also related to Cohen lying to Congress related to a negotiations or discussions with Russia about a proposed Trump Tower project in Moscow. So this was not, you know, Cohen's own thing. Oh, nothing to do with Trump. Some of it at least was directly related to the former president.",

And at one point, he said, well, I'm not going to say the person's name, that doesn't get you out of a potential gag order violation. It's obvious who he's talking about. But I will say Judge Merchan has been very careful in the way he's applied this gag order. And there were a few occasions where the D.A. said, this is a violation. And the judge said no, because Trump's allowed to respond to things that Michael Cohen and others say about him publicly.Michael Cohen certainly did the media rounds last night, had some things to say about Trump. So it may be that the judge finds that this is a response. What he said about Michael Cohen was largely inaccurate in the ways that Daniel just laid out though.",
