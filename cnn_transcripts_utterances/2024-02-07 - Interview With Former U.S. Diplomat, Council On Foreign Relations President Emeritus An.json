But in a press conference tonight, Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, says it's not happening, and the counteroffensive will continue apace.

So, I just don't understand the logic that so many more days or weeks or months of Israeli military activity will solve the problem for them, and it still doesn't obviously include anything about what would come afterwards in terms of governance. So, I don't think a lot of people in Israel are going to be persuaded by that. And, obviously, he's going to be -- come under pressure to at least not reject out of hand what Hamas is offering because it does open up the possibility of getting the remaining hostages back. So, I heard what the prime minister said, but it seems to me not a not a sustainable position to simply say, we're going to continue doing what we're doing, and we're not interested in anything that's being discussed.",

But you don't need massive military operations to do that. I would think something much more discreet or measured or targeted is what you might have in mind. It's also, by the way, one of the reasons I have trouble imagining any Israeli government, agreeing to an absolute open-ended ceasefire. If the day after they agreed to it, they somehow got intelligence that they could get this or that Hamas leader, it's hard for me to imagine, at least -- I don't know about you, but it's hard for me to imagine them not them not acting on it. So, again, I could see the Israelis signing up to some type of a cessation of major military operations. I find hard to imagine them signing up to an unconditional absolute open-ended ceasefire.",

Basically, another pause with various hostage and prisoner, exchanges. And then you've got the Hamas idea, which is a much longer, but also calls for Israeli withdrawal, which is a big, big thing and essentially an end to the conflict. And I -- that -- it's almost what Hamas has put on the table, Christiane, is a return to what existed before October 7th. And that's -- you know, my guess is that's a bridge too far for Israelis. So, I think what Tony Blinken ought to be doing is work on something that doesn't rule out what Hamas is putting out there or something ambitious, but one step at a time. So, I think the idea of continuing to press for a limited pause, whether it's a month, six weeks, two months, what have you, with aid going in, hostages coming out, some prisoners being exchanged, I think is the smartest way to go, and it doesn't rule out something more ambitious down the road.",

But Israel wants to be secure and prosperous and a Jewish democratic state. But what you see Bibi Netanyahu doing here is pushing back against the United States. And I think this is part of his long-term political goal. Obviously, he wants, to stay in office as long as he can. He wants to stay in office, in part, to stay out of prison. He wants to stay in office and prosecute the war. He's hoping he can basically say what I did was justified. I don't think he'd mind staying in office until after the November election in the United States and the hope that Donald Trump would be the next president, here. So, what I think you see is the Israeli prime minister essentially beginning to occupy the political space in Israel and to some extent here of standing up to Joe Biden, to the United States, even though this administration has had his and Israel's back ever since October 7th.",

And you make a really good point. It's one of the reasons. If he is not going to play the game, if you will, by the normal rules about how the United States and Israel, two close friends, if you will, allies, how we conduct our diplomacy, then the United States has to think about playing the game somewhat differently too. President Biden has been extraordinarily supportive, but also restrained in his criticisms. And what I think this teaches us is he's not -- that's not going to be enough. And I think he has to go over the head of this prime minister, speak to the rest of the government, speak to Israeli society. And I think he has to make the case for whatever it is the United States thinks, need, saying, and doing when it comes to how the war ought to be prosecuted, the terms for ending it, and ultimately, what the political dimension needs to be that gets introduced into the equation. So, yes. We've got to continue to deal with Bibi Netanyahu. He's the prime minister, like it or not. But the United States needs a much larger approach to the rest of the government and to Israeli society. And I think that's the message to take away from this.",

The U.N. is now saying malnutrition is stalking, you know, really significant parts of Gaza, maybe 12 times, apparently, you know, more than before October 7th.

So, that's why, again, I think the United States has to be prepared to put forward its own policies. I mentioned just a minute ago publicly in Israel, I think the time has come for the United States to consider drafting and tabling its own resolution in the U.N. Security Council. If we don't have an Israeli partner in this prime minister and in this in this right-wing government, then I think we have to, United States, be willing to take a more independent course internationally at the U.N. and also on what we say to the Israeli public. And I think after, what, nearly what, four months of this war, it is clear to me that this prime minister and this president are not on the same page. And we can't operate in the hopes that that will change. So, again, I think the United States has to be more independent and more forceful in advocating for what it thinks is right.",

He's watching what's going on the battlefield, and he thinks things are finally beginning to move in his favor. He wants to play for time. So, to me, what's most important is, in Washington on the ground there, that we find a way to extend to Ukraine a new tranche of support, even if not as large as it could or should be. I think Ukraine has to adopt a strategy, as it's beginning to, that puts most of the focus on defensive operations, which require less, in the way of resources. The idea of militarily liberating territory is simply not on for the foreseeable future. We need to start accelerating the development of an autonomous Ukrainian arms and ammunition industry, so they're less reliant or dependent on outsiders, including the United States. We've got to disabuse Putin of the -- of his confidence that time is his friend. But, you know, this year, I don't think, you know, there's any place particularly for diplomacy. Our goal ought to be to make sure that Ukraine can maintain at least a stalemate. And then I think if President Biden wins, then I think there's potentially some diplomatic possibilities because that ought to disabuse puke Putin of the notion that time is on his side. If Donald Trump wins, I'm hoping that by then, Ukraine and the European -- Europeans have somewhat filled our place, and Ukraine has become a little bit more self-sufficient and self-reliant.

But what I want to ask you is this, because, you know, the narrative has been that the Ukrainians are really, really, really demanding, pleading for the kind of combat aircraft that would give them air superiority.

So, the Ukrainians have been choosing the time and place of exercising some superiority in the air because they don't -- you're quite right, they don't have the capability of commanding the skies in every place in Ukrainian air airspace, but they're denying the Russians that kind of superiority. And the air defense capabilities that they have begun to, I think, really need extra help with now and assistance, that is an area that, I think, we should be placing great emphasis on bolstering their air defenses. They have their own indigenous air defenses, but we need to be able to bolster what has been provided by NATO allies.",

If not with a major package, we need to be looking at other ways to get them help. And things like using the interest payments against their frozen assets, in, Belgium in Brussels.

And, again, with the Russians ready to take a lot of casualties, to throw their soldiers into the meat grinder, as we were saying over the summer. So, in 2020 hindsight, it probably would have been a good thing to try to keep some momentum going with the Ukrainian attacks at that time. But remember, there was a good deal of concern during that period that the Russians were actually threatening the use of tactical nuclear weapons. And I know that that concerned many in Washington.

So, you know, we're looking at varying percentages. We see about half of Iowa caucus goers, a solid percentage in New Hampshire, and we'll see going forward people voting against him, which if you think of Trump as being kind of a de facto incumbent is a remarkable number. But it's very much true, the majority of the party is behind him. What we see on the Democratic side is different. There's not really any energy behind any of the challenges to him, whether that's Marianne Williamson or Dean Phillips, as we've seen most recently in South Carolina results where they both clocked in around 2 percent. But what you see is a lack of enthusiasm, and also sort of a continuing hope maybe that something will happen and Biden will jump out and drop out of the race and somebody else will end up in that place.

You know, among Republican primary voters, we see his support only strengthening since those charges. We've seen his rivals were unable to capitalize on that. And in fact, we're often blasting the charges themselves. So, that's another way in which I think you're right. They're not really exactly the same thing. The sorts of concerns you have are very different.

And those people who voted against Trump in the primary in 2016. And then, for the most part, they got in line, or they left the Republican Party. There's also people who are upset about the charges and think that it's dangerous. They -- you know, January 6th was a sort of alienating event for them. That was when it went too far. And I think the third group is people who have issues with Trump, but maybe will come around. And these are people who have said, again, since 2016, you know, you hear people, well, I like that he tells it how it is, or I like this or that. But, you know, I wish he wouldn't talk that much or I wish he wouldn't say it that way, or I wish you wouldn't tweet those things.

They sort of spun their wheels until suddenly Trump was the nominee. I think what we see, for example, on the Republican side is the Trump apparatus and the Trump base, which is not a majority of the part of the country and a majority of the party, but not a huge one, not an overwhelming majority, is able to make these things happen. So, it's not so much about the RNC itself, it's more about the basis in these parties and these coalitions that have managed to sort of hijack the primary and make it go to place they go, without the sort of moderating influence of a party establishment that might say, well, we understand that this guy appeals to our heartstrings, but we need somebody who's going to win a general election. The people who are coming out to vote for Trump, in many cases, aren't concerned about the general election, or they think that Trump will win anyway, they think he has one, but they they're sort of voting expressively for somebody who speaks to their concerns, even if another candidate is on paper, more electable.

But it's more about him saying the right things and the right tone of voice and standing up to the right people. And on the Democratic side, I think you see that the lack of enthusiasm is the same way. You know, Biden's victory in 2020 was really about being able to sort of be enough to enough people. And what you see the splintering is people are saying, well, wait a second, I disagree with him on this. I disagree with him on that. And, you know, there's a real division among Democratic strategists and pollsters who I've talked to about whether Democrats will come home. Some think, well, these are Democrats. They're pragmatic. Eventually, they're going to see, do we really want Trump? But I think there's some voters who will say, this guy just isn't -- he isn't doing it for me.

I mean, you can definitely find support for that. I think the question is whether they are offering a real solution. You know, I think what's interesting about what they're doing is they're offering valid access and they're going to choose a candidate, but then they're going to kind of turn things over to this candidate to come up with their own platform. So, it's a quasi-party. It's not clear what they -- you know, what they stand for. I think there are a lot of problems with this idea as much as I understand the motivation behind it and agree with their analysis that a lot of voters want another alternative. One is that, although there is a thirst for some sort of moderate difference, once you start getting into the actual specifics of policy, people get really divided. And there are voters who simply don't like the parties or voters who care about one thing or another, but you're going to start getting people splitting on things like abortion, on things like immigration, and I think they're going to run into trouble there. And the other problem is structural. I mean, a third-party candidate just has so many disadvantages. There's very little prospect of them winning states in the electoral college, much less winning a majority in the electoral college. And so, then you have them in a position of maybe playing spoiler, which they say they're not doing, or maybe sort of playing some kind of coalition kingmaker, which they have talked about. But I'm not sure how that works in the American system. I mean, we have an entire apparatus that's built around two parties.

How do we see those depolarize? You know, what could bring us back from that? And I have to say, I haven't heard a lot of hopeful answers. We just don't see a lot of cases where countries without a major shock have gone from something -- a situation like this to a less polarized one. And I think the U.S. system is unusual and that it is a two-party system. We don't have alternatives in the same way. And so, that also locks things in a little bit.
