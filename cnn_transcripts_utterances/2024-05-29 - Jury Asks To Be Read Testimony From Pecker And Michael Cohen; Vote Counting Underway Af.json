You don't often see the level of -- it is not a huge amountof selling, but the market was down at the open and it never recovered, it didn't even show signs of wanting to recover. That big red block tells us quite a bit about the markets, but we must look elsewhere in our day and the markets the main events. The jury in Donald Trump's hush money trial are asking to hear back four key sections of evidence. South Africans have voted in the biggest test of the ANC's power in three decades. And one of Britain's oldest institutions may have a new foreign owner, the Royal Mail accepts an offer from a Czech billionaire. Busy hour together, let's make sure we get to the other side. Live from New York. It is Wednesday, May the 29th. I am Richard Quest, and as always, with you, I mean business. Good evening. Donald Trump's fate is now in the hands of the jury. The 12 men and women have been deliberating for more than four hours. A short while ago, they asked to have parts of the testimony read back to them. The testimony included what David Pecker and Michael Cohen said about a meeting at Trump Tower, two key evidence. When he gave their jury instructions, Judge Juan Merchan reminded them speculation was not enough. The prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt every element of the crime. Jim Sciutto, is with me. We will get to the request for that Pecker testimony, we are hearing why they might be focusing, but give me a feel for the morning and how it was. You had the two summations, the judge's instructions and then jury go and do your work.",

For four hours and 34 minutes, as you can see on the clock there, a jury has beenconsidering the guilt or innocence on multiple felony counts of a former president for the first time, and of course, a current candidate for president. They have weighty decisions before them on these counts. This morning, you had about 90 minutes of jury instructions which are quite crucial to this case because while the general story of the case alleged payments to pay off someone so a story doesn't come out during election that might damage the president, while that is relatively simple to understand, that allegation -- the law behind it and particularly the law as it relates to elevating this from a misdemeanor to a felony is more complicated. And we should note, a second note sent by the jurors to the judge, which as we understand it is asking for those jury instructions to be read back to them. So Richard, it is quite clear at this point that this jury on their first day deliberations, four hours in, is quite hard at work here. They've sent their second note, this one about jury instructions. Their prior note, as you noted, related to specific testimony which we can get into greater detail and I see Elie Honig is joining me now. I will always defer to attorney, but just in summary, that earlier note related to specific testimony --",

He has just announced his candidacy two months before this. So this is chapter one according to the prosecutors, but I have to talk about what just happened because this is something I have been trying cases and covering cases for a long time. I have never seen this before. The jury just sent a second note a little bit before four o'clock saying, we want to hear the legal instructions all over again. Now, this morning, the judge read the jury the standard legal instructions. It is about a 50-page long document. It took an hour and change. It often happens that a jury will come back and say, hey, Judge, we'd like to hear a certain part of the jury instruction. Can you please give us the part again about campaign law?

Its origins date back to King Henry VIII. It is 500-year-old institution. There is an entire museum in London dedicated to celebrating its history. But sadly, that has become something of a sorry tale in recent years. It has been loss-making for several years. Last year, it was fined several million pounds by the communications regulator for failing to deliver its letters and parcels on time, a pretty fundamental part of its business. It has suffered strikes and of course, faces growing competition from rival delivery services. But Daniel Kretinsky, the Czech billionaire sees an opportunity.",

It has been trying to get out of the set of six days a week part of that. It is a vital piece of national infrastructure, a key public service. It employs 130,000 workers and Kretinsky has made a huge commitment to upholding that service. He has made commitments to employees. You know, he sees opportunity, but I will say, Richard, shareholders appear skeptical. The share price in IDS, Royal Mail's gained -- the shares gained four percent today, but they still closed well below the offer price. So clearly shareholders are worried that the deal may not pass must, and of course, the national security review could take place under a new government with UK elections around the corner.

In the U.K., the ABI says they're up 13 percent. It's not a disaster that are becoming much more common. Putting pressure on homeowners, putting the viability of insurance into question. This is Bruce Carnegie-Brown, the chair of Lloyds of London, who joins me now in New York. All right. I'm going to get this off my chest. My Lloyds of London policy, which is, all right, it's a beach house, it's not on the beach, but it's close, went up 40 percent. 40. Why? BRUCE CARNEGIE-BROWN, CHAIR, LLOYD'S OF LONDON: So I think there are three reasons, Richard, why our policy is probably going up in price. The first is the value of your property is going up in price. The second thing is persistent inflation is pushing out the replacement costs to your property, materials and the building contractors. And thirdly, as you identified in your introduction, natural catastrophe disasters are increasing in frequency and severity, and this is having quite a big impact on the cost of insurance.",

But as an industry, what point do you start getting worried that people just won't insure because they can't afford it? CARNEGIE-BROWN: Well, that is the problem. So it is important that insurance is both available and affordable. Otherwise, people don't buy it. And when you think about the math in insurance, well, it's really important just that we are insuring unexpected outcomes. If the outcomes are expected then of course the value of insurance breaks down because ultimately the claim and the premium are the same number. And so when incidents like natural catastrophes are on the increase, it's really important that we begin to build more resilience into our economy in order to make our homes, our buildings, our lives safer, so that insurance can do its job, which is to pay the claims for unexpected losses.",

So more of the premium that you pay goes to provide protection to you. It's about innovation and what can we do to help mitigate against the risks that we see developing.
