This new poll from The New York Times and Siena College finding Harris has a four-point lead over Trump among likely voters across the blue wall states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, all states, Trump carried in 2016 that Biden flipped blue in 2020.And Trump just doesn't seem to be handling any of this very well. The former president posting on social media last night, quote, I'm doing really well in the presidential race, leading in almost all of the real polls, and insisting, quote, this 2024 is thus far my best campaign, the most enthusiasm and spirit. Those comments come after a blockbuster piece in The New York Times over the weekend, where Maggie Haberman and Jonathan Swan report that Trump is, quote, a candidate knocked off his bearings, disoriented by his new contest with Kamala Harris and unsure of how to take her on. They write that Trump has no regrets about questioning Harris' black identity, telling donors Friday, quote, I was right. That he's sent angry text messages to a top donor, Miriam Adelson, potentially risking millions of dollars in support. And they report that Trump has repeatedly called Harris the B word in private. The Trump campaign disputes that, telling The Times, quote, that is not language that President Trump has used to describe Kamala. It all paints a portrait of an angry man struggling to run against a woman whose campaign, at least so far is embracing joy. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We've got tropical storm watches in effect for the Leeward Islands and Puerto Rico as it heads that way. Tropical storm force conditions could start as soon as Tuesday and then it makes this turn into the Atlantic, where it could become a hurricane as it heads towards Bermuda. Looking at some four to six inches of rain possible across parts of Puerto Rico. But it's 10 inches possible in some of those higher elevations, and that could cause flash flooding and mudslides. So, here's a look again at the steering kind of where it goes. It makes this turn because in the Eastern U.S. we have this area of high pressure and a stalled front along the east coast, and that's what's going to keep Ernesto out to see. What it's also doing, though, is not really making the situation of all the rain that we got from Debby over the last five days any better for anyone in the Carolinas. We still have some flood watches in effect, and we still have all of these flood warnings along the rivers because they're still reacting to the 10 to 20 inches of rain that they got from Debby. So, you could see still some river rises in the forecast, still up to major flood stage for the Cape Fear River, again could get up to 16 feet and still, again, rising at the Tar River as well. So, we'll continue to see some river conditions could potentially get worse over the next couple of days. Kasie.",
