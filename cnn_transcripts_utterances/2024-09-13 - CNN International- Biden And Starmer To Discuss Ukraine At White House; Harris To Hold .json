It's 05the Russian President warns of war if NATO allows Ukraine to fire deeper into Russia, more trouble at aerospace giant Boeing as 33,000 union workers are on strike. And a shakeup within Israel's defense forces as a top official resigns. Welcome to the show and the stock market is about to open in New York around 30 minutes from now, after four straight days of gains driven by rising tech stocks. Let's check in to see how the futures are doing. As you can see, the DOW and S&amp;P to the positive, NASDAQ slightly lower at this point. But of course, we'll check in on those numbers in around 30 minutes. All right, we start with a blunt and ominous warning from Russia's President to NATO about the war in Ukraine. Vladimir Putin says NATO would be at war with Russia if the alliance allows Ukraine to fire long range missiles into his country. That possibility is under discussion in a number of NATO member nations. And it's sure to be a topic of conversation later today, when U.S. President Joe Biden hosts British Prime Minister Keir Starmer at the White House. I want to bring in Senior White House Reporter now Kevin Liptak, who's been covering the story for us. Good to see you, Kevin. How is Secretary Blinken? How is the United States going to weigh up the risk of escalation after Putin's warning with Ukraine's needs to win this war?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, and I think it's a balance that the U.S. is trying to strike here, and just the fact that thisconversation is happening at all, I think tells you the enormous amount of pressure that President Biden is under to ease some of these restrictions on the American and Western long-range missiles and allow Ukraine to fire them deep into Russia. This is something that President Biden has all but ruled out previously, but the battlefield dynamic on the ground in Ukraine has certainly changed that so has the revelation this week that Iran is providing Russia with its own ballistic missiles. That has changed the calculus in some ways, according to Western officials. And so, you do have this new found conversation underway between the U.S. and its Western allies. And here in Washington, there has been something of a divide within the government about the wisdom of making this change. On the one side, you have officials who continue to be worried about the potential for escalation, and of course, President Biden has been worried about that every time a new capability comes on the table when it comes to Ukraine. You also hear top officials question the effectiveness of this strategy at all. And you heard the Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin give voice to that last week when he said that Russia has already moved a number of its key assets outside of the range of these long-range missiles. And he also raised the fact that this supply of these weapons is not limitless. On the other hand, you have senior members of Congress, including senior Democrats on the Foreign Relations Committee, who say that the risk of escalation is overblown. They point out that President Biden's moves over the last two years have not necessarily caused an escalation with Vladimir Putin, and they say that this kind of capability is necessary for Ukraine to win this war. And so, this will be a topic of discussion when Keir Starmer arrives to the White House later this afternoon. Both of these men recently dispatched their top diplomats to Ukraine to hear from President Zelenskyy directly about why this capability might be necessary. And we did hear from the American Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, afterwards, describing some of this. Listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: Look, a hallmark of what we've done from day one. In fact, even before day one of the Russian aggression against Ukraine in 2022 was to try to make sure that Ukraine has what it needs -- when it needs it, to deal with that aggression. And as what Russia is doing has changed, as the battlefield has changed, we've adapted. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We're going to see an impact on jobs perhaps. We're going to see delays and deliveries of airplanes to U.S. airlines and foreign airlines who have made those purchases, and of course, the union members themselves are going to be off the job. They're going to be getting strike pay, but they're not going to be getting their pay. Boeing, for their part, says in a statement that they really want to get back to the table. They say we're remain committed to reaching and resettling our relationship with our employers in the union and are ready to get back to the table to reach a new agreement. So, they're eager to get back to the table. It's day one of the strikes. So much can happen in just 24 hours. We could see a deal.

      "sentences": "All right. Kristen, I want you to jump in here. Post debate what is the Donald Trump team thinking behind declaring no more debates? I mean,what Kamala Harris was saying is that this could change. What is the sense right now? KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Right now, the answer is, Donald Trump has said there are no more debates. So, they are all saying there are going to be no more debates. Now, I do agree with the Harris advisor, who spoke to CNN on background, who said that Donald Trump often changes his mind. So obviously anything could happen. But after what we saw just a few nights ago with Donald Trump up on that debate stage, it certainly seems unlikely, a reminder that while Donald Trump continues to say that he won the debate, that because when you're in prize fighting the person who loses the one who immediately asked for a rematch, that's why Harris asked for a rematch. That's not what any of the polls indicate. In addition to the polls not indicating that we have heard from Republican allies and advisers, both on the record and on background who say that they were disappointed by his performance on Tuesday, that they didn't like the fact that he let Kamala Harris goad him, that he took the bait, that essentially he strayed from the issues, which was something that ally after ally, advisor after advisor had told him repeatedly to do, to stick to those issues, particularly when it comes to immigration and crime and the economy. But obviously, as we saw on Tuesday, he lost his cool. He was yelling. He went into various conspiracy theories at different times, and he went into some of the same rhetoric that we've heard in the past, not sticking to those three core issues that they believe would actually help him win the White House in November. So why he's not doing the debate? I think it remains clear, but I will tell you I did speak to one senior adviser who said that there is a general thinking that Kamala Harris needs this debate, a second debate, or third overall presidential debate, more than Donald Trump does, that she needs to be out there in front of millions of people, more than Donald Trump does. And I will remind you all of our reporting and all of the polls that we have seen nationwide, from every poll that we count as a credible poll shows that this race is really in the margins, that there is no discernible winner at this time, and both camps see that. Donald Trump's team believes they can eke out a win without doing another debate, and they think Harris is the one who actually needs a debate more than them. Obviously, we won't know if they don't do another debate, but this is just the thinking inside the campaign.",

It's a hospital on wheels evacuating dozens of wounded military personnel away from the Eastern Front as Russia's brutal offensive grinds on. Paramedics carefully loading patient after patient, many of them unconscious onto repurposed carriages. It's a highly organized special operation, and it's never been seen before.

STEWART (voice-over): A Ticketmaster spokesperson told CNN the company doesn't set ticket prices. That's decided by promoters and artists, and they can be fixed or dynamic. It's not the first time Ticketmaster has been under scrutiny. Taylor Swift fans crashed the site trying to book tickets to the eras tour, prompting the DOJ to file an anti-trust suit, which its owner Live Nation called faceless. Ultimately, the stadiums were packed for Swift, and there are always fans willing to pay a high price to see a rock and roll start. Anna Stewart, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

I was going to stick the Lego man up my nose and try to connect the piece on the top of the head, like a little hat. The Lego head popped off in my nose. At this point, I've panicked loudly, and my mom came in. So, she grabs a pair of tweezers, and she, you know, tilts my head back. She fishes out this Lego head. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
