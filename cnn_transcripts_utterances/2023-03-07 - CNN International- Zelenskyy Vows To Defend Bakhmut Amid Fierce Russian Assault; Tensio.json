      "sentences": "It has, Max. And in fact, we're already starting to hear noises from Ukrainian. U.S. officials saying that if Russia were to take Bakhmut that it would be more symbolic than strategic but, of course, it has been a very hard-fought battle. Over the past few months, both sides losing thousands and thousands of men.Now over the past day, according to Ukraine's military, they have repelled some 140 Russian attacks up and down the eastern front, many of those attacks around Bakhmut. Ukrainian -- Russian forces have been trying to encircle those Ukrainian forces in Bakhmut. The Russians being led by that Wagner mercenary group. They have made some gains to the north of the city trying to cut off those main supply routes into Bakhmut. But as you noted, Max, the head of Wagner, Yevgeny Prigozhin complaining that the Ministry of Defense is not giving him that ammunition that his forces need. And that really does highlight the acrimony that has grown between this private mercenary company and the Russian military. Now, Prigozhin also saying that Ukraine is sending more units to reinforce those Ukrainian positions in and around Bakhmut, and that is something that we've also heard from President Zelenskyy. He says that he has met with his top commanders, his top military commanders who recommended to him to keep defending the city, to not retreat, to reinforce those positions. And that's what he says he ordered his generals to do to find other units to send towards Bakhmut to help out those fighting and trying to hold the city. Also, around Bakhmut, Max, we have learned the name of a soldier. That soldier who was so brutally executed in that video that has gone so widespread, presumably executed by Russian soldiers. The Ukrainian Ministry of Defense and the soldiers brigade saying today that his name is Tymofiy Shadura. He was part of the 30th separate mechanized infantry brigade fighting around Bakhmut. So he has been identified but his body is still in Russian controlled territory. Final confirmation would come when his body comes back to Ukraine or back into Ukrainian controlled territory, I should say. But outrage is spreading like wildfire. It is impossible to overstate the fury being felt here in Ukraine after seeing that video from the general population all the way up to President Zelenskyy. Everybody's posting about on social media. And Max, President Zelenskyy has vowed to find the murders of this soldier. Max?",

      "sentences": "Yes, absolutely, Max. I mean we heard that warning from Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Monday saying that there would be that severe punishment for anybody found responsible and affirming that the Iranian authorities are investigating these reports.Now, according to Iran's interior ministry, as cited by state media, a number of people have been arrested in connection with these allegations of poisoning, although it's not clear just yet how many people have been arrested and exactly what role they played in these suspected poisonings. But look, according to the authorities here, they are carrying out an investigation, a fact-finding mission has been set up. And so far, they say they have looked into 5,000 cases. The vast majority of those cases, young schoolgirls, as you said. Then we've heard those accounts from parents, from teachers, from victims themselves, describing feelings of heart palpitations, shortness of breath, numbness in their limbs, and so this is a real cause for concern. However, at this stage, according to the fact- finding mission, who has been looking into this investigation, around 90 percent, they claim were -- these symptoms were the result of anxiety. That's how they've described it. Around 10 percent, maybe less, reportedly in relation to what they've described as suspicious substances. Now, this, of course, doesn't stand with the claims that we're hearing from parents, from the teachers, from the medical staff on the ground. They say, they feel they are being silenced by the authorities, by the regime. One teacher, even telling CNN that he believes his phone is being monitored by the authorities. And despite that, and despite the attempts that we've heard by the authorities to attempt to silence these parents, we have seen protests are taking place across the country. There is a real sense of panic amongst parents who are seeing these schoolgirls reporting, apparently, poisoning. We are seeing a process taking place in parts of the country. And there has been a crackdown, in response to that the use of tear gas and forcible disbursement by the authorities. And of course, it's important to remember the context in which this is all taking place. The Iranian regime itself has faced protests since September, mass protests up and down the country, of course, in relation to the killing of Mahsa Jina Amini in September. There has been a real sense of pressure mounting on the regime, and they have in turn crackdown violently on any sign of dissent against the government. And now there is real concern that the schoolgirls may have been part of a targeted attack by the authorities, although that has been of course, denied by the regime. They say they are still investigating the exact cause behind this and this latest arrest make on some information with regard to that, but we are still waiting for more details from the authorities on that front.

Now according to the President of Mexico, these Americans got caught in a confrontation between two different groups. A U.S. official with knowledge of the investigation, telling CNN that this is most likely a terrible case of mistaken identity, that these Americans were mistaken for Haitian smugglers. Now, there's a lot that we don't know. There is a video that has surfaced and also some photographs that show individuals getting dragged into the bed of a white pickup truck. We're still trying to confirm that those are the actual Americans.
