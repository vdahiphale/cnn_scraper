Israel's political future is on the line, once again, the country's fifth election in less than four years. Voters have six more hours to cast ballots. The turnout so far is the highest since 1999. What happens today could have a major impact on Israel and this entire region. At stake, control of Israel's parliament, the Knesset. Former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud Party could get the most votes. But it is a near certainty he would need to form a coalition to retake power.

What is at stake in the election is not just a referendum on Benjamin Netanyahu whether voters want him in power again or not, that's what we saw over the last four years. Keep in mind Benjamin Netanyahu still facing the ongoing corruption trial. It's also a question about the rise of the far right because for Benjamin Netanyahu's ruling coalition government, it will likely rely on the growing popularity of the far right of Israeli politics, including one leader who was convicted for inciting racism.

That's 8 pm London time, 10 pm in Tel Aviv, that's midnight here in Abu Dhabi, about six hours from now, right here on CNN. Israel's fiercest enemy, Iran, planning to give another helping hand to Russia's illegal war in Ukraine. And this is what we're hearing, at least from Western officials, who tell CNN, Tehran is sending about 1,000 more weapons to Russia, including advanced guided missiles. Now Iran has already supplied deadly drones but this new expected shipment would mark a significant escalation in Iranian support for the Kremlin. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has just been on the phone with his French counterpart discussing, quote, \"specific decisions on strengthening Ukraine's defense capabilities.\" All of this coming a short time after the mayor of Kyiv announced full power is back on in the capital. That was restored just a day after Russian missiles targeted critical infrastructure in Kyiv and across the country. We are covering the major angles for you, with CNN's Kylie Atwood in Washington and CNN Salma Abdelaziz live in Kyiv. I want you to stand by, Salma, if you will.

Of course, we need to consider this in the context of the fact that Russia is going to Iran for these weapons, right? That means they simply don't have enough on their own. They are looking to outsource to continue this war in Ukraine. When it comes to the Biden administration, last week, secretary of state, Tony Blinken, says the U.S. is doing everything they can, including sanctions and potentially other actions to try and break up this network that is allowing these Iranian weapons to go to Russia. You would think therefore going after things such as these shipping companies or the manufacturing companies and the like. So we will be watching for what more the United States does to try to get in the way of these expected weapons continuing to go to Russia. But we are bracing for impact because, if they do go ahead, as we're told, they're expected to come pretty soon, this could have a pretty substantial impact on the battlefield.",

The first is, of course, these drones, the Shahed drones, these Iranian made drones, yes, Iran denying that they're providing them to Russia. But Ukrainians have found them falling on the ground right here in Kyiv. It was just a few weeks ago that the capital was attacked with these loitering, they are loitering drones, they self detonate, they are hard to detect among the victims was a pregnant woman and her husband. So these drones have terrorized the civilian population. That is the first question, how will these drones be used to ramp up the attacks against innocents? Of course, the question about the battlefield. Now, U.S. officials have said and Ukrainian officials have said that Russia's stockpile of weapons has been severely depleted in this conflict. So those precision weapons could potentially make a change on the ground. But it is more than just the accusation of the weapons that's concerning Ukrainian officials. U.S. officials say that Iranians are actually training Russian troops on the ground, in occupied Crimea, to use these weapons. Look, the bigger picture here, Becky, is just the very fact that Russia is turning to Iran to obtain more weapons.

But as you know very well, it's very difficult for us to get information from inside Iran. So when it comes to these trials, the information is coming mostly from Iranian state media. What we understand so far, according to judicial authorities in the country, they say that more than 1,000 people, who have taken part in these protests over the past month, have been indicted. The trials started earlier this weekend. And they are ongoing right now. Now according to judicial authorities, some of those on trial are facing the very serious charges of attempting and killing security force members, attempting to destabilize the country and overthrow the regime, attacking public property, colluding and working with foreign entities. And you would expect with these sort of charges that some will be facing the death penalty. The concern is we are talking about a country that has a really bad track record when it comes to providing any sort of fair trials. They have been accused by human rights organizations for years of having a flawed judicial system, where people are brought on to trial after forced confessions, according to human rights organizations. We're talking about a country that has a very high rate, one of the highest in the world, of executions. So there's a lot of concern about those who are standing trial and the concern is that the government is really trying to make an example of those on trial right now. This is a regime, Becky, that has been trying everything it can to try and crush these protests over the past seven weeks, whether it is the brutality that we've been seeing play out on the streets, the crackdown on these protests. And then you had the most severe warning to date that we heard this weekend, coming from the head of the feared Revolutionary Guard, issuing an ultimatum, telling protesters, Saturday is your last day out on the streets. Do not come out to the streets. But the defiance has continued. We've seen protesters out again, starting on Sunday. They are continuing their protests today, according to social media videos that we've seen and reports we've seen continuing to protest in Tehran and elsewhere.

Butit is on par with what we saw in 2018, when Democrats took back the U.S. House. It is still uncertain though what that means for Election Day. Oftentimes it is hard to exactly measure voter enthusiasm until we see the full picture, whether voters actually come to the polls on Election Day. While there is some optimism on both sides, the numbers may be good for their respective parties, it is still uncertain what this ultimately will mean come next Tuesday.",

Narendra Modi surveyed search efforts there; he also met with some of the victims' families. The western state of Gujarat has declared a day of mourning for tomorrow. The new renovated bridge collapsed on Sunday, killing over 130 people, including 30 children. And we are starting to hear some heartbreaking accounts from some of the survivors and loved ones of those who didn't make it. CNN's Vedika Sud reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VEDIKA SUD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  That is how it came crashing down, captured on security camera. The suspension bridge collapsing with at least 200 people on it, sending them plunging into the river in a town in Western India, many clinging to the bridge's safety net, crying out for help. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  Death was in front of us. By God's grace, we could hold the safety net and did not let our grips go loose and came out safely. SUD (voice-over):  But not all survived. About 20 kilometers from the accident site, women from a village console a victim. She has lost a husband and 11 family members. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator):  My husband never goes without me, he never goes anywhere without telling me. SUD (voice-over):  The colonial era bridge, a popular local tourist spot, was reopened recently after renovation. Videos from Sunday evening show a crowd on the swaying bridge before the cables snapped. Rescue workers scrambled to pull victims from the river, many children and women among the dead",
