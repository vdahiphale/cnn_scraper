Some of them came away impressed, signaling they could support him. One of the members who met with DeSantis was Chip Roy, a conservative from Texas. And others may also be looking at their own potential future political aspirations. One member, Byron Donalds is a Member of the House Freedom Caucus, is not yet supporting either Trump or DeSantis, anyone yet. He wants the field to form. But John, I asked him whether or not he would run for governor. He was open to running for governor if DeSantis were to step aside? He said, \"Yes, he is.\"JOHN KING, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, ANCHOR OF 'INSIDE POLITICS': \"Yes, he is.\" All right. Ambition, it's a funny thing in politics. Manu Raju, great reporting up on Capitol Hill tonight (ph), as well as bringing the conversation back in the room with that great report. It's interesting, Tia Mitchell, in the sense that this was Trump's base. The senate has always been iffy on Donald Trump, Republicans and the Senate. The House is his base. And so Donald Trump would say, \"I don't care. I'm strong with the people out there.\" But a lot of these -- during the Trump years, when you talked to all these House Republicans, they mostly tried to take you off the record so you weren't quoting them. They'll be like, \"I have to go home.\" He is popular back home. So, if they are stepping up, if they are able to say to Donald Trump, \"Stay away, I'm not ready to endorse you right now,\" that tells you something about what they are hearing back home. TIA MITCHELL, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, THE ATLANTA JOURNAL- CONSTITUTION: Absolutely. That's the -- I think that's the main point, is that, that means that they believe that the base back home will support Trump to the level that he needs to be able to win, not just in a primary, but they are also thinking about a general election. And we saw what happened in 2020. We saw Republicans' losses in other ways that they think shows that some of the messages coming from Trump may not be able to resonate. I think, also what we're seeing from those far right members and we saw that with the speaker's race, is they want results. They have an agenda they are trying to implement and they are trying to find the right person they think can help implement that agenda. They can't do that with the Democrat in the presidency as much as they can with the Republicans. So they want to make sure they give themselves the best chance possible to have a Republican president because they want to implement that hard right agenda.",

Why not keep your options open? I mean, if you think back to 2015 when Donald Trump was running for president the very first time, a lot of these lawmakers were trying to stand on the sidelines as well. There aren't that many House Republicans trying to run in and endorse him. In part, that was because he was untested. He was a force out there. But I do think it's important to remember that these Republicans have their own political aspirations and they have their own things that they want to make sure they can accomplish.

Sources telling CNN, the Administration \"went from not wanting to do tough stuff to realizing they have no choice.\" The policy echoes some of what the Trump Administration did. That 180 not sitting well with some of the president's fellow Democrats. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez joins me now with this new reporting.First, what are they doing now that six months ago or a year ago they said \"No, we won't touch that.\" PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN'S WHITE HOUSE CORRESONDENT: This is a policy that would largely bar migrants from seeking asylum at the US-Mexico Border if they transited through other countries, which as you know many do. And it is a marked difference from where we were before, where US law says migrants who reach US soil have the right to request asylum. This is the most restrictive policy they've put out to date. And again, it's a departure from decades-long protocol. And sources tell me, this idea is not the first time it came up. In fact, in the summer of 2021, White House and DHS officials discussed this concept and White House lawyers knocked it down, seeing it as possibly being blocked by courts. Now, Administration officials tell me they feel strongly about its legal authority now and that it is not like the Trump -- what's they call transit ban. That was more of a ban on asylum all together. And instead, the Administration's defense of this is that they're also opening up legal pathways to the US. So there is an option for migrants to get here. But ultimately, it really does mark a shift of where the Biden Administration was in 2021 and where they are now, when they're on the cusp of a 2024 general election.

But the reality too is that there's mass movement across the western hemisphere. These are numbers that we haven't seen before and from countries we haven't seen before. We are seeing Cubans, Nicaraguans, Venezuelans. We haven't seen those populations before. And so, that really puts them in a corner into how they can manage these populations which we can't necessarily remove back to their countries because of strained diplomatic relations. So, it puts the Administration in a really tough spot, one they've been in since the outset.
