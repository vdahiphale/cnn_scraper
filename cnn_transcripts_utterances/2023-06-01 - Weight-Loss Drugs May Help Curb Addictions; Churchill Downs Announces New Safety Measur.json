CNN's medical correspondent, Meg Tirrell, joins us now from New York. Meg, you read some descriptions of the drug and what people are finding. They say it is revolutionary. It may have a whole host of applications. I wondered, have doctors pinpointed what is behind this?",

He was taken into custody following Wednesday's verdict and now faces 30 years to life in prison at a sentencing set for August. Also in a blow to unions, the Supreme Court is allowing a cement mixing company to sue a labor union in state court for property damage caused by striking workers. The union argued the case should be handled by an independent federal agency that investigates allegations of wrongdoing. Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote for the majority, while Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson was the lone dissenter. She wrote that \"The majority opinion risks erosion of the right to strike.\" And the Biden administration is sanctioning several Iranian officials they claimed plotted assassinations against U.S. government officers, including former national security adviser, John Bolton, and former secretary of state, Mike Pompeo. The targeted group is part of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which has also been accused of targeting journalists and Israeli nationalists. Jim?",

According to the FTC, ring fails to protect your privacy by basically allowing employees of the company to -- and hackers, outside hackers to spy on ring users.So when you had a camera set up in your bedroom or your bathroom, conceivably that could allow hackers to watch and view the recordings of people shown on the cameras. That was what the FTC said was an unfair and deceptive practice. And now with the Amazon Alexa issue, you had what the FTC said was a violation of children's privacy. Where Amazon was allegedly holding onto voice recordings of children that it had collected through the Alexa app and its smart speakers in violation of a national law that prevents children's data from being collected from users under 13 without parental consent. And so what's happening now is Amazon is settling this -- these two lawsuits for more than $30 million. It's going to pay $5.8 million to settle the ring lawsuit and $25 million to settle the Alexa lawsuit. Now, it's important to point out that there are also a number of behavioral changes that the FTC is imposing here. One, Amazon won't be able to use some of these voice recordings to train it's A.I. algorithms. And two, it's going to have to implement a privacy program for all of these services.",

These tips really apply to all sorts of platforms, whether it's Amazon, Google, Facebook or what have you. Two-factor authentication, making sure you have long, complex passwords, ideally tracked using a password manager so you don't have to remember each individual password.
