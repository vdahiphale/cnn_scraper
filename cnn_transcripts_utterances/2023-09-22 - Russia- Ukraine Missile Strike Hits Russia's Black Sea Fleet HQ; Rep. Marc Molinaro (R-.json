CNN cameras were rolling as children are pulled through barbed wire as a migrant surge unfolds once again along -- all along there with renewed calls for help. I'm Kate Bolduan with John Berman. This is CNN News Central.Let's start with the big news out of Ukraine that's still really unfolding as we speak, a missile strike on the headquarters of Russia's Black Sea Fleet. We now have new video coming in that shows the scenes afterward. You can see plumes of smoke coming out of a building there. At least one Russian soldier is reported missing that's right now. This is Sevastopol. This is one of the largest cities in Russia, Russian controlled Crimea. And Russian state media says the debris from the strikes scattered hundreds of feet from the point of impact. Over the past month, Ukraine has really been ramping up its attacks on Russian military bases and other sites in and around Crimea as part of their counter offensive. And this looks to be a big move today. CNN's Katie polglaze has more on this. She's tracking this from London. Katie, what more are you learning about this strike this morning?",

This is the headquarters for the Black Sea Naval Fleet. Now, in terms of what hit it, we're reporting currently that it's a missile. Again, we're talking a lot about these long range missiles that Zelenskyy is after and you can see why. This is the kind of impact that missile attacks can have. We're seeing in those videos, you showed really devastating huge plumes of smoke. Residents are being told by the Sevastopol governor to stay inside, take shelter while it's not safe, particularly in the city center. We're hearing about this debris reaching really quite a wide area. There's also this Luhansk theater right in the center of town that's been damaged by debris. This is really showing how it's impacting civilians right in the middle of the city and the impact it's having.And again, these attacks on Crimea, they are strategic. We were putting just yesterday on the Saki Airbase last week, again, on a ship repair facility in Sevastopol. This is an area that has a strategic value to Russia in this war. It's an area where a lot of this war effort is organized where a lot of ammunition, weaponry support for the invasion is conducted and stored and then transferred closer to the frontline. So really have incredible strategic importance to Russia, and to be hit successfully by allegedly the Ukrainian authorities, although we haven't heard anything from them yet. That would be a major success for them. The question really is how this managed to happen, how the Russian defenses didn't stop this from happening. And clearly, quite a lot still to monitor as we see this attack still unfolding.",

There's clearly a level of chaos here in terms of trying to glean information from their own side as to what's happened here. And again, the presentation of the Ukrainian side often when these attacks unfold, whether they explicitly take credit for them or not, is always that this is a success, that this is part of the effort to make sure that Russia feels afraid at home, taking the war back into Russian territory away from the frontline, because let's not forget that some of the frontline battlefield has been really quite marginal in terms of gains.

This after the last plan failed and the one before that and the one before that depending on how you're counting. All he's been able to do on the face of a government shutdown just eight days away is send members home for a long weekend. Part of McCarthy's bind is that if he works with Democrats to pass a funding bill, some conservative members might try to push him out of his speaker's role. [09At least two Republicans say they are now ready to take a rare procedural step to join Democrats and get the job done. Overnight, President Biden responded to the Republican chaos. He said last time there was a government shutdown 800,000 Americans were furloughed or worked without pay. But enjoy your weekend. We did just learn the federal government will soon formally start the process of preparing for a shutdown really, it's just eight days away. CNN's Lauren Fox on Capitol Hill are with the latest.

There are expected to be meetings happening in House Speaker Kevin McCarthy's office today and perhaps even into tomorrow.But right now, the House Rules Committee is expected in a couple of hours to begin the process of trying to put on the floor individual spending bills. But the problem with that gamble is that anything that they pass would be dead on arrival in the Senate. And it's not clear that they would have the Republican support that they would need because one of the bills that they're working on is that Department of Defense spending bill that would fund the Department for one year. But they failed to pass a procedural step yesterday on the floor. It was the second time in just a matter of weeks that that legislation has failed. So that is what Kevin McCarthy is working against. And he's acknowledging that he has some people in his conference that may never get to yes. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE SPEAKER: It's frustrating in the sense that I don't understand why anybody votes against bringing the idea and having the debate. And then you got all the amendments, if you don't like the bill. This is a whole new concept of individuals that just want to burn the whole place down. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

In fact, our commitment needs to be to earnestly move forward on these appropriation bills. I think what we saw over the course of the last couple of weeks is still that you know that we have a conference and a majority that comes from different perspectives and one end wants to be certain that we're earnestly moving forward with considering bills that shrink the size, scale scope of the federal government focus effectively on protecting and securing our border and funding the military. And, of course, there's another side that wants to do that, but also ensure that we're keeping government functioning. What I proposed yesterday with a number of my colleagues was simply getting that process back up and running. And I think an earnest effort to prove that we mean business on behalf of the American people is going to unstick the logjam while we continue to take these incremental steps forward.",

But to the point, this is an earnest effort to confront the wasteful spending show earnestly that we mean, to rein in the size, scale and scope of the federal government.And at the same time, I hope that that that kind of earnestness will send a message to the Senate that you can't just discard the concern of the American people, you got to focus on the fact that they're spending more than people can afford and have yet to secure the national borders.",

You guys need to deal within an earnest effort is important, but Republicans need to deal with the Republican mess right now.And you as Kevin McCarthy has said, you've got people who just want to burn the place down or see the place fall apart.
