And then, that's when they saw the boy Tashawn and detained him, since he was wearing similar clothing and was actually in the same apartment complexes where that witness saw their suspect running off to.The police chief here, Chief Ellery Sosebee has issued an apology. Here is part of the statement that he put out. Saying, \"As the chief of Police, I want to apologize that this incident had such an effect on this young man and his family. I'm asking for the community to consider all of the facts of the situation before making a judgement.\" The relationship with our community has been and will continue to be a top priority for the Lansing Police Department.\" Meanwhile, the Bernard family, they have retained an attorney here. And the attorney claims that the boy was actually wearing a white -- a gray shirt, not a white shirt. And that the police should have also seen that there was a noticeable age difference between the boy, 12 years old again, and their suspect. They are considering legal action now against the city.

And we begin this hour with this breaking news.Just moments ago, I spoke with the former Georgia Republican Lieutenant Governor Jeff Duncan, who told me that he will testify on Tuesday before a grand jury. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis has subpoenaed Duncan to testify about efforts by former President Donald J. Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 presidential election in Georgia. He said he received his notification which gives him 48 hours, in which to appear. CNN's Sara Murray joining us right now on the phone. Sara, what more can you tell us about the significance of Mr. Duncan receiving that notification and confirming that he will indeed be there on Tuesday? SARA MURRAY, CNN POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT (via telephone): Well, Fred, we've sort of been waiting for the moment when Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis would actually go before a grand jury, present her case, and seek what we expect to be charges against more than a dozen individuals. The fact that Jeff Duncan was summoned to testify on Tuesday is an indication that Willis is going to be using the grand jury that meets on Monday and Tuesday to present her case. Now, sources have previously told us this is the grand jury presentation that could take up to two days. And it's possible that she could begin presenting this case on Monday and then move into additional witnesses like Jeff Duncan, for instance, on Tuesday. But this is, you know, the clearest indication of the timing of when this is all going to happen, when, of course, that she actually is going to go forward is going to go before this grand jury, and is going to speak charges. We, of course, expect her to seek charges against former President Donald Trump, although, we'll have to see how that plays out before the grand jury, but she's also been looking in this investigation at a number of his allies. You know, she's been looking at the fake electors that convened in Georgia and cast their ballot for Donald Trump, even though Joe Biden won the state. She is been looking at the harassment campaign against, you know, local election officials there. And she's also been looking into this voting systems breach in Coffee County, Georgia. So, we would expect those to all the potential components of this presentation she makes before the grand jury. Fred.",

Well, Jeff Duncan, you know, breaking this news on your show is giving us the most significant and clearest indication that Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis is going to be seeking indictments when she goes before a grand jury. And that grand jury is likely to be the one that meets on Mondays and Tuesdays. Neither he is been called to testify on Tuesday, but we've been told by sources that this is a presentation before the grand jury that could take up to two days. So, it's possible that this is something the district attorney could begin on Monday. And again, she's not just scrutinizing the conduct of Donald Trump and his efforts to try to overturn the 2020 election, she is looking at a number of Donald Trump's allies and supporters who tried to help him and that aim throughout the state. And we've been told she could seek charges against more than a dozen individuals. And, you know, people like Jeff Duncan are potentially key to this grand jury presentation, because they help sort of craft the narrative around what Donald Trump and his many allies were doing around the 2020 election. And sort of the various parts of their efforts to try to overturn the election results, Fred. And Sara, that he would be called to testify. Does that open up any kind of indication of others who may also be receiving the same kind of notification since he was one of about 70, at least last year, who testified before a grand jury? That's right. I mean, she's not going to be calling, you know, all the 75 witnesses who testified before the special purpose grand jury, when she gives us the sort of summary of her case, before the regular grand jury that can issue indictments. But she's going to potentially call a couple of people who can drive home. Some key points for her. We know that there is a -- there are a handful of people who previously received subpoenas and were essentially put on notice. You know, the district attorney's office saying we'll give you a 48-hour heads up if we need you to appear. So, we're certainly checking in with others to see if there are other secret notified that the district attorney wants to see them before the grand jury on Monday or Tuesday. Because it is possible that she use multiple witnesses beyond Jeff Duncan to make this case before grand jury. And, of course, she has her own internal investigators in her office, who are able to go before grand jury summarize evidence, read evidence into the record or potentially play evidence into the record.

He got on the phone with the attorney general of Georgia, and wanted to keep him away from a lawsuit that was trying to overturn the results. He sent to allies like Rudy Giuliani and Mark Meadows to go to Georgia. Rudy Giuliani presented bogus claims of fraud to the state Senate and the state House. That has been a part of this investigation as well. Mark Meadows was on the ground in Cobb County near Atlanta, where they were doing signature matching and sending updates back to the White House. And then, there are other parts of this, Fred that were not directly tied to the White House and Donald Trump, but were allies of the former president who were trying to help his cause. People that were involved in the breaching of a voting system in a rural county, Coffee County, trying to basically break in and find fraud on those machines.

But this could not be more of a metaphor of how the legal cases against him really are colliding and unfolding simultaneously with this presidential campaign happening just as he is flying here to Iowa. Regardless of what he says now, he'll have a chance to speak about this. I'm told later he'll be addressing folks here. But we know what he thinks about this. In fact, he sent out a message on his social media channel as he was flying here, calling that Georgia phone call again, when he was asking for more votes, a perfect call. We know what his response has been to this. So it's really not that surprising what else he'll say today. But what is interesting here at the fair, Fredricka, is that Iowa voters and others are beginning to weigh their decisions here. This is part of the calculation. Yes, he does come into the -- this summer five months before the first voting begins as the frontrunner. There is no doubt. But it's a frontrunner with many questions.
