Plus, he's already shaking up the 2024 race, hoping to be a third- party nominee. But Democrats are growing worried, tonight, about Cornel West, and whether or not he could tip the election, in Donald Trump's favor. He's here to respond. And drug bust? The Secret Service has given up, trying to find a suspect. And the cocaine case, at the White House, is now closed. But questions still remain. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Tonight, my sources have confirmed that Jared Kushner testified, last month, in the Special Counsel's January 6th probe, questioned before a federal grand jury that is investigating efforts, to overturn the 2020 election, by Donald Trump, and his allies. Kushner, of course, is Trump's son-in-law, and was Trump's Senior Advisor, in the White House. According to one source, the grand jury is asking whether or not Trump had been told, he had lost the election. Back in 2020, in December, after Trump had lost that election, I reported that Kushner was one of several people, who approached his father-in-law, about conceding the election. Kushner had been in the Middle East, and just returned to the U.S., the day of that Capitol attack. He later told the January 6 congressional committee, he was at home, when he got an urgent call, from Kevin McCarthy. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Obviously, she was incredibly close, to the ex-President, as his longtime aide and Communications Director.I'm joined now, tonight, by former U.S. Attorney, Harry Litman; and former Chief Assistant District Attorney for the Manhattan D.A.'s Office, Karen Friedman Agnifilo. Thank you both for being here. Karen, when you find out that Jared Kushner went before the grand jury, not investigators, which is what some people, who have gone and spoken to Jack Smith's team have done, but he actually went before the grand jury, in June? What would you have wanted to ask him, about those efforts, to overturn the election? KAREN FRIEDMAN AGNIFILO, CNN LEGAL ANALYST, FORMER CHIEF ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY OF MANHATTAN D.A.'S OFFICE: I think more than anything, you want to lock him, into his testimony, under oath. You want before it that he has a chance, to hear what other witnesses have to say, and before Donald Trump even mounts a defense, you want to lock him in. He was somebody very close to Donald Trump. And you want him to -- you want to know exactly what is he going to say? And what is he not going to say? I think you're also going to want to know what are some of the things that Donald Trump said to him, and what did Donald Trump say, about losing the election, and January 6th. And there's several areas that Jack Smith can ask him about. But he was clearly a very close adviser. And when Bill Barr, for example, wanted to put a stop to these fake electors -- these fraudulent, \"The election's been stolen,\" all these wild goose chases? He went to Jared Kushner, and said, \"Can you do something about this?\" And Jared said, \"Yes, we're trying.\"",

And one of the things supposedly Jared said is he actually believed that Trump believed he had -- that the election had been stolen. Doesn't really matter, because we also have learned, in the last few days that there are some very good statements, including one by Mark Milley, and one by his Communications Director, that make it clear, he knows he's lost. And that's what -- sort of the Karen's point, that's what the prosecution will put on. And Jared, if he's a defense witness, they'll know what he's going to say.

And that day, someone had texted Hope Hicks, asking her to essentially get him to say something about being non-violent. And she said that she had been trying to do that January 4th, January 5th. And then afterwards, she said, \"I'm so mad and upset. We all look like domestic terrorists now.\" What kind of questions would you have for Hope Hicks? LITMAN: So, you're always starting with what exactly did Trump say to you, and did you say back? And you want evidence of mindset that goes the other way is always good, whether or not Kushner testifies against it. And Hicks is an important player, because she's very loyal, until the 6th itself, when she really is tearing her hair out, and saying, \"What is he doing?\" Can I make one more quick point about Kushner? Everything that Smith has been pursuing was sort of -- we saw in the January 6 committee with one important exception, the fundraising bit. That's his unique addition. And Kushner is all over that. There's an important phone call that Kushner initiates, with Trump on it, and all the information about what kind of red-meat charges can we make? How can we use the Big Lie to raise money?

It's the West Wing. I feel that an area like that should not be open to such a degree, OK? So, and then what I think they'll do is they'll probably won't get rid of the tours, although I'm kind of, again, from a security perspective, it just brings in so many unknowns, so many variables. But I think what they may do is separate the entrances. So, you have one entrance that is strictly dedicated, to staff, and another entrance, to tour guests. The problem is, it's all mishmash together, you have 600 people coming through, and how do you figure out who it has?",

So, when you're a movie studio, and you want to put a big film out, if you can't have your actors out there, going to Red Carpet premieres, putting things on social media, you're not going to get butts and seats in the theaters. So, I think one of the major things that's going to happen, because of this strike, is that you can expect to potentially see some movies be pushed, further out of the schedule, or movie studios are going to have to get a little bit more creative, perhaps spending even more, on advertising, to promote them, to consumers.",
