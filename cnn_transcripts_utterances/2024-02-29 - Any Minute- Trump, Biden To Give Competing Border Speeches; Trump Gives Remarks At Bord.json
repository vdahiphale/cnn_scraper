President Biden and Donald Trump, both in Texas at this very hour, both trying to blame each other for the crisis at the border. How their competing messages will be received. I'll speak with Republicans and Democrats who represent border towns. Meanwhile, behind the scenes, Trump's legal team is pushing back as yet another state has tried to take him off its 2024 ballot. Also today, we are following the chaos on the coast in Gaza. What the Israeli military is now saying about the more than 100 people believe to have been killed as crowds rush the convoy trying to provide food. (AUDIO GAP) will be here. Welcome to THE LEAD. I'm Kaitlan Collins, in for Jake Tapper today. And we start with our breaking news and our national lead, and the split screen that is playing out right before our very eyes. Both president Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, both down at the southern border right now, as immigration is set to be a major or if not the biggest issue in the 2024 election. Any minute now, we expect to hear from former President Trump. He's in Eagle Pass, Texas after he's been meeting with members of the state's National Guard. Eagle Pass, you'll recall became the epicenter of that tense standoff between Texas and the federal government last month as they fought over who had jurisdiction over that part of the border. Shortly after Trump speaks, we'll also hear from President Biden. He's in Brownsville, Texas, where he was just briefed by federal border and immigration officials. And we're told that we can expect him to reiterate his calls for House Republicans to pass a bipartisan border deal. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is traveling with President Biden in Brownsville and CNN's Kristen Holmes is with the Trump campaign in Eagle Pass. Kristen, let me start with you because even before Trump got on his plane and took this trip day, we saw him repeating those same kind of anti-immigration messages that we heard back in 2016 in 2020. What do we expect to hear from him shortly on the ground?",

      "sentences": "Well, Kaitlan, I would say more of the same. He's been operating out of the same immigration playbook since you said in 2015 when he launched his presidential campaign, saying that people coming across the border were bringing drugs and they were rapist. That has not changed really one bit, and that's what we expect to hear today.We are told that he's going to link a series of crimes that were allegedly committed by migrants to the immigration crisis, as well as that death of a UGA student. That was -- the suspect there is an undocumented Venezuelan migrant. And you should also really (AUDIO GAP), now you pointed that out. This is the focal point of the political aspect (AUDIO GAP) of Donald Trump with Texas Governor Greg Abbott, who is in a standoff with the Biden administration over who really controls this section of the border, as we know. Abbott has used state resources to put razor wire on train cars behind me, all along the Rio Grande, as well as on buoys in the middle of the river. He just had a briefing with Abbott, who again, has backed Donald Trump and said that they need Donald Trump's immigration policies. So we should really expect to see is how Donald Trump believes he is putting out his message. Remember what he's called for already in 2024, if he is elected? Saying that he would have mass deportations, that he would round up and house immigrants, wait for -- waiting for deportation. He would also use law enforcement to help with wide arrests.",

But we've heard them spinning time and time again is that Biden doesn't actually need to have any kind of border bill passed and said he should just have executive action if you really cared about the border, you would use executive action. That is what we've heard from Republicans.Also, we've heard from Donald Trump saying it had nothing to do with being political. It was just because it wasn't a good deal, despite the fact that one of the most conservative senators in the Senate was the one negotiating. But this is going to be a harder climb for them. What I do think when I talk to members, when we talk to people close to the former president, they believed that his messaging is better, than he can convince people that he was better, that he did more for the border, that he is stronger when it comes to the border. And one thing Donald Trump is good at is messaging, Kaitlan, as you know, and that is what they've really tried to hammer home even with the optics of this trip, even bringing him out, parading him in front of the national guard, kind of setting the scene for what he would say is what he wants his border control to look like if he is reelected back to the White House.",

He said no announcements on executive actions today, but sources do tell me that the White House is considering executive action that would restrict the ability of migrants to claim asylum if they cross the border unlawfully, using an authority that former President Donald Trump also used during his time in office. So the two executive actions might look very different.But on the same, this just goes to show how the White House is leaning in on an issue that up until this point, they had really kept at a distance and Democratic strategists, I spoke with say that this is the opportunity that they see polling as you heard there from Kristen shows that Americans are seeing this as a top priority in a really important issue to them, this being the issue of immigration. And so, it's not beneficial anymore for Democrats to keep it at a distance. In fact, Democratic strategist, I spoke with say, President Biden should be embracing it, leaning into it. And not only leaning into it, but also leaning into the enforcement aspect of this. Oftentimes Democrats have talked about immigration reform and protection for DACA recipients and Dreamers. But now were hearing a message that is very border security centric, and that's actually what were expecting to hear from the president today. And really again, could sort of outline what the next few months look like, not only for the president, but for Democrats who are running in other races.",

I knew that you are an opponent to that. What do you make of what the judge has decided here? REP. VERONICA ESCOBAR (D-TX):  Thanks so much, Kaitlan. Really appreciate the opportunity to talk to you. I agree with the judge, as do a number of legal scholars, advocates, border residents. We know that what Governor Greg Abbott was trying to do was not just immoral, but it was unconstitutional. We are already in communities like my own, seeing egregious civil rights abuses because of his Operation Lone Star and SB4 would have been a huge expansion of that that would have led to really some more our significant targeting of minority communities.

Many of us have shared with him as has Secretary Mayorkas, and others about the great challenge that has existed. And I have to say, Kaitlan, it's existed since before President Biden was in office.When Donald Trump was president, I led a number of congressional delegations to El Paso so that people could understand the great challenge that we faced, and the need for congressional action. You know, what we have seen over the last two decades has been an effort, a concerted and successful effort by Republicans to basically limit, and in fact deny any kind of congressional action. We saw it in 2006. We saw in 2014, in 2018, again this year, 2024. Every time Congress has been poised to act on what normally has been a combination of border security and immigration reform, it's been Republicans who blocked it and prevented any action. So the humanitarian crisis that many communities have seen to this day is a direct result of congressional inaction, but mostly led by Republicans who blocked that action.",

He has seen how Governor Abbott has been able to use his policies to secure this specific area, the epicenter of the last two years of the illegal border crisis that we have had to endure.

Border Patrol agents are upset that we cannot get the proper policy that is necessary to protect human life, to protect American citizens, to protect the people that are crossing the border illegally.

Democratic Congresswoman Veronica Escobar, who has been very patient waiting for us. And, Congresswoman, I will warn you, of course, we are seeing President Biden get a speech right now. We expect to hear from him in a little bit. But on the question that we were talking about, there, which is where President Biden is. He's in Brownsville, Texas. You just heard the head of the National Border Patrol Council, Brandon Judd criticizing Biden for being there in Brownsville, for not being closer to Tucson, Arizona, which is where the number one migrant issue is happening. Of course, the most crossings, Congresswoman, were you to make sure that we can get your connection, that it is here. But I should know what Brandon Judd was saying. He was criticizing Biden for being in Brownsville and for not being in the Tucson sector. I should note, Trump was standing right there at Eagle Pass. He's also nowhere near Tucson where the height of this issue is. But on President Biden, given you're a Democrat, what do you make of where he decided to go today? REP. VERONICA ESCOBAR (D-TX):  Kaitlan, you're right. I mean, Mr. Judge should have criticized Donald Trump as well for being in Texas and not Arizona. The fact of the matter is really many of the migrant pathways end up shifting over time. You know, Arizona right now is definitely where the highest number of encounters are. But recently it was Texas. And in fact, Mr. Judd mentioned that Eagle Pass was the number one, the epicenter -- no, El Paso, Texas, actually was the number one area for apprehensions and encounters last year. We've seen a shift recently in Texas, not because of what Greg Abbott is doing. And I think that's really important to say that much of what Greg Abbott is doing has not worked necessarily. But in fact, it was the president's collaboration with Mexico and Mexico engaging in its enforcement activities that shifted a lot of the movement away from Texas into other states. But it could very well ship back. I think -- I'm sorry. Go ahead COLLINS:  Congresswoman. Sorry, you're shot is having a few technical issues. I just want to say, Congresswoman, we do appreciate your patience. Thank you for standing by. We'll bring you back soon once we can get that restored. Also with us still, Kristen Holmes, who is traveling with the former president, was there in Eagle Pass as he is speaking. And, Kristen, I just think one thing that stood out to me beyond the fact that they're criticizing Biden for not being closer to the center of this crisis while they are themselves are in Eagle Pass and not also close to it is Trump was standing there talking about the lack of action on immigration, but its notable because he in what's going on at the border, he's the one who blocked, who urged House Republicans to stand in the way of that bipartisan Senate bill that would have addressed a lot of these issues that had money for more border wall. It would have tightened asylum claims. It would have maybe not done everything Republicans wanted, but it would have done something.",

I have no reason to doubt that.I also know that he sees this every day and there were a number of things if implemented that would help stem the migrant crisis. We know that. These were things that Republicans themselves were publicly fighting for and have been fighting for, for a number of years. But as you said, he is also clearly supporting former President Donald Trump. But if he's going to stand up there next to him, he's not going to support the same bill and that's really what we saw from Republicans across the board. We had so many Republicans who are publicly supporting the bill only to quietly pull back, pull back, pull back, and then eventually not vote. It was really remarkable to see, but not that surprising, particularly as we've seen, Donald Trump and inched towards nomination, it looks as though he's very likely to be the Republican nominee.

As we wait, I want to bring in former Republican Congressman Will Hurd, who represented a district on the majority of Texas's border with Mexico, and is well-versed in all of these issues. Congressman, can I just first get your reaction to what you heard from Donald Trump and also just the criticism that he's not near -- the Bidens not going near Tucson where it's the height of this crisis, but also Trump isn't going there either today. WILL HURD (R), FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE:  So I think what you heard is what you're going to hear if he is the nominee for the rest of the election. Some of it was just incorrect. I take your fact checker had it right. When Donald Trump is president, he deported less people than President Obama. Of the new wall that was built, it was less than 50 miles. The rest of that was existing. I mean, it was his policies that started this crisis and it was in Joe Biden is continuing this and has made this crisis significantly worse than it was under Donald Trump. And the reality about the border is it changes day by day. And so a place that may be quiet one day is going to get become a place where there's a lot of traffic and a lot a lot of action and a lot of problems. And so -- so that's the reality of the border. And unfortunately, I think what Americans saw was that this is -- Donald Trump continued to complain about a problem, not providing the solutions that we need to solve this. The fact that it was key was the one that killed the bill and the Senate that could have gotten some help. More needs to be done. And this is -- this is not normal. 5.6 million people coming into our country illegally under President Biden is not normal.

When the president was briefed by federal immigration officials, he repeatedly came back to all the resources that they were missing, or that they were gone (ph), not enough staff, not technologies.And it was interesting because he used Republican talking points like talking about fentanyl, or talking about cartels or criminals to make the point that more sources are acquired at the U.S.-Mexico border, and to get them, he needs the help of Congress. And that was also what his theme during his remarks, where he walks through the Senate border bill, but included, again, Kaitlan, some of the toughest border security measures in recent memory. In fact, the president ticked some of them included saying that its extraordinary emergency authority that would allow the homeland security secretary to struck down the border if certain triggers were met. That alone, that abrasive of that, it goes show how far this White House has come on this issue and how they have gotten tougher and almost had to given the urgency, given the surges at the U.S.-Mexico, and also as Americans are increasingly more concerned about this particular issue. But I also want to mention, Kaitlan, that toward the end of his remarks, President Biden called out former President Donald Trump. He didn't name him but he called his predecessor, and he gave him a message and that message he said that is instead of playing politics, or instead of swaying Republicans not to vote for the Senate border bill, that President Biden -- former President Donald Trump should work with them or he would work with former President Donald Trump. It was a remarkable moment and what it goes to show how much power former President Donald Trump holds with the Republican Party and how they're voting on the Senate border bill, but also President Biden almost trying to be as equally tough on this issue and so, them saying this as a key issue going into this presidential election. So again, the president down here at the Brownsville border patrol station. Secretary Mayorkas is speaking now, following the president, and they're both really going, hammering at his point that they need more funds for the borders, for the border (INAUDIBLE) and that they need more resources.

That's what sources tell me. There is still work behind the scenes, with administration attorneys to hammer out whether this is a possibility and it would be anchored in the same authority that former President Donald Trump use.And, actually, Kaitlan, I can hear homeland security calling out Texas Governor Greg Abbott. And I want to note this because that the governor has done in sending migrants to Democratic-led cities has really changed the calculus of how this White House has had to handle these issues because now it's an issue that is going to the doorsteps of every Democratic-led city, and those cities had been crying out to the White House to do more in the border. So that is played into all of this calculus. But going back to what the White House is considering, they are considering that executive action, but would the White House officials I talk to, always come back to is that it is a border bill that would enshrine this into law. So even if there is an executive action, it doesn't go as far as the Senate border bill will. But the same, Kaitlan, clearly the White House here leaning into an issue that they had really tried to keep at a distance for many years.",
