I'm Dana Bash in Washington, where the state of our union is wondering what doesn't become politicized these days.We just closed out an especially bitter and divisive week in American politics. On Tuesday, former President Donald Trump was indicted in New York and is vowing vengeance, as it appears possible the case could go to trial months before the presidential election. On Thursday, two Tennessee state lawmakers were expelled by Republicans for protesting in favor of gun restrictions following a mass shooting in a Nashville elementary school. And, on Friday, two federal judges split over the future of the medication abortion drug mifepristone. A judge in Texas gave the Biden administration seven days to appeal his decision, which blocked the FDA's approval of the widely used abortion drug, throwing many women and medical providers into a state of uncertainty. Here with me now is the secretary of Health and Human Services, Xavier Becerra. Thank you so much for coming in this morning. So, this Texas ruling banning mifepristone goes into effect on Friday, unless a stay is issued. The question that women across America have right now is, will they have access to abortion medication after this week? XAVIER BECERRA, U.S. HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SECRETARY:  Well, they certainly have access today, and we intend to do everything to make sure it's available to them not just in a week, but moving forward, period, because mifepristone is one of the safest and most effective medicines that we have seen over the last 20 years to help women with their health care, especially abortion care. So it is incumbent upon us as a country to make sure women have safe and effective medication available to them.",

The abortion pill ruling doesn't take effect for seven days. You just heard me discussing that with Xavier Becerra. The Biden administration is appealing it. Are you satisfied with what you just heard? And what would it mean for women if approval for this pill is revoked nationwide? OCASIO-CORTEZ:  Well, while I commend the Biden administration for appealing the decision. And I believe that Secretary Becerra has been doing a phenomenal job in his role. I do think that, when it comes to gaming out what the very real possibilities are in the coming days, weeks and months, this is not just about speculation, but this is about preparation. And the reality of our courts right now is very disturbing. This ruling is an extreme abuse of power. It is an extraordinary example of judicial overreach. The grounds of the ruling are completely -- are just completely discredited and without grounds. And what we also learned this week is that a Supreme Court justice of this court has been receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of gifts and expenses and having lifestyle subsidies by a billionaire who has been funding the same types of judicial organizations that appointed this judge in a partisan ruling in the first place.",

But I do not believe that the courts have the authority to have the authority over the FDA that they just asserted. And I do believe that it creates a crisis. Should the Supreme Court do that, it would essentially institute a national abortion ban, because you have an extraordinary amount of states who have implemented surgicals -- surgical bans or bans after very early time periods. And then, if you pair that with a mifepristone ban, then we will essentially have a ban on abortion with -- there are certain work- around. I will admit there would be certain work-arounds. But we would have taken very significant step towards a national abortion ban. Once you ban medication abortion, which represents -- or start banning medication abortion, which represents the overwhelming number of abortions in the United States, then we are in extremely dangerous territory.

He's saying -- quote -- \"Early in my tenure at the court, I sought guidance from my colleagues and others in the judiciary and was advised that this sort of personal hospitality from close personal friends who did not have business before the court was reportable -- was not reportable,\" rather. What is your response? OCASIO-CORTEZ:  I think that his own statement contradicts -- contradicts many of the facts on the ground and also raises in other ways even more serious questions. Later on in his statement, he stated that the reason and the rationale for this exemption was personal hospitality from an old friend. And he said himself in his statement a friend of 25 years. Justice Thomas has been on the court for 30 years. And so to say what he is admitting in his statement in an attempt to defend himself is that he began this relationship with a billionaire and receiving these sorts of gifts as -- after he was appointed to the Supreme Court of the United States. I think that that, in and of itself, indicates a very, very serious problem. And then, on top of that, he is now implicating his colleagues. And I do believe that Chief Justice John Roberts must now come forward and state if he allows and is allowing this kind of very serious corruption to happen on this court.

I admit it is very difficult to see a path in a Republican Party that refuses to hold itself accountable and, in fact, breaches the law itself. For all of their talk of a crime wave and Democrats -- Republicans talking about crime waves across the country, the crime wave is within the Republican Party. It is within all of the -- what we are seeing. We have seen -- we are seeing breaking of the law by conservative members of the court. We are seeing a former president of the United States just indicted in recent days. I mean, we need to hold our systems accountable. And I do not believe that we should be refusing to do that for political reasons. I believe that we should pursue the course.
