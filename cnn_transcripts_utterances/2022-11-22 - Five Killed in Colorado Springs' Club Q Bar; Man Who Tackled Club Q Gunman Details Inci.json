We're also hearing from one of the heroes of the tragedy, Richard Fierro, an Army veteran, who authorities credit with saving many lives and subduing the gunman until police arrived. Officials say the shooter had multiple firearms on him, including an AR-15-style rifle. That suspect is facing murder and hate charges today. Rosa Flores is starting us off.

And his family described him as being kind and selfless and gifted and always willing to go out of his way for anyone. Kelly Loving; her sister, Tiffany, said that she was a good person, that she was loving and carrying and sweet and everyone loved her. Ashley Paugh, her husband saying they were high school sweethearts and she worked at a nonprofit that helps foster children find homes. And Derrick Rump; I spoke to a survivor, Ed Sanders, who knew Derrick very well, who said that he was such a kind person and he always made sure that he had a ride home and, if he didn't, Derrick would give him a ride home, he said. Now all this as we are learning more about the suspect and his condition. At this point what we know from police is that he is still hospitalized. He has not made statements to police and he has not been formally charged. But the DA here does say that he is being held, pending multiple charges. Now some of the charges could include first degree murder and hate crimes. And the DA said that those charges could be expanded, especially because, Kate, as you know, not only did five people die, there were 19 others who were injured. And so we, of course, are learning more about what happened here from them and the survivors.",

And Chip was right there, her husband was reaching for her. I put her hand in his hand so that they can be together. I didn't know that if they were going to make it. This guy, man. This whole thing was a lot. My daughter and wife should have never experienced combat in Colorado Springs and everybody in that building experienced combat that night, not to their own accord but because they were forced to.

It is a facility that gave us a safe space to be who we are all the time. And Derrick and Daniel especially were always the glue -- yes, correct -- the heart that kept everything together. If anybody was having a hard time, if anybody was new to the community, they always had open arms for everybody.

Today this appeals court will hear arguments from prosecutors, who want these judges to remove what has been one of the biggest obstacles in their investigation and that is the requirement that a third party review all of the materials seized from former president Trump's home in Mar-a-Lago back in August.Now Trump requested this review process because he argued that privileged materials may have been swept up in the search. A lower court judge granted that request. Now also interesting, this is the first court hearing since the appointment of special counsel Jack Smith. He will not be here today. But he has personally approved all of the arguments that the prosecutors will make today. And really the big question is whether they could move this along any faster. Speed is an important issue in this investigation. We know the former president has successfully and strategically used delay as a litigation tactic for decades.

And if he does, she intends to run with him as his vice presidential candidate. Now President Biden is set to begin those discussions with his family that he had promised that he would be having toward the end of the year, over the Christmas and Thanksgiving holidays, to decide whether he will run for re-election. So far all indications that are the president will run for reelection. He said it is his intention to do so. His 80th birthday this week certainly called attention once again to those questions about his age, about his fitness to continue to serve. The president has addressed those questions repeatedly, making clear that he believes he is fit to serve and pointing to his record of accomplishments over the past two years. That was also a point that the vice president raised when she was asked this question in the context of former president Trump announcing his bid for re-election. The vice president talking about the Biden-Harris administration's record on everything from COVID to combating the climate crisis to other pieces of legislative accomplishments.
