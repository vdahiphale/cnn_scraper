You know, he's going to have trouble reassembling a coalition that got him elected in 2016.

And our Convention '68 was a disaster and Nixon won. We've got a very unpopular war right now. The images there are shocking a generation and that same thing could happen again.

You can take a look at some of this and opposing, calling for an immediate ceasefire. And I wonder what your concern level is about that, particularly when it comes again to another constituency of young voters. This is something Gretchen Whitmer has also talked about being concerned about. And I wonder if you are as well.",

And we know that Hamas is not and will never be a legit partner inside the work.We have to be able to push for a peaceful and stable Israeli state. We also need to make sure that we have a peaceful and stable Palestinian state as well. Anybody who is not pushing for that is not going to be a partner inside this work. And I think that that's something that the president has been talking about and pushing for, the idea that we need to be able to have a pause with infighting to allow humanitarian aid in, that we need to be able to ensure that we get the hostages out now. These have to be priorities. We have to preserve human life. And the president is acting as the commander-in-chief in making sure that we can get that conclusion and really make sure that we have peaceful states, both the Palestinian and Israeli, states side by side. And anybody who is not fighting for that is not going to be part of a long-term solution.",

This is the most -- the Ravens are the most complete team in football.There's only one team that can beat the Ravens left, and that's the Ravens. I feel very good about what we're going to be able to do. And, literally, we have the league's most exciting player, the MVP, and who's going to lead us to Vegas for the Super Bowl.
