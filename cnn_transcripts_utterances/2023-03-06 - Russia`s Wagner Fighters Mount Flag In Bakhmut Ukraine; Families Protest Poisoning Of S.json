Tonight, Wagnerfighters plant their flag in the eastern part of Bakhmut, but Ukraine claims it`s hanging on to the territory. And Iran`s supreme leader is calling the poisoning of school girls an unforgiveable crime. But parents accuse the government of trying to silence them. And four Americans kidnapped in Mexico, we expect an update from Mexican officials this hour. Now, at this hour, the battle for Bakhmut is not over. The city still officially in Ukrainian hands with defense forces holding on to their positions despite massive pressure from Russian troops. Fighting in the eastern Ukrainian city has now reached the highest level of intensity in the months-long siege. That`s according to the command of Ukraine`s land forces, who visited troops there, Sunday. But the private military group Wagner claims they are on the cusp of victory. Wagner posted video of fighters planting their flag on a tank in the eastern part of the city. But a so-called Russian victory in Bakhmut will come with tremendous losses. NATO estimates that five times as many Russians soldiers have died for every Ukrainian soldier. So let`s get straight out to -- joining us now live from Kyiv. Melissa, it has been a long -- what? More than seven months, and now we hear of Russia appearing to be on the brink of capturing Bakhmut. Given that estimate we just heard from NATO there, walk us through the symbolic or the costs that this is going to have for Russia, not just -- obviously, we know this is a symbolic victory, but at what cost will this come for Russia, this victory in Bakhmut?",

Now, Afghanistan is dealing with its coldest Winter in more thana decade, many people are now in desperate need of humanitarian assistance. The Taliban policies are preventing aid agencies from doing more to help. CNN`s Anna Coren has this report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANNA COREN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Fresh snow blankets the hill tops of Ghor Province in central Afghanistan, creating the illusion of a Winter wonderland. But, for those who live here, there is no wonder, let alone glimmer of hope. Simply staying alive is a deadly struggle. For this family, their young son lost that battle. Now, they huddle around his hillside grave, offering prayers to six-year-old Wahid(ph) who just days ago froze to death. \"I miss my brother, and that is why I came to visit him at the graveyard\", she says. Abdul Zahed(ph) moved his family to the township of Feroz Koh in Ghor looking for work as a laborer. But with an economic and humanitarian crisis gripping Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, he was unable to make ends meet. \"I had nothing to burn to keep the house warm\", he explains. \"I checked on the children during the night and their bodies were numb. I realized my son had died a frostbite. This is a photo of him last year\", he says. \"And this is his dead body.\" An unprecedentedly brutal Winter has claimed countless Afghan lives this year, but so too has extreme poverty. This has been exacerbated by the repercussions of the Taliban government`s dystopian gender policies, and the response by the international communities. Almost a year ago, the Taliban banned female secondary students from attending school, that has morphed into a nationwide ban on all female education. But it was the Taliban`s decision in December, banning women from working for non-governmental organizations that forced humanitarian aid groups to abruptly halt or suspend operations.",

We heard the U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin saying earlier that playing down the strategic significance of Russia taking Bakhmut, saying that any victory there would, of course, be more symbolic.

There was a -- Oleksiy Danilov, who was the head of the Ukraine`s National Security and defense console was in the area of Donbas last Thursday, and he claimed that Russia was losing seven soldiers for every one Ukrainian killed in the city. So when you`re talking about that kind of advantage, and unfortunately, sometimes, battles are measured that way, with body counts, and with how much you give up, it has been just a horrific fight. But as you said, it`s been seven months since this battle has been going on and Russia has tried all sorts of ways to conquer this relatively small city that was, before the war started, a city of about 70,000 population. It has just become a cauldron of death for both sides, but certainly more so from the Russian side than Ukrainian one.",

For many years, CPAC was dominated by the legacy of Ronald Reagan, who, although a realconservative, was a much different kind of conservative than Donald Trump, an internationalist conservative, more ideologically detailed if you`d like, than Trump. That speech that you just showed, the clips there was pure Trumpian demagoguery that you might see from any strongman leader, any in the -- anywhere in the world. And you`re right, that it was full of, you know, absolute nonsense on almost everything that Trump spoke about. I think this is clear here that this is part of the Republican Party. Trump is still very strong among his most loyal supporters. That was the reason why one of his biggest rivals potentially, if he runs, Ron DeSantis of Florida, did not show up at that conference and gave speeches elsewhere because there wasn`t much there for him to win. The question is, is that crowd representative of the Republican primary electorate that will decide the Republican nominee for the 2024 presidential election at this point, I don`t think we can say that. Clearly, Trump has lost some juice more broadly. But he`s still very strong in that particular section of the Republican base.",

He`sbasically saying that he`s appealing to the same instincts in the party, the same cultural issues, this what he calls wokeism he`s pledging to attack on the left that Trump has done for the last five or six years. But he`s saying he`d be more effective in getting laws passed. He`s pointing to his own governorship of Florida. He won the governorship very narrowly to begin with, and then he won a massive reelection victory last year. He is basically saying that Trump didn`t get what he could do done because of the massive chaos that he engenderedly, you know, the scandals, the noise. DeSantis is a much more intellectual, ideologically coherent candidate, much more methodical, and he is trying to tell Republican voters that he would be actually much more successful in implementing some of the cultural policies, the conservative economic and social policies than Trump would be. The question is, do Republican voters want that or they -- do they still have this emotional connection to Trump and his kind of backlash politics? I think that will be one of the key questions if Trump decides -- if DeSantis decides to run against Trump.",
