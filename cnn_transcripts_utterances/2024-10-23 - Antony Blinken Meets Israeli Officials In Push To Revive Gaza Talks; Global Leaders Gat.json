Look, you look at the letter that you quoted from -- and you and Jeremy Diamond before you. The letter, the American letter to Israel stipulated that humanitarian aid must be funneled or infused into Gaza in 30 days. And I ask you, and I think we've had this discussion before, why 30 days? Why not 24 hours? Why not 48 hours? So the idea was that the administration is afraid that if they set too short a timetable, then they would look bad once Netanyahu ignored it. So they said 30 days.

She actually made a point of saying to Putin, this was their third meeting just this year. And the two men, of course, have met dozens of times over the years.It really is a testament to the strength of this relationship, even after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Very much living up to that much touted term of a no limit partnership. You have seen bilateral trade, soaring military cooperation increasing between the two governments, and they are also increasingly in lockstep on many political and ideological issues on the global stage. But it is worth noting as Xi Jinping emphasized in the Chinese statement after their meeting, that this relationship is non-alliance, non-confrontational, and non-third party targeted. But many analysts would probably beg to differ because of course what has been bonding these two men increasingly closely is their shared desire and willingness to reshape that U.S.-dominated world order and that of course is exactly where this BRICS summit comes in, and the Kazan being this perfect setting to showcase Putin as this world leader, even though he is still very much a pariah in the eyes of the West. He's playing host to representatives and leaders from some three dozen countries and organizations, and also, of course they're holding the summit as the war in Ukraine continues to rage on. Now, of course, that conflict in the Middle East where Putin and presumably Xi also is trying to highlight the angst and the dissatisfaction of many of these countries in attendance against the U.S. policy in that region. So this is very much in a way that their united front of the global south trying to trying to express that kind of angst and dissatisfaction. But the problem here, Anna, of course, is there are divergent interests and priorities among the members.

Some social media posts of the video got hundreds of thousands of views and were amplified by right-wing personalities. The campaign echoes the bizarre and false Pizzagate conspiracy that smeared Democrats in 2016. Intelligence tying the attacks on Walz to Russia was produced as part of a broader assessment on the state of foreign threats to the U.S. election. Well, election disinformation is nothing new.

And here we go. What could be taken -- several options of what could be a real car crash between two vehicles.
