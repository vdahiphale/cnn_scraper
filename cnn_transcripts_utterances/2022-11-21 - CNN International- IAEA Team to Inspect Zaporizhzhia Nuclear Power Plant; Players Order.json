That's a warning from the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog after Russia and Ukraine trade blame over shelling around a nuclear plant.Plus, politics off the pitch European football teams elect not to wear these armbands in World Cup action would have the latest life in Qatar. And Joe Biden turns 80, the first U.S. President ever to do so in office. Does that make him too old to run for reelection? The U.S. nuclear watchdog Chief is calling for an end to the madness after fighting rocked Europe's largest atomic power plant over the weekend. And he says whoever is responsible for the attacks is playing with fire. An IAEA inspection team is set to arrive at Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power facility today, but it's not yet clear which side is responsible for the explosions. Both Kyiv and Moscow are trading blame. Meanwhile, Ukraine says Russia in the shelling hit the nearby Southern District of Nikopol overnight, but President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says the heaviest fighting is taking place in the Eastern region.

      "sentences": "You are right; a lot of concern and it's concerned that's been ongoing for the past several months since Russian forces took control of that? Well, it's the biggest nuclear power station in Europe and there have been sort of almost constant battles in the areas around it for control of the area. It found itself unfortunately, right in the center of this incredibly brutal conflict.Last 24 hours, there have been very dangerous explosions taking place in the actual vicinity of the nuclear power plants. According to a reports from the area, a number of buildings in the in the zone have been struck. Nothing fortunately, that has caused a radioactive leak. Although that is a distinct possibility, IAEA the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog as saying that we're talking about explosions taking place meters, not kilometers, not miles, but meters away from critical bits of infrastructure that if they're hit, would be potentially catastrophic. And even the Russians at this point, are warning of the potential for a nuclear accident at the scene. Now, both sides, as you say, are blaming one another for the explosions. The Ukrainians say that it's the Russians that are basically shelling it. The Russians say it's the Ukrainians and you know, without trying to take sides, what the IAEA is doing is saying, look, whoever's doing it. Let's just stop. Let's just take a step back to prevent what could be a very serious nuclear accident indeed, Max. Matthew Chance in Kyiv, thank you. And now football fans rejoice the 2022 World Cup is finally here. Excited fans have been pouring into Doha for the last few days now. Qatar's team fell to Ecuador yesterday. And now England is taking on Iran just one of the three games today. The event isn't without controversy. FIFA has told players they cannot wear these one love armbands which are aimed at inclusion or seven European clubs says in a statement they will abide by the decision but it disappointed by it. Let's go straight to the action and Amanda Davies joins us from Doha. And this is because FIFA has threatened to book any players wearing the armbands. Is that correct?",

England for their parts, then took a knee carried on the theme that we've seen from them since the death of George Floyd's their show of solidarity and the fight for against social injustice. And then the other story dominating the headlines is the one love armbands, as you very much mentioned this was something that a group of European teams requested to wear the captains of their teams.That essentially a rainbow band to show solidarity with members of the LGBTQ+ community because of this rising wave in social activism within football, and of course, the fact we're sitting here in Qatar, where it is illegal to be gay. The problem is the when the announcement was made, it seems they hadn't got the OK from football's world governing body FIFA who have said time and time again a very long standing rule that it is not allowed to show political signs or symbols within the footballing realm. If you do you get punished with suspensions. So FIFA have stood firm, they were saying that they would issue yellow cards to any players who wore those armbands. And it seems that the crux of the issue is, these teams are here to win a football tournament and ultimately, when you're talking about the captains of the teams like England and the Netherlands, the likes of Harry Kane and Virgil Van Dijk. The teams that association so said ultimately, it's too dangerous surprise for them to pay if one of their key players might be suspended for a game so early in the tournament. You can absolutely understand the outrage, the disappointment from members of the LGBTQ+ community. The feeling that football is more important than their rights but equally you can see it from FIFA's perspective they have said the rules have not have never changed, and they don't want to set a precedent. I guess the teams were hoping that in the current climate, there might be a bending of those rules, which hasn't come about. FIFA, though have said that all the teams will have the option of wearing a no discrimination band in these early stages of the games as part of a project that they have started with the United Nations. It's not what many were hoping for, but Max, the action is underway. That is fair to say today, the first day with three games on the agenda. England against Iran, I mentioned it is just what some seven minutes and it will be quickly followed by arguably the game of the day. The Africa Cup of Nations champions Senegal, up against the Netherlands and then the U.S. return to the World Cup for the first time in eight years against a Welsh side back at this tournament for the first time since 1958.",

A synagogue there held a vigil on Sunday night for the five kills and dozens injured at Club Q. After a 22-year old suspected gunman entered around midnight and immediately started shooting. Colorado's governor has ordered flags lowered to half-staff on all public buildings through to Saturday. In a statement U.S. President Joe Biden called the shooting senseless. So threats of violence are increasing. Let's get to CNN's Rosa Flores who's in Colorado Springs, Colorado and we're just trying to figure out the motive but what happened is just terrific.",

Now police say that as soon as the suspected shooter entered Club Q he started shooting, but then shortly thereafter, one or two patrons took the Man's weapon and subdued him. And according to at least one witness, they said they subdued him they started kicking him until authorities arrived and authorities now credit these individuals for saving countless lives. Then, of course, firefighters arrived after that for triage, Max and as soon as you might imagine just a lot of very intense moments here at Club Q that you see behind me as then authorities and first responders scrambled to get some of these victims to hospitals and some of them are still in the hospital this morning, Max.",

They have seen an intensifying crackdown in these Kurdish areas where a lot of these protests have been taking place. They say they have also seen a significant increase in brutality, they say by security forces opening fire directly and deliberately at protesters and even shooting into people's homes. They say, since last Tuesday hangout has documented the killings of at least 41 people. At least 13 of those have been killed in the last 24 hours according to hangout, Max. And at least seven of those, the majority of those killed in the last 24 hours in the town of Javon root. A lot of concern about a very, very dangerous situation that activist and hangout or warning is unfolding right now in that town where they say that security forces are attacking protesters and they are worried that that death toll is only going to rise. The Iranian regime Max has sent in reinforcements, security forces and military, members of the Elite Revolutionary Guard Corps have also been deployed to the Kurdish region. What the Iranian regime is saying and they have been pushing this narrative for weeks now. But what we are seeing in the Kurdish region is a separatist movement. They are dismissing the protesters and their grievances they're describing it all as a separatist terrorist movement and saying that the military has been mobilized to confront these terrorists so a lot of concern about what we might see happening in the coming hours and days, Max.",
