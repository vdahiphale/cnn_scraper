We're following major developments in two different investigations of the former president, Donald Trump. His own defense attorney has been ordered to testify tomorrow in the special counsel's probe of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago. This is a huge legal blow for the ex-president. An appeals court has agreed that Trump may have used the attorney, his attorney, to commit a crime when the FBI was trying to locate and retrieve top secret files from Trump's private club. We're also learning that the attorney needs a turnover handwritten notes that could end up being key evidence. We're going to explain all of it to you. There's a lot here. Also here in New York, it could be a very big day in the Stormy Daniels hush money investigation. The grand jury is set to reconvene today as it weighs charges against Trump. Any indictment would be unprecedented. No sitting or former president has ever been charged with a crime in U.S. history. So, we turn now to CNN's Kara Scannell, has been following this case and is here with us now. Kara, we know there's a lot, we're going to break all of it down because there're several different cases here. But let's talk about what this Costello testifying in the impact that it has with the D.A.'s office, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera?",

He told us that he said that he said he -- Michael Cohen was wrong, that Michael Cohen lied, that Cohen said that he made these payments, the hush money payments, in coordination with and at the direction of Donald Trump. Costello said when he was talking to Cohen in 2018 and representing him, that Cohen told him that Trump had no involvement.So, since then, our reporting and our sources tell our colleagues that the D.A.'s office is regrouping. They're looking to see whether they need to bring in another witness, whether they need to bring back Michael Cohen or whether they're satisfied and they'll move forward. So, there's just a lot of uncertainty because the grand jury process is secret. We know that they are coming in today. It's unclear what will be before them today could be a witness. Maybe it will -- they'll hear something else and it won't be related to this case. But it's -- we now are reaching this point where it feels like a decision is going to make because, you know, whether they're going to bring in another witness to try to rebut Costello or whether they will make a decision and ask the grand jury to indict.",

I think there's being considered in making their decision. And then they can go to the grand jury and asked them to vote.

Because yesterday, an appeals court has ordered that Trump's own defense attorney, the one you see here, Evan Corcoran, must testify tomorrow and turn over his handwritten notes.I want to bring in CNN's Justice Correspondent Jessica Schneider. Jessica, I was struck by the statement from Ty Cobb, who, of course, was a White House attorney when Trump was president, that he said last night, he said Trump has turned more attorneys into witnesses than any criminal defendant in the history of the U.S. justice system. Obviously, you know, speaking with some hyperbole there, but making the point that it's just remarkable that we're seeing another Trump attorney going for the grand jury, this time with no attorney-client privilege to say to why he can't answer certain questions.",

This is a top Trump attorney being compelled to give this testimony about his interactions with Trump.And in this, Kaitlan, the courts have really moved swiftly on this. This has been a rapid fire legal battle that's only played out over the past couple of days. And we've learned that Corcoran is expected to appear before the grand jury actually tomorrow. And this is all really potentially key to the special counsel's classified documents probe. Because I'll take you back, Corcoran is the attorney who drafted a statement in June. He said that Trump's team had done a diligent search of Mar-a-Lago, that there were no remaining classified material there, but in fact, weeks later, the FBI searched Mar-a-Lago, found hundreds of government records, including some of that classified material. And then in the wake of that in January, Corcoran was called before the grand jury. He was asked about what happened in the lead up to that FBI search, but he declined to answer some of the questioning because he did cite that attorney-client privilege. So, then DOJ challenged that. They said that Corcoran's discussions with the former president really could have been part of an attempt to plan a crime. And because of that, Corcoran should be compelled to testify. So, Kaitlan, that's exactly what is happening here. Evan Corcoran lost at the district court level. Now, he lost at the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals and now scheduled to testify before the grand jury tomorrow.",

And key here, Kaitlan, you know, whether there was any obstruction by the former president by any of his top aides in getting those documents back into the government's hands.

Now, there is no universal consensus among lawmakers about what exactly this threat is. On one hand, some lawmakers are saying that TikTok is like digital opium, or like fentanyl that's addicting our children, and then we have other lawmakers that are saying that the Chinese government is using TikTok as a spy vessel, as a propaganda tool.Now, we don't have any actual evidence yet that the Chinese government has done so.

A lot of the concerns about TikTok or that the Chinese government, because of Chinese surveillance laws, can broadly access personal information that's either stored or transferred within borders. Now, if the United States either bans TikTok or forces TikTok the sell to a U.S. company, this isn't going to affect just TikTok. This could potentially affect any Chinese or even any non-U.S. company that wishes to operate in the United States. I mean, in 2023, every company operates a website. Every company collects data. So, every company is a tech company. But it could also affect U.S. companies as well that wish to operate abroad.There are a lot of countries that have concerns about the lack of data privacy laws in the United States. There are a lot of countries that have concerns about U.S. government surveillance, too. So, if the United States takes this very unprecedented move to either ban TikTok or force it to divest, this could have longer term ramifications for the global economy.",

The Federal Reserve making clear yesterday it is not letting up its fight on inflation yet despite concerns another interest rate hike could stress the banking system even more. Yesterday marked the ninth straight increase of interest rates, this time by a quarter percentage point. Fed officials noted the recent banking turmoil likely will actually help in its fight on inflation, leading to tighter financial conditions, hopefully helping their mission of slowing down the economy.I know it seems antithetical, but that's why we have Jason Furman here, Harvard professor and top former Obama economic adviser to explain. Jason, good morning. This is what you thought would happen, 25 basis points.
