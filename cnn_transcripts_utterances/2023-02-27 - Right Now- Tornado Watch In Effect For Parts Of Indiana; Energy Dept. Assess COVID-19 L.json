And the sustained winds through much of this storm as it came through here, 70 to 80 miles per hour. That is just a terrifying storm system that blew through here.

But their reaction a few hours ago from the foreign ministry is one of the -- we've really quite frankly seen many times before, and that is they're telling the U.S. to stop smearing China and to stop politicizing the issue. Also, worth noting, in that response from the foreign ministry today, they point out that the WHO conclusion after their field visit in 2021. And they say that the WHO field team determined that it was highly unlikely that a lab leak was the origin of COVID-19. That is true, the WHO field team did say that in their conclusion to that field visit. The issue is, Bianna and Victor, the WHO also went on to ask for a second follow-up field visit and the Chinese said no, that's not going to happen. They did not let that team back into Wuhan, China. And we're hearing from some of those scientists who are part of that and they told me early on, that they had asked for data from some of the Chinese officials who are on the ground, and that data was never handed over to them.",

Not a single intelligence community, a member nor the WHO believes that it is purposeful bioterrorism. I want to make that clear because it is -- this report is being manipulated to suggest that China was purposeful.All the lab leak theory is also an accidental theory, no matter who you ask, it is that someone got infected in the lab, and then it starts to spread. So, between the lab leak and natural causes, the second point is, we won't know because China, of course, views this as a threat to whatever narrative they -- were the narrative that they want to put out. So, we don't have full transparency. And so, the question now is, what do we do with this? Why does this matter? Well, it matters, obviously, because you're going to want labs to be safer and to know what had happened. Does it change -- does it change a narrative about how each individual country responded? Probably not. And the reason why we want to be careful about how we interpret this is because we're reporting China's reaction does matter. I mean, you know, if this was a lab leak, it's very different to them than if this was in say, a market or natural causes. So -- but I'm -- maybe I've been in this role too long. I'm comfortable in the space of we don't know yet, but a totality of the intelligence community believes more likely that it was natural causes. And all of the intelligence community believes that it was not bioterrorism.",

And to Juliette's point, the idea that this was manufactured unintentional that this lab leak then is the source of COVID-19 and that this is what the origin theories rooted in, you can put that aside, and you can say perhaps it is accidental. And then the amplification point where it was really that initial outbreak was that market.But when you look at the labs, I think this is really important, you have to look at the circumstantial evidence of where they're located. One of them is about a 30-minute drive to the Wuhan Institute of virology from that first amplification point, the market, the other just two blocks away. And the other thing that is undeniable that all of this is the early handling or mishandling from the Chinese government. I mean, we covered these extensively, there was the silencing of whistleblowers, one of them being a doctor who we spoke with a few days before he ultimately died from COVID-19. And he was simply trying to warn friends and family that this was a strange mystery illness going around. That got screenshotted and went very public and got him in a lot of trouble with local police. So, there was certainly from the local government in Wuhan, an effort to stop the rumors as they put it from being spread and to keep this quiet. And that is ultimately what folks are looking at here as the real culpability factor. Even beyond how this started is how it was mishandled and the cover-up that followed.",

And so, their failure to act, we call it the squandered time, right, that January, possibly December, the dates are still up in the air of 2019 or January 2020 when they start to notice a respiratory disease that is spread very quickly and it's killing, they are not transparent about that.[14:15:12] There's no -- There's no politics about this. They call in the WHO. They allege, in early January of 2020 that they're concerned about this new outbreak, but it's not causing any deaths. That's just -- that can't possibly be true, right? China was sufficiently concerned that they begin to notify by early January. People like me who read this stuff are starting to get concerned.

It's been approved by the FDA for more than 20 years right now. It is being challenged. But right now, medication abortion makes up the majority of abortions nationwide. So, if the challengers to this drug win as is expected here, it would mean that women in states where abortion has virtually been halted because of the Supreme Court decision, they wouldn't have this drug as another option to them. And even in states where abortion is still legal, it would mean that women would not have this medication abortion option. And that could really create some major backlogs at abortion clinics. So, this really is the biggest court case and decision since the Supreme Court overturn Roe v. Wade in June. It is being closely watched because it really would, again, upend abortion access in this country if the use of this pill, guys, is blocked, which is something that is expected and a ruling really could come at any time.

It is now at the Supreme Court with the arguments tomorrow.So, they're -- the challengers to this program, it includes several Republican-led states, it also includes student borrowers who say that they don't qualify that further relief, they're saying that the Department of Education really overstepped its authority in agreeing to cancel some of the student loan debt and that Congress is the only body who can do this. The government is responding here saying that first, the party is suing including the states, they don't even have the authority to sue so this lawsuit shouldn't be moving forward.
