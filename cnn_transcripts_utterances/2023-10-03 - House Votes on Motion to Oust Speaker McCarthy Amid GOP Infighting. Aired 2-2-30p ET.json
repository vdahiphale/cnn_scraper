      "sentences": "This hour, we continue CNN's special live coverage of an historic vote on Capitol Hill. Any moment, the House of Representatives will hold a key vote on a motion to oust Kevin McCarthy as Speaker, a motion being brought by one of his fellow Republicans. At the beginning of the day, we knew that there were five Republicans who would vote to oust him. And now, we know that there are six. And we are learning that McCarthy's Republican allies are attempting to make a last-minute plea to the 212 House Democrats there, to try to join them to save him. But House Democrats appear to be united in not wanting to rescue McCarthy. Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries just sent what is known as a dear colleague letter to his fellow Democrats, saying it's the responsibility of the GOP to end their own House Republican civil war.Let's go right to Capitol Hill now, where we find CNN's Manu Raju and CNN's Melanie Zanona. Manu, to you first, what are you hearing from Republicans as this vote gets closer and closer?",

      "sentences": "Well, they're coming to grips with the reality here that Kevin McCarthy simply does not have the votes to survive these afternoon measures. The first vote will happen in just a matter of minutes to try to block Matt Gaetz's effort from going forward. The Matt Gaetz's resolution would actually kick McCarthy out from the speaker chair. There is a procedural vote that will try to block that  resolution. That's going to fail. That means McCarthy will lose that first vote because of bipartisan support to actually allow it to move ahead. Then the vote, which we expect later today on that historic vote, to actually eject McCarthy from the speakership. That is expected later this afternoon.And at the same time, McCarthy does not have the votes for that as well. Then it is major uncertainty about what's next, because the House is essentially paralyzed until they can elect a new speaker. If McCarthy puts himself up as a candidate for speaker, he almost certainly would not have the 218 votes needed to be elected speaker. And other candidates could come up as well, and they wouldn't have 218 votes to be elected speaker. So what will happen then? That is the question that everyone has on their minds, and the question for the speaker. How long is he willing to go to fight this out? Because the congressman who is initiating this effort, Congressman Matt Gaetz, has made crystal clear he plans to force this vote over and over and over again until McCarthy is ultimately forced out in what would be a historic first. Never before in this nation's history has a speaker been kicked out of the speakership through a vote on the House floor. But that's exactly what we can see later today as we head into a period of deep uncertainty and chaos among the House GOP as they grapple with a leadership crisis in their conference. Speaker of the House Joseph Cannon faced a motion to vacate in 1910, but he overwhelmingly survived. It does not appear that Speaker McCarthy is a Speaker Cannon. Melanie, Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, the Democrat from New York, he says Democrats are not going to rescue McCarthy. Are Democrats totally united in that? All 212 are going to vote the same way?",

First of all, one of the things that we need to ask ourselves is, if this happens, if McCarthy is removed from the speakership, immediately there is a question about who is next in the line of succession.It goes president, vice president, then Speaker of the House. David, you have some insights on this because, per the House practice, a guide to the rules, precedents, and procedures of the House, chapter 34, the speaker is required to submit a confidential list of the clerk of people in the order in which each shall act as speaker pro tempore in the case of a vacancy. In other words, when McCarthy became Speaker of the House, he gave the clerk a list of people. If I'm ever not the Speaker of the House, these are the people who will take my place.",

Would he participate in the next Speaker's race? And he said, we'll see. He didn't directly answer the question. Obviously, allies of McCarthy feel like if they give in to Gaetz and if they allow another candidate to run for Speaker and then get the consensus of the conference, that they are only empowering the hardliners. That the lesson then for people like Matt Gaetz and his friends becomes, if you don't like one thing a Speaker does to govern, then you can try and get rid of them. That is not a message that people like Johnson or Bice want to be sending to their colleagues. Jake.",

Is it for personal and grand and grandizement? Is it just to get a good airtime for a  governor's race in Florida in two years? You know, nothing's changed when you handicap the speaker at the beginning of the year by doing this. I think he's done a very, very good job considering the circumstances. Is it perfect? No, but no one in this situation is going to be perfect. But this is personal. Gaetz has his own personal agenda against people and also just promoting himself.
