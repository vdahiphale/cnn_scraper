First, some of the other news headlines for you. We begin with a change of plans for Russian president Vladimir Putin. His last-minute trip to the Pskov region in Western Russia has been canceled due to what Kremlin calls flight conditions. Now it's worth noting that region is close to the border with Latvia and Estonia. In Ukraine, Moscow appears to be intensifying its attacks on Kherson, including shelling a hospital after Russian troops were forced out of the southern city last month. At the same time, Kremlin critic, Alexei Navalny says that he is being injected with an unknown drug while being held in a high security prison in Russia. Looming over all of this, the U.N. has reported a death toll of nearly 7,000 civilians across Ukraine since the invasion began. With so much to cover, let's get you to CNN's Clare Sebastian who is with us tonight from London. Let's start with what's going on in the ground in Kherson. The shelling of this maternity hospital ward. What do we know?",

They've gone from months of Russian occupation into this relentless bombardment. We saw at least 10 people killed on Christmas Eve in a massive mortar attack on the center of the city. It continues, so not surprisingly, civilians are trying to get out. The Ukrainian government says it's helping them, it's providing trains, taking them out of the city, around 300 a day, according to the deputy prime minister. Some of those struggling with the idea of leaving, as is often the case with local officials. Some people need a bit of convincing. But they're worried that wherever they go in Ukraine, they might be hit by shelling. But clearly, all of this reveals that what Sergey Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, said earlier this week, reiterated today by the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, that Russia will not countenance any kind of compromise when it comes to these illegally annexed regions, which Kherson is one of them. Even though this shows they don't actually occupy all of those regions. They will not consider anything other than full control of that. If not, as they've said, the military will take matters into their own hands. This violence is a clear sign of that.",

That island now requiring all travelers arriving from Mainland China to take a COVID PCR test. Japan and India announcing similar policies earlier this week. The change in China's restrictions also means that some Chinese citizens will finally be able to return home after years away due to the pandemic. CNN's Selina Wang has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SELINA WANG, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The world's harshest quarantine is no more. As COVID sweeps through China, the country is scrapping quarantine for inbound travelers from January 8 and promising to gradually restore outbound tourism. Since the start of the pandemic, China has severely limited who can go in and out of the country, drastically cutting the number of flights and cutting arrivals into government facilities. I went through multiple quarantines in China this year, lasting as long as 21 days. There is no choice where you go or what room you get. Once the doors close, you can only open them for COVID tests and food pickups. Workers sprayed disinfectant in the hallways every few hours. Food delivery is not allowed. But breakfast, lunch and dinner are part of quarantine fees. All of that is soon going away. It a huge relief for Chinese nationals living overseas, like this woman in New York City.",

He's been treating, saying medical information is withheld from him. CNN's Fred Pleitgen has been covering the Kremlin's invasion since even before it again and not just from Ukraine.

You could hear them, obviously, in our live shot as well. There's more rockets that's being fired right now. If we look in the sky, we can see it there. If we pan up, there's another Salvo being fired right now. So you can see in this area the Russians firing artillery rockets towards Ukraine. At the same time, we've also seen them move in heavy, heavy armor through the road that I just pointed to before. We saw Howitzers going down that road just a couple of minutes ago. That was where you could really see that the war had started in full force. We have to keep in mind that this is really the time that full on war has come back to Europe, which is quite a scary thing but again, also, of course, a very important thing to document as well. PLEITGEN (voice-over):  As Russian forces retreat from the area north of Kyiv in their wake, scenes of utter destruction, whole blocks of houses flattened. Ukrainian authorities saying they believe dead bodies are still lying underneath. But here, the dead also lay in the open. Ukrainian national police showed us this mass grave in Bucha, saying they believed up to 150 civilians might be buried here but no one knows the exact number. People killed while the Russian army occupied this town.",

And so we were driving around the area, there was no cell phone connection, so we couldn't really communicate with our guys at headquarters. And then we got back into the cell phone connection area and I got an email that said, there are reports of a mass grave in Bucha. And I wrote facts. We just came back from that mass grave and, with that, it just became this gigantic international story. And then the next couple of days, we went back to Bucha pretty much every day and into the surrounding areas as well. And it was really much worse than almost anything I've ever seen. Everywhere went, there were dead bodies. There's not many things, I think, in the world that have truly moved me and shaken me. I do remember that a couple of weeks later, after I got back home and I was talking about what had happened in Bucha, it was something that definitely I did feel very emotional at that point, just remembering the things that we saw and the things that we witnessed. It was definitely devastating to have witnessed all that but at the same time, of course, very important to shine the light on it and to document all of that for the wider public. And another thing that really stood out in the reporting was also the way that the Russians dealt with their own troops. We also got the chance to go to Chernobyl. We were the first team to go to Chernobyl. PLEITGEN (voice-over):  The Russians imprisoned the security staff inside the plant's own bomb shelter.

The Trump era policy put in effect during the early days of the pandemic allows border agents to expel migrants to their home countries in the name of COVID prevention. The Supreme Court blocked a lower court's opinion, ordering and end to Title 42, keeping it in place while legal challenges now play out. Within El Paso and Texas, officials have been preparing for a surge of migrants. CNN's Leyla Santiago joins us from El Paso, where thousands are waiting in limbo. That city must be preparing or certainly has been preparing for a surge of migrants. Now this border program to expel migrants remains in place. What is the impact there?

They said this means there's a lot of uncertainty for a future, given that Title 42 remains in place. I just want to show you where I am, kind of walking you through it. There is a long line of folks that are coming in to get breakfast this morning because they have been out on the street for quite some time. They really don't have anything. And when I say they've been out here, we are talking about older men, younger men, children. You will see toddlers and babies wrapped up in Red Cross blankets with really not much else. And when you talk to them about Title 42, many of them are very aware of that number, that number 42. To them, that has been quite a barrier. And they are seeking clarity on exactly what this will mean moving forward for many of the families that are just looking to flee violence and economic crisis in Venezuela, as well as have a better future for these children. Now let's talk about the city of El Paso. The mayor has said that, in recent days, they've had about 2,500 migrants coming each day. And even though this policy remains in place, they are preparing for a surge in migrants because on the other side of the border, there are more than 20,000 migrants between Matamoros, Juarez, as well as in Reynosa, waiting to come in, waiting to have their chance. Many of these migrants will also tell you that they tried to come in legally. But because of Title 42, they have too many challenges. So they just found another way. But for El Paso now, they are actually even looking at taking two vacant schools to turn them into a shelter in preparation for what is to come. I had a conversation with one mother. She's a mother from Venezuela, traveling with two children, including a toddler, fleeing the poverty and violence of Venezuela. I was the one who told her about the Supreme Court decision here.
